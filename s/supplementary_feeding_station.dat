40|$|Supplementary feeding stations, or "vulture restaurants", {{are common}} {{conservation}} management tools. While {{a number of}} studies have investigated the consequences of surplus food on the population dynamics of scavengers, relatively little is known about the effects of such practices at the individual level. Within the long-term monitored breeding population of Canarian Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) we investigated individual bird’s patterns of use of a <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> at Fuerteventura (Canary Islands), over the course of breeding (2001, 2002; 2004 - 2011) and non-breeding seasons (2000 - 2010). Our results show that during the breeding season the individual use of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> was inversely related to the distance to the breeding territory, which suggests the existence of central-place foraging constraints. In addition, larger birds of poor body-condition and individuals that ultimately failed to fledge young were detected more frequently at the feeding station. During the non-breeding season, and because most breeding birds abandoned the breeding territories, the overall abundance of Egyptian vultures at the feeding station grew. Moreover, the only variable increasing the probability of presence of individuals was poor body condition so that birds with lower wing residual visited the feeding station more frequently. Supplementary feeding may benefit individuals who would otherwise have been subject to selective pressures. From our results it follows that this conservation strategy must be used with caution because it can have consequences on an individual level and thus potentially affect the viability of endangered populations...|$|E

In community ecology, chance is recognized as a key factor in community assemblage, but less is known about its role in intraguild processes leading to species coexistence. Here we study the relevance of resource unpredictability per se as a promoter of intraguild positive interspecific interactions and as a biodiversity enhancer in an Old World avian scavenger guild, which has evolved to feed upon spatially and temporally unpredictable resources, i. e., carcasses. We performed a large-scale field experiment in which 58 carcasses were disposed of and observed until complete consumption, either in continuously active <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> (predictable carcasses) or disposed of at random in the field (unpredictable carcasses). Richness of scavenger species was similar at unpredictable and predictable carcasses, but their relative abundances were highly uneven at predictable carcasses leading to higher scavenger diversity (Shannon index) at unpredictable carcasses. Facilitatory interspecific processes only occurred at unpredictable resources but were disrupted in predictable conditions because the dominant specialist species (in our case, the Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus) arrived earlier and in larger numbers, monopolizing the resource. Small, endangered scavengers congregated at <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> but profited less compared to unpredictable carcasses, suggesting that they could constitute an ecological trap. Our findings offer new insights into the relevance of unpredictability of trophic resources in promoting both positive facilitatory interspecific interactions and species diversity and thus maintaining the function of guilds. Finally, the preservation of randomness in resource availability and the processes associated with its exploitation should be a major goal of conservation strategies aimed to preserve scavenger guilds evolved under naturally unpredictable trophic resources.

The main aim of this thesis is to quantify the effect of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> on the spatiotemporal distribution of moose (Alces alces L. 1758) living in southern Norway. I used locations of free-ranging GPS (global positioning system) collared moose (N = 26 in summer and N = 32 in winter) with access to <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> to estimate habitat selection and home range size as a function of feeding status (i. e. <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> users vs. non-users), variation in browse quantity and quality, and also in terms of local climate and individual characteristics.

However, <b>feeding</b> <b>station</b> users did not differ in their large-scale habitat selection patterns or home range size compared to non-users. Instead, moose habitat selection was driven by a scale-dependent trade-off between browse quantity (landscape-scale) and browse quality (within-home rangescale). Moreover, depletion of high quality browse during winter lead moose to increase selection for lower quality browse within their home range. Variation in home range size was affected by several extrinsic (i. e. climate and natural browse) and intrinsic variables (i. e. individual characteristics) and their effects varied between and within spatiotemporal scales. After 6 years of feeding, moose that used <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> selected for commercially valuable browse (i. e.

In addition, as the time scale of feeding increased from 5 - 10 to 15 - 20 years, browsing pressure on commercially valuable browse (i. e.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{consequences of}} spatio-temporal distribution and abundance of trophic resources have received significant attention in ecology {{due to their}} predicted effects at the individual, population and community levels. Pulses are defined as occasional episodes of food abundance concentrated in space and time. Although these phenomena are common in many ecosystems {{we still have a}} limited understanding about their effects on the dynamics and functioning of guilds and vertebrate communities. To explore these issues we carried out research using carcasses and scavenger guilds as a study model. Carcasses are a paradigmatic pulsed resource that under natural conditions appears unpredictable. They are exploited by guilds of organisms ranging from bacteria to vultures and large carnivores. However, human activities (including certain conservation strategies) change the unpredictable conditions with foreseeable consequences in the structure and functioning of scavenger guilds. In this scenario, the main aims of this thesis were: 1) to explore the role of unpredictability (randomness) as a driver of both the diversity and the existence of facilitatory processes within an avian scavenger guild and 2) to detect the ecological consequences that occur when trophic resources become predictable, both for scavengers and for non-scavenger species. We explored the second goal using <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> (vulture restaurants) as our study model. Thus our results are not only of ecological significance, but can also be of great utility for the management and conservation of these species. We found that unpredictable (random) distribution of carcasses favours the diversity of scavengers and promotes the existence of intraguild facilitatory processes. Moreover, through a transcontinental approach we found that migrant scavengers change their spatial distribution patterns between the breeding (in Europe) and the wintering areas (in Africa) consistently following the degree of food aggregation. Moreover, we detect higher overlap in interspecific diets in Europe, where resources are scarce, clumped and predictable. The availability of long-lasting carcasses provokes the aggregation of large numbers of facultative scavengers, increasing the risk of predation on other vertebrates that live around these areas. Finally, we examined conservation consequences of the concentration of carcasses at <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> (vulture restaurants) promoted by current European sanitary legislation. We found that clumped and predictable food resources cause the co-occurrence of scavenger species at these points provoking an overlap in their diets, which is otherwise segregated. Moreover, <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> favour the gathering of individuals of the dominant species (the griffon vulture Gyps fulvus), which monopolize food to the detriment of small scavengers of conservation concern. To minimize these negative effects we provide guidelines for an appropriate design and propose that adaptive management is key for the most effective application of this widely used conservation tool. In conclusion, this study shows that changes in the distribution and predictability of food resources have important consequences for the structure and functioning of the scavenger guilds as well as other vertebrate communities not directly related to the exploitation of this resource. Studies such as this thesis, which deal with the issue from different perspectives (including those relating to conservation) are particularly relevant in understanding the phenomenon.

In <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> vultures and other scav- engers can consume carcasses almost immediately after disposal, which implies the potential ingestion of veterinary pharmaceuticals as a non-target consequence of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding.</b> Using UPLC-MS/MS and HPLC-TOF, we evaluated the presence and concentration of fluoroquinolone residues in plasma of nestling vultures feeding on domestic livestock carrion. Three different fluoroquinolones (marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin) and a non-targeted ß-lactam (nafcillin) were detected in vulture plasma. The high proportion of individuals (92 %) with fluoroquinolone residues at variable con- centrations (up to ~ 20 ¿g L¿ 1 of enrofloxacin and ~ 150 ¿g L¿ 1 of marbofloxacin) sampled in several ge- ographically distant colonies and on different dates suggests that these and other drugs were potentially ingested throughout nestling development. Contamination with veterinary fluoroquinolones and other pharmaceuticals {{should be considered as}} an unintended but alarming consequence of food management in threatened wildlife. F.

40|$|As obligate scavengers, {{vultures}} {{are entirely}} dependent on carrion resources. In {{this study we}} model the carrion ecology of an ecosystem in Swaziland which {{is home to the}} densest breeding population of the African White-backed Vulture (Gyps africanus). We collected data on life-history parameters of the avian scavenging guild of the area as well as the potential food available from the ungulate fauna. By using novel Population Dynamics P-Systems we show that carrion provided by wild ungulates biomass is currently enough to sustain this vulture species. However, in light of forecasted population increases, food will become limiting. We discuss the significance of mass closure of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> in Swaziland which now forces these birds to forage farther afield endangering them to poisoning events.

40|$|The wild {{population}} of Pink Pigeons (Columba mayeri) of Mauritius has recovered from ten individuals in 1990 to ~ 390 birds in 2008. Limited availability of native feeding habitat {{is a primary}} factor restricting further increases in population. Current management of the species includes provision of supplementary food (wheat) and restoration of native forest habitat. This study investigated dependence on supplementary food by examining patterns of supplementary food use and social interactions in two Pink Pigeon subpopulations. During 72 h of observations over a 10 -week study period 99 % of the birds visited <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> and the combined duration of these visits per individual was 0 – 1. 7 % of the total observation period.

40|$|Current European {{sanitary}} {{laws are}} promoting {{the concentration of}} domestic livestock carcasses in lim- ited locations called ‘vulture restaurants’ or <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> in order to safeguard human health. However, this type of food concentration could lead to monopolization by a few, large dominant species. Management guidelines are urgently needed to ensure that potentially less competitive and more endangered scavengers can also beneﬁt from this resource, considering that once abundant car- casses are now absent from the ﬁeld. Here, we assess factors affecting the abundance of six avian scav- enger species at 17 <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> in northern Spain, considering aspects such as carrion availability, physiographic features, humanization, presence of heterospeciﬁcs and densities of scavengers during both winter and summer seasons. Results indicate that conditions for interspeciﬁc facilitatory processes are possible at low numbers (< 100 individuals) of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus). Otherwise, the other avian scavengers are excluded. In a few cases, spatio-temporal patterns of segregation become apparent. Differences {{in the size of}} carcasses supplied to <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> as well as the local characteristics inﬂu- ence the balance of species at these points and, therefore, how species of conservation concern use feed- ing stations.

40|$|Carcasses {{not only}} recruit carrion-eaters, {{but can also}} attract facultative scaven- gers which could predate on species living in the surroundings. At <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> (‘vulture restaurants’) {{carcasses}} are available permanently, posing a conservation dilemma: enhancing populations of endangered scavengers might introduce a predation pressure on non-target species. Here, we test if nest predation risk on ground-nesting birds increases near carcasses in Fuerteventura Island (Canary Archipelago). This is an optimal scenario for performing this study {{because there is a}} simple community of ground-nesting birds and facultative scavengers; carrion-eaters feed regularly in a unique vulture restaurant but also exploit scattered carcasses of goats. We placed artiﬁcial nests along different lines located at variable distances (200 m to 34 km) from the vulture restaurant or from single carcasses. Sixty-seven per cent of lines and up to 90 % of nests within lines were predated. Predation risk was higher in lines near carcasses, that is single carcasses or the vulture restaurant. Thus, our study alerts that choosing the location for vulture restaurants may be the key not only for scavengers but also for the conservation of the species living nearby. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Urbanisation is an ever-growing {{threat to}} global wildlife. Nevertheless, urban {{areas around the}} world hold {{significant}} wild bird populations and urban birds provide a key connection between people and wildlife. Many people provide supplementary resources, such as food and nesting sites. However, even apparently beneficial actions may have unintended negative consequences. This work explores some of these direct and indirect effects. Grey Squirrels Sciurus carolinensis are a widespread, introduced species in the UK, acting both as a competitor for resources with birds and predator of their nests. When present, Grey Squirrels effectively excluded birds from <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> Allowing them unrestricted access both supports their energy requirements and reduces its availability to target taxa, through both behavioural exclusion and food consumption. In addition, nest predation was higher in artificial nests adjacent to filled bird feeders which were frequented by potential nest predators and the exclusion of these predators did not significantly reduce nest predation. Providing point attractants during the breeding season may therefore depress local urban bird breeding success in addition to directly supporting predator/competitor populations. Garden <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> may also represent a threat to wild bird and human health through pathogen transmission. Bacterial communities were found to differ between two bird feeder types {{but there was little}} association between feeder usage by animals and bacterial load or pathogen presence in a typical UK suburban garden bird-feeding setting. Nest boxes are commonly provided for cavity nesting urban birds as an additional supplementary resource. Nest box using Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major differed in their use of anthropogenic material. Anthropogenic nest material was associated with lower arthropod diversity and ectoparasite predator abundance but higher ectoparasite loads. Higher arthropod diversity was linked to lower flea numbers, implying more complex arthropod communities depressed ectoparasite abundance though no direct link was found between these factors with breeding success. Domestic cats Felis catus are the most abundant predator in many urban ecosystems. Cat home ranges varied with level of urbanisation and they ranged significantly further during the night. To reduce the probability of Domestic Cats entering local protected areas a management zone of 300 - 400 m from the nearest housing was estimated to be of management value and must be adjusted to the local landscape to ensure effectiveness. Despite the various negative effects highlighted in this thesis, the findings suggest that many of them can be mitigated, to ensure that our best intentions do effectively benefit urban birds...|$|R

Forty-one observations of sap feeding were made of 21 individually-identified birds.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{sanitary}} policies within the European Union (EU) concerning disposal of carcasses of domestic {{animals and the}} increase of non-natural mortality factors, such as illegal poisoning, are threatening European vultures. However, the effects of anthropogenic activities on demographic parameters are poorly studied. Using a long-term study (1994 - 2011) of the threatened Pyrenean Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus population, we assess the variation {{in the proportion of}} breeding pairs, egg-laying dates, clutch size, breeding success, and survival following a sharp reduction in food availability in 2005 due to the application of restrictive sanitary policies decreasing livestock carcass availability. We found a delay in laying dates and a regressive trend in clutch size, breeding success, and survival following policy change. The maintenance of specific <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> for Bearded Vultures probably reduced the negative effects of illegal poisoning and food shortages, which mainly affected subadult survival. A drop in food availability may have produced changes in demographic parameters and an increase in mortality due to an increased exposure to contaminated food. As a result, <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> as a precautionary measure can be a useful tool to reduce illegal poisoning and declines in demographic parameters until previous food availability scenarios are achieved. This study shows how anthropogenic activities through human health regulations that affect habitat quality can suddenly modify demographic parameters in long-lived species, including those, such as survival, with high sensitivity to population growth rate. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

40|$|Evidence for decline or {{threat of}} wild populations {{typically}} comes from multiple {{sources and methods}} that allow optimal integration of the available information, representing a major advance in planning management actions. We used integrated population modelling and perturbation analyses to assess the demographic consequences of the illegal use of poison for an insular population of Red Kites, Milvus milvus. We first pooled into a single statistical framework the annual census of breeding pairs, the available individual-based data, the average productivity {{and the number of}} birds admitted annually to the local rehabilitation centre. By combining these four types of information we were able to increase estimate precision and to obtain an estimate of the proportion of breeding adults, an important parameter that was not directly measured in the field and that is often difficult to assess. Subsequently, we used perturbation analyses to measure the expected change in the population growth rate due to a change in poison-related mortality. We found that poison accounted for 0. 43 to 0. 76 of the total mortality, for yearlings and older birds, respectively. Results from the deterministic population model indicated that this mortality suppressed the population growth rate by 20 %. Despite this, the population was estimated to increase, albeit slowly. This positive trend was likely maintained by a very high productivity (1. 83 fledglings per breeding pair) possibly promoted by <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding,</b> a situation which is likely to be common to many large obligate or facultative European scavengers.

40|$|Wildlife {{exposure}} to pharmaceuticals can occur through contaminated water, {{and through the}} excreta and carcasses of medicated livestock, with potential for bioaccumulation and transfer through food webs. We evaluated whether nestling {{exposure to}} pharmaceuticals can occur from food delivered to nests in the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), a top predator and facultative scavenger. Despite the fact that diet analysis suggests an apparently low dependence on livestock carcasses reduced to two piglets remains (1. 5 % of food remains, n =  134), {{a high proportion of}} nestlings (71 %, n =  7) showed fluoroquinolone residues in plasma, mostly enrofloxacin, which is exclusively used in veterinary treatments. The occurrence and concentration (54. 5  ±  6. 6  μg·L) of fluoroquinolones in plasma was similar to those found in the nestlings of three vulture species largely dependent on livestock carcasses obtained at <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> which are managed for the conservation of their populations. Although the number of analysed eaglets is comparatively small, the fact that enrofloxacin was found in all nests sampled in three breeding seasons suggest an exposure to the drugs similar to that of vultures. An underestimation of the role of carrion, especially from small piglets whose consumption may have gone unnoticed, and the predation of semi-domestic prey and generalist prey exploiting carcasses of medicated livestock, can contribute to explaining the unexpectedly high occurrence of these drugs in eaglets.

40|$|International audienceIn {{a context}} of {{increasing}} concern for biodiversity conservation but decreasing resources devoted to species management, measuring the impact of actions is critically needed so as to optimise conservation practices. Long-term longitudinal data collected on marked individuals allow for {{an assessment of the}} demographic response of a population to conservation actions while accounting for potential confounding factors. This study focused on the recovery of a geographically-isolated population of the endangered Egyptian vulture in south-eastern France, which experienced food shortages induced by major changes in habitat and sanitary legislation limiting the abandonment of dead animals in the field. The survival rates and population dynamics of the Egyptian vulture were computed, following the implementation of <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> while accounting for the potential variation in environmental conditions on wintering grounds, reproduction and immigration. An integrated population model (IPM) was used to combine capture-resighting data with recoveries of dead birds, breeding surveys and counts of territorial pairs over a 16 -year period. Results showed that the implementation of vulture restaurants improved the local survival rates and successfully stabilised the local demography of Egyptian vultures; this despite a reduction in average fecundity due to compensatory density feedback. Moreover, throughout the study period, about two thirds of the new recruits into the breeding population were immigrants, suggesting immigration constantly sustained the Egyptian vulture population in south-eastern France. However, we did not detect any effect of vulture restaurants on the immigration rate, indicating that the improvement of local survival by vulture restaurants remained the main driver of the positive shift in the population dynamics. This study highlights the positive impact of vulture restaurants on Egyptian vulture population restoration by compensating for natural food limitations. It also points out the methodological importance of estimating immigration for understanding population dynamics and that large-scale monitoring and internationally-concerted conservation should be promoted.

40|$|Between 2004 and 2013, 486 {{suspected}} scavenger poisoning cases, including 24 bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), {{were investigated}} in the Pyrenees and surrounding areas in Spain {{as part of}} a monitoring programme regarding accidental and intentional poisoning of wildlife. Poisoning was confirmed in 36 % of all analysed cases where scavenger species were found dead within the distribution range of bearded vultures. Organophosphates and carbamates were the most frequently detected poisons. Four of the bearded vulture cases were positive for the presence of topical antiparasitics (3 with diazinon and 1 with permethrin). These likely represented accidental exposure due to the legal use of these veterinary pharmaceuticals. In order to confirm the risk of exposure to topical antiparasitics in bearded vultures, pig feet (n = 24) and lamb feet (n = 24) were analysed as these are one of the main food resources provided to bearded vultures at <b>supplementary</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> Pig feet had no detectable residues of topical antiparasitics. In contrast, 71. 4 % of lamb feet showed residues of antiparasitics including diazinon (64. 3 %), pirimiphos-methyl (25. 4 %), chlorpyrifos (7. 1 %), fenthion (1. 6 %), permethrin (0. 8 %) and cypermethrin (27. 8 %). Washing the feet with water significantly reduced levels of these topical antiparasitics, as such, this should be a recommended practice for lamb feet supplied at <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> for bearded vultures. Although the detected levels of antiparasitics were relatively low (≤ 1 μg/g), a risk assessment suggests that observed diazinon levels may affect brain acetylcholinesterase and thermoregulation in bearded vultures subject to chronic exposure.
