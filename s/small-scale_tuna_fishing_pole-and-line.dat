Previous studies mostly concentrated in Java, while in {{eastern part of}} Indonesia the information still scarce and limited. The study was conducted from January to December 2013, describes in detail the gears, fleets and catch dynamics of the <b>small-scale</b> <b>tuna</b> fisheries operating based in Labuhan Lombok Coastal Fishing Port (PPP. Labuhan Lombok). <b>Small-scale</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery in Labuhan Lombok are characterized by the small boats less than 10 GT, operating both troll line and hand line simultaneously, targeting large tuna, skipjack tuna and small <b>tuna.</b> <b>Fishing</b> season starts from April to August and influence by southwest monsoon wind {{and the presence of}} middleman as the connector between fishers and the market are the main character of the small-scale fisheries business in this area...|$|R

This research was conducted experimentally using Completely Randomized Design (CRD) and Least Significant Difference (LSD).  The treatments were P 1 (head of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple steak); P 2 (head of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple peel); P 3 (head of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple middle); P 4 (digestive tracts of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple steak); P 5 (digestive tracts of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple peel); P 6 (digestive tracts of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple middle). These treatments were replicated three times.   The results showed that true protein content of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> waste was affected by bromelyn treatments.   The average of true protein content was 12. 06; 14. 80; 19. 74; 17. 32; 17. 34; and 16. 61 mg/g, for P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4, P 5, and P 6 respectively.   The results showed true protein was highly significant (P< 0. 01).  The true protein content of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> waste head added with bromelyn from pineapple middle was highest compare to the other treatments.  Amino acids were twelve the all treatments tested.
