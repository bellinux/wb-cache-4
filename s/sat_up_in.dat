25|$|Before {{he could}} be ordained a priest, Gabriel died in the retreat at Isola del Gran Sasso {{the early hours of}} February 27, 1862, in the {{presence}} of the community, holding close an image of Our Lady of Sorrows and smiling peacefully. Those who were with Gabriel when he died reported that at the moment of death, he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed and his face became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary at the very moment of his death.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} match on the undercard was the Undertaker versus Reigns. The match was made after Reigns {{interfered}} in the Undertaker's match during the Number One Contenders tournament. This interference cost the Undertaker his match, and his opportunity to {{challenge for the}} WWE Championship at WrestleMania. The following week, Reigns cut a promo on the Undertaker, and claimed that he wasn't scared of him. On February 17, the Undertaker faced Reigns' tag team partner, Jindrak, immediately after Reigns had defeated Nunzio and cut another promo on the Undertaker. The Undertaker pinned Jindrak after a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver. Reigns then hit the Undertaker with a television camera. The Undertaker, however, quickly recovered, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the ring, and then stalked Reigns to the backstage area.|$|E
500|$|... "Suddenly she <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> her bed {{and looked}} {{from one to the}} other of us with wide, frightened eyes," [...] wrote Eagar. [...] "She cried out suddenly, 'I'm dying! I'm dying!' She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E
60|$|He spoke {{so loudly}} that {{all in the}} room heard him; the younger squires who were {{dressing}} stared in blank amazement, and Blunt <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> suddenly <b>in</b> his cot.|$|R
60|$|Brigida's eyes {{began to}} lose their {{indolent}} expression. She <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> suddenly <b>in</b> her chair, and set {{one of her hands}} heavily on a little table by her side.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dove {{shook his}} head, {{but his wife}} <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>in</b> bed, and plucked him by the sleeve, for she had been listening intently to everything that passed.|$|R
500|$|On 28 July 1937, at {{the evening}} performance, Davidson gave his usual speech before {{entering}} the cage in which two lions, Freddie and Toto, were sitting quietly. Then, according to Blythe: [...] "in scarcely credible terms, the little clergyman from Norfolk and the lion acted out the classical Christian martyrdom to the full". Eyewitnesses later reported that after Davidson had cracked his whip and shouted, Freddie became agitated and knocked Davidson over, before seizing him by the neck and running with him around the cage. Somner struggled to pacify the snarling Freddie, who eventually dropped the unconscious Davidson, enabling her to drag him to safety; he was badly gashed, and had suffered a broken bone in his neck. [...] An uncorroborated story circulated that {{while waiting for the}} ambulance, Davidson asked that the London newspapers be alerted in time for next day's first editions. According to some press reports he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> hospital and asked visitors for their impressions of his ordeal in the cage. Most historians of the affair, however, believe that Davidson never recovered consciousness. He died on 30 July, his death possibly hastened by an insulin injection administered by a doctor who believed that Davidson was a diabetic. The coroner's verdict was death by misadventure.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Beveridge married Jessy Janet, {{daughter}} of William Philip and widow of David Mair, in 1942. He died {{at his home}} on 16 March 1963, aged 84, and was buried in Thockrington churchyard, on the Northumbrian moors. His barony became extinct upon his death. His last words, as he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed whilst still working on his 'History of Prices', were [...] "I have a thousand things to do".|$|E
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{the chair}} {{and looked at him}} with quivering lips.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned again}} to his maps. Bert <b>sat</b> {{crumpled}} <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the corner, apparently heedless of him. For some time both kept silence.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{straight}} <b>in</b> his chair, and {{put down}} his cigar. [...] "I will begin," [...] he said, [...] "by stating that I am the Vizier of the Two-horned Alexander." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Panney {{turned toward}} Mrs. Tolbridge, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very {{straight}} <b>in</b> her chair, and glared.|$|R
60|$|Joe (his Christian {{name was}} Joe) <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed, and looked around.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman was}} silent, but not convinced. Presently she <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed.|$|E
60|$|His wife <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed listening. A loud knock resounded {{through the}} house.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{had been}} asleep {{about two hours}} when he awoke with a start. He <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and <b>in</b> {{the dim light of}} the room saw his brother {{thrashing}} wildly in the bed.|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} midnight, {{and all were}} in bed but ourselves, who <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> one <b>in</b> each chimney-corner; she, needles in hand, indefatigably {{knitting}} a sock; I, pipe in mouth, indolently weaving my vapors.|$|R
60|$|Part of {{the time}} it rained, and then she <b>sat</b> huddled <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the shawls and {{tarpaulins}} which the woman placed about her: then, when the sun came out, she still <b>sat</b> huddled <b>up,</b> closing her eyes against the glare.|$|R
60|$|Ngakura <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed {{and began}} to cry. The matting started to shake.|$|E
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the chair. Julien {{had known}} well how to rouse her.|$|E
60|$|Louise {{glanced at}} her watch, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed, and turned reproachfully toward Aline.|$|E
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>in</b> bed {{and turned}} on the light. It was barely two o'clock by my watch, but I felt sure that I had not been mistaken. Some one had knocked at my door.|$|R
60|$|The {{second day}} was {{exactly like the}} first. The rain {{continued}} to pour down, and we <b>sat,</b> wrapped <b>up</b> <b>in</b> our mackintoshes, underneath the canvas, and drifted slowly down.|$|R
6000|$|Alan {{bit his lip}} and Barbara <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> quite {{straight}} <b>in</b> her chair, observing which indications, Mr. Haswell went on hurriedly: ...|$|R
60|$|The dazed girl <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed and listened, {{while her}} heart almost stood still.|$|E
60|$|The man <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{alarm and}} made a {{movement}} as if to draw a pistol.|$|E
60|$|Tess <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed, {{lost in a}} vague {{interspace}} {{between a}} dream and this information.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's silence. The {{recovering}} man's {{consciousness of}} his position and of events was evidently as yet incomplete. He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> suddenly <b>in</b> his chair, gripping the sides of it. His eyes were large with reminiscent trouble.|$|R
6000|$|In the evening, {{putting her}} cheek against her brother's {{shoulder}} {{as she was}} sitting by him, while he <b>sat</b> propped <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed under a new difficulty of breathing, she said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He thrust {{away his}} glass {{once and for}} all, and <b>sat</b> {{straight}} <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the chair {{where he had been}} previously lolling. [...] "What am I to understand?" [...] said he.|$|R
60|$|Alan <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} and stared at Jeekie, while Jeekie nodded his head at him.|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the great bed with his arms about his knees.|$|E
60|$|He {{was soon}} sound asleep, and {{remained}} so until Osgod touched him. He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a moment.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{understand}} this Charles Davis. He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> calmly <b>in</b> his bunk, and calmly lighted his pipe ere he replied to Mr. Mellaire. He {{certainly is not}} insane. Yet deliberately, in cold blood, he has murdered a helpless man.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not answer}} this, {{not knowing what to}} say. The mother <b>sat</b> bunched <b>up</b> <b>in</b> silence, her {{beautiful}} white hands, that had no rings whatsoever, clasping the pommels of her arm-chair.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> stiffly <b>in</b> bed. Seconds passed {{while he}} {{interpreted}} his strange surroundings. He wasn't {{in his own}} home, of course. This {{was out in the}} country. It was colder than it should be and there was green at the window.|$|R
