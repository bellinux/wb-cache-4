A large splitting between the t2g and eg AOs requires a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> for the electrons to overcome the energy gap (Δ) to comply with Hund’s Rule. [...] Therefore, electrons will fill the lower energy t2g orbitals completely before populating the higher energy eg orbitals. Conversely, a HS state occurs with weaker ligand fields and smaller orbital splitting. In this case the energy required to populate the higher levels is substantially less than the pairing energy and the electrons fill the orbitals according to Hund’s Rule by populating the higher energy orbitals before pairing with electrons in the lower lying orbitals. An example of a metal ion that can exist in either a LS or HS state is Fe3+ in an octahedral ligand field. Depending on the ligands that are coordinated to this complex the Fe3+ can attain a LS or a HS state, as in Figure 1.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{it comes}} from a {{hydroelectric}} dam, a big nuclear generator, a coal or gas-fired power plant, or a renewable source, electrical energy follows a similar path through our power distribution infrastructure to meet our needs. You can follow the chain through the main steps from the source to our sockets, to our end use. When we want to turn on the TV or the light switch, a primary source of energy like coal, natural gas, or wind is fed into a device that performs a conversion to high voltage electricity. That electricity is then transmitted along large high-tension wires to a neighborhood substation, where after stepping down the voltage, the electric current travels down smaller wires on the final leg of its journey, either underground or on poles, into your home, typically to a socket in the wall, where it is available for further conversion into the work that you desire. As electricity consumers, we’re almost completely oblivious to that behind-the-scenes process. The power only becomes real when we plug in a blow dryer, vacuum cleaner, light bulb, or television set and convert the electrical energy into useful work. We’re also largely unaware that along the supply chain, there are massive energy losses everywhere. At each stage of conversion or transmission a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> is thrown away, mostly as unused heat.

Enhanced paper is used as the electrode and as the separator which results in a sturdy, flexible battery that have great performance capabilities such as good cycling, great efficiency, and good reversibility. Using paper as a separator is more effective than using plastic. The process of enhancing the paper, however, can be complicated and costly, depending on the materials used. A carbon nanotube and silver nanowire film can be used to coat regular paper to create a simpler and less expensive separator and battery support. The conductive paper {{can also be used to}} replace traditionally used metallic chemicals. The resulting battery performs well, while simplifying the manufacturing process and reducing the cost. Lithium-ion paper batteries are flexible, durable, rechargeable, and produce significantly more power than electrochemical batteries. In spite of these advantages, there are still some drawbacks. In order for paper to be integrated with the Li-ion battery, complex layering and insulating techniques are required for the battery to function as desired. One reason these complex techniques are used is to strengthen the paper used so that it does not tear as easily. This contributes to the overall strength and flexibility of the battery. These techniques require time, training, and costly materials. Additionally, the individual materials required are not environmentally friendly and require specific disposal procedures. Paper {{lithium-ion batteries}} would be best suited for applications requiring a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> over an extended period of time.

Other researchers have been successful using carbon paper manufactured from pyrolyzed filter paper. The paper is inserted in between the electrode and cathode.The use of a carbon paper as an interlayer in Li-S batteries improves the batteries efficiency and capacity. The carbon paper increases the contact area between the cathode and the electrode which allows for greater flow of electrons. The pores in the paper allow the electrons to travel easily while preventing the anode and the cathode from being in contact with one another. This translates into greater output, battery capacity and cycle stability; these are improvements to conventional Li-S batteries. The carbon paper is made from pyrolyzed filter paper which is inexpensive to make and performs like multi-walled carbon nanotube paper used as a battery.|$|E

The origin for Parasite is fairly consistent with his modern one in the comics. This version is able to duplicate the voices of whomever he drains as well. First appearing in the episode [...] "Feeding Time", Rudy Jones is portrayed as a janitor at S.T.A.R. Labs. He and fence Martin Lebeau (voiced by Robert Patrick) stole barrels containing chemicals with unknown properties. But although the two manage to make their getaway in a pickup truck after narrowly escaping the scene, Rudy rides {{in the back of}} the vehicle with the semi-closed barrels. The barrels soon open when the truck encounters an uneven road, spilling their contents all over Rudy and transforming him into the Parasite. Parasite then uses his new powers to go after Lebeau for revenge, almost killing him if not for the timely intervention of Superman. In the ensuring battle, Parasite is able to drain a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> greatly weakening Superman. With the Man of Steel's powers, Parasite goes on a citywide rampage, and later attacks him in his apartment after discovering his secret identity of Clark Kent. Parasite then trapped him inside a boiler room at S.T.A.R. Labs as a [...] "daily recharge" [...] for his crime sprees. While Parasite is away, Jimmy Olsen stumbles across Superman while investigating, and frees him just as the Parasite returns. Superman, having regained some of his strength, slips into his titanium-lead alloy Kryptonite armor and engages the Parasite in a ferocious battle, which ends when Superman forces Parasite to grab a piece of Kryptonite, which drains him of all his Kryptonian powers to the point of unconsciousness and amnesia. Parasite is subsequently incarcerated in a S.T.A.R. Labs holding cell. In the episode [...] "Two's a Crowd", Superman asks for Parasite's help to learn the location of an atomic bomb that has been hidden by rogue ex-S.T.A.R. Labs scientist Earl Garver (voiced by Brian Cox), to which Parasite agrees, in exchange for Cable TV in his cell. But somehow, Garver's mind takes over Parasite's body in the absorption process. Superman is later forced to fight Garver/Parasite at the location of the bomb, while Rudy and Garver fight inside for control of Parasite's body. Superman eventually manages to defeat the Parasite and destroy the bomb, and Rudy regains control of his body. With Earl Garver recovered and incarcerated, Parasite gets his end of the bargain as he is seen watching TV in his cell. In the episode [...] "Double Dose", Livewire breaks Parasite out of prison, and forms an uneasy alliance with him to destroy Superman. However, Parasite's greed gets the better of him, as he constantly attempts to take Livewire's powers for himself. The two later encounter Superman, protected against both Parasite and Livewire by a layer of latex. However, Livewire shatters it with liquid nitrogen, and Parasite drains Superman of his powers. But Parasite betrays Livewire by absorbing her powers as well, intending to keep both of them trapped and alive as his [...] "unlimited power source". With both the Man of Steel and Livewire's powers, Parasite confronts a weakened Superman alone. But he is eventually defeated when Superman tricks him into burning a mop and setting off an emergency shower which, reacting with Livewire's vulnerability to water, drains Parasite of all his new powers and memories (including Superman's secret identity) to the point that he no longer remembers who he himself is. Parasite is then arrested and returned to prison.|$|E
