40|$|In Arabidopsis, {{much of what}} we {{know about}} the {{phytohormone}} salicylic acid (SA) and its role in plant defense comes from experiments using <b>young</b> <b>plants.</b> We are interested in understanding why <b>young</b> <b>plants</b> are susceptible to virulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae, while mature plants exhibit a robust defense response known as Age-Related Resistance (ARR). SA-mediated signaling is important for defense in <b>young</b> <b>plants,</b> however, ARR occurs independently of the defense regulators NPR 1 and WHY 1. Furthermore, intercellular SA accumulation is an important component of ARR, and intercellular washing fluids from ARR-competent plants exhibit antibacterial activity, suggesting that SA acts as an antimicrobial agent in the intercellular space. <b>Young</b> <b>plants</b> accumulate both intracellular and intercellular SA during PAMP- and Effector-Triggered Immunity, however, virulent P. syringae promotes susceptibility by suppressing SA accumulation using the phytotoxin coronatine. Here we outline the hypothesis that mature, ARR-competent Arabidopsis alleviates coronatine-mediated suppression of SA accumulation. We also explore the role of SA in other mature-plant processes such as flowering and senescence, and discuss their potential impact on ARR...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} four cotton cultivars on the {{oviposition}} {{behavior of the}} pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) was studied under laboratory and semi-field conditions. <b>Young</b> <b>plants</b> and bolls from four commercial upland cotton cultivars (Lachata, Macnair- 220, Midas and Sandra) cultivated {{in the area of}} Thessaloniki were used. The four cultivars had palmate leaves, and nectaries on both leaves and bolls. Differences were observed in the trichome density and the length of leaf petiole among the cultivars. The typical shape of bolls was either round or ovate. Differences were observed among the cultivars tested in boll size and bract's length. In a series of experiments we recorded the number of eggs oviposited in no-, two-, three-, and four-choice tests using either <b>young</b> <b>plants</b> or bolls. Although the four cotton cultivars exhibited a variation in morphological characteristics, the mean number of eggs oviposited on <b>young</b> <b>plants</b> and bolls did not differ among them in two-, three-, and four-choice experiments. Substantially higher number of eggs were oviposited on either <b>young</b> <b>plants</b> or bolls of Midas in no-choice experiments. Eggs were oviposited mainly on newly developed unfolded leaves of the <b>young</b> <b>plants</b> and under the calyx of the bolls. In a semi-field experiment, we found a clear oviposition preference for bolls compared with plant terminals in all the cultivars tested. Females oviposited similar number of eggs in the four cultivars. We discuss the effect of morphological characteristics of cotton cultivars on the oviposition behavior of pink bollworm...|$|R
40|$|There are {{significant}} differences in the dynamics of employment over the business cycle between young and old manufacturing <b>plants.</b> <b>Young</b> <b>plants</b> are more sensitive to aggregate disturbances, and they respond to them along different margins. We interpret these differences as reflecting greater organizational flexibility at <b>young</b> <b>plants</b> due to the changing nature of a plant's environment as it ages. In the presence of aggregate uncertainty, differences between young and old plants' organizational flexibility allows the model to reproduce their distinct cyclical characteristics. Previous empirical studies show that small firms generally respond by more to aggregate shocks than do large firms. To the extent that small firms tend to operate <b>young</b> <b>plants,</b> our analysis suggests an alternative to conventional explanations of this evidence which appeal to imperfections in credit markets. ...|$|R
