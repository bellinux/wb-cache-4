40|$|Background: The {{problems}} to leaf in plants are very severe {{and they usually}} shorten the lifespan of plants. Leaf diseases are mainly caused due to three types of attacks including viral, bacterial or fungal. Diseased leaves reduce the crop production and affect the agricultural economy. Since agriculture plays {{a vital role in}} the economy, thus effective mechanism is required to detect the problem in early stages. Methods: Traditional approaches used for the identification of diseased plants are based on field visits which is time consuming and tedious. In this paper a comparative analysis of machine learning approaches has been presented for the identification of healthy and non-healthy plant leaves. For experimental purpose three different types of plant leaves have been selected namely, cabbage, citrus and sorghum. In order to classify healthy and non-healthy plant leaves color based features such as pixels, statistical features such as mean, <b>standard</b> <b>deviation,</b> <b>min,</b> max and descriptors such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) have been used.

40|$|Social insect colonies operate without central control, and colony {{organization}} {{results from}} the ways that individuals respond to local information. We investigated how temporal information, in particular the rate of interaction among workers, stimulates foraging activity in the red harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus). Patrollers scout the foraging area each morning. Previous work showed that the patrollers' safe return to the nest stimulates the foragers to leave the nest; if the patrollers do not return, the foragers do not emerge. Here, we tested whether contact with returning patrollers must occur at a particular rate to stimulate foraging. We varied the rates at which we introduced patroller mimics, glass beads coated with an extract of the cuticular hydrocarbons of patrollers. A return rate of 1 patroller mimic every 10 s stimulated {{the highest level of}} foraging activity. We found that the onset of foraging depends on the rate of patroller return. Adding beads coated with patroller hydrocarbons at a rate of 1 per 10 s caused otherwise undisturbed colonies to forage 17. 9 � 19. 7 (<b>standard</b> <b>deviation)</b> <b>min</b> faster than colonies that received blank control beads.

40|$|Telepathology (TP) {{is defined}} as {{delivering}} pathology services over a distance 1. TP frozen section service is in routine use for more than 20 years, mainly in countries with areas of low population density, such as USA 2, Canada 3, Norway 4 and Japan 5. Telepathology frozen-section-service is using a robotic microscope with an attached digital camera to intraoperatively render time-critical diagnosis 4, 7. Diagnostic accuracy in telepathology frozen section examining different tissues is between 90 - 98 % 3, 8 - 12. It takes more time to render a diagnosis compared to conventional microscopy 11, 25. Virtual microscopy is an emerging alternative technology already in routine use 3, 14 - 16. In telepathology frozen-section the preparation of gross specimen prior to kryostaining is performed by a non-pathologist 15, 17 under supervision by the telepathologist via videoconference. The professional association of German pathologists sees this {{as a violation of}} specialty boundaries and deployed a restraining order against TP frozen section services in Germany 21. There is limited data {{about the quality of the}} macroscopic part of frozen section, since the mainly retrospective studies are limited on telemicroscopy 18 - 20, 26. More prospective comparing studies were demanded 22. Methods In our prospective randomized trial comparing conventional and telepathological frozen section service in oncological breast surgery we used the dynamic robotic TP-System TPS 1 (Leica Microsystems GmbH Wetzlar) 24. The gross preparation was executed by the surgeon supervised by the telepathologist using a videomacroscope. We randomized 84 cases in seven month. In the TP arm three cases had to be excluded, two due to technical failure and one for meeting the exclusion criteria. Finally 81 cases were included, 46 in the conventional and 35 in the telepathological arm. Results Diagnostic accuracy was slightly lower in the telepathological arm (91, 4 % vs. 95, 7 %). In each of the study arms two cases were deferred. Telepathologically there was one false-positive diagnosis “Suspicious for DCIS”, with the same diagnosis rendered conventionally. The turnaround time was higher in Telepathology (TP: 4 bis 38, 5 min., Median 17 min., Standardabweichung 8, 3 min.; conventional: 2, 5 bis 27 min., median. 9 <b>min,</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> 5, 7 <b>min.),</b> also the time for microscopy (TP: 1 bis 27, 5 min., median 6 <b>min.,</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> 7 min.; conventional: 0, 5 bis 18 min., median 5 <b>min.,</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> 3, 7 <b>min.).</b> The gross preparation performed by the surgeon was time-effective and there was no sampling error.

The data were collected using the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) at the Fermilab Tevatron from 1992 – 1995 (Run 1). The experimental measurement of σ (W + ≥ 1 jet) is compared to next-to-leading-order QCD predictions generated using the DYRAD Monte Carlo program. We explore the sensitivity of σ (W + ≥ 1 jet) to differences in the jet definition by using two different jet cone sizes (R = 0. 4 and R = 0. 7) and by varying the jet transverse energy threshold (E min T) from 15 to 95 GeV.

40|$|BACKGROUND: RNA {{quality is}} {{believed}} to decrease with ischaemia time, and therefore open radical prostatectomy has been advantageous in allowing the retrieval of the prostate immediately after its devascularization. In contrast, robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALP) require the completion of several operative steps before the devascularized prostate can be extirpated, casting doubt on the validity of this technique {{as a source for}} obtaining prostatic tissue. We seek to establish the integrity of our biobanking process by measuring the RNA quality of specimens derived from robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. METHODS: We describe our biobanking process and report the RNA quality of prostate specimens using advanced electrophoretic techniques (RNA Integrity Numbers, RIN). Using multivariate regression analysis we consider the impact of various clinicopathological correlates on RNA integrity. RESULTS: Our biobanking process has been used to acquire 1709 prostates, and allows us to retain approximately 40 % of the prostate specimen, without compromising the histopathological evaluation of patients. We collected 186 samples from 142 biobanked prostates, and demonstrated a mean RIN of 7. 25 (<b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> 1. 64) in 139 non-stromal samples, 73 % of which had a RIN ≥ 7. Multivariate regression analysis revealed cell type [...] stromal/epithelial and benign/malignant [...] and prostate volume to be significant predictors of RIN, with unstandardized coefficients of 0. 867 (p = 0. 001), 1. 738 (p < 0. 001) and - 0. 690 (p = 0. 009) respectively. A mean warm ischaemia time of 120 <b>min</b> (<b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> 30 <b>min)</b> was recorded, but multivariate regression analysis did not demonstrate a relationship with RIN within the timeframe of the RALP procedure. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the robustness of our protocol [...] representing the concerted efforts of dedicated urology and pathology departments [...] in generating RNA of sufficient concentration and quality, without compromising the histopathological evaluation and diagnosis of patients. The ischaemia time associated with our prostatectomy technique using a robotic platform does not negatively impact on biobanking for RNA studies...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{for a person}} with diabetes is to adapt insulin dosage regimens and food intake to keep blood glucose within tolerable limits during daily life activities. The early knowledge {{about the effects of}} inputs on glycemia would provide the patients with invaluable information for appropriate on-the-spot decision making concerning the management of the disease. Against this background, in this paper we propose multi-step data-driven predictors to the purpose of predicting blood glucose multiple steps ahead in the future, supporting therefore the patients when deciding upon treatments. We formulate the predictors based on the state-space construction step in subspace identification methods for linear systems. Physiological models from the literature were used to filter the raw information on carbohydrate and insulin intakes in order to retrieve the input signals to the predictors. The clinical data of 14 type 1 diabetic patients collected in hospital during a 3 -days long visit were used. Half of the data were employed for predictor development and the remaining half for validation.
