5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E

40|$|In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uneven {{development}} <b>of</b> e-government around <b>the</b> world, {{it is not}} unimagined {{that governments}} and scholars have started to question what influences its sophistication. The term <b>sophistication</b> captures <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> service functionality as e-government evolves {{through a series of}} stages. A considerable body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature has examined indicators of technological, economic and institutional factors, which are likely to influence <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> e-government. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> these studies have placed more emphasis on <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> a country’s technological and economic conditions only. Recognising that other factors might influence <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> e-government, more recent studies are incorporating indicators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institutional dimension into this analysis -i. e., the rules, norms and laws that shapes a country’s society. However, e-government is not static, and <b>the</b> examination <b>of</b> these indicators across different sophistication levels has been ignored. Thus, the following study questions what the influence is from these indicators, and what differences exist between them across different degrees <b>of</b> e-government <b>sophistication.</b> To answer these questions, a two-step examination approach was undertaken utilising secondary sources from 142 countries around the globe. <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study examined <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> indicators of technological, economic and institutional factors –i. e., ICT infrastructure, GDP per capita, corruption control, press freedom and human capital – in <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> e-government. A regression model was utilised for this first analysis. The second part evaluated with closer granularity these indicators across groups that represent <b>the</b> different levels <b>of</b> e-government <b>sophistication.</b> A Kruskal-Wallis test was undertaken to study these indicators across groups of high, medium and low degrees <b>of</b> <b>sophistication.</b> <b>The</b> results from the regression analysis provide support to ICT infrastructure and human capital as significant indicators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sophistication</b> <b>of</b> e-government. For <b>the</b> second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis, with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> press freedom and human capital, differences across all groups were identified for the indicators ICT infrastructure, GDP per capita, and corruption control. Considering these findings, countries should take a closer examination to the indicators ICT infrastructure and human capital as potential indicators of higher levels <b>of</b> e-government <b>sophistication.</b> Also, countries need to examine their particular circumstances to understand the underlying causes that might influence the observed results across groups <b>of</b> e-government <b>sophistication...</b>|$|R
