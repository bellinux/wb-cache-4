5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no {{questions for the}} attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> this was criticised.|$|E
60|$|His words made me blush hotly, {{although}} I {{should not}} have minded his very personal remarks much if that beautiful girl had not been standing there listening to everything. My uncouth garments, by the way, were made by a fashionable West End tailor, and fitted me perfectly, although just now they were, of course, very dirty. It was also a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> I had a thick speech, since I had always been considered a remarkably clear speaker and good singer, and had frequently both sung and recited in public, at amateur entertainments.|$|R

25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
500|$|The Nadaswaram {{played by}} Ganesan and Rajan was played {{off-screen}} by the brothers, M. P. N. Sethuraman and M. P. N. Ponnusamy. Nagarajan {{had seen the}} duo performing at a wedding reception in Karaikudi {{and asked them to}} come to Chennai. Their rehearsals took place over 15 days in Mahadevan's recording studio in Chennai. Nagarajan then listened to a radio recital by the duo, and was impressed with their rendition of Thyagaraja's Keerthana, [...] "Nagumomu Ganaleni". The Keerthana was later selected as one of the soundtrack instrumentals in the film. After Thillana Mohanambals release, a Russian delegation met Ganesan in person. They were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> he was only acting and not actually playing the Nadaswaram.|$|E
500|$|Sebastian Coe was {{instrumental}} in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the Happy and Glorious film sequence featuring the Queen. [...] Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as Helen Mirren, in a location to double as Buckingham Palace. [...] Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, {{and she told him}} to ask the Queen. [...] Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary. [...] Boyle was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> the Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part. Filming took place in late March 2012, and Happy and Glorious was produced by the BBC, as was the opening film sequence Journey along the Thames.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite naturally," [...] Crawshay replied. [...] "Now with {{reference}} to this young man, I watched him coming down the steps from his office this morning. You may be <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> Captain, <b>that</b> I found him unprepossessing--in fact I might almost say that I took a dislike to him." ...|$|R
60|$|So, as I told you, the son {{found our}} {{neighbourhood}} the surest place he {{could choose to}} set things right secretly in his own interests. It may <b>surprise</b> you <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> what he really did to the marriage register was done {{on the spur of}} the moment--done on second thoughts.|$|R

500|$|Bhatti {{revealed}} that since appearing in EastEnders, {{people have come}} up {{to him in the}} street and called him a [...] "bad man", and that fans call him [...] "Dr Evil". In May 2011, Bhatti was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the TV Quick Awards and the storyline where he tries to destroy the Masoods' marriage was nomated for Best Storyline. Bhatti was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Yusef is liked mainly by women, but {{in an interview with the}} Daily Mirror, he admits that he is nothing like Yusef in real life. BBC News branded Yusef as [...] "Zainab's sinister first husband", elsewhere, Metro.co.uk described Yusef as a [...] "deceptive doctor". Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Zainab sending Yusef into the blazing building was a [...] "stroke of genius". Simon also said that it's unknown what Yusef is hoping to achieve with his [...] "one-man reign of terror. Being married to a woman he can’t stand, with a son he doesn’t want." [...] She added: [...] "It doesn’t sound like much of a game-plan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{gave the}} show a {{negative}} review saying, [...] "Like so many former primetime titans, it's perplexing to see Barr reduced to this [...] " [...] and [...] "Why Barr wanted {{to participate in}} this sort of [...] "celebreality" [...] unscripted sitcom—especially if she hates Hollywood as much as she says—is a little less obvious, especially since she professes not to need the money and, given her syndication bounty, shouldn't". David Hinckley of the Daily News gave it two out of five stars. He said, [...] "Roseanne fans will be reassured, though not <b>surprised,</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> she sounds and acts exactly the same on the plantation as she did on her sitcom set".|$|E
2500|$|Following the song's initial improvisation, {{tapes of}} the {{recording}} sessions were delivered to assisting producer Brian Eno to gather his input; [...] Eno spent {{extended periods of time}} away from the sessions before visiting to review songs, and he believed that distancing himself from the work allowed him to provide the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them. The band were rather anxious about the quality of their material, but when Eno arrived in Berlin, they were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> he liked most of the tapes. [...] However, as Bono recalls, Eno said, [...] "There's just one song I really despise, and that's 'One'." [...] Eno felt that they needed to deconstruct the song.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Brooks continued, [...] "it may <b>surprise</b> you <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> {{a few of}} us {{who have}} a little money up there have come to the same conclusion. We'd like to do our little bit towards {{squaring}} things up. It may not be much, but lots more may come of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy you are depreciating {{yourself}} too much. But it <b>surprises</b> me <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> {{you don't}} sing. I always fancy that I can distinguish a musical {{person in a}} crowd, and you, in the expression of your face, in your movements, {{and most of all}} in your voice, seemed to reveal the musical soul." ...|$|R
40|$|It may not <b>surprise</b> you <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Ames, Iowa, is {{well known}} across the United States as a center of {{veterinary}} knowledge. It may <b>surprise</b> you, however, <b>to</b> learn that Ames, Iowa, is even better known outside the United States for its animal health expertise. This is due, in part, {{to the work of}} the Institute for International Cooperation in Animal Biologics (IICAB). What,you may ask, is IICAB...|$|R
2500|$|Prince Henry the Navigator did {{not return}} to Lisbon to report to his brother, King Edward of Portugal, but rather sailed {{directly}} to Ceuta. [...] Henry assigned D. Fernando de Castro the duty of bringing his troops home and giving the account of the expedition and its defeat. [...] In Ceuta, Henry barricaded himself in his lodgings for several weeks, with hardly a word to anyone – evidently, Henry had fallen into a deep depression. [...] The new Portuguese governor of Ceuta, Fernando de Noronha, who had been appointed to succeed his father-in-law, the late Pedro de Menezes, arrived in Ceuta around this time. He must have been <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> a treaty had been signed to evacuate the garrison he had just been appointed to command. [...] With Henry ensconced in his room, not speaking to anyone, Noronha was not sure how to proceed.|$|E
2500|$|When it {{came time}} to record the score for Double Indemnity, Lipstone made no secret that he despised what Rózsa had done, to which Wilder finally turned to him and snapped, [...] "You may be <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> I love it. Okay?" [...] Lipstone then {{disappeared}} and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned Rózsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing [...] "Carnegie Hall music" [...] which had no place in a film. Rózsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not – and suggested he listen to the music from Madame Curie to learn how to write a proper film score. When Rózsa pointed out that Double Indemnity was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to The Battle of Russia. Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director, Buddy DeSylva, heard the music he would throw it out. At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over: expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief – only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: there was not enough of it. By this time Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously, [...] "I always find you the right guy for the job, Buddy, don't I?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Faith, why not?" [...] said Mr. Wood. [...] "His keep, meanwhile, {{will not}} be sixpence a day." [...] Then turning round to the blacksmith, [...] "Mr. Billings," [...] said he, [...] "you will be <b>surprised,</b> perhaps, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> I know {{everything}} regarding that poor lad's history. His mother was an unfortunate lady of high family, now no more; his father a German nobleman, Count de Galgenstein by name." ...|$|R

"This splendid Graham {{is a young}} scamp, Polly--that is {{my present}} notion of him: it will <b>surprise</b> you <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> for my part, I do not love him one whit. Ah! years ago I saw {{something}} in that lad's eye I never quite fathomed--something his mother has not--a depth which warned a man not to wade into that stream too far; now, suddenly, I find myself taken over the crown of the head." ...|$|R
6000|$|And so Anty was rescued, for a while, {{from her}} brother's persecution. This {{happened}} on the morning on which Martin and Lord Ballindine met together at the lawyer's, when the deeds were prepared which young Kelly's genuine honesty made him think necessary before he eloped with old Sim Lynch's heiress. He would have been rather <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> at <b>that</b> moment, {{that his mother had}} been before him, and carried off his bride elect to the inn! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I have {{certainly}} been to blame," [...] this unexpected visitor confessed. [...] "On the other hand, I {{have been very}} much absorbed.

60|$|It was in {{the spring}} of 1829 that my father {{received}} a lawyer's letter announcing the death of James Winslow, Esquire, of Chantry House, Earlscombe, and inviting him, as heir-at-law, to be present at the funeral and opening of the will. The <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> us all was great. Even my mother had hardly heard of Chantry House itself, far less as a possible inheritance; and she had only once seen James Winslow. He was the last of the elder branch of the family, a third cousin, and older than my father, who had known him in times long past. When they had last met, the Squire of Chantry House was a married man, with more than one child; my father a young barrister; and as one lived entirely in the country and the other in town, without any special congeniality, no intercourse had been kept up, and it was a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> he had left no surviving children. My father greatly doubted whether being heir-at-law would prove to avail him anything, since it was likely that so distant a relation would have made a will in favour of some nearer connection on his wife's or mother's side. He was very vague about Chantry House, only knowing that {{it was supposed to be}} a fair property, and he would hardly consent to take Griffith with him by the Western Royal Mail, warning him and all the rest of us that our expectations would be disappointed.|$|R

This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained {{in the minds of the}} coroner's jury." ...|$|R
