5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States. This belief was <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> ingrained that the reintroduction of condors to the Grand Canyon was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} Beecher's legacy, Applegate {{states that}} His reputation has been eclipsed {{by his own}} success. Mainstream Christianity is <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> infused with the rhetoric of Christ's love that most Americans can imagine nothing else, and have no appreciation or memory of the revolution wrought by Beecher and his peers.|$|E
5|$|Today some of {{the sharpest}} opening {{variations}} have been analyzed <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> that they are often used as drawing weapons. For example, at the highest levels, Black often uses the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez, a line where Black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances, to obtain an endgame where Black is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play.|$|E

5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy {{to go around the}} trench. These troops found their path blocked by the wagons which the Lacedaimonians had sunken into the soil. The wagons were planted <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> that they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to remove some of the wagons, giving them the opportunity to burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to turn around to confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E
25|$|Introjection: Identifying {{with some}} idea or object <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> {{that it becomes}} {{a part of that}} person. For example, introjection occurs when we take on {{attributes}} of other people who seem better able to cope with the situation than we do.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is a dark}} comedy but is as much <b>so</b> a <b>deeply</b> {{dramatic}} story, {{involving the}} mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed.|$|R

50|$|In June 1967, French {{president}} Charles de Gaulle, who {{had recently}} granted independence to Algeria, shouted Vive le Québec libre! during a speech from the balcony of Montreal's city hall during a state visit to Canada for Expo 67 and the Canadian Centennial. In doing <b>so,</b> he <b>deeply</b> offended the Canadian federal government, which derided him. De Gaulle cut short his visit and left the country.|$|R

25|$|While King Louis XVI still enjoyed {{popularity}} among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes (June 1791) seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to {{the prospects of}} foreign invasion. His credibility was <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> undermined that {{the abolition of the}} monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} Taihos armor {{immersed}} her hull <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> that her lower hangar deck was barely above the load waterline and {{the bottoms of}} her two elevator wells (which formed the roofs of her fore and aft aviation fuel tanks) were actually below the waterline.

25|$|American {{independence}} led {{to great}} changes for Bermuda. Prior to the war, with no useful landmass or natural resources, Bermuda was largely ignored {{and left to}} its own devices by the London government. By being <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> involved in trade, Bermuda merchants and financiers had played roles {{out of proportion to}} the colony's size in relation {{to the development of the}} Triangle Trade, and the trans-Atlantic English and British empires.|$|E
25|$|Although {{mathematics}} {{became more}} and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend. His unique skill was to eliminate all unnecessary hypotheses and burrow into an area <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> that its inner patterns on the most abstract level revealed themselves–and then, like a magician, show how the solution of old problems fell out in straightforward ways now that their real nature had been revealed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{classical}} rabbinical sources {{argue that}} Joseph identified himself for other reasons. In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on {{the memory of}} Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph {{was so important to}} him that he had named his sons in Joseph's honour. These sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> that Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.|$|E
50|$|His {{acquaintance}} with the Hamons familiarised Painlevé with the active practice of anarchism and teaching it by example. Augustin Hamon {{and his wife}} wanted their children to be raised in the altruist culture and under anarchist principles, so they had no objections to their young daughter living with Jean Painlevé as an unmarried couple ("living in sin"), something socially unacceptable in Catholic France, and, even more <b>so,</b> in <b>deeply</b> Catholic Penvenan, where the Harmons resided.|$|R
40|$|Both {{academics}} {{and policy makers}} have shown increasing interest in {{the topic of the}} high performance work organisation (HPWO) as a means to achieve a 'high skills' or 'learning' economy.

25|$|In March, Lee {{passed along}} War Department orders to begin {{transferring}} regiments from Florida to Tennessee to reinstate operations following the “disasters to our arms” there. Georgian troops {{had been sent}} to Virginia in July, additional Georgians would be moved to Tennessee also. The Confederate government required a withdrawal from seaboard forces into the interior of South Carolina and Georgia to better secure the breadbasket plantations feeding the armies. In Florida, only the Apalachicola River had to be defended at all costs because Federal gunboats could penetrate <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> into the Georgia interior.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Thompson {{returned}} to a life as a land owner, but soon financial misfortune would ruin him. By 1831 he was <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> in debt {{he was forced to}} take up a position as a surveyor for the British American Land Company to provide for his family. His luck continued to worsen and he was forced to move in with his daughter and son-in-law in 1845. He began work on a manuscript chronicling his life exploring the continent, but this project was left unfinished when his sight failed him completely in 1851.|$|E
25|$|Geologically, Holderness is {{underlain}} by Cretaceous chalk but in {{most places}} it is <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> buried beneath glacial deposits {{that it has no}} influence on the landscape. The landscape is dominated by deposits of till, boulder clays and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form a more or less continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area.|$|E
40|$|Over the years, {{the rest}} of the European Union has got very used to being lectured at by British prime ministers. <b>So</b> the <b>deeply</b> {{critical}} tone of Theresa May's speech at Lancaster House (17 January) when she spoke about the EU's failings – and her unseemly boastfulness about Britain – shocked nobody. 1 There were nevertheless some important clues in her speech about what in the Brexit negotiations will be really difficult issues to resolve; there were also ambiguities and provocations...|$|R

25|$|Muriel Helena Ball {{was born}} in 1908 on her parents' farm in Austin, Quebec, a village in the Eastern Townships about 130km east of Montreal. She was one of five {{children}} born to Anna Westover and Ezra Ball. Their farm was on the scenic shores of Lake Memphremagog and Muriel spent her first years enjoying the natural beauty around her. She was <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> affected by the landscape that she returned nearly every summer {{for the rest of}} her life to the cottage her aunt and uncle built in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years after}} Henry Ball's death, DeDe Ball married Edward Peterson. While {{her mother and}} {{stepfather}} looked for work in another city, Lucy's stepfather’s parents cared for her brother and her. Ball's new guardians were a puritanical Swedish couple who banished all mirrors from the house except for one over the bathroom sink. When the young Ball was caught admiring herself in it, she was severely chastised for being vain. This period of time affected Ball <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> that, in later life, she claimed that it lasted seven or eight years. Peterson was a Shriner.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprints {{have been}} found on ancient Babylonian clay tablets, seals, and pottery. They have also been found {{on the walls of}} Egyptian tombs and on Minoan, Greek, and Chinese pottery, as well as on bricks and tiles from ancient Babylon and Rome. Some of these {{fingerprints}} were deposited unintentionally by the potters and masons as a natural consequence of their work, and others were made in the process of adding decoration. However, on some pottery, fingerprints have been impressed <b>so</b> <b>deeply</b> into the clay that they were possibly intended to serve as an identifying mark by the maker.|$|E

50|$|The {{price of}} a car, unlike many retail sales, is often negotiable. New cars will often have a factory window sticker listing {{equipment}} and options, and the suggested retail price. With the prevalence of the internet, and third party information sites, the profit of dealers has dropped dramatically since prices are widely advertised and best discounts are given to remain competitive. The salesman is paid a commission, rarely a fixed salary but usually based on a percentage of profit, <b>so</b> a <b>deeply</b> discounted price results in a very low commission for the salesman.|$|R
