40|$|The 2005 {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact has amplified the role of {{government}} debt and long-term fiscal sustainability in the <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> <b>budgetary</b> <b>positions</b> in the European Union (EU). Some aspects of the reform are still to be fully defined, including the role of implicit liabilities. This paper explores two main possibilities for accounting for such liabilities: using long-term expenditure projections and referring to estimates of the amount of pension liabilities. With reference to the former, the paper examines the pension expenditure projections available for EU countries and their use in the assessment of fiscal sustainability. While acknowledging the progress in the availability and quality of projections, the paper notes that their comparability is still unsatisfactory. Any mechanical use of existing pension expenditure projections should therefore be avoided. As to pension liabilities, the paper examines the main definitions and their potential role in the EU fiscal framework.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{uncertainty}} {{as to the}} sustainability <b>of</b> a country?s <b>budgetary</b> <b>position</b> will frustrate <b>budgetary</b> stabilisers to operate as a stabilisation device. Therefore, rather than irrelevant or harmful, the disciplinary incentive offered by the Stability Pact is even beneficial from a stabilisation point of view. This implies that the common trade-off between rules (of the Stability Pact to prevent the externalities from unsustainable budget balances) and flexibility (required to stabilise output) does not hold in this case. The empirical results presented in the paper indicate that a substantial, statistically significant and robust partial relation exists between government debt {{on the one hand}} and the degree of actual stabilisation on the other hand.

40|$|The {{transition}} process {{covers all}} sides of the economic system. The experience of the transition countries shows that the budgetary policy {{has been one of the}} most complicated elements of the transition process. Speaking about the role <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> policy during the transition process, one can talk about two generations <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> reforms. In the initial phases of the transition the first generation of the reforms was concentrated on the quantitative adjustment of the budget to the actual macroeconomic situation. It included the reduction of the deficit and debts, the dissolution of the interaction between the money supply growth and the financing of the budget deficit as well as the dismantling of the soft budget constraints. Nowadays when the overall economic stabilisation has been mainly reached in the transition countries and the fundamentals of the market-based institutions have been established, these countries are in the "post transition" stage which, in its turn, puts new challenges before them: such as strengthening the achieved macroeconomic stabilisation results and the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> policy, improving the functionality of market-based institutions and realising the structural reforms. First <b>of</b> all the <b>budgetary</b> policy should aim at the quality <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> adjustments, thus determining the second generation <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> reforms. The sustainability has been an important priority <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> policy at all stages of the transition process. Indeed, assessing the sustainability on the basis of the size of the deficit and debts has been and still remains the most widely used method <b>of</b> evaluating the <b>budgetary</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> a transition economy. The opinion which is defended in this paper is that this method does not give enough information about the load-carrying sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> policy. In this paper the stages of the transformation process have been characterised from the perspective of the changes <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> policy and the conclusions have been formulated with the regard to the factors which determine the load-carrying sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> policy and the budgetary risks. Moreover, the attempt has been taken, using the multidimensional approach, to observe the load-carrying sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>budgetary</b> policy in the interaction with the following factors: initial conditions, macroeconomic stability, structural and institutional reforms.

40|$|The Stability and Growth Pact sets a {{medium-term}} {{target for}} fiscal policy <b>of</b> a <b>budgetary</b> <b>position</b> 'close to balance or in surplus'. This {{addition to the}} deficit rule defined by the Maastricht Treaty has been interpreted {{as an attempt to}} reconciliate the objective of sound public finances with the availability of adequate margins for stabilisation. However, with the debt rule set in the Treaty unchanged, there is a risk that the Pact will not fully achieve the desired reconciliation. Using the budget to implement stabilisation policy while still ensuring a reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio during cyclical downturns, as required by the Treaty, is likely to require large structural surpluses. Assuming positive nominal growth rates, the closer the debt ratio is to 60 per cent the larger are the surpluses needed. If countries with debt ratios higher than 60 per cent set insufficiently ambitious deficit targets, {{they will not be able}} to make full use of the margins allowed by the 3 per cent threshold. During cyclical downturns such countries may have to adopt a pro-cyclical budgetary stance. The regulation of the interaction between deficit and debt rules is complicated by the EU definitions of debt and deficit, as they refer to different groups of transactions and are based on different accounting conventions.

40|$|Recent {{economic}} forecasts {{increase the}} probability that firstly, the EMU can start as planned on January 1, 1999 and secondly, that it will start with {{a large group of}} countries. The economic implications of the artificially unification of "hard-currency" and "soft-currency" countries are analysed by means of macroeconomic model simulations. The results of a large "non-optimal" EMU are as expected. On the one hand, there are positive income effects for all countries � although unevenly distributed over the participants � on the other hand, the internal (inflation) and external (value of the Euro vis-à-vis the Dollar) stability are at risk. The "hard-currency" group will be the major winner (in terms of real GDP and employment), whereas the "soft-currency" group has to carry the adjustment costs to a regime of fixed exchange rates (Euro) which results in slower growth, decline in employment and a deterioration <b>of</b> their <b>budgetary</b> <b>position.</b> The necessary convergence of prices and interest rates leads to an increase (decrease) of inflation and interest rates in the "hard-currency" countries ("soft-currency" countries). If the EMU will start with a large group there will be a tendency to devalue the Euro against the Dollar. As a consequence of the uneven economic performance of a large (non-optimal) EMU I would suggest to start the EMU with a core group of "hard-currency" countries.

40|$|Outsourcing of {{municipal}} tasks {{from the core}} budget to municipal enterprises tends to distort {{the perception of the}} actual financial position, net assets and results of operations of the German local governments. Excess supply or -demand of/for local public services might be possible consequences of this development. Hence, this article attempts to develop a more comprehensive picture <b>of</b> the municipal <b>budgetary</b> <b>position</b> by a simultaneous analysis of selected indicators. Furthermore, the methodological problems of the calculations are illustrated. If these shadow budgets are taken into account, the total per capita revenues, -investments and -debts will increase by approximately one third to 50 %. However, the share of the municipal employees belonging to the core administration in the total number {{of municipal}} employees is 75 %. Although only about 22 % of the expenditures for certain voluntary municipal tasks have been outsourced, {{there seems to be an}} upward trend. The study also indicates that there are significant differences between Eastern and Western German cities. These include the higher revenues from municipal enterprises, the higher debts per capita and the higher expenditures on culture, sports, leisure services or the promotion of science in Eastern Germany. The results should be interpreted carefully due to some shortcomings of the official statistics. For example, internal cash flows cannot be totally eliminated. Moreover, indirect municipal majority holdings as well as the municipal savings banks are not included in the results. All in all, it remains to be seen whether the initiated reforms concerning the introduction of double-entry accounting into the local government budgeting system will help to achieve the ideal goal of a meaningful “consolidated financial statement” for the “city company”. ...|$|R
