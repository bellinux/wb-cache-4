2500|$|Peugeot HYmotion3 compressor, {{a hybrid}} scooter is a three-wheeler that uses two {{separate}} power sources {{to power the}} front and back wheels. The back wheel is powered by a single cylinder 125 cc, [...] <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>motor</b> while the front wheels are each driven by their own electric motor. When the bike is moving up to 10km/h only the electric motors are used on a stop-start basis reducing the amount of carbon emissions.|$|E
50|$|Prices for the Gray {{were set}} at $350 for a <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>motor</b> cycle engined car and $450 for a twin cylinder. The cars used Harley-Davidson engines and {{weighted}} 850 lbs {{with a body}} and 540 lbs without. The car ran on motorcycle wheels and had room for two people. It was claimed to obtain 50 miles per gallon of gasoline. The cars transmission had two forward gears and reverse.|$|E

50|$|The Moto Zodiaco was {{powered by}} a stroke <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> 227cc <b>motor</b> with 20bhp, (normally found in snowmobiles) and a pulley {{transmission}} (normally found in tractors). The top speed was around 100 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Simplex took a {{stand at}} the Paris Motor Show in October 1919 and {{exhibited}} a light “voiturette” style car featuring a <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> horizontal <b>motor</b> of 735cc.

5000|$|In the 1930s Rovin {{had turned}} his {{attention}} to a sportscar dealership which he established in Paris on the Boulevard Pereire. Although the business was at this stage concentrated on the dealership, Raoul Rovin was already offering a little car of his own design at the 20th Paris Motor Show in October 1926. [...] Powered by a 4CV <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> 480cc <b>motor,</b> the offering was baptised by its manufacturer as the [...] "Monocar", and was listed in two versions, either as a [...] "Monocar Sport" [...] for 19,000 francs or as a [...] "Monocar Record" [...] which was fitted with a compressor (a form of [...] "turbo-charger") and priced at 22,000 francs.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{her first}} sailing trip the Sea Lark {{anchored}} in front of Manam. No traffic was permitted anymore, said Les Ingle, but he promised her {{to find a way to}} get her to the island. She won Ingle's sympathy and he became interested in her venture while little by little she confided in him. He offered to lend her his 15 ft boat which he had equipped with a <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>motor</b> for fishing trips. They made arrangements to get the boat for her from Madang.|$|E
5000|$|The company's only {{model was}} based on the [...] "Mauser Einspurauto" [...] of 1923. It used two {{principal}} wheels, one behind the other, but with a second set of side-wheels which prevented the vehicle from falling over when stationary, but which folded up when the vehicle was traveling. The water cooled <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>motor</b> had a capacity of 510cc and delivered an approximate maximum 12HP of power, delivered via a three speed transmission, using a chain drive, to the back wheel. [...] There was space for two, positioned one behind the other.|$|E
50|$|In July 1914 P&M {{revealed}} {{details of}} their prototype 90 degree V-twin, their first deviation from the <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>motor</b> cycles {{for which they were}} well known. When the V-twin was launched in November 1914 it featured a 4-speed gear, and was of 770cc, rated as 6 hp. It appears only a handful of the twin were built, though it appeared in catalogues until 1916. The four speed gear arrangement used on the V-twins was re-introduced for the single in 1922, {{and at the same time}} the engine capacity was increased from 499cc to 555cc. This was the last model to carry the P&M name, later models being branded as Panther.|$|E
50|$|Adjacent to the woolshed a {{powerhouse}} was constructed to supply electric and hydraulic {{power for the}} various machines used in the clip. The interior of the Isis Downs powerhouse contained both a boiler room and a generating room. The generating room accommodated an Austral Otis hydraulic pump (which was coupled to an external accumulator) and a <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> reciprocating vertical steam engine that was attached to an electric generator. The system produced DC power for the Falkiner Boll shearing machines and hydraulic power for the wool presses, bale dump and hoist. Power was transmitted via a power-board in the powerhouse and a distribution-board in the woolshed. A diesel generator was eventually installed, followed by a belt driven set which was powered by a twin <b>cylinder</b> <b>motor</b> within the skillion annex; these systems were eventually superseded in the 1970s {{with the introduction of}} 240 volt electric power.|$|R

5000|$|Edwin A. Rutenber {{attended}} {{the public schools}} and college. He learned carpentry from his grandfather and carriage making from his father, and inherited a taste for mechanics from both. He made a study of mechanics, learning the machinist trade thoroughly, and in 1892 invented a <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>motor.</b> For {{a number of years}} he worked to devise a four-cylinder motor of commercial value. In 1898, he produced his first four-cylinder gasoline motor, establishing the Rutenber Manufacturing Company in Chicago to manufacture his new engines, the first four-cylinder engines to be manufactured in the United States. The fame of the design spread and the [...] "Rutenber" [...] motor was used in many early automobiles and attained a worldwide reputation.|$|E

50|$|The Ducati 888 was a {{motorcycle}} manufactured by Ducati as an upgrade to the Ducati 851. The earlier 851 had introduced liquid cooling, computerized fuel injection and four-valve {{heads to the}} company's two <b>cylinder</b> <b>motors.</b> In 1991 Ducati increased {{the capacity of the}} 851 to 888 cc to create the 888. Both engines featured the Desmoquattro valvetrain concept in which a four valve per <b>cylinder</b> <b>motor</b> was given desmodromic valve actuation, with cams both opening and closing the valves. Ducati's desmodromic system reduces the frictional penalty from conventional valve springs.|$|R

40|$|Range {{extender}} {{engine is}} one of the main components of the range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) and together with a generator to extend the mileage of the electric vehicle. The main component of REEV is an electric motor, battery, and generator set that consist of generator and engine. In this study, we compared two models of REEV performance with two different types of the engine by simulation. <b>Single</b> <b>cylinder</b> 499 cc gasoline engine and <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> 667 cc diesel engine are chosen as the object of this research especially relating to the utilization of the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions when fitted to an electric vehicle. The simulation was conducted by using AVL Cruise software and performed by entering the data, both experiment and simulation data, on all the main components of REEV. This simulation was performed in Japan 08 driving cycle. Based on the simulation, fuel consumption is reduced up to 35. 59 % for REEV with <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> diesel engine 667 cc compared to REEV with <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> gasoline engine 499 cc. The reduction of CO 2 emissions from REEV with <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> 499 cc gasoline engine compared to REEV with <b>single</b> <b>cylinder</b> 667 cc diesel engine up to 30. 47 %...|$|R
