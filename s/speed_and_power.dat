This is normally the practice when one training partner is a beginner.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E

The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large carnivores such as bobcats. Large birds of prey, such as northern goshawks, will take ducks from the ground, and some falcons, including the gyrfalcon, have the <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> to catch flying birds.|$|E

5|$|During her career, Haruna {{underwent}} {{two major}} reconstructions. Beginning in 1926, the Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt {{her as a}} battleship, strengthening her armor and improving her <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> capabilities. In 1933, her superstructure was completely rebuilt, her speed was increased, and she was equipped with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan's growing carrier fleet, Haruna was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Haruna transported Imperial Japanese Army troops to mainland China before being redeployed to the Third Battleship Division in 1941.

United, above a black bald eagle facing right on a red field, clawing three soccer balls overlaid on three white stars. The three stars and balls were intended to represent the region's three jurisdictions. The bird, associated {{with the federal government}} based in Washington, D.C., symbolizes many of the attributes of the team, including <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> The logo was redesigned before the 1998 season. This second logo design reoriented the eagle facing left, and removed the three stars below it, whose metaphor was retained by three raised wing feathers. At the center of the eagle is a single gold-colored star and soccer ball, which represents the team's victory in Major League Soccer's inaugural cup in 1996. The logo can also be adorned with four silver stars above it, representing the MLS Cups the team has won.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{construct}} new capital ships until 1931, Japan resorted to upgrading battleships and battlecruisers. In July 1926, Haruna {{became the first}} of Japan's vessels to undergo extensive modernization and modification, in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Over the next two years, her horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened, and the machinery spaces within the hull were increased. Anti-torpedo bulges were added along the waterline, as permitted by the Washington Treaty. She was refitted to accommodate three Type90 Model0 floatplanes. To increase her <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> capacities, all 36 Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with 16 newer boilers, and Brown-Curtis direct-drive turbines were installed. Harunas forward funnel was removed, and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened. The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6,502 to 10,313long tons, directly violating {{the terms of the}} Washington Treaty. In July 1928, Haruna—now capable of speeds of —was reclassified as a battleship.|$|E

25|$|FETs {{often have}} a very low 'on' {{resistance}} and have a high 'off' resistance. However the intermediate resistances are significant, and so FETs can dissipate large amounts of power while switching. Thus efficiency can put a premium on switching quickly, but this can cause transients that can excite stray inductances and generate significant voltages that can couple to the gate and cause unintentional switching. FET circuits can therefore require very careful layout and can involve trades between switching <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> dissipation. There is also a trade-off between voltage rating and 'on' resistance, so high voltage FETs have a relatively high 'on' resistance and hence conduction losses.|$|E
25|$|Seventh Avenue was a Christian metal {{band from}} Wolfsburg, Germany, formed in 1989.

40|$|In {{the natural}} gas {{production}} industry, recent legislation has mandated new emission regulations for low horsepower reciprocating internal combustion engines. One method to achieve compliance of the new regulations {{is the use of}} non-selective catalytic reduction. Non-selective catalytic reduction utilizes a three-way catalyst and an air-to-fuel ratio controller to oxidize carbon monoxide and unburned fuel while reducing oxides of nitrogen. Testing of a non-selective catalytic reduction system was preformed on a typical exploration and production engine, a Compressco GasJack. To fully test the unit, exhaust gas samples were taken with an ECOM gas analyzer {{both before and after the}} catalyst over typical engine <b>speeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>powers.</b> By sampling the exhaust gas concentration before and after the catalyst, the catalyst efficiency or percent reduction in exhaust gas specific concentrations were calculated. Additionally by testing throughout the engine’s typical operation range, conditions under which the non-selective catalyst reduction system fails were determined. After testing, it was found that the three-way catalyst was effective at reducing oxides of nitrogen by 98 % at all <b>speeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> conditions.
