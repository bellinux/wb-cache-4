2500|$|In 1996, {{the film}} was given a lengthy and {{controversial}} restoration by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz and re-released to theaters. The new print featured restored color and newly created audio, using modern sound effects mixed in DTS digital surround sound. In October 1996, the restored Vertigo premiered at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, with Kim Novak and Patricia Hitchcock in person. At this screening, {{the film was}} exhibited {{for the first time}} in DTS and 70mm, a format with a similar frame size to the VistaVision system in which it was originally shot. When restoring the sound, Harris and Katz wanted to stay as close as possible to the original, and had access to the original music recordings that had been stored in the vaults at Paramount. However, as the project demanded a new 6-channel DTS stereo soundtrack, it was necessary to re-record some sound effects using the Foley process. The soundtrack was remixed at the Alfred Hitchcock Theatre at Universal Studios. [...] Aware that the film had a considerable following, the restoration team knew that they were under particular pressure to restore the film as accurately as possible. [...] To achieve this, they used Hitchcock's original dubbing notes for guidance of how the director wanted the film to sound in 1958. Harris and Katz sometimes added extra sound effects to camouflage defects in the old soundtrack ("hisses, pops, and bangs"); in particular they added extra seagull cries and a foghorn to the scene at Cypress Point. The new mix has also been accused of putting too much emphasis on the score at the expense of the sound effects. The 2005 Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection DVD contains the original mono track as an option. Significant color correction was necessary because of the fading of original Technicolor negatives. In some cases a new negative was created from the silver <b>separation</b> <b>masters,</b> but in many instances this was impossible because of differential separation shrinkage, and because the 1958 separations were poorly made. Separations used three individual films: one for each of the primary colors. In the case of Vertigo, these had shrunk in different and erratic proportions, making re-alignment impossible. As such, significant amounts of computer assisted coloration were necessary. Although the results are not noticeable on viewing the film, some elements were as many as eight generations away from the original negative, in particular the entire [...] "Judy's Apartment" [...] sequence, which is perhaps the most pivotal sequence in the entire film. When such large portions of re-creation become necessary, then the danger of artistic license by the restorers becomes an issue, and the restorers received some criticism for their re-creation of colors that allegedly did not honor the director's and cinematographer's intentions. The restoration team argued that they did research on the colors used in the original locations, cars, wardrobe, and skin tones. One breakthrough moment came when the Ford Motor Company supplied a well-preserved green paint sample for a car used in the film. As the use of the color green in the film has artistic importance, matching a shade of green was a stroke of luck for restoration and provided a reference shade.|$|R
60|$|Then {{machinery}} {{came into}} the lives of men, and steam power, and there began that change of scale which is going on still to-day, making an ever-widening <b>separation</b> of <b>master</b> and man and an ever-enlarging organization of industry and social method. Its most striking manifestation was at first the substitution of organized manufacture in factories for the half-domestic hand-industrialism of the earlier period; the growth of the fortunes of some of the merchants and manufacturers to dimensions comparable with the wealth of the great landowners, and the sinking of the rest of their class towards the status of wage-earners. The development of joint-stock enterprise arose concurrently with this to create a new sort of partnership capable of handling far greater concerns than any single wealthy person, as wealth was measured by the old scale, could do. There followed a great development of transit, culminating for a time in the coming of the railways and steamships, which abolished the isolation of the old towns and brought men at the remotest quarters of the earth into business competition. Big towns of the modern type, with half-a-million inhabitants or more, grew up rapidly all over Europe and America. For the European big towns are as modern as New York, and the East End and south side of London scarcely older than Chicago. Shopkeeping, like manufactures, began to concentrate in large establishments, and big wholesale distribution to replace individual buying and selling. As the need for public education under the changing conditions of life grew more and more urgent, the individual enterprise of this school-master and that gave place to the organized effort of such giant societies as (in Britain) the old National School Society and the British School Society, and at last to State education. And one after another the old prosperous middle-class callings fell under the stress of the new development.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{a new approach}} for multisatellite state modelling: the Master-Slave approach. By this concept slave satellites are modelled according to an existing master, whereas the correlation between multiple slaves is omitted. Master-Slave is therefore a generic name for a state modelling concept, for which different realisations are possible. As a possible realisation we present the Conditional Assembling Method. For modelling of only two satellites (one master and one slave), the Conditional Assembling Method enables an accurate resimulation of the correlation coefficient between the satellites and the probabilities of single and combined states. Based on this condition, the performance of Master-Slave for three, four, and five satellites is evaluated in terms of state probability modelling. Therefore, the correlation coefficients and the all bad-state probabilities with Master-Slave are compared with the measurements for different elevation angles and azimuth angle separations of the multisatellite system. Master-Slave has a high modelling error in case of small azimuth separation between the slave satellites (except that one slave has a small azimuth <b>separation</b> to the <b>master).</b> Furthermore, a master satellite with a high elevation provides a lower probability error compared to a master with low elevation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Engineering Sciences (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Zirconium metal (Zr) {{is highly}} {{desirable}} as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods in nuclear power plants, {{because of its}} very low nuclear absorption cross-section for thermal neutrons, however to use this Zr metal {{it has to be}} purified (< 100 ppm) from the contained (1 â€“ 3 % wt) hafnium metal (Hf), occurs in zircon ore (ZrSiO 4) in nature. Because of the extensive beach deposits, rich in zircon minerals, located along the South African coasts, there is a great opportunity for zircon beneficiation in South Africa to convert the country's mineral output into high added value products rather than selling the basic mineral to countries like China. Due to the significantly similar chemical properties of these two elements, the purification of the Zr metal is a complicated process. The separation of Zr and Hf, as currently practiced, is mostly conducted through solvent extraction in which the aqueous chloride solution of metal species is contacted with an immiscible organic phase containing a reagent that selectively removes one of the two metals from the aqueous phase. The conventional multi-stage industrial approach, in production since the 1950 s, presented several technological disadvantages and environmental problems that were considered acceptable when these processes were developed, but have become a serious problem as legislation became more stringent. Thus, the main objective for this study is to develop an innovative, environmentally friendly and cost-efficient solvent-extraction process that makes use of Hf-containing Zr compounds, produced by NECSA (Pty) Ltd from zircon ore by means of plasma technology, for the separation of Zr and Hf in order to produce nuclear-grade Zr metal. Results obtained from this study show that the extraction of Zr and Hf from chloride-based compounds (Zr(Hf) CI 4) proceeds via an anion-exchange mechanism through the extraction with amine extractants (Alamine 336 and Aliquat 336), while the Zr species could be successfully recovered from the organic solutions. However, the extraction from fluoride-based compounds (K 2 Zr(Hf) F 6) was unsuccessful for both Zr and Hf species. The new proposed process for Zr and Hf separation from chloride-based Zr compounds seems to be an improvement from the conventional <b>separation</b> processes. <b>Master...</b>|$|R

I {{do this in the}} context of explicating the construction of a public history concerning Aboriginal Australian child separations over the 20 th century, and in particular as it arose in the 1990 s as a social problem. Particular attention is given to knowledge construction practices around the Australian National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal Children from Their Families (1996 - 1997) and the related Bringing Them Home Oral History Project (1998 - 2002). The once separated children have {{come to be known as}} The Stolen Generation(s) in public discourse and have been represented as sharing a common experience as well as reasons for the <b>separations.</b> Against the <b>master</b> narrative of common experience and discussion of the reasons for it, this thesis raises the problematic that knowledge is grounded in particular times and places, and also that many people who are differently related and who have experiences which contain many differences as well as similarities end up being represented as though saying the same thing. Through an institutional ethnography grounded in explicating the social organising activities which produced the Bringing Them Home Oral History Project, I examine how institutional relations coordinate the multiplicity and variability of peopleâ€™s experiences through a textually-mediated project with a focused concern regarding the knowing subject, ideology, accounts, texts and analytical mapping. Through this I show how ruling relations are implicated in constructing what is known about the Aboriginal child separation histories, and more generally how experience, memory, the telling of a life and the making of public history are embedded in social organising practices...|$|R

Even today in Odisha, these two crafts are combined inone and these artists and known as Chitrakaras, their title remains mostly Mohapatra or Maharana. Strangely enough, painting appeared in Odisha rather later, several centuries after the construction of the great temples of Bhubaneswar, Puri and Konark.here exists a good number of paintings from 18th century onwards in many temples and Mathas especially in the southern districts of Odisha. Lord Jagannath in the present from is being taken as the origin of the Patta style. The colour schemes of the deities of Puri are quite {{similar to those of the}} Patta style. The oldest record of Patta Paintings does not probably go beyond the establishment of the present shrine of Shri Jagannath at Puri. It may be due to the fact that paintings do not survive like sculptures. The paints inside the shrines of Lord Jagannath at Puri make the date probable. The oldest classical marble paintings of Sitabanji at Keonjhar do not conform to the present style of Patta painting wholly. The wooden statues of the three deities are also covered with cloth and then overlaid with glue mixed with chalk, and then given paint only with four limited colours of red, yellow, white and black. The deities who are held in high esteem by the Oriyas and who inspire religion, life and activity of the people also carry with them a {{tradition of}} art and painting which is as old as the deities themselves. If the Savara origin of Jagannath is accepted, the date of the Patta paintings can be dated back to an earlier period. These paintings were originally substitutes for worship on days when the temple doors were shut for the 'ritual bath' of the deity.|$|R
40|$|SAR Interferometry (InSAR) {{is a well}} {{established}} remote sensing technique widely employed for the retrieval of topographic information. The relative vertical accuracy of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generated through InSAR techniques depends, among other factors, on the spatial <b>separation</b> between <b>master</b> and slave sensors and on the signal correlation between both datasets. In monostatic single-pass configurations, master and slave data are acquired simultaneously by sensors mounted on the same platform. As a consequence, the single-pass interferogram does not present temporal decorrelation and is less affected by spatially correlated artifacts. However, the fixed baseline limits the achievable relative vertical accuracy. On the other hand, repeat-pass configurations offer a flexible choice of baseline enabling the retrieval of very fine elevation measurements, provided that the temporal decorrelation can be kept small. Nevertheless, since the datasets are acquired independently, the interferograms are subject to artifacts due to, e. g., aircraft motion or propagation in the inhomogeneous atmosphere. Hence, the extraction of precise terrain information from repeat-pass data requires an accurate phase calibration, i. e., the removal of all undesired phase biases. In this thesis, the joint use of single- and repeat-pass datasets in a multi-mode configuration is proposed in order {{to profit from the}} stability of the single-pass derived DEMs in relation to spatially correlated artifacts, {{as well as from the}} robustness to noise associated with large baseline acquisitions. As the large-baseline interferometric phase is highly sensitive to the unknown topography and to systems errors and other artifacts, large phase variations between neighboring pixels are observed. The former in association with elevated noise can compromise the phase unwrapping, thus preventing the retrieval of accurate height measurements. In order to overcome this limitation and to promote a robust phase calibration, the use of data simultaneously acquired with an additional carrier frequency is proposed. Hence, the final DEM is extracted from a Dual-Frequency and Dual-Baseline (DFDB) dataset with the help of new algorithms developed for the proposed configuration. Specifically, a method for the mitigation of artifacts in the single-pass data due to multiple reflections in the aircraft is suggested. Furthermore, a dual-channel region-growing algorithm is proposed for efficient phase unwrapping. An active-contour-based unwrapping error correction strategy is developed for the treatment of residual errors associated with challenging terrain characteristics. A DFDB framework is proposed for the calibration of residual constant and linear baseline errors and global phase offsets, including alternatives in the complex domain and considering the use of external reference data. Finally, the joint estimation of the underlying topographic information is discussed and the problem of the correction of spatially correlated artifacts in the repeat-pass data and noise reduction are tackled. All developed algorithms are validated with DFDB data acquired with the F-SAR sensor during two campaigns in Germany: the first over tidal flats in the Jade Bight, North Sea; and the second over a calibration test-site in Kaufbeuren. In both cases, the proposed methodology allows the generation of elevation models with relative and absolute vertical accuracies in the order of centimeters. Lastly, the developed phase unwrapping framework is applied to TanDEM-X large-baseline data, demonstrating the use of the algorithm for single-pass spaceborne datasets with multiple acquisitions...|$|R

Here he dwelt for some weeks in profound melancholy. Being unable to stand <b>separation</b> from his <b>master</b> any longer, he ventured to return to the village, but was immediately hunted out of it, and once again fled in horror to the hills. Jarwin was not allowed to quit the village alone, he therefore never saw his little dog, and at length {{came to the conclusion that}} it had been killed. When, however, he had ingratiated himself with his master, he was allowed more freedom, and one day, having wandered a considerable distance into the mountains, he came suddenly and unexpectedly upon Cuffy. Having experienced nothing from man of late but the most violent and cruel treatment, Cuffy no sooner beheld, as he supposed, one of his enemies, than, without giving him a second glance, he sprang up, put his ears back, his tail between his legs, and, uttering a terrible yell, fled [...] "on the wings of terror!" [...] But Jarwin put two fingers in his mouth and gave a peculiarly shrill whistle, which brought the dog to a sudden stop. He looked back with ears cocked. Again Jarwin whistled. Instantly Cuffy turned and ran at him with a series of mingled yells, whines, and barks, that gave but a faint idea of his tumultuous feelings. It would scarcely be too much to say that he almost ate his master up. He became like an india-rubber ball gone mad! He bounded round him to such an extent that Jarwin found it very difficult to get hold of or pat him. It is impossible to do justice to such a meeting. We draw a veil over it, only remarking that the sailor took his old favourite back to the village, and, after much entreaty and a good deal of persuasive song, was permitted to keep him.|$|R

This <b>masterâ€™s</b> thesis {{has focused on}} testing and optimization of polyvinylamine/polyvinylalcohol (PVAm/PVA) blend fixed-site-carrier (FSC) membranes on polysulfone supports for separation of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4). Permeation tests, process simulation and cost estimation were applied to evaluate CO 2 /CH 4 separation performance and process feasibility for biogas upgrading. Utilization of biogas as a natural gas substitute or as vehicle fuel can contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Orthogonal experimental design (OED) was employed to study the influences of membrane preparation conditions on the transport properties of flat sheet PVAm/PVA blend FSC membranes. The conjoint analysis method was applied for the statistical analysis of OED results using SPSS software, {{and the importance of}} the investigated membrane preparation condition parameters on the CO 2 /CH 4 separation performance was found to be: polymer concentration in casting solution > heat treatment temperature > heat treatment duration > content of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in polymer. The optimized membrane preparation conditions in the interval investigated were: 1 wt% polymer in the casting solution, containing 3 wt% of CNTs, heat-treated at 105 Â°C for 0. 5 h. It was found that a membrane with a very thin selective layer (375 nm) was able to achieve both high CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity and CO 2 permeance. Reinforcing the PVAm/PVA membrane with CNTs was investigated, but no significant effect was found within the range of investigation. SEM analysis has shown that CNTs gathers in large aggregates, and that an even distribution of well-dispersed CNTs is needed to secure a defect free selective layer. Permeation tests were performed in an advanced mixed gas permeation rig and operating conditions were optimized on the basis of OED and conjoint analysis by SPSS software. The relative importance of the operating condition parameters investigated in this work was in the following order: relative humidity > sweep gas flow rate > feed gas pressure > feed gas flow rate. The optimized operating conditions were found at a feed gas pressure of 2 bar with a relative humidity of 80 % and a feed gas flow rate and sweep gas flow rate at 12. 3 cm 3 /s and 0. 18 cm 3 /s, respectively. CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 31 with a CO 2 permeance of 0. 16 m 3 (STP) /(m 2. h. bar) was obtained at optimized conditions. A conceptual design of a biogas upgrading process with a feed gas flow rate at 300 Nm 3 /h (60 vol% CH 4 and 40 vol% CO 2) was conducted. Two different process designs with a feed gas pressure of 2 and 5 bar were simulated in UniSim. In a two-stage membrane module separation system with recycle it was possible to purify biogas up to 99. 3 vol% CH 4 (vehicle fuel quality), and obtain a CH 4 recovery of 98 %. The total membrane area was reduced a lot by increasing the feed gas pressure from 2 to 5 bar. The capital cost of the most promising process design was estimated to US$ 4. 622 million, and the running costs were estimated to be US$ 0. 603 /Nm 3 upgraded biogas. The total membrane area was 7900 m 2. The most important economic parameter for upgrading biogas is the price of upgraded biogas as vehicle fuel, and a price of US$ 1. 22 /Nm 3 is necessary to secure a positive net present value of the project after 10 years. </p...|$|R
40|$|Most of the easily {{accessible}} offshore {{oil and gas}} resources have been developed. As a result of this, subsea production and processing has {{over the last decade}} been regarded as the future of the offshore oil and gas industry. Operators are moving into more complex environments and remote locations. The increased water depths and lower temperatures implies that the existing subsea technology is in constant need of innovation. Through the Center of Innovation-Driven Research (SFI) SUBPRO (Subsea Production and Processing), which is a cooperation between NTNU and several companies in the oil and gas industry, the industry partners expressed an interest in compact separation technology, especially hydrocyclones and Compact Flotation Units (CFUs). Since the large vessels used in conventional subsea separation technology are limited by both hydrostatic pressure and installation complexity, compact separation technology is considered a necessity for operating at greater water depths. Because of their limited volume and short residence time, compact separators are sensitive towards flow irregularities. Flow irregularities are changes in pressure and flow rate that occurs naturally in a well stream, or during start up and shut down of a well. These irregularities can potentially {{have a negative impact on}} separation efficiency. Avoiding or suppressing the effects of these flow irregularities is some of the current challenges in compact <b>separation</b> design. This <b>Master</b> s thesis describes the design of a compact separator laboratory that will facil- itate research on novel control algorithms. The design is based on a multi-stage hydrocyclone system, with three hydrocyclones in series. The laboratory focuses on produced water treat- ment, and aims to meet the governmental regulations for disposal of produced water to the sea. By developing new aspects in control theory, the control algorithms aim to solve the problems related to flow irregularities in compact separation. As a result, the design includes several fast acting control valves, pressure- and temperature transmitters, and flow meters to provide a continuous real time overview of the system. Oil-in-Water (OiW) sensors are in- cluded to monitor the OiW concentration, and act as an input to the control system. Low shear control valves are also included in order to compare the impact on separation efficiency with conventional control valves. The compact separator laboratory is designed and constructed through four individual phases. An additional phase, containing a feeding and reservoir system, has also been de- signed. The phases are implemented based on the experience and requirements of the previous phase/phases. The last of the four phases focuses on future solutions, and is not implemented in the budget. The main focus of this thesis is the specific design of Phase 1, but in order to account for future expansions and increased flexibility, Phase 2, 3 and 4 are included in the design. Technical future proofing is applied in the design of Phase 1 to ease the implementation of the later phases. Phase 1 will be connected to a Cameron feeding system, with both a gravity separator and oil- and water pumps. Phase 1 is designed with EX certified components to allow testing with crude oils, which increases the credibility of the results. The additional phase, a reservoir and a feeding pump system, are designed in detail to allow fast implementation if the Cameron feeding system proves to be disadvantageous for the separation results. The total budget for the design, construction and operation of the compact separator lab- oratory is NOK 3, 000, 000. The proposed design is within the budget and has an economical safety factor of 1. 50 %. The health, environment and safety aspects has influenced the entire design process, and all chosen process equipment has a safety factor of 1. 6 with respect to operating pressure.
