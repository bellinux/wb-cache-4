We begin by examining a recently reported, highly decomposable algorithm for contour <b>surface</b> display <b>generation.</b> We establish {{a piece of the}} total algorithm as the algorithm component. The algorithm component is that part of the algorithm that can be executed in parallel, independently from the computations performed on any other algorithm subpart. We propose an architecture for the algorithm component, and model that architecture {{in order to determine the}} real-time capability of the algorithm. We then model the larger system of multiple algorithm component processors. This modeling effort is performed with respect to a particular application requiring real-time contour <b>surface</b> display <b>generation.</b> A VSLI feasibility computation is then performed on the proposed architecture.

Here a rich domain theory, i.e., a natural language grammar---although neither perfect nor complete, is tuned to a particular application or particular language usage, using a treebank (training examples). Rayner pioneered this work. The first successful industrial application was to a commercial NL interface to relational databases. The method has been successfully applied to several large-scale natural language parsing system, where the utility problem was solved by omitting the original grammar (domain theory) and using specialized LR-parsing techniques, resulting in huge speed-ups, at a cost in coverage, but with a gain in disambiguation.EBL-like techniques have also been applied to <b>surface</b> <b>generation,</b> the converse of parsing.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{samples are}} hybridized to a primer immobilized on a flow cell for sequencing, {{so it is}} usually {{necessary}} to generate a nucleic acid with an end compatible for hybridization to those surfaces. The target sequence attached to the flow cell surface could, in theory, be any sequence which can be synthesized, but, in practice, the standard commercially available flow cell is oligo(dT)50. To be compatible with the oligo(dT)50 primer on the flow cell surface, {{it is necessary to}} generate a poly(dA) tail of at least 50 nt at the 3’ end of the molecule to be sequenced. Because the fill and lock step will fill in excess A’s but not excess T’s, it is desirable for the A tail to be at least as long as oligo(dT) on the <b>surface.</b> <b>Generation</b> of a 3’ poly(dA) tail can be accomplished with a variety of different ligases or polymerases. If there is sufficient DNA to measure both mass and average length, it is possible to determine the proper amount of dATP to be added to generate poly(dA) tails 90 to 200 nucleotides long. To generate tails of this length, it is first necessary to estimate how many 3’ ends there are in the sample and then use the right ratio of DNA, dATP, and terminal transferase to obtain the optimal size range of tails.|$|E

Oliaei and Karpat [16] investigated the influence of machining parameters on the surface roughness of stainless steel machining. Bissacco et al. [17] studied the size effects on <b>surface</b> <b>generation</b> by ball nose and flat end micro milling of hardened tool steel, and the effects of the increased ratio between cutting edge radius and chip thickness have been observed. Sun et al. [18] studied the relationship among the surface roughness, the feed per tooth, as well as the cutter geometry. Li et al. [19] proposed a trajectory-based surface roughness model for micro-end-milling and proven capable of capturing the minimum chip thickness, micro tool geometry and process parameters. Based on this model, a surface roughness model with tool wear effect is developed by taking the material removal volume and cutting velocity into account and is experimentally validated. Weule et al. [20] investigated <b>surface</b> <b>generation</b> in micro-end-milling of steel and concluded that the surface roughness had the increasing trend when the feed rate was smaller than the cutting edge radius.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental investigation which attempts {{to provide a}} better scientific understanding of the material removal characteristics and <b>surface</b> <b>generation</b> in bonnet polishing. The experimental results reveal that the material removal is shared by the polishing pad and the abrasives trapped in the pad-workpiece interface, and the abrasive wear is dominated significantly by plastic removal mode of abrasive particles, while the material removal caused by the polishing pad should be mitigated {{in order to obtain}} super mirror finished surfaces. The <b>surface</b> <b>generation</b> is found to be a linearly cumulative effect of dwell time together with the constant material removal rate under the identical polishing condition. Hence, a multi-scale material removal model and a <b>surface</b> <b>generation</b> model have been built based on the contact mechanics, kinematics theory, abrasive wear mechanism, as well as the relative and cumulative removal process of <b>surface</b> <b>generation</b> in bonnet polishing. The models are verified through a series of spot and pattern polishing experiments. Based on the results of spot polishing experiments, the multi-scale material removal model is found to predict well for the material removal characteristics under various polishing conditions. The simulated patterns by the <b>surface</b> <b>generation</b> model are found to agree well with the measured patterns in the pattern polishing experiments which substantiate that the relative and cumulative removal process is a key <b>surface</b> <b>generation</b> mechanism in bonnet polishing.
