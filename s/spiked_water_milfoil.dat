25|$|The River Hull valley {{dominates the}} western {{landscape}} of Holderness. The river {{and its associated}} wetland habitats support a diverse range of plants and animals. The upper tributaries of the river originate {{on the edge of}} the Yorkshire Wolds before entering the area of glacial and alluvial deposits of Holderness. The river bed varies in composition reflecting the underlying geology. In the upper reaches of the river water crowfoot, lesser water parsnip, mares tail and <b>spiked</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> may be found in the main channel whilst the marginal vegetation is composed of branched bur-reed, common reed and reed sweetgrass.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} plant of {{the waters}} edge is reed canary grass running from the East round to the South and into the West side. Creeping bent, reed sweet grass and iris are abundant. Common water-crowfoot, chara species, Canadian waterweed, slender spike-rush, perfoliate pondweed and <b>spiked</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> are the other main species present.|$|E
50|$|The pond lies in {{the centre}} of Thijsse's Hof, and plays an {{important}} role, {{from the point of}} view of garden architecture, as well as {{from the point of view}} of the ecological value. It attracts many bird species and insects, like dragonflies. In the water several plants are growing, like <b>spiked</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil,</b> mare's tail and fringed water lily.|$|E
5000|$|Myriophyllum verticillatum, the whorl-leaf watermilfoil or whorled water-milfoil, is {{a native}} {{to much of the}} North America, North Africa, and Eurasia. It closely resembles another native <b>milfoil,</b> called {{northern}} <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> (M. sibiricum) [...] Whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> is also easily confused with four types of invasive milfoils: Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> (M. spicatum), Variable water-milfoil (M. heterophyllum), Parrot feather (M. aquaticum), and hybrid <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> (M. heterophyllum X M. laxum).|$|R
50|$|The {{best way}} to {{identify}} whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> (M. verticillatum) is by looking at its {{two different types of}} leaves. The first type is the submersed leave, which looks feathery and contain about 5 to 14 leaflet pairs per leaf. The whorls along the stem contain about 4 to 5 leaves, which are spaced about 1 cm apart. The other type is known as the emergent leaves. These leaves occur on the emergent spike and are pinnately lobed. From June till September whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> produces flowers and fruits above or at the water's surface on erect spikes along the emergent leaves. The emergent leaves are typically two or more times longer than the flowers and fruits. Another way to distinguish whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> is to look for turions, winter buds that appear toward the end of its growing season. This milfoil is one of a few that produce turions. This characteristic can also rule out other types of <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> that lack turions such as Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil,</b> parrot feather, hybrid <b>water</b> <b>milfoil,</b> and low <b>water</b> <b>milfoil.</b> The turions of this milfoil look like long yellowish-green club-shaped buds with small stiff leaves attached to the submerged stem. In the spring after dormancy the small, thick, dark green turions expand and grow from the stem. As the plant develops roots and continues to grow, the larger green summer leaves are produced {{at the tip of the}} plant. Turion leaves can be seen at the base of the plant sometimes into July. In fall the turions, with some other plant material, often break away from the majority of the rooted plant and float to new areas. Those fragments can be found washing up along shorelines in late fall. The stems of the whorled <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> form into mats from branched and unbranched stems that grow to be 20 to 100 inches long.|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing {{has rarely}} {{been used as a}} tool to map and monitor {{submerged}} aquatic vegetation (SAV) in rivers, due to a combination of insufficient spatial resolution of available image data and strong attenuation of light in water through absorption and scattering. The latter process reduces the possibility to use spectral reflectance information to accurately classify submerged species. However, increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) image data may enable the use of shape and texture features to help discriminate between species by taking an object based image analysis (OBIA) approach, and overcome some of the present limitations. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of using optical remote sensing for the detection and mapping of SAV. It firstly looked at the possibilities to discriminate submerged macrophyte species based on spectral information only. Reflectance spectra of three macrophyte species were measured in situ across a range of submergence depths. The results showed that water depth will be a limiting factor for the classification of species from remote sensing images. Only <b>Spiked</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Milfoil</b> (Myriophyllum spicatum) was indicated as spectrally distinct through ANOVA analysis, but subsequent Jeffries–Matusita distance analysis did not confirm this.

50|$|Myriophyllum sibiricum is {{a species}} of <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> known by the common names shortspike watermilfoil, {{northern}} watermilfoil, and Siberian water-milfoil.

It is lined with whorls of fanlike green leaves divided into many narrow, feathery lobes. The erect inflorescence is a spike of small flowers up to 8 cm long which grows above the water's surface.|$|R
30|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} The use of plant {{protection}} products is common practice in modern agriculture and forestry. Their use, however, may result in risks for the environment because even correct application can not always prevent a possible contamination of the off-field environment. A contamination of surface waters may occur through driftage, precipitation, run-off and drainage from treated surfaces. Dicotyledonous macrophytes {{are not part of}} the initial risk assessment of {{plant protection products}} in the aquatic environment although they are an important part of the ecosystem. This paper presents a standardised single-phase test system with the dicotyledonous <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> Myriophyllum spicatum (Haloragaceae).|$|R

50|$|Rice is {{the main}} aquatic plant grown for human food, but smaller areas of {{watercress}} and water chestnut are also cultivated. In their native environments, aquatic weeds {{are part of a}} balanced ecosystem, and it is mainly introduced species of water plant that become invasive and cause problems by congesting water bodies. The worst culprits, found in both temperate and tropical waterways, are floating plants such as water hyacinth, water lettuce and Salvinia, fully submerged rooting plants such as Hydrilla and <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> and rooting plants that reach the surface such as cattail, papyrus, bulrush and reed.|$|R
50|$|Eurasian watermilfoil has slender stems up to 175 cm long. The {{submerged}} leaves (usually between 15-35 mm long) are borne in pinnate whorls of four, {{with numerous}} thread-like leaflets roughly 4-13 mm long. Plants are monoecious with flowers {{produced in the}} leaf axils (male above, female below) on a spike 5-15 cm long held vertically above the water surface, each flower inconspicuous, orange-red, 4-6 mm long. Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> has 12- 21 pairs of leaflets while northern watermilfoil M. sibiricum only has 5-9 pairs. The two can hybridize and the resulting hybrid plants can cause taxonomic confusion as leaf characters are intermediate and can overlap with parent species.|$|R
