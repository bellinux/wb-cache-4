5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the <b>storable</b> oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more <b>storable</b> than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into <b>storable</b> and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E

25|$|Nitrogen tetroxide {{is used as}} an {{oxidizer}} in one of {{the more}} important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature. In early 1944 research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by German scientists, although the Nazis only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for S-Stoff (fuming nitric acid). It became the <b>storable</b> oxidizer of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. It is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel. One of the earliest uses of this combination was on the Titan family of rockets used originally as ICBMs and then as launch vehicles for many spacecraft. Used on the U.S. Gemini and Apollo spacecraft and also on the Space Shuttle, it continues to be used as stationkeeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites, and many deep-space probes.|$|E

The cuisine is diverse, with Northern European, Central European, Central Asian, Siberian, East Asian and Middle Eastern influences as Russia is by area the largest country in the world.

Moreover, it is necessary to divide Russian traditional cuisine and Soviet cuisine, which has its own peculiarity. Its foundations were laid by the peasant food of the rural population in an often harsh climate, with a combination of plentiful fish, pork, poultry, caviar, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of rye, wheat, barley and millet provided the ingredients for a plethora of breads, pancakes, pies, cereals, beer and vodka.

2500|$|Coal Pollution Mitigation is {{a process}} whereby coal is {{chemically}} washed of minerals and impurities, sometimes gasified, burned and the resulting flue gases treated with steam, {{with the purpose of}} removing sulfur dioxide, and reburned so as to make the carbon dioxide in the flue gas economically recoverable, and <b>storable</b> underground (the latter of which is called [...] "carbon capture and storage"). The coal industry uses the term [...] "clean coal" [...] to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation and use, but has provided no specific quantitative limits on any emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. Whereas contaminants like sulfur or mercury can be removed from coal, carbon cannot be effectively removed while still leaving a usable fuel, and clean coal plants without carbon sequestration and storage do not significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. James Hansen in an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama has advocated a [...] "moratorium and phase-out of coal plants that do not capture and store CO2".

2500|$|To {{some extent}} the Rashaida {{alleviate}} these discrepancies by processing milk {{that is not}} needed by the calf or for immediate human consumption into <b>storable</b> products. Unprocessed camel milk remains fit for consumption for four to five days, although its acidity increases significantly during this period. It can be processed into {{two different types of}} product with practically unlimited [...] "shelf-life" [...] by very simple procedures. Milk may be turned into butter (zibde) by shaking it in a goatskin or other container for about one hour. Through heating, zibde turns into zamin (clarified butter or ghee) which is then used as cooking fat or eaten with sorghum porridge or bread. The other milk product described by the Rashaida is madhur, made by boiling sour milk until it coagulates. The clotted substance is then drained through a piece of gauze, formed into balls and sun-dried. In this form milk stores for almost indefinite periods and can be reconstituted during droughts or the dry season by pulverizing and adding water. Since it is often held that camel milk does not lend itself to butter or cheese production, these practices of the Rashaida are noteworthy. However, because the women and smallstock are usually separated from the camel herds during the rainy season when milk yields are abundant, only a small proportion of the milk is processed.|$|E
