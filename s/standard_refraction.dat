The focus is on Castelleone, where a seismic station of the Italian National Seismic Network has been deployed since 2009. To define a detailed shear-wave velocity (VS) profile, extensive active and passive geophysical surveys were carried out. The active measurements included seismic profiles examined through <b>standard</b> <b>refraction</b> techniques and multichannel analysis of surface waves. The passive methods included ambient vibrationmeasurements in both single and array configurations. In particular, three microtremor arrays with increasing apertures were performed to capture the experimental dispersion curve down to 0. 2 Hz. The horizontal- to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) showed two main peaks, at 0. 17 and 0. 70 Hz. A joint inversion of the experimental phase-velocity dispersion and HVSR curves was performed to obtain the VS profile. The data show two main discontinuities at ~ 160 and 1350 m in depth. According to the Italian and European seismic codes, the shallow VS discontinuity can be ascribed to the seismic bedrock (i. e., VS > 800 m=s), whereas the deeper one is observed at the transition between Pliocene-Quaternary deposits and Miocene marls. Preliminary site-specific seismic-hazard analysis in terms of displacement response spectra for periods up to 10 s shows that neglecting the effects of the deeper discontinuity implies underestimation in hazard estimates of up to about 49 % for mean return period (MRP) of 475 years and about 57 % for MRP of 2475 years, with possible consequences regarding the design of very tall buildings and large bridges...|$|E

40|$|Passive {{refraction}} microtremor (ReMi) surveys utilize standard field seismic-refraction {{recording equipment}} and linear geophone arrays to record ambient background noise owing to microtremors caused by natural and anthropogenic activities. The technique relies upon {{the detection of}} coherent phases of Rayleigh waves that have propagated along the axis of the geophone array, {{which is the same}} mode of propagation that causes ground roll on <b>standard</b> <b>refraction</b> surveys. Rayleigh-wave propagation is confined within one wavelength of the surface, causing dispersion because waves with longer wavelengths (lower frequencies) are controlled by ground stiffness and density properties at greater depths. Field records that include coherent modes of dispersive Rayleigh-wave propagation along the field array are processed using slowness (reciprocal of the phase velocity) –frequency transformations to extract the phase velocity–frequency dispersion curves. A series of dispersion curves are extracted by processing the field records of sub-groups including 6 – 8 geophones, from which 1 D shear-wave velocity–depth profiles are constructed and attributed to the centre of each array sub-group. In this survey, nine overlapping sub-groups of eight geophones were selected along the whole field array of 24 geophones equi-spaced over 69 m. A 2 D shear-wave velocity section was created by infilling a grid between each of the velocity–depth profiles using an anisotropic inverse distance weighting algorithm. Interpretation of the 2 D section included the identification of: (1) reworked ground comprising colliery spoil and clay to around 5 m below ground level associated with shear-wave velocities from 100 to 700 m s− 1; (2) deeper strata within the host formation associated with higher velocities that increased with depth to above 1000 m s− 1 at depths below 10 m; (3) a backfilled mineshaft and a backfilled sandstone quarry at depths below 7 m associated with low-velocity perturbations within the background host velocity structure. Key recommendations from this case study include the use of low-frequency geophones to increase the depth of investigation and recording of high frequencies at reduced geophone spacings to increase near-surface resolution. ...|$|E

However, application of transmission IR spectroscopy to aqueous systems is only of limited value due to the very strong water absorption. The necessity of very short pathlengths to obtain quantitative spectra is accompanied by very low reproducibility of the spectra obtained in such a way. However, in the last two decades, a reliable procedure which allows the calculation of optical constants [real n and imaginary k part of the complex refraction index n] from the spectra obtained by use of the attenuated total reflection (ATR) techniquepATR, has enabled a very accurate quantitative IR spectroscopy of liquid systems containing water. The use of calibrated infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy is discussed in the present work. The paper is organised as follows. After a short introduction, a theoretical clarification of processes corresponding to the attenuated total reflection is given. Here, an analysis of the processthrough Fresnel equations is followed by the discussion of the specific terms, such as effective number of reflections and penetration depth. In these terms, the difference between spectra obtained by transmission A and by ATR pATR was explained, specifying also the relation, through optical constants n and k, between these two forms of the IR spectra of the same system. The next section discusses the most reliable and up-to-date method for determining the optical constants of the ATR spectra, provided by Bertie and Lan (J. E. Bertie, Z. Lan, J. Chem. Phys. 105 (1996) 8502). This method calculates optical constants from s-polarised ATR spectra by a modified Kramers-Krönig transform of the reflectance Rs to the phase shift on reflection Θs. However, the method is developed only for the specific conditions of the ATR experiment, i. e. for CIRCLE cell, with a 45 ° incident angle and with equal intensities of s- and p-polarised light.

METHODS: Subjective refraction was carried out on 448 cycloplegic eyes and compared with cycloplegic readings with the Allergan Humphrey 500 autorefractor (448 eyes) and the Nidek AR- 1000 autorefractor (160 eyes). Each refraction was followed by clinical visual acuity measurement. The study population comprised 224 healthy students, 107 men and 117 women, {{with a mean age of}} 20. 6 (SD 1. 1) years. RESULTS: Both the Nidek and Humphrey autorefractors measured more negative or less positive refractive values compared with subjective refraction and these biases were statistically significant (Humphrey right eye - 0. 23 D, p = 0. 0001, left eye - 0. 20 D, p = 0. 0001), (Nidek right eye - 0. 13 D, p = 0. 0001, left eye - 0. 11 D, p = 0. 0002). Comparing the results of autorefraction with subjective refraction, the Nidek was better than the Humphrey autorefractor in several ways: a smaller mean difference, better agreement between spherical equivalent values, narrower limits of agreements, and better visual acuity obtained with the autorefraction. On the other hand, the Humphrey autorefractor agreed better with subjective refraction concerning cylinder axis.

40|$|Puropse]: In some eyes, aberrometric {{measurements}} of the refractive error can differ by more than 1 diopter from <b>standard</b> subjective <b>refraction.</b> We aim to understand the reasons for these discrepancies and to study the role of both amplitude (irregular or inhomogeneous pupil transmission) and phase (aberrations) of the wavefront. [Methods]: The spherical equivalent was measured by different subjective, objective, and aberrometric methods in a population of 177 eyes. We first analyzed the degree of correlation between the outcomes of the different methods. Then we analyzed cases showing the highest discrepancies (> 1 diopter) between subjective and aberrometric spherical equivalent. The refractive error sensing method was generalized and applied here to include the effect of inhomogeneous pupil transmittance (Stiles-Crawford effect) and irregular pupil shapes on refractive error. [Results]: Objective and aberrometric methods showed a strong correlation with subjective methods (R 2 > 0. 89 in all cases). However, individual data points may show large discrepancies. Several eyes with discrepancies of 1 D or even 2 D usually presented higher values of higher-order aberration (mainly coma and/or spherical aberration) than average, which may cause these eyes to have a natural bifocal (or even multifocal) optical performance. Refractive error sensing analysis suggests that this multifocal performance could explain the high objective-subjective discrepancies found in these eyes. Nevertheless, the Stiles-Crawford effect (or irregular pupils) can substantially modify the energy distribution, tending to minimize multifocal effects, thus minimizing discrepancies between aberrometric and subjective refraction. [Conclusions]: Discrepancies between aberrometric and subjective refraction may appear in aberrated eyes when aberrometric methods ignore {{the impact of the}} wavefront amplitude (inhomogeneous or irregular pupil transmittance.) The generalized refractive error sensing proposed here seems promising and able to provide a reliable clinical refraction in monofocal and multifocal eyes.

Method: This study used the Night Sight Meter for assessment of the night vision thresholds, glare vision thresholds and glare  recovery times of individuals who had had LASIK at least one year before commencement of the study.   The inclusion criteria were post-surgical interval following LASIK of at least one year and willingness to participate in the study.   The exclusion criteria included previous ocular surgery other than LASIK, current ocular disease and any systemic illnesses.    One hundred subjects were selected from participating ophthalmologists’ records, using convenience sampling, at different post-operative periods that ranged from 12 to 57 months.   Other refractive findings taken included post-LASIK visual acuity measured using the Snellen Visual Acuity chart and post-LASIK refractive error, measured with the <b>standard</b> subjective <b>refraction</b> tests which included duochrome, Jackson crossed-cylinder and Humphrey’s Immediate Contrast test, which are used for comparison in this study. Results: Post-operatively, the majority of the eyes (89. 2 %) were classified as having ‘poor’ night vision thresholds.   A similar trend was observed {{in the case of the}} glare vision thresholds as 84. 7 % of the eyes fell into the classification of below average.   The degree of pre-operative myopia appears to have an effect on the post-LASIK night vision and glare  thresholds.   Only glare recovery  time was not affected as 51. 2 % of the subjects displayed good recovery times. Conclusion: This study suggests that the post-LASIK myope has difficulty with night vision due to poor night vision and glare vision thresholds which are linked to the higher aberrations and intraocular scatter resulting from LASIK.    As macular integrity is not affected in the LASIK patient, the glare recovery time appears to be within normal limits. </p...|$|R

Setting: Private clinical ophthalmology practice. Patients and methods: A total of 100 eyes (50 patients) in consecutive cases of myopic topography-guided LASIK procedures {{with the same}} refractive platform (FS 200 femtosecond and EX 500 excimer lasers) were randomized for treatment as follows: one eye with the <b>standard</b> clinical <b>refraction</b> (group A) and the contralateral eye with the topographic astigmatic power and axis (topography-modified treatment refraction; group B). All cases were evaluated pre- and post-operatively for the following parameters: refractive error, best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), topography (Placido-disk based) and tomography (Scheimpflug-image based), wavefront analysis, pupillometry, and contrast sensitivity. Follow-up visits were conducted for at least 12  months. Results: Mean refractive error was - 5. 5  D of myopia and - 1. 75  D of astigmatism. In group A versus group B, respectively, the average UDVA improved from 20 / 200 to 20 / 20 versus 20 / 16; post-operative CDVA was 20 / 20 and 20 / 13. 5; 1 line of vision gained was 27. 8 % and 55. 6 %; and 2 lines of vision gained was 5. 6 % and 11. 1 %. In group A, 27. 8 % of eyes had over - 0. 50 diopters of residual refractive astigmatism, in comparison to 11. 7 % in group B (P< 0. 01). The residual percentages in both groups were measured with refractive astigmatism of more than – 0. 5 diopters. Conclusion: Topography-modified refraction (TMR) : topographic adjustment of the amount and axis of astigmatism treated, when different from the clinical refraction, may offer superior outcomes in topography-guided myopic LASIK. These findings may change the current clinical paradigm of the optimal subjective refraction utilized in laser vision correction.

Several {{examples}} of eyes with multifocal wavefronts are analyzed by comparing subjective and aberrometric refraction. These multifo-cal eyes are analyzed using a generalized refractive error sensing method. Our results suggest an important {{effect on the}} refraction caused by inhomogeneous pupil transmittance (SCE or vignetting.). [Introduction]: In some eyes subjective refraction may differ more than 1 D from objective refraction obtained by aberrometry or autorrefracto-metry. Usually these eyes present wavefront errors larger than ave-rage (in particular coma and/or spherical aberration). Here, {{our goal was to}} assess the hypothesis that these important discrepancies in these highly aberrated eyes might be explained by their multifocal properties. In normal eyes, the prevalence of these cases is not high. We identified 8 out of 178 eyes (~ 5 %) from a previous study. However the prevalence in post-surgical eyes is expected to be much higher. The analysis was based on refractive error sensing, which was generalized to account for multifocal wavefronts, as well as to include the effect of possible irregular and/or non-uniform transmission pupils (Stiles-Crawford effect, etc.). [Discussion]: The study was focused on the above mentioned 8 eyes, which sho-wed differences greater than 1 D between subjective and objective equivalent sphere, Se. Se was obtained subjectively by <b>standard</b> subjective <b>refraction</b> and also by a more precise custom Badal system. For the objective refraction we used retinoscopy, autorefracto-meter (Canon T 1000) and aberrometer (irx 3, Imagine Eyes). In what follows we present one example of bifocal eye, which showed the maximum discrepancy of nearly 2. 5 D between subjective and ob-jective refraction. This case is especially interesting, since there are two different possible explanations for such a large difference. The left panel of Fig. 1 shows the distribution of equivalent sphere across a 4. 9 mm pupil diameter, showing values ranging from - 5 to - 9 D. The right panel shows the frequency histogram of that distribution under three hypothetical situations. Red line corresponds to the histogram of the plain aberrometric measure which implicitly assumes a perfect circular pupil with uniform transmission. This histogram shows two peaks separated by more than 2. 5 D, which is indicative of a bifocal wavefront. Nevertheless, the peak on the right is domi-nant as it shows Se = - 5. 8 D. The blue histogram simulates the effect of pupil vignetting by the upper eye lid. This simulation was inclu-ded, since this phenomenon was actually observed in this subject. For that purpose we assumed that the area of the pupil above the das-hed line was blocked by the eye lid. The resulting (blue) histogram is totally different, now showing a single peak, which is much closer to the value of the subjective refraction (Se=- 8. 2 D). The green histogram represents a second possible explanation. It was computed by weighting the data points according to the Stiles-Crawford effect (SCE). Here we used standard nominal values, ex-cept for the fact that we shifted the SCE peak downwards (its positi-on is indicated by the cross on the left panel.). As expected, the decentered SCE yields an intermediate situation: The two peaks remain but their relative heights changed so that now the dominant peak is the left one (Se =- 8. 2 D). The other cases analyzed so far exhibit two or even three peaks, which means that there are two or three possible refractions. One of these peaks is always close to the subjective refraction. Their relative heights depend on the position of the SCE peak. [Conclusions]: A small percentage of normal eyes show bifocal wavefronts, with power differences greater than 1 D (or even 2. 5 D in some cases), which are typically associated to high values of HOA. These bifocal eyes often show important discrepancies between subjective and objective refraction. Our results suggest that these discrepancies may appear because aberrometric methods ignore the inhomogene-ous effective pupil transmittance. The generalization of refractive error sensing proposed here seems suitable to obtain the refraction in these multifocal eyes. It may be especially relevant for postsurgi-cal eyes, which often present high levels of HOA, and hence may show multifocal wavefronts. Supported by grant FIS 2011 - 22496 (Spain).
