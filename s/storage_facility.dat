40|$|In is {{expected}} that electrical energy <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> will be installed for improving load factor. Although there are no constraints for places to install, ordinarily, a site is considered as a possibility if it is one where transmission loss is minimized or where voltage or frequency can he easily controlled by setting up <b>storage</b> <b>facilities.</b> If <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> are installed at load buses, electric power would be maintained by supply from the <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> to the loads, even when outage should occur at the power source side of the buses in question. In this paper, the authors propose a method to determine the arrangement of <b>storage</b> <b>facilities,</b> {{for the objective of}} minimizing the cost of interruption of electrical service, assuming that the facilities are installed at load buses. The problem is formulated and solved by using the dynamic programming method. From the examples, it is confirmed that we can reduce the cost of interruption by the ratio of (maximum output) /(interrupted load), if the corresponding maximum capacity is 2 〜 5 times larger than the mean outage duration time, and also it is confirmed that it is better to install larger <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> for larger capacity loads and for loads with larger mean outage duration time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} mathematical optimization {{models of}} produce <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> {{to optimize the}} operation of their energy systems {{in the context of}} Smart Grids. In the <b>storage</b> <b>facilities,</b> climate control of the storage rooms consumes considerable energy; thus, in this paper, a mathematical model of <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> appropriate for their optimal operation is developed, {{so that it can be}} implemented as a supervisory control in existing climate controllers. The proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing climate control systems in <b>storage</b> <b>facilities.</b> The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of <b>storage</b> <b>facilities,</b> i. e., inside temperature and humidity should be kept within acceptable ranges. The performance of the proposed model for various electricity price and weather conditions and their variations are studied via Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The presented simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints.
