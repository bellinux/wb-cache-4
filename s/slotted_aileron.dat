50|$|He {{invented the}} Frise aileron, {{also known as}} the <b>slotted</b> <b>aileron,</b> in 1921, which is {{designed}} to counteract adverse yaw, which won him the Royal Aeronautical Society's Wakefield Gold Medal (for advances in aviation safety) awarded on 30 May 1933. The Frise aileron has an effect on parasitic drag so that the total drag on both wings is the same when an aircraft executes a roll.|$|E
50|$|The Turbi {{is built}} using all-wood construction. The wing uses a two-spar design. It uses <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was fitted with various devices to increase lift; slotted flaps and <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and, {{on the low}} wing sponsons, split flaps. The wings folded back, pivoted close to the fuselage, on hydraulic power.|$|R
50|$|The Handley Page H.P.20 was an {{experimental}} monoplane modification of a de Havilland DH.9A, built to study controllable <b>slots</b> and <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> as high lift devices. It {{was the first}} aircraft to fly with controllable slots.|$|R
50|$|Of {{traditional}} high-wing layout, {{it carries}} 90 gallons of spray fluid {{in a tank}} beside the pilot, an extra seat being provided for a passenger. The Lycoming engine driving a McCauley v.p. propeller giving it ample power; with <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons,</b> balanced tail controls and oversize tyres providing good handling during operations in restricted spaces and rough surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Stressed for aerobatics, {{one example}} was {{purchased}} by Alan Cobham's National Aviation Day displays, and was flown under tow directly to London by Joan Meakin. During early flying with the Wolf it gained a reputation for dangerous spinning characteristics, {{which resulted in the}} Gö 1 being grounded in 1938, pending incorporation of modified, longer-chord, <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Breguet 670's wing had a {{constant}} thickness centre section, with wing roots faired into the fuselage on its trailing edges, and two outer panels, tapering in both thickness {{and plan to}} semi-elliptical tips. It was a two spar structure, with sheet duralumin, I-section spars which had extruded webs, and was duralumin skinned. Narrow chord <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> occupied the outer two-thirds of the span and the rest fitted with similar flaps.|$|R
50|$|The G-27 was {{the only}} Gribovsky design {{with more than one}} engine. It was a wooden {{multi-purpose}} monoplane, intended to provide training in navigation and photo-reconnaissance for its crew of three as well as filling light transport and air ambulance rôles. In plan its wing had a rectangular centre section and straight tapered, two spar outer panels with rounded tips. The outer panels carried <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and the centre section pneumatically operated split flaps.|$|R
50|$|The Stal-3 was an {{enlarged}} {{development of the}} Stal-2, designed at the OOS (Otdel Opytnogo Samolyetostroeniya - section for experimental aircraft construction), with a simplified structure which reduced manufacturing man-hours and structural weight, whilst increasing the design load factor. The layout of the aircraft was {{very similar to the}} Stal-2, but featured larger dimensions, slotted flaps, a wide chord engine cowling, <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons,</b> and spatted wheels with brakes, or skis depending on season.|$|R
50|$|The Aleks-251 {{is mostly}} {{constructed}} of metal, only using composites in the nosecone, engine cowlings and fin tip. It has a parallel chord, square tipped wing with a full-span combination of <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and flaps. The parasol configuration allows the twin 127 kW (170 hp) LOM 332S inverted inline engines to be mounted forward of {{and under the}} wing, close together. The wing is braced to the fuselage {{with a pair of}} inverted V-struts to the engine mountings.|$|R
50|$|The Kometa-Standard was {{the second}} glider {{designed}} by Pavlov and Panchovsky, a fully aerobatic Standard Class aircraft of almost entirely wooden construction, though with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings, straight tapered in plan and set at mid-wing position, were single spar structures with leading edge plywood covered D-boxes. They had 4° of dihedral. There were salmon type fairings, tapering, slender, streamlined bodies, at the tips. The Kometa-Standard had mass-balanced, <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and spoilers at 60% chord which opened {{above and below the}} wing.|$|R
50|$|Following earlier Gribovsky practice, {{the wing}} centre section was an {{integral}} part of the circular cross-section fuselage and, like it, was ply covered. The outer wing panels were ply covered from the leading edge back to the rear spar, with the rest fabric covered. In plan the wings were strongly tapered, mostly on the trailing edges, and ended in long, elliptical tips. Their trailing edges carried slotted flaps inboard; <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> filled the rest of the span. Fuel tanks were located between the spars, two in each wing.|$|R
50|$|The XL-15 Tagak was {{the second}} of these prototypes, {{developed}} {{in collaboration with the}} Philippine Air Force. It was a single-engine, high-wing monoplane with a twin-boom layout and tricycle undercarriage to enable easy access to the fuselage pod via rear doors. The inner wing sections, fitted with slotted flaps on the trailing edges had constant chord but further out the wings tapered, with <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons.</b> There was a single lift strut on each side between wing and lower fuselage, with an airfoil profile to add to the lift from the wings.|$|R
50|$|The wooden {{cantilever}} wing is sheathed in laminated wood and canvas. The wing is a right-angle trapezoid with rounded tips and has three structural sections: a central section and two removable outer sections joined {{to the central}} section by three pins. The dual-spar central section is unitized with the fuselage pod and tail booms. The removable monospar outer sections have an oblique auxiliary spar. The canvas-sheathed <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> are aerodynamically-compensated, differentially displaced 30° upward and 18° downward. The wing has a fixed slot {{at the edge of}} attack.|$|R
5000|$|The Lastochka is {{designed}} {{for a wide range}} of utility work, such as fire and geological surveys, freight transport and passenger carrying. It is a low wing monoplane constructed largely of composites, with straight tapered wings tipped with winglets. Their trailing edges carry <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and <b>slotted</b> flaps. Two [...] Rotax 912 ULS air-cooled flat four engines are mounted in pusher configuration on pylons over the wings in short cowlings, positioned with their propeller discs as close as possible to the fuselage. [...] Rotax 914 engines are an alternative.|$|R
50|$|The Van Lith VI was a two/three seat light high-wing cabin {{monoplane}} {{of conventional}} wooden construction. The wing was a two-spar structure with plywood and fabric covering. The fuselage was of rectangular section with plywood cladding. The main undercarriage with fixed legs, wheels, brakes and tailwheel were adapted {{from those of}} the Stampe SV.4. The pilot and passengers were seated in tandem with an access door on each side hinging upward for entry and exit. The <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> could be drooped together to function as flaps. It was initially flown with a single fin, but this was replaced with twin fins.|$|R
50|$|Its wings had an all wood {{structure}} and were mounted with 2.5° of dihedral. They were significantly forward swept, by 7° at quarter chord, with a constant chord inner section and strongly tapered outer panels with unswept leading edges. The wings were {{built around a}} single spar with a forward, plywood skinned torsion box {{between it and the}} leading edge; behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. The tips carried the small sreamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time. The outer panels carried wooden <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> which were ply skinned but with an outer fabric covering.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was predominantly made from aluminium, with some stainless steel {{used for the}} wing ribs, controls and fittings. The two-place side-by-side cockpit was made from fibreglass. Its four-piece 60.75 ft span high aspect ratio wing employed a modified Wortmann FX-61-163/35SF airfoil. The Fowler flaps occupied the entire trailing edge of the wing and accounted for 35% of the wing chord. In cruise the flaps were retracted, reducing the wing area. While climbing, the flaps were extended, producing a high lift coefficient of 2.2. For glidepath control when landing the flaps deployed to 80° to create aerodynamic drag. The outer flaps acted as <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> for roll control.|$|R
40|$|Three model wings, {{two with}} typical <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> {{and one with}} typical frise ailerons, have been tested {{as part of a}} general {{investigation}} on lateral control devices with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack, in the 7 by 10 foot wind tunnel of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Force tests, free-autorotation tests, and forced-rotation tests were made which show the effect of the various ailerons on the general performance of the wing, on the lateral controllability, and on the lateral stability, in general, rolling control at 20 degree angle of attack to plain ailerons of the same size. The adverse yawing moments obtained with the <b>slotted</b> and frise <b>ailerons</b> were, in most cases, slightly smaller than those obtained with plain ailerons of the same size and deflection. However, this improvement was small as compared to the improvement obtainable by the use of suitable differential movements with any of the ailerons, including the plain...|$|R
50|$|The Auster J/1U Workmaster is a late 1950s British single-engined single-seat high-wing agriculutural {{monoplane}} {{built by}} Auster Aircraft Limited at Rearsby, Leicestershire. Of traditional high-wing layout, it carries 90 gallons of spray fluid {{in a tank}} beside the pilot, an extra seat being provided for a passenger. The Lycoming 0-360-A engine of 180 h.p. driving a McCauley v.p. propeller giving it ample power; and <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> and balanced tail controls providing good handling. Oversize tyres were fitted. Take-off run at 2,550 lb gross weight and cruising speed at 65 per cent power are respectively 180 yd and 88 mph.

50|$|The VSO 10 is a mixed-construction glider {{with wooden}} and steel tube {{structural}} members, aluminium alloy rear fuselage and glass-fibre sandwich skins. The wings are shoulder-mounted and the tailplane {{is mounted on}} top of the integral fin. Conventional control surfaces include all-wooden <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons,</b> all-metal DFS airbrakes on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing and fabric-covered all-metal elevators and rudder. The undercarriage in the Standard Class aircraft is a manually retractable rubber-sprung monowheel with a drum brake, (non-retractable in the Club-Class aircraft), with a rubber-mounted steel skid under the tail. The pilot is accommodated in a fully reclined seat under a removable canopy rear segment and fixed forward segment. Provision is made for 56 L water ballast, for use in strong lift conditions.|$|R
50|$|The Rallye is {{equipped}} with a cantilever wing, which incorporated interconnected full-span automatic leading edge slats, wide-chord <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons,</b> and wide-span Fowler-type trailing edge flaps. The combination of full-span slats and large Fowler flaps provided the aircraft with its capable slow-speed flight performance. Fuel is also internally carried within the wings. According to Flying Magazine, the Rallye possessed a generous degree of controllability and was relatively forgiving to fly, being extremely difficult to mishandle to the point where effective control of the aircraft would be lost. The aircraft is safe to fly at practically any piloting skill level. While the Rallye has fair manoeuvrability, such as during loops and rolls, the execution of aerobatic maneuvers is not officially approved by the manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|The {{new high}} {{wing of the}} IS-9 had a span of only 13 m and was mounted with a {{dihedral}} of 2.5°. In plan it had a rectangular centre section, extending to about mid span, with straight tapered outer panels. The wing sections were the same NACA ones used on the IS-7 and IS-8 gliders. It was of wooden construction with a single wooden spar and a plywood covered torsion box from the spar forward around the leading edge. Behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. There were fabric over ply covered wooden <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> which occupied all {{the trailing edge of}} the outer panels. The wing tips carried the small, streamlined bodies known as salmons which were common at the time.|$|R
5000|$|From about 1950 to {{his death}} in February 1981, Iosif Silimon was Romania's most {{prominent}} glider designer, his aircraft distinguished by his initials. [...] The IS-5 first flew on 14 June 1960. It was a shoulder wing cantilever monoplane developed from the URMV-3 IS-3 and of mixed wood and metal construction. The wings had an all wood structure and were plywood skinned. Mounted with 3° of dihedral, they were straight tapered in plan and built around a single spar with a forward torsion box {{between it and the}} leading edge. The tips carried the small streamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time. The <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons,</b> which filled about half the span, were ply skinned but with an outer fabric covering.|$|R
5000|$|The 301's general {{configuration}} {{was similar}} to other Mooney models, differing in details such as an aft-sloping vertical fin, {{as opposed to the}} vertical leading edge with forward-swept trailing edge M20 fin, a lower-set engine with small cooling-air inlets, and fixed horizontal stabilizers with trim tab-equipped elevators, as opposed to the pivoting-empennage M20 design. The tapered wing planform {{was similar to}} the M20, slightly longer (37.0 feet vs. 36.42 feet for the M20), and with several differences: the airfoil was a low-drag 15% profile NASA NLF(1)-0315 from root to tip; [...] double-slotted Fowler flaps covering 90% of the trailing-edge length, with <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> on the remaining 10%, and with spoilers mounted on the wing's upper surfaces ahead of the flaps to assist the ailerons.|$|R
50|$|The {{control system}} used the {{foreplane}} and 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) span <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> at {{the tips of}} the mainplane. Fore and aft movement of the stick altered the angle of attack of the whole foreplane raising or lowering the nose. Side to side movement of the stick operated the mainlane ailerons in a conventional fashion to control the bank angle (i.e. stick left -left aileron up right aileron down and vice versa). The sole yaw control, as the aircraft had neither fin nor rudder, consisted of applying left or right foot operated rudder pedal deflected small servo flaps on the trailing edge of the foreplanes to tilt the foreplanes;left plane low for the nose to yaw left and right plane low for the nose to yaw right.|$|R
2500|$|The Veltro was a wooden, {{shoulder}} wing cantilever monoplane, with a [...] span wing which was straight tapered in plan {{and had an}} aspect ratio of 18:1.

50|$|The {{cantilever}} {{shoulder wing}} of the IS-10 was mounted with a dihedral of 2.5°. It was built around a single spar with a plywood covered torsion box ahead of it around the leading edge. Behind the spar the wing was fabric-covered. The leading edge was straight and unswept, and over the inner half span section the trailing edge ran parallel, apart from a root extension rearwards to blend wing and fuselage. The outer panels were straight-tapered, with short span, <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> that were fabric-over-ply-covered. The IS-10 had spoilers, opening both {{above and below the}} wing, mounted at midchord on the inner panels. The wing tips carried the small, streamlined bodies known as salmons, which were common at the time. The laminar flow wing sections were from the NACA airfoil 6-series, with a thickness-chord ratio of 18% over most of the span.|$|R

50|$|The PWS-3 was a {{two-seater}} {{parasol wing}} braced monoplane of wooden construction. The fuselage was {{built around a}} box-section wooden boom, {{with a kind of}} superstructure of wood strips, covered with plywood in front and aircraft fabric fairing in the rear. The engine compartment was covered with duralumin sheeting. The empennage was wooden, with the fixed surfaces plywood covered and fabric on the control surfaces. The rectangular wooden wings had two spars, and were covered with plywood in front and fabric in the rear. Initially it had <b>slotted</b> <b>ailerons</b> on all span, later shortened. The fuselage had two cockpits in tandem, with windscreens and dual controls. The undercarriage consisted of a fixed split axle conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. Both main undercarriage struts and wing struts were fixed to small horizontal winglets at the bottom of fuselage sides. Fuel was carried in two tanks, 100 l capacity in total, in a central wing section.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from its}} {{variable}} wing trailing edge, the SN.2 was a conventional, single engine cantilever high wing monoplane.

[...] The fixed part of the wing had the popular, thick (15%) flat-bottomed Göttingen 387 airfoil with room within it for the extension, which had a right angle triangular plan and circular arc profile. When retracted, its rear edge protruded slightly out of the slot in {{the trailing edge of}} the fixed section. At its root, which was supported in a groove in the narrow, central upper fuselage, it increased the chord by about 35%; overall it added 20% to the wing area and increased the camber.
