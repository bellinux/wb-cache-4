50|$|The Petersburg Creek-Duncan <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> Wilderness is a {{designated}} wilderness area located on Kupreanof Island, Alaska, within the Tongass National Forest. The wilderness area protects 46,849 acres of temperate rainforests, salt marsheses and rugged, glacier-carved mountains.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{or fourth}} series of benches and flats are {{prominent}} at {{an elevation of}} about [...] above sea level. At this level also there are lakes, from which small streams flow down through gulch-like valleys to lower levels. At this altitude, there are terraces along the north slope of the southwest half of the peninsula, flats south of Hadley, a low pass across the peninsula southwest of Lyman Anchorage, and the lakes and flats on the divide from Windfall Harbor to Tolstoi Bay and east of the It mine. Most of the summits of the hills north of the It mine and adjacent to the <b>Salt</b> <b>chucks</b> {{at the head of}} Kasaan Bay are at an elevation of about [...] Higher levels of erosion are indicated at elevations of [...] by lakes and flats in the central portion of the southeast half of the peninsula, by flats that are in part occupied by lakes on Mount Andrew and on the mountain just west of Lyman Anchorage, and {{at the head of a}} branch of Tolstoi River. Other lakes at an altitude of about [...] north of Grindall Point Mountains and north of Kasaan Mountain may mark a higher erosion level. The highest relatively level areas stand at an altitude of about , on the Grindall Point Mountains, where there are also small lakes, and also on the ridge southeast of Kasaan Mountain and on Tolstoi Mountain.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{settlement}} {{on the island}} is Kake, on the northwestern side of the island. The only other city is Kupreanof, on the eastern side, across the Wrangell Narrows {{from the city of}} Petersburg on nearby Mitkof Island. The island lies within the limits of Tongass National Forest (Petersburg Ranger District).

5000|$|Wallen was {{a pioneer}} in the {{conservation}} movement in southeast Alaska in the 1960s. He worked to get protected status for places such as the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve, the Mendenhall Wetlands, Admiralty Island National Monument, Petersburg Creek-Duncan <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> Wilderness, and the extension of Denali National Park. He has donated his artwork to state and national conservation fundraising efforts as well as to public television. [...] In 1990, Alaska governor Steve Cowper appointed Wallen to the all-volunteer Alaska Board of Game in 1990.|$|E
50|$|Settlers began mining of gold, copper, {{and other}} metals {{on the island}} in the late 19th century, as European Americans entered the area to exploit the natural resources. Gold {{production}} came from underground lode mines exploiting: gold-bearing quartz veins in metamorphic rocks (such as the Gold Standard, Sea Level, Dawson, Golden Fleece and Goldstream mines); skarns (at the Jumbo and Kassan Peninsula copper-gold mines); zoned mafic-ultramafic plutons, as at the <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> silver-gold-copper-PGE mine; and VMS deposits such as Niblack. Uranium was mined at Bokan Mountain in the 1950s and 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 58,000 {{ounces of}} lode gold and 4000 ounces of placer gold {{have come from}} the Ketchikan district, {{consisting}} of Dall, Prince of Wales, Revillagigedo, and smaller islands, as well some mainland, in the southernmost-part of Alaska.Numerous historical lode mines and prospects for base metals, uranium, rare earth elements (REE's), iron, and platinum group elements (PGE's), as well as gold exist in the Ketchikan district. Major gold production came from underground lode mines exploiting: gold-bearing quartz veins in metamorphic rocks (such as the Gold Standard, Sea Level, Dawson, Golden Fleece, and Goldstream mines); skarns (at the Jumbo and Kassan Peninsula copper-gold mines); zoned mafic-ultramafic plutons, as at the <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> silver-gold-copper-PGE mine; and VMS deposits such as Niblack.|$|E
40|$|The early Paleozoic <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> {{intrusion}} has petrographic {{and chemical}} characteristics thal {{are similar to}} those of Cretaceous Alaskan-type ultramafic-mafic bodies. The <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> intnrsion is markedly discordant to the structure of the early Paleozoic Descon Formation, in which ithas produced arather indistinct contact aureole a few meters wide. Field relationships and sequences ofcumulus minerals indicate thatthe two rock types, magnetite clinopyroxenite and gabbro, are related by fractional crystallization. All analyzed samples are feldspathoid-normative, a result ofthe high proportion ofthe esseneite component of clinopyroxene and not an indication of crystallization from a silica-undersaturated magma. The Mg # of the modal clinopyroxene ranges from 0. 937 to 0. 83 1, consistent with a normal trend offractional crystallization. Mineral assemblages, sequence of crystallization, and mineral chemistry suggest that the intrusion crystallized under low pressures (- 2 kbar) with oxidation conditions near those of the NNO buffer, from a hydrous, silica-saturated, orthopyroxene-normative parental magma. The dominance of Pd over ft [average Pt/(ft+Pd) = 0. 061 in the <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> intrusion contrasts harply with the general dominance of Pt over Pd [average Pt/(ft+Pd) = 0. 591 in other Alaskan-type bodies. There are also generally higher levels of PGE and sulfide concentrations in the <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> deposit. Sulfides in the <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> intrusion are substantially more Cu- and Pd-rich than magmatic sulfides in other ultramafic rocks. The <b>Salt</b> <b>Chuck</b> deposit was probably formed by a two-stage process: (I) a stage of magmatic rystallization in which the sulfides and PGE accumulated in a disseminated manner in cumulus deposits, possibly largely in the gabbro, and (2) a late...|$|E
