5|$|Feminist cinema, advocating or {{illustrating}} feminist perspectives, arose largely {{with the}} development of feminist film theory in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce <b>substantive</b> <b>change</b> for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women. Differences were particularly marked between feminists {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, Women and Film. Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women's Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.|$|E
5|$|After {{being pushed}} back repeatedly, a {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 17 November 2010 that resulted in adoption of the state's fourth constitution with 73% in favor and a voter turnout of 52.6%. The independent Malagasy political watchdog group KMF-CNOE, {{as well as the}} political opposition and the international community, cited numerous irregularities in the process, which was carried out unilaterally by the HAT. The constitution in effect at the time Rajoelina took office required that presidential candidates attain a minimum of 40 years of age. One <b>substantive</b> <b>change</b> made by the new constitution was to lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, making Rajoelina eligible to stand in presidential elections. In addition, the new constitution mandated the leader of the High Transitional Authority – the position held by Rajoelina – be kept as interim president until an election could take place. The new constitution also contained a clause that required presidential candidates to have lived in Madagascar for at least six months prior to the elections, effectively barring Ravalomanana and other opposition leaders living in exile from running in the next election. After being repeatedly postponed, the general election was held on 25 October 2013.|$|E

25|$|After the Babylonian {{conquest and}} {{during the period of}} Achaemenid rule, notable drops in the {{population}} of Jerusalem, the Sphephelah and the Negev region occurred, while a continuity is maintained in the northern Judean and Benjamin areas.

The exilic returnees resettled, perhaps with a heightened sense of their ethnic identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome of}} this Commission was that Harrison, Hughes and Lord Lichfield {{produced}} a minority report (1869), recommending that all the legal restrictions should be dropped. Then the matter was raised again in a second Commission, {{at the end of}} Hughes's time in Parliament. At that point Alexander Macdonald used a minority report to refer back to Hughes's earlier view; but Hughes signed the majority report. It advocated amendment of the Master and Servant Act 1867, but little <b>substantive</b> <b>change</b> to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871 and the law of conspiracy.|$|E

2500|$|His <b>substantive</b> <b>change</b> to Jacobitism {{occurred}} in 1725, when Wharton joined Earl Orrery in attacking the Court. [...] He made allies among City politicians, which was valuable to the Jacobites as Jacobitism {{had previously been}} associated with Scotland and disaffected country squires. [...] The City had been a Whig stronghold and any erosion in their support would have powerful consequences. [...] Indeed, although Wharton did not benefit from it, much of this would bear fruit {{in the emergence of}} the Patriot Whigs a few years later. [...] At the same time, Wharton was £70,000 in debt.|$|E
2500|$|Laughlin lectured on Jungian {{psychology}} at {{universities and colleges}} throughout the United States since the 1970s, including Yale University and Stanford University In 1995, because of his background in football and psychology, he {{was brought in to}} counsel University of Nebraska football player Lawrence Phillips after Phillips' suspension from the team. He said of Phillips at the time, [...] "He should not be rewarded by being allowed to play unless there is real <b>substantive</b> <b>change.</b> I don't mean surface change. But if he does change, then he's not only going to not batter this girl, he's not going to batter the girl he marries at 30 and 35. If he just pretends to change, of course he {{should not be allowed to}} play, but Lawrence has already been sanctioned in ways other batterers on this campus are not".|$|E
2500|$|Operating {{independently}} of the PDA, the Market Historical Commission (established by the 1971 initiative to preserve the Market) has the specific mandate to preserve the Market's physical and social character as [...] "the soul of Seattle." [...] The commission must approve any <b>substantive</b> <b>change</b> in the use or design of buildings and signage in the Historical District, even when these actions are taken by the PDA itself. Members of the 12-member commission are appointed to three-year terms by the mayor. At any time, the commission consists of two members each from the Friends of the Market, Inc., Allied Arts of Seattle, Inc., and the Seattle chapter of the American Institute of Architects; two owners of property within the district; two Market merchants, and two district residents. They meet 22 times a year. The Seattle Department of Neighborhoods provides them with a staff person, and the city's Department of Design, Construction and Land Use (DCLU) can enforce their decisions.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Kennedy's dissent, {{joined by}} both Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, argued that Congress simply had not {{established}} that the states [...] "engage in widespread {{discrimination on the basis}} of gender in the provision of family leave benefits." [...] Justice Kennedy believed the evidence summarized by the Court was too isolated and anecdotal to established such a pattern of discrimination. He also argued that the states had actually [...] "been ahead of Congress in providing gender-neutral family leave benefits." [...] The fact that gender classifications are subjected to heightened scrutiny, he said, [...] " [...] not alter [...] conclusion," [...] because Hibbs still bore the [...] "burden to show that Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States." [...] This was a burden, said Justice Kennedy, which Hibbs had not met. Thus the FMLA amounted to a <b>substantive</b> <b>change</b> in the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment, not an enforcement of its provisions, and under Boerne, this was unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|For years Burke pursued {{impeachment}} efforts against Warren Hastings, formerly Governor-General of Bengal, {{that resulted}} in the trial during 1786. His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings' impeachment trial. For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation. In 1781 Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the East India Company when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs—from that point {{until the end of the}} trial; India was Burke's primary concern. This committee was charged [...] "to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties". While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second 'secret' committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the Indian princes that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the HEIC recall Hastings. This was Burke's first call for <b>substantive</b> <b>change</b> regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that [...] "began 'in commerce' but 'ended in empire.'" ...|$|E

A contrary view - that Congress intended no major <b>substantive</b> <b>change</b> - is reflected in the concurring opinion of Justice Hugo Black in Aro Mfg. Co. v.
