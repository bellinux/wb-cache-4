6000|$|There {{is always}} {{the young man who}} was, one year, {{spending}} the Christmas at a country house, and, on Christmas Eve, they put him to sleep in the west wing. Then {{in the middle of the}} night, the room door quietly opens and somebody--generally a lady in her night-dress--walks slowly in, and comes and <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> The young man thinks it must be one of the visitors, or some relative of the family, though he does not remember having previously seen her, who, unable to go to sleep, and feeling lonesome, all by herself, has come into his room for a chat. He has no idea it is a ghost: he is so unsuspicious. She does not speak, however; and, when he looks again, she is gone! ...|$|E
6000|$|MAN (drowsily). Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, slee--(The words trail {{off into}} a murmur. He wakes again with a shock {{on the point of}} falling.) Where am I? That's what I want to know: where am I? Must keep awake. Nothing keeps me awake except danger--remember that--(intently) danger, danger, danger, dan-- Where's danger? Must find it. (He starts of vaguely around the room in search of it.) What am I looking for? Sleep--danger--don't know. (He stumbles against the bed.) Ah, yes: now I know. All right now. I'm to go to bed, but not to sleep--be sure not to sleep--because of danger. Not to lie down, either, only sit down. (He <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> A blissful {{expression}} comes into his face.) Ah! (With a happy sigh he sinks back at full length; lifts his boots into the bed with a final effort; and falls fast asleep instantly.) ...|$|E
6000|$|You {{return to}} bed, and lie {{listening}} to somebody being dragged upstairs, evidently against their will. By a thoughtful arrangement the spare rooms at [...] "Beggarbush" [...] are exactly underneath the nurseries. The same somebody, you conclude, still offering the most creditable opposition, {{is being put}} back into bed. You can follow the contest with much exactitude, because every time the body is flung down upon the spring mattress, the bedstead, just above your head, makes a sort of jump; while every time the body succeeds in struggling out again, you are aware by the thud upon the floor. After a time the struggle wanes, or maybe the bed collapses; and you drift back into sleep. But the next moment, or {{what seems to be}} the next moment, you again open your eyes under the consciousness of a presence. The door is being held ajar, and four solemn faces, piled one on top of the other, are peering at you, as though you were some natural curiosity kept in this particular room. Seeing you awake, the top face, walking calmly over the other three, comes in and <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> in a friendly attitude.|$|E

60|$|Valencia's indignation had no words. She {{could only}} <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> with Lucia in her arms, looking {{defiance}} {{at all the}} world above that fair head which one moment dropped on her bosom, and the next gazed up into her face in pitiful child-like pleading.|$|R

60|$|A ring {{of his bed}} 'phone made Dick <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> {{to take up the}} receiver. As he listened, {{he looked}} out across the patio to Paula's porches. Bonbright was {{explaining}} that it was a call from Chauncey Bishop who was at Eldorado in a machine. Chauncey Bishop, editor and owner of the San Francisco Dispatch, was sufficiently important a person, in Bonbright's mind, as well as old friend of Dick's, to be connected directly to him.|$|R

50|$|Later that night, {{after all}} the guests have left, the elders of the family then bring the bride to her bridal room where the Penganggun (Wedding Attendant?) then lights 3 candles and passes them to one elderly lady sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bride's <b>bed</b> and to another who follows behind her. The Bride then puts her arms around the Penganggun and is led around <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> behind her three times. The Bride then {{proceeds}} to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and blows out the three candles ending the initiation. Again, this practice is only carried out in weddings from the Brunei Muara District.|$|R
50|$|Willow and (evil) Cordelia's {{conversation}} about what they've {{been up to}} since they last communicated, {{is similar to a}} conversation Buffy Summers and Amy Madison have in the 6th season of Buffy.

5000|$|Another song <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album gave Mathis the {{opportunity}} to provide some insight into his emphasis upon including as many verses as he does: [...] "I loved singing songs {{that were part of}} that great songbook that was recorded at the time by Ella Fitzgerald and eventually Sarah Vaughan. I listened to those things over and over, learning songs like [...] "A Ship Without a Sail". I used to just <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and play those songs over and over and learn the verses. That’s the reason I sang so many verses on my recordings…I listened to Ella and Sarah do the verses…and they sang them meticulously." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} in 1998 as well. The video featured a controversial scene at the beginning where Yearwood exits a bath and is seen returning to her bedroom to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> while wearing only a towel wrapped around her. As the video progresses, Yearwood is seen getting dressed and leaving the house, where she is eventually soaked by the pouring rain as her former lover passes by. It aired on CMT upon its official release. The video was {{a departure from the}} wholesome image of her previous videos. Yearwood has since admitted that she was very uneasy about her family (particularly, her father) seeing her in such a provocative fashion.|$|R

The film ends with Louise and Shelley alone, with no explanation for the events of the film.|$|E

When Kim leaves she leaves the door ajar and listens to the nasty comments Pie's mother makes about her, she begins to cry and walks away.|$|R
50|$|The area of {{each cell}} is around 20 square meters. The wooden door of each cell is {{sandwiched}} between two iron plates, {{and there are}} two peepholes: one {{at the level of the}} toilet, while the other is above it. Around a foot from the ground, there is a rectangular window for delivering meals. The only furniture inside each cell is a bed that was around a foot from the ground and when a prisoner needs to write a confession or other materials, a desk similar to those in elementary schools would be provided. However, there would never be any chairs and prisoners must <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to write. For safety and security reasons, every sharp edge inside the cell has been changed to smooth/round shape. There are also special suicide watch cells with walls made of rubber so prisoners could not commit suicide by running into the walls.|$|R
5000|$|Freddy meets {{back with}} Christine {{at the hotel}} where he tells her he needs {{motivation}} {{to get out of}} his chair. She says she’ll be his motivation ("Love is My Legs").

Lawrence has the same two sailors kidnap Freddy while he takes Christine to the train station so she can leave ("Love Sneaks In"). Freddy shows up, having escaped the sailors too late to get to Christine.|$|E
50|$|It {{works with}} an {{overhead}} projector. The panel {{consists of a}} translucent LCD, and a fan to keep it cool. The projection panel <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the overhead projector, and acts {{like a piece of}} transparency. The panels have a VGA input, and sometimes Composite (RCA) and S-Video input. Later models have remotes, with functions such as 'freeze' which lets you freeze the image, useful for when you want to leave something on the screen whilst you do other things. Earlier models only had 640x480 resolution, while newer ones had up to SVGA resolution. Proxima, one maker of the panels, included a magic wand and sensor, which worked with the sensor detecting where you put the wand, to create and interactive effect, the equivalent of today's smart boards.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} {{and size of}} the sediments can sometimes help indicate the type of river, and the general flow direction. The grain distribution of the bed armor is essential to understanding the armor, and its function that is dependent {{on the size of the}} armor. For example, if there is a large piece of sediment that <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> armor layer of the river it can change the threshold for critical flow. The change in critical flow at the bottom of the stream or river can change the turbidity of the flow, and create different types of river systems depending on the range of impact the change in flow has. This effect can create a positive loop, with the critical flow disrupting smaller sediments downstream which repeat the process.|$|E
5000|$|The story {{comes to}} a climax when Jack enters, {{apparently}} absent-mindedly, naked into Julie's bedroom. Julie is not there; only Tom is present. Jack climbs into Tom's crib and begins {{to talk to him}} about their parents. Julie enters and, seemingly unsurprised by Jack's nakedness, jokes that 'it is big'. Jack and Julie <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> while Tom sleeps, and Julie takes off her clothes. While talking, Jack and Julie become more and more intimate with each other. Right at this point, Derek enters. He remarks that he has seen it all and calls them [...] "sick". When he leaves, Jack and Julie begin to have sex. A thudding noise can be heard below, and their sister Sue comes and informs them that Derek is smashing up the concrete coffin. The three begin to talk, remembering their mother. After a while, police lights illuminate the room through the bedroom window.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's late," [...] Hannah objected. But Janet departed. Instead {{of going}} to Eda's she walked alone, seeking the quieter streets that her {{thoughts}} might flow undisturbed. At ten o'clock, when she returned, the light {{was out in the}} diningroom, her sister had not come in, and she began slowly to undress, pausing every now and then to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and dream; once she surprised herself gazing into the glass with a rapt expression that was almost a smile. What was it about her that had attracted Ditmar? No other man had ever noticed it. She had never thought herself good looking, and now--it was astonishing!--she seemed to have changed, and she saw with pride that her arms and neck were shapely, that her dark hair fell down in a cascade over her white shoulders to her waist. She caressed it; it was fine. When she looked again, a radiancy seemed to envelop her. She braided her hair slowly, in two long plaits, looking shyly in the mirror and always seeing that radiancy....|$|R
60|$|But {{after she}} had eaten, she made Torfrida <b>sit</b> before her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and Hereward likewise; and began to talk; eagerly, as one who had not unburdened her mind for many weeks; and eloquently too, as became Sprakaleg's {{daughter}} and Godwin's wife.|$|R
5000|$|Paint {{is usually}} applied {{right after the}} road has been paved. The road is marked {{commonly}} by a truck called a [...] "Striper." [...] These trucks contain hundreds of gallons of paint stored in huge drums which sit on the bed. The markings are controlled manually or automatically by the controller who <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Paint is run {{through a series of}} hoses under air pressure and applied to the roadway surface along with the application of glass beads for retroreflectivity. After application, the paint dries fairly quickly. Sometimes the glass beads are mixed in with the paint and applied together, which is not a recommended method. The usual method is to use a separate gun to spray the glass beads on to the wet paint during the application.|$|E
5000|$|Sawyer has a {{nightmare}} about the night, as a child, {{he was told}} by his mother to hide under his bed while {{she went to the}} door to tell his father to leave.

Sawyer travels there, buys a gun, and goes to the shrimp shop where Duckett works. He chats with him briefly, but doesn't kill him. Sawyer goes to an Australian bar and happens to meet Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) father. Christian tells Sawyer some people are meant to suffer, and [...] "that's why the Red Sox will never win the damn Series." [...] He says he wishes he had the strength to call his son, say how proud he is of him, and [...] "fix everything", but he is too weak to do it. Christian tells Sawyer to fix the thing that's making him feel bad. Sawyer shoots Frank Duckett, but Frank denies being the real Sawyer, telling Sawyer he owed Hibbs money—Sawyer realizes this is the real reason Hibbs sent him after Duckett. Duckett tells Sawyer [...] "It'll come back around", the phrase whispered when Sawyer encounters the boar.|$|E
50|$|The glazier {{is still}} {{repairing}} Victor's window, {{as well as}} the lock on his door. Victor's mother is now ill with grief, and the funeral has been delayed as long as possible to get Victor to attend. The glazier starts to get an explanation that Victor desired freedom from his family, but could not get it because of their interminable visits, but that he has not received any sort of freedom when they are not around, either. An audience member becomes dissatisfied and leaves his box to get on the stage, complaining that the play is going on without providing any satisfaction to the audience. the prompter becomes fed up, and the script plummets from the sky onto the ground. The audience member brings a Chinese torturer to try to cure Victor. Eventually, he gets a mildly satisfactory answer and leaves the stage. Dr. Piouk, whom Victor is stunned to learn is now his uncle by marriage, arrives with Olga to see if he wants to take a poison pill and commit suicide, but he does not wish to. The glazier leaves his work unfinished, leaves the tools to Victor, and Mme. Karl again arrives to ask for the rent. He gives her a wad of money from the drawer, but it's not enough, so he gives her the tools, and tells her to pawn the jacket he thinks that he has left on the stairs to pay the rent. She tries to offer him food, but says that she can't be a nursemaid to him. He pushes the bed as far from the door and window and as close to the audience member's box as possible, then <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to rest.|$|E

A few ramps have strengthening ribs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the exit lip which can narrow the usable width and interfere with the loading/unloading operation, preventing the final pallets being loaded with the ramp.|$|R

When Cordelia asks why they're not freaking out about wooden stakes or {{the sight of a}} green man with horns, Wesley and Gunn both reveal that vampires and demons are real and they both have {{experience}} with them. Fred examines an unconscious Lorne while Wesley shares his theory that they're being kept in the hotel with a vampire as a test. They all start to wonder why they don't look 17, and collectively decide to hunt for the vampire that will supposedly set them free once they kill it. Cordelia and Angel team up and go one way while the other three head in the other direction. Angel struggles to adjust to this strange world that is hundreds of years beyond his life.
