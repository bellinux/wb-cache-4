50|$|A simple form of {{directional}} antenna is the <b>loop</b> <b>aerial.</b> This {{consists of an}} open loop of wire on an insulating former, or a metal ring that forms the antenna elements itself, where {{the diameter of the}} loop is a tenth of a wavelength or smaller at the target frequency. Such an antenna will be least sensitive to signals that are normal to its face and most responsive to those meeting edge-on. This is caused by the phase output of the transmitting beacon. The phase changing phase causes a difference between the voltages induced {{on either side of the}} loop at any instant. Turning the loop face on will not induce any current flow. Simply turning the antenna to obtain minimum signal will establish two possible directions from which the signal could be emanating. The NULL is used, as small angular deflections of the <b>loop</b> <b>aerial</b> near its null positions produce larger changes in current than similar angular changes near the loops max positions. For this reason, a null position of the <b>loop</b> <b>aerial</b> is used.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{electrodynamic}} tether can propel {{a spacecraft}} through a planetary magnetized plasma without using propellant. In the classical embodiment of an electrodynamic tether, the ambient magnetic field exerts a Lorentz {{force on the}} current along the tether, the ambient plasma providing circuit closure for the current. A suggested propulsion scheme would hypothetically eliminate tether performance dependence on the plasma density by using a full wire loop to close the current circuit, and a superconductor to <b>shield</b> a <b>loop</b> segment from the external uniform magnetic field and cancel the Lorentz force on that segment. Here, we use basic electromagnetic laws to explain how such a scheme cannot produce a net force. Because there is no net current in the superconducting shield, the circulation of the magnetic field along a closed line outside the full cross section, in its plane, is just due to the current flowing in the loop segment. The presence of the superconducting shield simply moves the Lorentz force from the <b>shielded</b> <b>loop</b> segment to the shield itself and, as a result, the total magnetic force, acting on full <b>loop</b> plus <b>shield,</b> remains zero...|$|R

The apparent height of reflection was also measured. Full-wave calculations were performed to test several published models of the ionospheric D-region for consistency with the measurements. Modified models were also tested and new models for winter days, and for nights throughout the year were derived. TM mode propagation of VLF transmissions on eight long paths was examined, and TE mode propagation on three long paths was also examined at two receiving sites using orthogonal <b>loop</b> <b>aerials</b> to isolate the TE and TM modes. Measurements were found to be consistent with published predicted values of relevant ionospheric parameters. Disturbances resulting from solar flare activity were observed on all the paths and the anomalies present in the records were examined in detail. The contrasting response of the different paths was noted. Comparison of selected anomalies with the incident flux of X-radiation enabled an explanation for the different response of the various paths to be found.

He also experimented with antennas, radio wave propagation, and noise suppression.On August 30, 1906 he filed a patent for a silicon crystal detector, which was granted on November 20, 1906.

A preliminary experiment examined the effect of presence and colour of <b>loop</b> <b>aerial</b> wires, on the activity of grazing cattle. Results from brown and white aerials pegged {{on the surface of the}} ground were compared with those from aerials buried at a depth of 5 cm. There was no effect of colour or burial of aerial on total number of contacts, or in time duration of cows within patches (P> 0. 001). Further experiments were conducted to examine potential sources of variation in the reading range of aerials. Reading range declined with reduction in aerial size and as the height of the transponder above ground level increased. Detection distance from a square aerial varied according to the transponder direction of approach, whereas direction of approach around the circumference of a circular aerial had little affect on detection distance. Reading range was greatest when orientation of the transponder tag to an aerial was vertical compared to horizontal. Implications of the results for studies of grazing activity are discussed and it is concluded that the field based active transponder system used in this experiment offers potential when recording patch level investigative behaviour of grazing animals.
