When the scope for punishment is weak, {{there is a natural}} question about why agents do not defect from these groups. I model a rosca as a commitment savings device for hyperbolic discounters. Roscas are attractive for two reasons: the possibility of getting the nondivisible good early (the standard reason), and the fixed saving requirement (valued only by time-inconsistent agents). I find explicit conditions under which an agent strictly prefers to remain in a rosca, {{even in the absence of}} formal contracting or social punishment.

40|$|Well {{before the}} global {{financial}} crisis, the long-term trend in fiscal policy had raised concerns about risks for the outcomes of monetary policy. Are fears of an unpleasant monetarist arithmetic justified? To provide some insights, this paper examines strategic fiscal-monetary interactions in a novel game-theory framework with asynchronous timing of moves. It generalizes the <b>standard</b> <b>commitment</b> concept of Stackelberg leadership by making it dynamic. By letting players move with a certain fixed frequency, this framework allows policies to be committed or rigid for different periods of time. We find that the inferior non-Ricardian (active fiscal, passive monetary) regime can occur in equilibrium, {{and that this is}} more likely in a monetary union due to free-riding. The bad news is that, unlike under the static commitment of Sargent and Wallace (1981), this may happen even if monetary policy acts as leader {{for longer periods of time}} than fiscal policy. The good news is that under some circumstances an appropriate institutional design of monetary policy may not only help the central bank resist fiscal pressure and avoid the unpleasant monetarist arithmetic, but also discipline excessively spending governments.

40|$|Recent {{contributions}} in the environmental literature {{seem to suggest that}} incentives to environmental research is lower than incentives to ordinary research, arguing in favor for additional support for environmental R&D. Their arguments are based on the conjecture of the commitment problem. Since the government influences incentives implicitly through their environmental policy, they may be tempted to expropriate rents from the successful innovation with strategic taxation. In this thesis I analyze whether the incentives to environmental R&D is systematically lower, due to both the appropriability problem and the commitment problem. Secondly I investigate how an inducement prize to environmental innovations can remedy these market failures. My conclusion on the <b>standard</b> <b>commitment</b> problem confirm the results in Greaker and Hoel (2011) where a ranking of incentives is arbitrary, depending on parameter values. This gives no reason to frequently use of innovation prizes to environmental R&D. I therefore expand the analysis and introduce a political disturbance, investigating whether this gives a specific ranking. It turns out that intermediate disturbance gives a distinct underprovision of environmental R&D. For this special case innovation prizes will restore the optimal level of incentives. The thesis contains of a historical introduction and a discussion of innovation prizes as an inducement mechanism for environmental R&D...|$|E
40|$|Well {{before the}} global {{financial}} crisis, the stance of fiscal policy {{in a number of}} countries had raised concerns about risks for the outcomes of monetary policy. To provide some insights this paper examines the fiscal-monetary interactions in a novel game theory framework with asynchronous timing of moves. It generalizes the <b>standard</b> <b>commitment</b> concept of Stackelberg leadership by making it dynamic: it allows policies to be committed or rigid for different periods of time. We find that the (active fiscal, passive monetary) policy equilibrium- characterized by socially inferior medium-term monetary outcomes due to fiscal spillovers- can occur, and this is more likely in a monetary union due to free-riding. The bad news is that, unlike under static commitments, this may happen even if monetary policy acts as the leader for longer periods than fiscal policy. The good news is that appropriate institutional design of monetary policy may not only help the central bank resist fiscal pressure, but also discipline ambitious governments. Strong monetary commitment may therefore induce a reduction in the average size of the budget deficit and debt, moving the economy to the (passive fiscal, active monetary) policy equilibrium. The implication is that monetary policy in the United States, Switzerland, Japan, Eurozone, and other countries should be committed more explicitly to a numerical inflation target, and that this can improve the medium to long-term outcomes of both monetary and fiscal policy...|$|E
40|$|Monetary and Fiscal {{policies}} {{interact in}} many ways. Recently the stance of fiscal policy {{in a number}} of countries has raised concerns about the risks for the outcomes of monetary policy. This paper first shows that these concerns are justified since, under ambitious fiscal policy makers, inflation bias and lack of monetary policy credibility may obtain in equilibrium even if the central banker is fully independent, patient and responsible. To reach a solution, the paper proposes an asynchronous game framework that generalises the <b>standard</b> <b>commitment</b> analysis. It allows concurrent and partial commitment; both policies may be committed at the same time for varying degrees or different periods. It is demonstrated that these undesirable outcomes can be prevented if monetary commitment is sufficiently strong relative to fiscal commitment. Interestingly, monetary commitment can not only resist fiscal pressure, but also discipline an ambitious fiscal policy maker to achieve socially desirable outcomes for both policies. We extend the setting to the European monetary union case with a common central bank and many fiscal policy makers, to show that these results carry over. The implication therefore is: by explicitly committing to a long run inflation target, the central bank can not only ensure its credibility, but also indirectly induce more disciplined fiscal policies. The paper shows that these predictions are broadly supported empirically. asynchronous moves; Battle of sexes; commitment; Game of chicken; inflation targeting; monetary-fiscal interactions...|$|E

40|$|The Ford Pinto’s {{fuel tank}} {{was prone to}} rupture in {{collisions}} above 20 mph, sometimes resulting in burn deaths. An infamous Ford memo estimated {{the cost of a}} shield correcting the problem at $ 11. Should Ford have installed the shield, holding public safety paramount, or, respecting consumer autonomy, have made the shield an option? Answering this question requires distinguishing between three kinds of autonomy: merechoice autonomy (deciding something for oneself, regardless of the content of the choice), proclamative autonomy (making a choice that holds up a value or <b>standard,</b> <b>commitment</b> to which is partly definitive of who one is), and high-impact autonomy (making a choice that profoundly affects one’s ability to make proclamative choices). (This is not a formal distinction, that is, a distinction meant be to be clear, rigorous, and neutral). Autonomy is thus asymmetric: choosing to do x may be highly proclamative while choosing not to do x is not. In the Pinto case, not giving consumers the option of declining the shield undercuts only mere-choice autonomy. Several arguments are provided (including an argument based on the nature of moral agency) that proclamative autonomy (and, derivatively, high-impact autonomy), rather than mere-choice autonomy, has significant positive value. More precisely, it is argued that, as a rule, the more proclamative a choice is, other things being equal, the more weight autonomy claims about that choice possess. The paper concludes that common sense is correct about the Pinto case. In some instances, consumer choice may legitimately count more than the engineer’s commitment to public safety (particularly when proclamative choice is involved). However, losing the opportunity to save $ 11 is not too large a price to pay in order to counter market pressures against safety by inducing in engineers a professional commitment to put safety first...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new flavor of commitment schemes, which we call mercurial commitments. Informally, mercurial <b>commitments</b> are <b>standard</b> <b>commitments</b> that have been extended to allow for soft decommitment. Soft decommitments, on the one hand, are not binding but, on the other hand, cannot be in conflict with true decommitments. We then demonstrate that a particular instantiation of mercurial commitments has been implicitly used by Micali, Rabin and Kilian to construct zero-knowledge sets. (A zero-knowledge set scheme allows a Prover to (1) commit to a set S {{in a way that}} reveals nothing about S and (2) prove to a Verifier, in zero-knowledge, statements of the form x ∈ S and x / ∈ S.) The rather complicated construction of Micali et al. becomes easy to understand when viewed as a more general construction with mercurial commitments as an underlying building block. By providing mercurial commitments based on various assumptions, we obtain several different new zero-knowledge set constructions...|$|R

It argues that a fruitful way to (re) formulate the values, <b>standards,</b> <b>commitments</b> and 'internal goods' of ABE as a field is to construe it as inheriting the educational traditions and telos of practical philosophy. The thesis starts from the assumption that ABE has already been seriously deformed by being thrust into the forefront of governmental strategies for meeting the challenges of a globalizing economy. However, rather than respond directly to this immediate policy context, the thesis responds by working towards the formulation of a deeper understanding and articulation of ABE as a field of adult education in and for itself. To this purpose, the thesis reaches back behind modernist construals and practices of education to an older tradition of education oriented to governance of the polis—practical philosophy—a form of education designed to cultivate practical wisdom (phronesis), not knowledge (episterne) or vocational skill (techne). The thesis adduces Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutic as a contemporary (re) appropriation of this ancient tradition of practical philosophy which dialogically attunes it to the 'postmodern times' in which ABE now finds itself...|$|R
