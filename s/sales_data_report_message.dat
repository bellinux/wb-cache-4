METHODS: Quarterly cigarette <b>sales</b> <b>data</b> <b>reported</b> by the California State Board of Equalization between 1980 and 1992 were used to estimate a time-series model, adjusted for seasonal variations and time trends. RESULTS: The estimated results show that sales of cigarettes were reduced by 819 million packs from the third quarter of 1990 through the fourth quarter of 1992 owing to an additional 25 -cent state tax increase, while the anti-smoking media campaign reduced the cigarette sales by 232 million packs during the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Both taxation and anti-smoking media campaigns are effective means of reducing cigarette consumption. The strength of those effects, however, is influenced by the magnitude of the taxes and the amount of media campaign expenditures...|$|R

Proposition 99 also earmarked 20 % of the revenue raised by this new tax for an anti-smoking media campaign and other educational programs to reduce tobacco use. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the relative effects of taxation versus the anti-smoking media campaign on cigarette <b>sales.</b> Quarterly <b>sales</b> <b>data</b> <b>reported</b> by the California State Board of Equalization between 1980 and 1992, adjusted for seasonal variations and time trends, show that sales of cigarettes were reduced by 1333 million packs as a result of the additional 25 -cent tax, while the anti-smoking media campaign reduced cigarette sales by 232 million packs during the same period, July 1990 - December 1992. The combined effects of taxes and the anti-smoking media campaign during the 4 -year post Proposition 99 period resulted in 1. 565 billion fewer packs of cigarettes sold in California. The magnitude of those effects is influenced by the magnitude of taxes compared with the amount of the anti- smoking media campaign budget. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} energy-efficient time synchronization in {{a wireless}} sensor network where a head node (i. e., a gateway between wired and wireless networks and a center of data fusion) {{is equipped with a}} powerful processor and supplied power from outlet, and sensor nodes (i. e., nodes measuring data and connected only through wireless channels) are limited in processing and battery-powered. It is this asymmetry that our study focuses on; unlike most existing schemes to save the power of all network nodes, we concentrate on battery-powered sensor nodes in minimizing energy consumption for time synchronization. We present a time synchronization scheme based on asynchronous source clock frequency recovery and reverse two-way message exchanges combined with measurement <b>data</b> <b>report</b> <b>messages,</b> where we minimize the number of message transmissions from sensor nodes, and carry out the performance analysis of the estimation of both measurement time and clock frequency with lower bounds for the latter.

40|$|Understanding urban use {{patterns}} of synthetic pyrethroid pesticides {{is an important}} component of their re-evaluation by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR). Some urban uses are reported in DPR’s Pesticide Use Reporting system (PUR), while certain other uses are unreported. This latter category includes residential home and garden uses, and most industrial and institutional uses. Most estimates of unreported urban pesticide use are based on differences between pesticide <b>sales</b> <b>data</b> and PUR <b>reported</b> pesticide use. Here we examine the accuracy of this estimation procedure by comparing pesticide use and <b>sales</b> <b>data</b> from 2006 and 2007. Annual use and <b>sales</b> <b>data</b> retrieved from DPR’s PUR and the Sales Database were compared side by side on an (a) individual product basis, (b) primary EPA registration number basis, and (c) total pounds of active ingredient (AI) basis. There were four types of disagreements between reported annual use and sales. Among the 1, 127 group III pyrethroid individual products reported used and/or sold in 2006 and 2007, 73 % were of type 2 and type 4 disagreements where reported use was greater than reported sales, while 27 % were of type 1 and type 3 disagreements with reported use less than reported sales. Possible reasons for each type of disagreement were identified. We conclude that although unreported urban pesticide use can be estimated as the difference between sales and use in theory, the large uncertainties in PUR, <b>sales</b> <b>data,</b> and associated errors severely undermine the accuracy of those estimates. Consequently it is impossible to derive meaningful estimates of unreported urban use at any of the levels of data aggregation studied (product, EPA primary registration number or total pounds active ingredient) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to re-examine the task-media fit model of {{communications}} by adopting an interactive approach and thus taking into account the influence of time. Task-media fit is manifest in communication artifacts such as emails, minutes of meetings, reports or flowcharts. Task-media fit theory holds that when communication tasks (e. g. sharing <b>sales</b> <b>data,</b> work-in progress <b>reports</b> or technical <b>data)</b> are matched with the appropriate media (e. g. email, text, face-to-face), a more effective communication is likely to occur at that moment in time. By adopting a multi-methods approach, this longitudinal study explores how communication practices shape a new business relationship. Our findings show how different forms of time (horizontal, vertical, standardized, and planned time) interact and are variously privileged in complex task-media fit judgments. Findings show how task-media fit judgments change as they unfold over time, stabilizing to create communication norms that then become disrupted by critical events. Communication artifacts are emergent and relational, to what has gone before and what is intended to come next...|$|R
