40|$|Objective-To compare 4 assay {{procedures}} for prediction of passive transfer status in lambs. Animals-Thirty-one 1 -day-old Sardinian lambs. Procedure-Serum IgG concentration {{was determined by}} use of single radial immunodiffusion, The following were determined: <b>serum</b> total protein concentration as measured by refractometry (ie, refractometry <b>serum</b> total protein concentration), <b>serum</b> total protein concentration {{as determined by the}} biuret method (ie, biuret method <b>serum</b> total protein concentration), <b>serum</b> gamma-globulin concentration as determined by <b>serum</b> protein electrophoresis, and <b>serum</b> gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity as measured by spectrophotometry. Accuracy of these assays for estimation of <b>serum</b> IgG concentration in 1 -day-old lambs was established by use of linear regression analysis. Results-Refractometry <b>serum</b> total protein concentration, biuret method <b>serum</b> total protein concentration, and <b>serum</b> gamma-globulin concentration were closely and linearly correlated with <b>serum</b> IgG concentration. The natural logarithm (In) of <b>serum</b> GGT activity was closely and linearly correlated with <b>serum</b> IgG concentration (In) Refractometry <b>serum</b> total protein concentration, biuret method <b>serum</b> total protein concentration, and gamma-globulin concentration accounted for approximately 85 %, 91 %, and 95 % of the variation in <b>serum</b> IgG concentration, respectively. <b>Serum</b> GGT activity (In) accounted for approximately 92 % of the variation in <b>serum</b> IgG concentration (In). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-For prediction of passive transfer status in 1 -day-old lambs, <b>serum</b> GGT activity or biuret method <b>serum</b> total protein concentration determination will allow for passive transfer monitoring program development. Immediate refractometry <b>serum</b> total protein concentration determination is beneficial in making timely management and treatment decisions. <b>Serum</b> gamma-globulin concentration determination {{can be used as a}} confirmatory test.

In 16 patients with hyperthyroidism, increased post-heparin plasma hepatic lipase activity, decreased <b>serum</b> total cholesterol and <b>serum</b> high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were found while lipoprotein lipase activity and <b>serum</b> triglyceride were normal. In six patients with overt hypothyroidism <b>serum</b> total cholesterol and triglyceride were increased, post-heparin plasma hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase were decreased while <b>serum</b> high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was normal.

When the three groups of patients became euthyroid, <b>serum</b> total cholesterol, <b>serum</b> triglyceride, post-heparin plasma hepatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and <b>serum</b> high-density lipoprotein cholesterol reverted to normal except for <b>serum</b> high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the hyperthyroid group which showed no significant change with treatment.

2500|$|In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, {{and this}} time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he {{switched}} <b>serums</b> with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One’s dagger and uses it to control Gold to [...] take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Fortunately, Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to [...] "do what is necessary" [...] to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of [...] "weakness," [...] but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that “necessity” will make her love him once again.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Fetuin-A is a {{circulating}} inhibitor {{of calcium}} deposition in the vasculature {{and may be}} involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Low plasma fetuin-A level is independently associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease mortality among men and women without diabetes; in addition, low level of fetuin-A is linked to mortality in patients on dialysis. Aim of the study The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the role of fetuin-A as a marker for microvascular and macrovascular diseases in a high-risk population of end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis, with and without diabetes mellitus. Patients and methods This study included 30 end-stage renal disease patients on regular hemodialysis, with and without diabetes and 10 age-matched and sex-matched apparently healthy controls. All patients were subjected to careful history-taking, including history of strokes and acute myocardial infarction and thorough physical examinations, and cardiac assessment was performed using ECG and ECHO. Routine laboratory tests were performed, such as hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, <b>serum</b> creatinine, <b>serum</b> urea, <b>serum</b> Na, <b>serum</b> K, uric acid, <b>serum</b> cholesterol, <b>serum</b> triglycerides, <b>serum</b> aspartate aminotransferase, <b>serum</b> alanine aminotransferase, <b>serum</b> albumin, <b>serum</b> calcium, <b>serum</b> phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), <b>serum</b> iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and <b>serum</b> fetuin-A. Results The study showed significant statistical decrease in <b>serum</b> fetuin-A level in chronic renal failure (CRF) and diabetes patients with vascular strokes when compared with CRF patients and CRF patients with diabetes without history of vascular strokes. There was significant positive correlation between fetuin-A and hemoglobin, <b>serum</b> Ca, <b>serum</b> albumin, TIBC, and total protein (TP), whereas there was significant negative correlation between fetuin-A and <b>serum</b> cholesterol, <b>serum</b> triglyceride (TG), fasting blood glucose (FBG), <b>serum</b> urea, <b>serum</b> creatinine, <b>serum</b> uric acis (UA), iPTH, <b>serum</b> Na, and <b>serum</b> K. No correlation was found between fetuin-A and age or BMI. Conclusion Our findings suggest a unique role for fetuin-A deficiency as a biomarker of vascular diseases in the setting of CRF and type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- <b>Serum</b> {{separator}} tube {{is composed}} of synthetic polymer gels designed to separate <b>serum</b> from the formed elements. In line with this, an alternative <b>serum</b> separator gel using 0. 25 g/mL concentrated Ipomoea batatas starch extract was produced. Results show that all the samples in the alternative <b>serum</b> separator gel successfully separated the <b>serum</b> from the formed elements. However the <b>serum</b> blood glucose levels using the alternative <b>serum</b> separator gel showed no evidence of agreement [ρϲ = 0. 133, CI 95 %:- 0. 23 to 0. 46] when compared with commercial <b>serum</b> separator tube...|$|R
