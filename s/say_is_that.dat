The cousins recorded events in her later life, but they found Josephine evasive about the timing and nature of events during her time in the Arizona Territory and Tombstone. She would not even talk about the key events of 1881-82, their key years in Tombstone.

500|$|After the {{publication}} of this letter, Bernard Becker, special correspondent of the Daily News, traveled to Ireland to cover Boycott's situation. On 24October, he wrote a dispatch from Westport that contained an interview with Boycott. He reported that Boycott had £500 worth of crops that would rot if help {{could not be found}} to harvest them. According to Becker, [...] "Personally he is protected, but no woman in Ballinrobe would dream of washing him a cravat or making him a loaf. All the people have to <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are sorry, but that they 'dare not. Boycott had been advised to leave, but he told Becker that [...] "I can hardly desert Lord Erne, and, moreover, my own property is sunk in this place." [...] Becker's report was reprinted in the Belfast News-Letter and the Dublin Daily Express. On 29October, the Dublin Daily Express published a letter proposing a fund to finance a party of men to go to County Mayo to save Boycott's crops. Between them, the Daily Express, Daily Telegraph, Daily News, and News Letter raised £2,000 to fund the relief expedition.|$|E

[...] According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] is played in the key of D minor and the track's time signature is common time. The song, which is cited as being a pop song, has a moderately slow tempo of 90 beats per minute. Instruments used include a piano and guitar. Jon Pareles stated that Jackson was calling himself [...] "a victim of police brutality" [...] and a [...] "victim of hate". He continued, [...] "A listener might wonder just who 'Us' is supposed to be... To make the songs lodge in the ear, Jackson uses elementary singsong melodies – a 'nyah, nyah' two-note motif in 'They Don't Care About Us'... and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements".|$|E
500|$|Allan Girdler and Glynn Kerr {{nonetheless}} still {{favor the}} Roper, even by Cameron's criterion. The reason, they <b>say,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it did in}} fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies, including the twistgrip throttle control, and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle {{as we know it}} today, while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude, failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the front fork, and turn by leaning. Rake and trail are created by having the steering axis angled to varying degrees, rather than perfectly vertical, and by having the steering axis slightly offset, creating trail. This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the counterintuitive, and typically unconscious, technique of countersteering, in which the handlebar is turned slightly to the left, causing the machine to lean to the right, and turning the vehicle to the right. Trail, also called fork offset, is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, and the lack of it was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down, so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle. David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed [...] "a crude makeshift", saying, [...] "as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date." ...|$|E

500|$|Morris {{managed a}} century in each innings of the Fourth Test at Adelaide, making 122 and 124 not out in {{extremely}} hot weather. This {{made him the}} second Australian after Warren Bardsley to score two centuries in one Ashes Test. With Australia having fallen to 2/24 {{at the end of}} play on the second day in response to England's first innings score of 460, Morris combined with Lindsay Hassett, who scored 78, to lead a recovery. After England's Denis Compton scored his second century of the match in the second innings, Morris put in another determined effort to ensure a draw. With the match secure, Morris played more aggressively towards the end in an unbeaten 99-run partnership with Bradman. Ahead of the final Test, Morris made 44 and 47 for New South Wales in a drawn match against Hammond's men. He made 57 in the Fifth Test in Sydney to end the series with an aggregate of 503 runs, at an average of 71.85, second only to Bradman. He ended his first full first-class season with 1234 runs at 68.55, partnering Sid Barnes {{at the top of the}} order at both state and international level. E. W. Swanton wrote [...] "Morris set himself up as a No. 1 for Australia for a while to come ...

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the failed coup, Diệm blamed Durbrow for a {{perceived}} lack of US support, while his brother Nhu further accused the ambassador of colluding with the rebels. Durbrow denied this in later years, saying that he had been [...] "100% in support of Diệm". In January 1961, Diệm told Kahin of his belief the US had been involved, while Nhu told Karnow [...] "the principal culprits in the revolt were the 'western embassies' and individual Americans in particular ... American military advisers were helping the paratroopers during the revolt." [...] In May 1961, Nhu said [...] "he least you can <b>say</b> ... <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the State Department was neutral between a friendly government and rebels who tried to put that government down ... and the official attitude of the Americans during that coup was not at all the attitude the President would have expected". For Diệm, that Durbrow had called for restraint was an indication he saw Diệm and the rebels as equals, something Diệm saw as anathema. Durbrow called for Diệm to treat the remaining rebel leaders leniently, stressing the need for Diệm to [...] "unify all elements of the country", but Diệm was adamantly opposed to this, angrily rebuffing the ambassador, saying [...] "You apparently do not understand that the rebels caused much blood-letting", accusing them having [...] "duped" [...] innocent people. Diệm also sent Gene Gregory, an American supporter who edited the Times of Vietnaman English-language newspaper operated as a mouthpiece for the Nhus and known for stridently attacking Ngô family opponentsto meet Durbrow with concrete evidence of [...] "American support of and complicity in the coup". From the coup onwards, Diệm became increasingly suspicious of Washington's policies. He was also angry with US media coverage of the coup, which depicted Diệm as authoritarian and the revolt as a manifestation of widespread discontent. Diệm instead viewed opposition simply as troublemakers.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics. Speaking of the premiere, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV {{noted that the}} special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom {{and one of the}} surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough." [...] In contrast, Kelly West of TV Blend was critical of the premiere, writing: [...] "I don’t think based on the first episode that we can say that Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can <b>say</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago, we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
