2500|$|In {{contrast}} are {{the more}} recent comments from Vice Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., deputy chief of naval operations for communication networks (OPNAV N-6) and deputy chief information officer, Department of the Navy. [...] "I believe that NMCI in 2008 is achieving {{much of what we}} had hoped NMCI would achieve. It's leveled the playing field for security. It's allowed us to do things like push security patches that go through the whole enterprise that's on NMCI. If you look at NMCI historically, it was probably the first step for the Navy to move into what was then called Joint Vision 2010 and now is Joint Vision 2020. It's actually done that, and it's moving the Navy toward the U.S. Defense Department's goal of information superiority. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> {{a lot of good things}} with NMCI." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gun in Your Pocket {{was finally}} {{released}} in October 2012 as the B-side to Cool Zombie, the eventual first single from the album (which finally emerged in January 2013). [...] In {{addition to this}} song, Baillie and Adam Ant composed a second track about the Ross-Brand affair, Rubber Medusa, a song focussed mainly on Brand and written from Baillie's perspective. [...] Baillie's band, the Poussez Posse, performed this second song regularly in live support slots for Ant's UK tours during 2011–2012. [...] Commenting on the two songs in an interview by John Robb, Baillie noted [...] "The first one that Adam and I wrote was about an ex of mine- guess who! Which {{is not on the}} album, which is called Gun in Your Pocket ...(Subsequently) the first one Adam and I wrote together was Rubber Medusa, which was about Russell, Adam came up with the title which is a quote from the Jubilee film, (Brand) does look like a rubber Medusa <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> why he said it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. G. (Calmly {{settling}} {{herself in}} long chair.) <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>see.</b> What a mess you're making! Why have you brought all that smelly leather stuff into the house? ...|$|E

60|$|She <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>see,</b> and feel. My true and {{faithful}} lover, {{where is your}} 'eternal constancy,' 'unalterable trust,' and 'reverent devotion'? I remember those phrases; {{you seem to have}} forgotten them. I mention a man's name.|$|E
6000|$|... "They didn't do nothing. And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as <b>I</b> <b>see.</b> They tiptoed away; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen,</b> easy enough, that they'd shoved {{in there}} to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up; and found you WARN'T up, and so they was hoping to slide {{out of the way}} of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you up." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{smiled as}} I {{rang the bell}} for the lift. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> might <b>see</b> my lady of the turquoises again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> that fraternal love before under similar circumstances, and it {{has always}} ended in the same way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> {{the crooked}} logic of your mind. You might {{go so far}} as to say to him: 'Refuse me this, and I shall refuse to be your marquise.' You would {{go so far as}} that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> him! there! there! {{going to}} leeward still; what a leaping spout!-- Hands off from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again! Set the sail; out oars; the helm!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it did, so it did," [...] Hiram agreed. [...] "I can't gainsay you there, Jacob Carey; now {{you put it}} <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> {{there is}} {{something}} in it, though never before have I heard of there being anything in the curse except in the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yessir! You {{sure are}} wet! Gee! <b>I</b> never <b>seen</b> anyone <b>so</b> wet! <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> wet guys, but <b>I</b> never <b>seen</b> anyone <b>so</b> wet as you. Yessir, you're {{certainly}} wet!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, sir! You {{sure are}} wet! Gee! <b>I</b> never <b>seen</b> anyone <b>so</b> wet! <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> wet guys but <b>I</b> never <b>seen</b> anyone <b>so</b> wet as you. Yessir, you're {{certainly}} wet!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord, {{long live}} your fair Countess," [...] said Varney; [...] "but neither your love nor my good wishes can make her immortal. But God grant she live {{long to be}} happy herself, and to render you <b>so!</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> not but you may be King of England notwithstanding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. I {{am glad to}} {{know that}} they are nothing; and that I may now trust that you have {{consulted}} my wishes, and have reserved your animosity solely for me," [...] returned Brant quietly. [...] "That being <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> no reason for your hurrying your departure in the least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll try, but {{she goes}} up to read to Uncle, you know, and since he has had the gout, she stays later, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> little {{of her in the}} evening. There she goes now. I think she will captivate the old one as well as the young one, she is so devoted." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You knowed as I wor goin' ter marry 'er directly, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>see</b> as {{it matters}} o' th' day. I non wanted a' th' pub talkin'——'' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} been, as {{fortunate}} as myself, {{and why you}} should be more <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> no reason," [...] cried the soldier, throwing a glance of cool contempt at the other: [...] "fear whitens the cheek, and ladies best love to be seen when the roses flourish rather than the lilies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean immediately. And--I may as {{well tell}} you now--I mean for my own time. I want," [...] Charlotte said, [...] "to have him at last a little to myself; I want, strange {{as it may seem}} to you"--and she gave it all its weight [...] "to KEEP the man I've married. And to do <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>see,</b> I must act." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{just the}} contrary, my lord! It is because I see only too well that I am forced to bandage my eyes. Even <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> {{as well as people}} who have no bandage. When I take it off my eyes pierce through everything. Everything I look at catches fire, or, if it cannot catch fire, it falls into a {{thousand}} pieces. They call me Quickeye.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right. It's {{better than}} doing Thucydides with Downing. We've got math till the interval, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>see</b> {{anything}} of him all day; which won't hurt me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take them bunnets an' {{things off}} <b>so</b> <b>I</b> kin <b>see</b> your faces," [...] ordered the old man, {{at the same}} time keeping the crowd covered with his shotgun.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold {{the light}} <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can <b>see</b> to sort this truck," [...] he said, and plunged {{his hand into}} the bag. It was white when he brought it out.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it now, {{but there}} is {{something}} harsh in the earnest intensity of youth, and having at first taken all these things quite seriously, the fiery hell and God's vindictiveness at any neglect, as though they were as much a matter of fact as Bladden's iron-works and Rawdon's pot-bank, I presently with an equal seriousness flung them out of my mind again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Messy {{style of}} feeding, that," [...] said Kotick. They bowed again, and Kotick {{began to lose}} his temper. [...] "Very good," [...] he said. [...] "If you do happen to have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn't show off <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names." [...] The split lips moved and twitched; and the glassy green eyes stared, {{but they did not}} speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{not that}} we can do anything," [...] De Pascal said. [...] "We have heard that these torchlight gatherings are part of a plan for a sham attack on a castle, or {{something}} of that sort, for the amusement of the king. Doubtless the soldiers are gathered for that purpose. We cannot arouse La Rochefoucauld, at this hour of the night, that is certain; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> nothing to do but to go home, and wait till morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> from Severn's brink [...] A {{flock of}} geese jump down together; Swim where the bird of Jove would sink, [...] And, swimming, never wet a feather.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, not <b>so</b> muchamuch. <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> a woman {{come through}} here {{yesterday}} that was swell, though--had on a purple dress and white {{shoes and a}} hat big 's a bushel." ...|$|R
