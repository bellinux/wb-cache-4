30|$|Traditional <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> is {{primarily}} concerned with the positioning, existence and timing of the temporary facilities that are used throughout the construction project (Mawdesley & Al-Jibouri 2003), and the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> problem can be dissected into the following sub-problems: (1) identifying the shape {{and size of the}} facilities to be laid out; (2) identifying the constraints between facilities; and (3) determining the relative positions of these facilities (Zouein et al. 2002). In order to study the space utilization of construction sites, research of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> has been carried out and many studies have attempted to solve <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> problems. The research within this scope can be classified according to two different criteria: (1) optimization algorithms and (2) visualization.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Site {{space is}} limited {{resource}} where all temporary facilities {{are to be}} provided within boundary of construction site. In India <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> is mostly a neglected aspect. For <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> various techniques are used such as Genetic Algorithm, Simulation techniques and Ant colony. In this study Genetic Algorithm is discussed in detail. This work also focuses on the various software being used for the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> problem. The review of literature for various aspects other than economy is presented this paper...|$|R
30|$|Under {{the first}} criterion, {{researchers}} have used {{different kinds of}} optimization algorithms to solve <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> problems. Zouein et al. (2002) tried to resolve transportation cost problems in construction <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> by using genetic algorithm analysis. Mawdesley and Al-Jibouri (2003) used a genetic algorithm to reduce {{the costs associated with}} transportation paths, and both Lam et al. (2009) and Ning et al. (2010) combined the genetic algorithm and the Max-min Ant system (MMAS) to provide a computing method for reducing cost and transportation time. Wong et al. (2010) utilized genetic algorithms to optimize a layout for precast facilities on a construction site. One of the limitations of these algorithms is that some of them assume that all the facilities in the construction site can be represented by box shapes. Researchers have tried other approaches of developing automated optimization of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> (Elbeltagi et al. 2001; Lam et al. 2007; Easa & Hossain 2008).|$|R
30|$|In summary, a {{new method}} {{that focuses on}} the {{accessibility}} issue by realistically simulating mobile units needs to be developed. Winch and North (2006) interviewed 18 experienced site planners and concluded that a construction space planning system should be a decision supporting system instead of a decision making system. Therefore, we aimed to develop a computation-based decision supporting sandbox system to deal with this problem. In this research, we propose a tool that can easily evaluate transportation access and also indicate potential problems of site layout plans. The system is composed of four modules: (1) transportation, (2) site importing, (3) accessibility evaluation, and (4) visualization. Using this system, we can easily simulate transportation processes in a construction site and test the safety and accessibility of the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>plan.</b> The system {{can also be used to}} visualize the test results. Engineers can therefore easily identify the unsafe parts of a site and mitigate potential accessibility problems.|$|E
40|$|Part 3 : Knowledge Based Production ManagementInternational audienceHaving an {{efficient}} construction site layout can significantly impact the productivity, cost {{and safety of}} a construction project. Construction site layout planning is therefore recognized as a critical step in construction planning by researchers. In literature this {{is often described as}} an optimization process where some objectives (e. g. safety, cost savings) are pursued within the constraints of the site and facilities requirements. Such models are usually complex and difficult for practitioners to apply, and usually result in each project having its unique <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>plan.</b> The authors challenge this by proposing a standard layout template that can easily be utilized in planning of multiple construction sites. It is argued that each site should be treated as a factory and that similarity between sites should be pursued {{due to the nature of}} the construction industry. The template has been developed in collaboration with a Norwegian contractor, utilizing the action research approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{layout of}} temporary facilities on {{a construction site}} has a large impact on construction safety and productivity. For the duration of a project the site layout {{may need to be}} efficiently re-organized at various intervals to satisfy the schedule requirements and to maintain site efficiency. This paper presents a practical model for schedule-dependent site layout planning in construction. The proposed model uses a combination of artificial intelligence tools (knowledge-based systems, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms) to generate, optimize, and re-organize the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>plan</b> at frequent intervals during the project. The model incorporates flexible representation of irregular site shapes and several options for placing facilities. Based on the proposed model, an automated system is developed, fully integrated with widely used scheduling software. At each schedule interval, the system recalculates the space requirements and, for the convenience of congested sites, can utilize parts of the constructed space to accommodate temporary facilities. Details of the schedule-dependent model are described, and its application in an actual case study project is presented to demonstrate its capabilities.

40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} (GAs) {{have been}} introduced into <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> as reported {{in a number of}} studies. In these studies, the objective functions were defined so as to employ the GAs in searching for the optimal <b>site</b> <b>layout.</b> However, few studies have been carried out to investigate the actual closeness of relationships between site facilities; it is these relationships that ultimately govern the <b>site</b> <b>layout.</b> This study has determined that the underlying factors of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> for medium-size projects include work flow, personnel flow, safety and environment, and personal preferences. By finding the weightings on these factors and the corresponding closeness indices between each facility, a closeness relationship has been deduced. Two contemporary mathematical approaches - fuzzy logic theory and an entropy measure - were adopted in finding these results in order to minimize the uncertainty and vagueness of the collected data and improve the quality of the information. GAs were then applied to searching for the optimal <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> in a medium-size government project using the GeneHunter software. The objective function involved minimizing the total travel distance. An optimal layout was obtained within a short time. This reveals that the application of GA to <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> is highly promising and efficient. Site-layout, entropy, genetic algorithm, decision-making,...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the serious}} tasks in the {{construction}} <b>planning</b> was the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> as it had a considerable effect on construction sites. However, in practice <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> was often ignored or overlooked due to its complexity. Project Managers often performed a <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> based on experience, ad-hoc rules and first-come-first-serve approach which may lead to inefficient <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> that had {{a negative effect on}} construction projects. Therefore, the automated systems can be considered as the most effective methods to develop an efficient <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> as they fully covered all concerns that cannot be taken into account by manual methods. Although, a lot of automated <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> systems had been developed to support this serious planning task. However, they remained having serious limitations and drawbacks such as a single objective, integrating with regular facilities and site areas only, 2 D <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> representation, inefficient approaches to reflect the dynamic nature of construction sites, ignoring space reuse and facilities relocation, equal area space search, generating static layout, did not cover end users’ requirements, highly complex for users, ignoring the user interaction and lacking of flexibility in the system design. This revealed the need to develop new automated systems to cover the limitations and drawbacks of the existing automated systems and offer the end users’ requirements. Furtherer more, the quantitative study of survey returned by twelve participations from the Egyptian sites guided this research to list the end users’ requirements. These results led to identifying MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the suitable tool and technique to overcome the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> limitations and shortcomings as well as offer the end users’ requirements. Therefore, this research had developed an automated dynamic <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> system (ASLS) which had positive impacts on the construction industry in terms of: (1) improving the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> and space <b>planning</b> (2) maintaining the construction projects cost and time; (3) improving the overall safety of construction sites; and (4) protecting the surrounding environment. The automated system subjected to a validation process through two construction projects based in Egypt to examine its accuracy and effectiveness. The validation process results proved its accuracy and effectiveness in developing optimal <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> for construction projects. In addition, an evaluation process was used to examine its functionality, completeness, performance, usability and user acceptance through functional (black-box) test, structural (white-box) test and users’ trial. The functional (black-box) and structural (white-box) tests results verified its completeness and performance. The users’ trial results indicated its usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction and revealed that it was acceptable to use and efficient as it saved time. This research concluded that the developed automated system (ASLS) was effective and outperformed existing automated systems in generating global <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> while satisfying the layout constraints by offering a number of new capabilities. Furthermore, this research contributed to knowledge by creating an innovative dynamic space search method and formulation of a novel objective function that minimized the harmful effect of construction activity on the surrounding neighboring. Recommendation emerged from the research findings were used to suggest the integrating of the automated system with the Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate the data exchange and provide the project stakeholder with different scenarios of <b>site</b> <b>layout...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{management practices}} {{that have the}} potential to enhance productivity in building projects by focusing on construction methods. In phase 1 of the study, face-to-face interviews with nineteen experts were conducted to identify the best management practices for construction methods. The qualitative data analysis reached saturation and resulted in a list of best practices for construction methods that are relevant to the local industry. The second phase used an industry-wide survey to prioritize the best practices. Accordingly, project start-up plan, traffic control plan, machinery positioning strategy, project completion plan, and dynamic <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>plan</b> were shown to be the top five best practices for construction methods. The study also revealed that high levels of implementation of best practices are associated with low levels of project delays. The use of best practices also varied according to the project costs. There were no discernible differences between the top five best practices. The authors suggest that they should be implemented jointly to improve productivity in building projects.

The study revealed that some best practices that are applicable to infrastructure and industrial projects are not suitable for building projects.

The building is located {{in the heart of the}} Piran city centre and consists of ground and first floor with dimensions of 17, 0 x 10, 0 m. Reconstruction of the bearing structure and replacement of the existing wooden floor slab by a reinforced concrete one was foreseen.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Planning</b> {{construction}} <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> involves identifying, sizing and {{positioning of}} temporary facilities on site, and accordingly {{it has a}} significant impact on the safety and efficiency of construction operations. Although existing <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> models are capable of optimizing travel costs of resources on site, they do not consider safety as an important and independent objective in <b>planning</b> <b>site</b> <b>layouts.</b> This paper presents an enhanced <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> model that enables simultaneous optimization of construction safety and travel cost of resources. The model integrates two recently developed safety performance criteria that are designed to improve the safety of crane operations, and enhance the control of hazardous material on site. The optimization model is designed to consider all relevant decision variables, optimization objectives and practical constraints in this <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> problem, and is implemented using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. As such, the developed model enables construction planners to search for and identify optimal locations of all temporary facilities on site in order to minimize construction safety and cost simultaneously.

30|$|In short, the {{majority}} of previous {{studies have focused on}} how to reduce the transportation costs of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning.</b> They utilized mathematical models and algorithms to compute the least distance between facilities. Thus, in current <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> methods, the location of facilities will be largely determined by considerations such as the distance to materials, the transportation time and the transportation cost (Hegazy & Elbeltagi 1999; Mawdesley et al. 2002; Tam et al. 2002; Zouein et al. 2002). Although these methods can generate a plan with paths of the least distance or lowest transportation costs, the accessibility issue is neglected. In a real site situation, the accessibility of transportation vehicles can directly affect the progress of work. If the transportation path is difficult to navigate due to obstacles or convoluted routes in a narrow working area, even if the distance is shorter, it can lower the efficiency of the operation. Furthermore, it can occasionally cause additional damage and costs (Soltani et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> {{problem has}} been studied by several researchers for the last 15 years; each presenting it from his/her own perspective. Yet, one fundamental aspect of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> was not as well investigated and documented in the literature, that is considering several planning objectives simultaneously. In principle, objectives need to be achieved by a <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> are many and could include transportation costs, labor movement, material handling, safety consideration, etc. These objectives are rather heterogeneous {{and in some cases}} conflicting. The paper attempts to handle this reality by using the optimization capabilities of goal programming (GP). While traditional optimization tools aim at finding the optimum solution for an objective function, GP seeks a solution that satisfies as many goals as possible rather than optimizing a single goal, which fully suits the case in hand. Formulation and specifics of the GP model are elaborated on in the paper, including use of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to identify the priorities among the various objectives.

40|$|<b>Planning</b> the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> of {{construction}} projects {{is a crucial}} task that has {{a significant impact on}} construction cost, productivity, and safety. It involves the positioning and dynamic relocation of temporary facilities that are needed to support various construction activities on site such as offices, storage areas, workshops, and parking areas. Due to the complexity of the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> problem, construction managers often perform this task using previous experience, ad-hoc rules, and first-come-first-serve approach which leads to ambiguity and even to inefficiency. Accordingly, a number of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> models have been developed {{over the past three decades}} to support this important planning task. Despite the contributions of existing <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> models, they have a number of limitations that require additional research in five main areas in order to: (1) ensure global optimization of dynamic <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning; (2) integrate material procurement and <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> in a construction logistics planning model; (3) enhance the utilization of interior building spaces for material storage areas on congested construction sites; (4) enable automated retrieval and integration of all necessary data {{of construction}} logistics and <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> from available design and planning documents; and (5) consider security needs and constraints during the construction of critical infrastructure projects. Accordingly, the main objectives of this study are to: (1) formulate novel models of dynamic <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> (DSLP) that are capable of generating global optimal solutions of DSLP problems by considering the effects of first stage layout decisions on the layouts of subsequent stages; (2) develop an innovative optimization model for construction logistics planning (CLP) that is capable of integrating and optimizing the critical planning decisions of material procurement and material storage on construction sites; (3) formulate a new multi-objective optimization model for Congested Construction Logistics Planning that is capable of modeling and utilizing interior and exterior spaces in order to generate optimal logistics plans for congested construction sites; (4) develop a multi-objective automated system for construction logistics optimization that enables seamless retrieval and integration of project spatial, temporal, and logistics data as well as generating and reporting optimal plans of material procurement and site layouts; and (5) formulate a multi-objective optimization framework for <b>planning</b> construction <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> and <b>site</b> security systems of critical infrastructure projects. First, two novel optimization models are developed that are capable of generating global optimal solutions of dynamic <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> in order to minimize resources travel and facilities relocation costs while complying with various site geometric constraints. The first model, DSLP-GA, is implemented using Genetic Algorithms while the second model, DSLP-ADP, is formulated using Approximate Dynamic Programming. These two models are designed to optimize facilities locations and orientations over construction stages to minimize total layout costs, which include the travel cost of construction resources and the cost of relocating temporary facilities between construction stages. Furthermore, the developed models consider four types of geometric constraints (boundary, overlap, distance, and zone constraints), which can be used to represent site space availability as well as construction operational and/or safety requirements. The performance of these two models is evaluated using two examples to illustrate their capabilities in generating global optimal plans solutions for dynamic <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> problems. Second, a novel model of construction logistics planning (CLP) is developed to enable the integration and simultaneous optimization of critical planning decisions of material procurement and material storage on construction sites. Procurement decision variables are designed to identify the fixed-ordering-periods of each material in every construction stage, while dynamic layout decision variables are designed to identify the locations and orientations of material storage areas and other temporary facilities in each construction stage. The model utilizes Genetic Algorithms to generate optimal material procurement and layout decisions in order to minimize four types of construction logistics costs: material ordering, financing, stock-out, and layout costs. The performance of the developed CLP model is evaluated using an application example that illustrates the model capabilities in: (1) generating optimal procurement decisions that minimize ordering, financing, and stock-out costs while considering site space availability; and (2) generating optimal layout decisions that minimize layout costs while complying with material storage space needs as well as imposed operational and safety geometric constraints. Third, an innovative multi-objective optimization model for congested construction logistics planning (C 2 LP) is developed to help planners in utilizing interior building spaces and generating optimal logistics plans that minimize total logistics cost while minimizing the adverse impacts of interior material storage on project schedule. Interior building space is represented as a set of non-identical rooms that can be defined based on project architectural drawings, while exterior space is modeled as a grid of locations with planner-specified fixed spacing. The model utilizes multi-objective Genetic Algorithms to formulate and optimize four categories of decision variables: (1) material procurement that includes fixed-ordering-periods of every material in each stage; (2) material storage plan that includes material storage type, exterior grid location, exterior orientation angle, and/or interior storage location for every material in each stage; (3) temporary facilities <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> that identifies exterior grid location and orientation angle for every temporary facility in each stage; and (4) schedule of noncritical activities that identifies the number of minimum-shifting-days within the total float of each non-critical activity. Interior material storage plans are generated using novel computational algorithms that consider four main types of interior storage constraints: room space capacities, room creation times, room partitioning times, and permissible material interior storage periods. Furthermore, new algorithms are developed to calculate interior and exterior material handling costs as well as shifting of noncritical activities. C 2 LP model utilizes Genetic Algorithms to generate optimal solutions that represent optimal tradeoffs between the two conflicting objectives of minimizing total logistics costs and project schedule criticality. Fourth, a prototype automated multi-objective optimization system for construction logistics planning is implemented to support construction planners in generating optimal plans of material logistics and <b>site</b> <b>layout.</b> The system is developed in four main modules: (1) site spatial data retrieval module; (2) schedule data retrieval module; (3) relational database module; and (4) graphical user interface module. The site spatial data retrieval module is designed to facilitate the automated retrieval of site exterior dimensions and building geometric attributes (building footprint, floors, and rooms) from existing IFC-Based Building Information Models of the project. The schedule data retrieval module is designed to obtain the list of construction activities, their relationships, construction materials, and activities material demand from schedule database files that are exported from Microsoft Project. The relational database module is designed to store and integrate project spatial, temporal, and logistics input data considering their interdependencies in order to eliminate data inconsistencies. The user interface module is designed to facilitate data input and reporting of generated optimal material logistics plans. Fifth, a multi-objective optimization framework is developed to enable construction planners of critical infrastructure projects to plan and optimize the implementation of site physical security systems and <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> in order to minimize construction security risks and overall site costs. The framework is developed in four main phases: (1) risk identification and system modeling phase to identify security threats, attackers, and targets as well as site and security system geometric representation; (2) security lighting optimization phase to generate optimal tradeoff designs of fence and area lighting systems that consider the conflicting objectives of maximizing lighting performance while minimizing its system cost; (3) security-cost optimization phase to generate optimal site security systems that quantifies and simultaneously minimizes construction security risks and overall site cost; and (4) performance evaluation phase to test and analyze the performance of the proposed framework. The aforementioned developments of this research study contribute to enhancing the current practices of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> and material logistics planning and can lead to: (1) increasing the efficiency and global optimality of construction <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning; (2) improving construction productivity that can be realized as a result of the early coordination between material procurement and site space planning; (3) enhancing the utilization of interior building spaces for material storage areas while minimizing its possible negative impacts on construction operations and schedules; (4) increasing the security level on the construction sites of critical infrastructure projects; and (5) minimizing contractors site costs that cover the travel cost of resources on construction sites, material logistics, and site security systems...|$|R

In this paper, artificial neural networks are used to model the non-linear operations of a key site facility: a tower crane — for high-rise public housing construction. Then genetic algorithms are used to determine the locations of the tower crane, supply points and demand points by optimizing the transportation time and costs. The scope of this study confines to a defined area of construction: the structural concrete-frame construction stage of public housing projects. The developed genetic algorithm model for <b>site</b> facility <b>layout</b> and the artificial neural network model for predicting tower-crane operations are evaluated using a practical example. The optimization results of the example are very promising and it demonstrates the application value of the models. <b>Site</b> <b>Layout,</b> Genetic Algorithms, Tower Crane, Public Housing Construction,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the ISSP system for activity scheduling and <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> under spatial constraints. The importance of tying schedule and layout data {{has been established}} and dealt with extensively in the literature. Many decision-support tools were developed to assist planners in space scheduling but these were limited to providing the user with a platform that ties spatial and temporal data in the project and left {{it up to the}} user to decide on positions of resources and schedule adjustments to solve spatial conflicts that may arise in the process of constructing <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> over time. The ISSP system, presented here, provides a graphical user-interactive interface with underlying layout and scheduling algorithms that construct feasible layout and schedule solutions under 2 -dimensional spatial constraints between resources. The underlying algorithms optimize positions of resources by minimizing handling and rehandling costs of these on site. ISSP can also be integrated with existing scheduling and <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> decisionsupport tools to enable users to override the system’s decisions to reach “usersatisfycing” solutions.

40|$|Logistics {{operations}} in construction sites {{are one of}} the major impacts on labor productivity. Improving labor productivity by analyzing logistics {{operations in}} digital tools such as simulation studies, is a common way in manufacturing industry. In this thesis, logistics operations in construction sites are analyzed in a discrete-event factory simulation software for potential improvements on labor productivity. Elements of logistics operations in construction sites are interconnected and difficult to isolate. A theoretical model from literature is adopted for this research to identify the impact of each element on labor productivity. Learnings from adopted model resulted in two groups of elements that are fitting to simulation studies. These groups are, site lay-out optimization (SLO) and congested workspaces. Existing digital tools and methods for optimizing <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>plans</b> were reviewed and used as a base point to create a procedure for simulation studies. For <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> optimization, a procedure that uses BIM model, data extraction, statistical analysis and model transfer to simulation environment was created. It was aimed to create a procedure that decreases the required time for simulation modelling and processing time. Proposed procedure was used as a decision aid tool for construction <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning.</b> Demonstration of developed solution is presented on a conceptual example. Methods of labor productivity measurement are discussed, and combined into a model to estimate the reduction in labor productivity due to congestion in workspaces via simulation studies. Proposed model included field rating, time study and labor productivity impact factors found in literature review. For demonstration, a theoretical example of congested workspace is given. Demonstrated example for congested workspaces showed close results to impact factors given by labor organizations.

40|$|A good <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> {{is vital}} {{to ensure the safety}} of the working environment, and for {{effective}} and efficient operations. Moreover, it minimizes travel distance, decreases materials handling, and avoids the obstruction of materials and plant movement. Based on studies in the manufacturing industry, the cost of materials handling could be reduced by 20 - 60 % if an appropriate facility layout is adopted. In designing a <b>site</b> <b>layout,</b> a planner will first position the key facilities that influence the method and sequence of construction, and then assign the remaining facilities in the available space that is left over. This process is similar to the positioning of facilities in the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The general principle of the ACO algorithm is to assign facilities to a location one by one, and the occupied locations are deleted from the location scope in the next assignment. In the study, ACO algorithm is employed to resolve the construction <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> <b>planning</b> problem in a hypothetical medium-sized construction project. By applying fuzzy reasoning and the entropy technique, the study calculates the closeness relationship between facilities, in which the optimal <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> is affected by the mutual interaction of facilities.
