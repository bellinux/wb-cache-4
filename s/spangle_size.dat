40|$|The {{nature of}} {{nucleation}} {{and growth of}} the alloy overlay of a 55 %A 1 -Zn alloy on a steel substrate strongly affects the surface appearance of hot dip metal-coated steel in the Zincalume process. The potential nucleation site of the first nucleus that forms in the alloy overlay {{will contribute to the}} initial solidification process and subsequent microstructural development. An important issue of industrial interest is the occurrence of localized variations in <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> or variations in <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> from coil to coil. Control of <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> on hot-dip metallic coatings is important both from an aesthetic and functional point of view. From {{the point of view of}} surface appearance, a uniform <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> is required and small <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> is required for improvement of tension bend rust stain performance. An attempt was made to reveal the nature of nucleation and growth of the A 1 -Zn overlay by studying early stage nucleation and growth. The effect of cooling rate on spangle formation, the influence of trace element additions, the effects of dipping time, preheat temperature and bath composition were taken into account during experimental immersion tests. <b>Spangle</b> <b>size,</b> dendrite arm spacing and solidification temperature of the alloy overlay were determined under various cooling conditions and a variety of other techniques were used to analyze the progress of solidification. Experiments were conducted in the current study to determine the influence of process variables on <b>spangle</b> <b>size.</b> An experimental immersion simulator was used to test the hypothesis regarding nucleation on intermetallic particles using a quench-interruption technique. Serial sectioning in combination with microprobe studies has been used to quantify the element distribution. Commercial products have been analyzed using a tilt polishing technique combined with EPMA to assess element distribution across the solidified overlay. Also, bulk analysis of the element distribution through the thickness of commercial products has been conducted using Glow Discharge Spectroscopy. These experimental studies provided convincing experimental evidence that 55 %A 1 -Zn spangles nucleate on the intermetallic layer. In an attempt to verify that the experimental observations are scientifically founded, a model was developed to predict the nucleation rate and nucleation temperature. Thermodynamic analyses as well as phase-field modeling have been used to further correlate the experimental findings with theoretical predictions. The rate of nucleation decreases with an increase in wetting angle, and the nucleation temperature decreases with increasing cooling rate. Phase field modeling predicts that an aluminum rich phase forms at the intermetallic layer, acting as the nucleus of a spangle. Experimental studies on <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> distribution of 55 %A 1 -Zn have indicated that the cooling rate and bath composition are factors that influence <b>spangle</b> <b>size.</b> An attempt to prove that experimental observations are scientifically forwarded, modeling of nucleation rate, nucleation temperature, thermodynamic analysis as well as phase-field modeling have been conducted. An advantage of the modeling techniques is that the rate of nucleation and nucleation temperature as function of undercooling and cooling rate can be extrapolated beyond the experimental findings. A description of heterogeneous nucleation was modeled to elucidate the effect of cooling rate on the rate of nucleation and nucleation temperature. The rate of nucleation decreases with an increase of wetting angle, and the nucleation temperature decreases with increasing the cooling rate, also the microstructural evolution at different nucleation sites during solidification of 55 %A 1 -Zn coating is simulated using a phase-field model. A comparison of this experimental observation with the phase field simulations reveals good correlation with the case where dendrite growth was initiated at the intermetallic layer. Detail examination and thermodynamic analysis explained the occurrence of the different intermetallic phases on the alloy layer that could provide potent nucleation sites and hence lead to variation of <b>spangle</b> <b>size.</b> Consideration of nature of nucleation and growth of 55 %A 1 -Zn alloy on steel substrate was taken to clarify the variation of <b>spangle</b> <b>size.</b> In combination with modified immersion simulator and various measuring techniques and modeling approaches, it concluded that the intermetallic layer is potent nucleation site and results in <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> variation, also the cooling rate and trace elements play role in the <b>spangle</b> <b>size...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out into the effect of silicon content on 55 wt% Al–Zn–Si metallic coating solidification. Immersion experiments were conducted on a metal coating simulator, and the resulting solidification structure was characterised in terms of <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS). It was found that at bath temperatures of 600 °C as silicon content was increased from 1. 05 to 1. 5 wt% there were an increase in <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> without any change in SDAS. Thermodynamic modelling was utilised to probe the phase stability of intermetallic species in the baths. Two competing intermetallic phases, α-AlFeSi and Fe 3 Al, are stabilised dependant upon bath silicon content and temperature. Literature data for the lattice mismatch between α-Al, the primary solidification phase in this study, with these two intermetallic phases indicates that FeAl 3 has much better crystallographic fit than does α-AlFeSi. This supports the proposal that FeAl 3 has a higher nucleation site density for solidification, which results in a reduced <b>spangle</b> <b>size.</b> The thermodynamic modelling has been used to provide compositional and temperature ranges for <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> control...|$|E
40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanize}} {{can vary}} in appearance, and therefore usability, {{as a function}} of <b>spangle</b> <b>size,</b> zinc composition, mechanical treatment, and chemical or oiling treatments. Marketplace problems can develop because the customer finds the appearance is different than expected, or changes due to darkening, water staining, or field handling marks. These and other issues are reviewed, along with actions that can be taken to control them and minimize problems with end users...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Simulation {{experiment}} {{was done to}} investigate the effects of rare earth on hot-dipped Zn- 55 %Al alloy coating. The {{results show that the}} rare earth has little effect on the zinc dross and its burning loss is about 10 %. The microstructure of coating {{is similar to that of}} solidification bath, and which is made up of phases of rich aluminum, rich zinc, rich silicon and rare earth, and intermetallic layer of Al-Zn-Fe-Si. The rare earth phase is needle or rod, and mainly distributed inside rich zinc phase and on the interface between the coating and steel substrate. The rare earth has no obvious influence on coating grain and <b>spangle</b> <b>size.</b> The appropriate addition of rare earth would be helpful to improve the coating bending formability and corrosion resistance...|$|E
40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanized}} steel sheets with different spangle sizes were deformed {{by means of}} rolling and tension. The change of preferential crystallographic orientation and of superficial characteristics due to the deformation was analyzed by means of both X-rays diffraction and optical and scanning electronic microscopy. A correlation between such changes and the involving deformation modes {{was intended to be}} done and the <b>spangle</b> <b>size</b> influence on these modes was studied. Coating reactivity change due to the deformation was investigated by means of quasi-steady DC electrochemical tests. The results allow to infer that, in great spangle samples, the main deformation mechanism is twinning whereas in small spangle ones, pyramidal slip systems happen as well. The increase of the reactivity with the deformation is greater in tension than in rolling and it is more important in small than in great spangle samples. Facultad de Ingenierí...|$|E
