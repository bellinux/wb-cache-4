40|$|Several {{shifts from}} ancestral conifer feeding to {{angiosperm}} feeding have {{been implicated in}} the unparalleled diversification of beetle species. The single largest angiosperm-feeding beetle clade occurs in the weevils, and comprises the family Curculionidae and relatives. Most authorities confidently place the bark beetles (Scolytidae) within this radiation of angiosperm feeders. However, some clues indicate that the association between conifers and some <b>scolytids,</b> particularly in the tribe Tomicini, is a very ancient one. For instance, several fragments of Gondwanaland (South America, New Caledonia, Australia and New Guinea) harbour endemic Tomicini specialized on members of the formerly widespread and abundant conifer family Araucariaceae. As a first step towards resolving this seeming paradox, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the beetle family Scolytidae with particularly intensive sampling of conifer-feeding Tomicini and allies. We sequenced and analysed elongation factor 1 alpha and nuclear rDNAs 18 S and 28 S for 45 taxa, using members of the weevil family Cossoninae as an out-group. Our results indicate that conifer feeding is the ancestral host association of <b>scolytids,</b> and that the most basal lineages of <b>scolytids</b> feed on Aramucaria. If <b>scolytids</b> are indeed nested within a great angiosperm-feeding clade, as many authorities have held, then a reversion to conifer feeding in ancestral <b>scolytids</b> appears to {{have occurred in the}} Mesozoic, when Araucaria still formed a major component of the woody flora...|$|E
40|$|<b>Scolytids</b> (Curculionidae, Scolytinae) {{are small}} borer beetles {{belonging}} to the order Coleoptera that develop within or under the bark of trees.

Given the importance of subfamily Scolytinae, this paper aims at providing {{a better understanding of the}} behavior of <b>Scolytids,</b> mainly regarding the flight height in a stand of Pinus taeda L. For the execution of this work 72, intercept flight traps were installed in area {{belonging to the}} State Foundation for Agricultural Research (FEPAGRO), located in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul state. The treatments correspond to heights of 0. 5; 1. 0; 1. 5; 2. 0; 2. 5; 3. 0; 3. 5; 4. 0; 4. 5; 5. 0; 5. 5 and 6. 0 meters.

40|$|Abstract Ethanol in sapwood was {{analyzed}} along vertical transects, through small spot cankers and larger basal can-kers, of Phytophthora ramorum-infected stems of Quercus agrifolia at three sites in California. Trees with large basal cankers, known to attract <b>scolytid</b> beetles, had a 4. 3 times higher ethanol level than trees with spot cankers that attract fewer beetles. Ethanol concentrations inside cankers, where <b>scolytid</b> beetles preferentially attack, varied by about four {{orders of magnitude}} among samples, with a median level of 16. 0 μg. g− 1 fresh mass. This concentration was 4. 3 and 15. 5 times greater, respectively, than the concentrations at 1 cm or 15 – 30 cm outside the canker boundaries. In the labora-tory, we demonstrated that ethanol escaped through the bark of a Q. garryana log just 3 days after it {{was added to the}} sapwood. At the three study sites, traps baited with ethanol captured more Xyleborinus saxesenii, Pseudopityophthorus pubipennis, and Monarthrum dentiger (all Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) than traps baited with ethanol plus (−) -α-pinene, or ethanol plus 4 -allylanisole (4 AA). Logs of Q. agrifolia with a 50 % ethanol solution added to the sapwood were placed at the study sites, with or without additional bark treatments above the ethanol. The number of <b>scolytid</b> beetle gallery holes above the ethanol-infused sap-wood was 4. 4 times greater than that {{on the opposite side of}} the log where no ethanol was added. Attachment of ultra-high release (−) -α-pinene pouches to the bark surface above the 50 % ethanol solution reduced <b>scolytid</b> attacks to a density of 19. 1 % that of logs without this treatment. We conclude that ethanol in P. ramorum cankers functions as a primary host attractant for <b>scolytid</b> beetles and is an impor-tant link in colonization of these cankers and accelerated mortality of Q. agrifolia. The results of this research shed light on the chemical ecology behind the focused <b>scolytid</b> attacks on P. ramorum-infected coast live oaks, and lay the groundwork for future efforts to prolong the survival of individual trees of this keystone species...|$|R

40|$|The beetle family Scolytidae {{includes}} several groups having regular sib-mating and extremely female-biased sex ratios. Two such groups {{are known to}} include haplodiploid species: (i) the tribe Xyleborini and (ii) Coccotrypes and related genera within the tribe Dryocoetini. Relationships of these groups have been controversial. We analysed elongation factor 1 -α (852 bp) and cytochrome oxidase 1 (1179 bp) sequences for 40 species. The most-parsimonious trees imply a single origin of haplodiploidy uniting Xyleborini (approximately 1200 species) and sib-mating Dryocoetini (approximately 160 species). The sister-group of the haplodiploid clade is the outcrossing genus Dryocoetes. The controversial genus Premnobius is outside the haplodiploid clade. Most haplodiploid <b>scolytids</b> exploit novel resources, ambrosia fungi or seeds, but a few have the ancestral habit of feeding on phloem. Thus, <b>scolytids</b> provide the clearest example of W.

40|$|Abstract—The braconid Dendrosoter protuberans and the pteromalid Cheiropachus quadrum are two parasitoids of {{the olive}} bark beetle, Phloeotribus scarabaeoides.

40|$|Polyphagy is a {{very common}} trait among insects. In this study, we focus on a generalist bark-beetle predator, Thanasimus formicarius (L.) (Coleoptera, Cleridae), which feeds on many <b>scolytids</b> in spruce, pine and broad-leaf stands. It is known {{to respond to the}} pheromones of many <b>scolytids,</b> among which the most harmful spruce bark beetle in Europe, Ips typographus (L.). The adults attack scolytid adults and oviposit on {{attacked}} trees where their larvae feed upon immature stages of the prey. However, a bottom-up process limits Thanasimus formicarius’ impact on spruce bark beetles, because in most cases the bark of spruce is too thin for sheltering pupal niches and mature larvae have to leave the trees. On pine however, pupation is quite successful and reproductive success is high. The present work estimates the advantages (complementary prey during gaps among the phenology of pine bark beetles or due to the population fluctuations of most <b>scolytids)</b> and constraints (landing on unsuitable host trees for the predator’s reproduction) for T. formicarius to have a wide range of prey. Passive barrier-trappings showed that the presence and abundance of scolytid species vary strongly from year to year. So, polyphagy in T. formicarius appears as a response to fluctuating prey supplies. This way of foraging may lead T. formicarius towards stands not always favourable for its development (for example, spruces). At the tree level, funnels and pitfall-traps caught high numbers of third-instar T. formicarius larvae walking on the bark surface of standing spruces infested by Ips typographus (respectively 365 and 70 L 3 s). After feeding into the whole infested part of the trunk, these larvae are obliged to migrate outside of the galleries to favourable pupation site (e. g. the base of the trees where the bark is thicker), or even to leave the trees and search for an acceptable pupation substrate in the litter. At the landscape level, different trapping experiments showed a correlation between catches of T. formicarius and the proportion of pines around each trap. Consequently, in a metapopulation landscape pattern, pines would act as “sources” of predators, whilst spruces are “sinks”. Indeed, Thanasimus formicarius are trapped in higher numbers in mixed stands comprising pines. This observation is also corroborated in a four-year trapping experiment in the North-East of France, following the storms of December 1999. The predator/prey ratios (T. formicarius/I. typographus) were higher in stands comprising pines than in stands without pines. The first step of a method to estimate Ips typographus infestation trends thanks to the predator/prey ratios was also developed.

40|$|Lindgren {{multiple}} funnel traps {{were set}} up in pine forests of central Oregon to determine the response of scolytid bark beetles to ethanol and 4 -allylanisole (4 AA). Traps were baited with two release rates of ethanol (4. 5 or 41. 4 mg/hr) and three release rates of 4 AA (0, 0. 6, or 4. 3 mg/hr) in a 2 × 3 factorial design. All traps also released a 1 : 1 mixture of α- and β-pinene at 11. 4 mg/hr. Of 13, 396 <b>scolytids</b> caught, Dendroctonus valens made up 60 %, Hylurgops spp. 18. 5 %, Ips spp. 16 %, Hylastes spp. 1. 8 %, Ganthotrichus retusus 0. 9 %, and bark beetle predators another 2. 8 %. Increasing the release rate of ethanol {{in the absence of}} 4 AA increased the number of most scolytid species caught by 1. 5 – 3. 7 times, confirming its role as an attractant. Ips latidens, Temnochila chlorodia, and clerid predators were exceptions and did not show a response to higher ethanol release rates. Release of 4 AA at the lowest rate inhibited attraction of most <b>scolytids,</b> with a significant reduction in G. retusus, Hylastes macer, and Hylurgops porosus when compared to traps without 4 AA. A high release rate of 4 AA further inhibited responses for most beetles compared to low 4 AA. Seven species were significantly deterred by high 4 AA, including the latter three, and Hylastes longicollis, Hylastes nigrinus, Hylurgops reticulatus, and Ips latidens. Exceptions include Hylurgops subcostulatus, which was significantly attracted to both low and high 4 AA, and I. pini, which was attracted to low and high 4 AA in combination with low ethanol, but unaffected by either release of 4 AA with high ethanol. Dendroctonus valens was significantly attracted to low 4 AA and unaffected by high 4 AA. Predators appeared to be less inhibited by 4 AA than most bark beetles. Although 4 AA can deter the attraction of some secondary bark beetles to ethanol in combination with α- and β-pinene, this inhibition could be weakened for certain species by increasing ethanol release rates. 4 -Allylanisole may have some utility for managing the behavior of secondary bark beetles sensitive to this compoun...|$|E

Due to an abundant host supply in 1963, greater numbers of many species were caught in 1964. Twenty-four <b>scolytid</b> species were identified from net collections in 1964, whereas only 15 species were collected the previous year. With the exception of a single species, Scolytus unispinosus LeConte, which overwinters in an immature stage, the initiation of seasonal flight depended on sufficiently high temperatures to induce flight. A wide range of air temperatures necessary to initiate flights of the respective species was observed. These differences in temperature thresholds resulted in a seasonal succession of species found in flight. While changes in relative humidity caused no apparent effects on flight, light intensity was especially influential for certain species. Of 11 species in sufficient abundance for detailed study, six (Pseudohylesinus nebulous (LeConte), P. grandis Swaine, Trypodendron lineatum (Olivier), Phloeosinus sequoiae Hopkins, P. punctatus LeConte, and Scolytus unispinosus) flew during the mid-day hours. The remaining five (Hylastes nigrinus (Mannerheim), H. ruber Swaine, Gnathotrichus sulcatus (LeConte), G. retusus (LeConte), and Dryocoetes autographus (Ratzeburg)) exhibited crepuscular flight patterns, flying in greatest numbers when light intensities were below 1000 foot candles...|$|R
40|$|Species {{breeding}} under local mate competition {{conditions have}} sex ratios biased towards females, a trait {{that is often}} associated with male haploidy (arrhenotoky). We used insecticide resistance as a genetic marker in #Hypothenemus hampei$, a local mate competing <b>scolytid</b> beetle that is cytologically diplo-diploid, for investigating the inheritance of nuclear genes. We confirmed that males express the resistance phenotype that they inherit from their mother, whatever their father. The segregation of resistance phenotypes in F 2 females significantly departed from the Mendelian model, and were in accordance with the arrhenotokous model, indicating that the parental genes were eliminated between F 1 and F 2. This finding (pseudo-arrhenotoky) constitutes a step towards an understanding of the mechanism by which diplo-diploidy evolves to arrhenotoky in local mate competing insects. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Unanswered key {{questions}} in bark beetle-plant interactions concern host finding in species attacking angiosperms in tropical zones and whether management strategies based on chemical signaling used for their conifer-attacking temperate relatives {{may also be}} applied in the tropics. We hypothesized {{that there should be}} a common link in chemical signaling mediating host location by these <b>Scolytids.</b> Using laboratory behavioral assays and chemical analysis we demonstrate that the yellow-orange exocarp stage of coffee berries, which attracts the coffee berry borer, releases relatively high amounts of volatiles including conophthorin, chalcogran, frontalin and sulcatone that are typically associated with Scolytinae chemical ecology. The green stage of the berry produces a much less complex bouquet containing small amounts of conophthorin but no other compounds known as bark beetle semiochemicals. In behavioral assays, the coffee berry borer was attracted to the spiroacetals conophthorin and chalcogran, but avoided the monoterpenes verbenone and a-pinene, demonstrating that, as in their conifer-attacking relatives in temperate zones, the use of host and non-host volatiles is also critical in host finding by tropical species. We speculate that microorganisms formed a common basis for the establishment of crucial chemical signals comprising inter-and intraspecific communication systems in both temperate-and tropical-occurring bark beetles attacking gymnosperms and angiosperms.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{objectives}} {{undertaken in}} this study were to investigate the biologies and potential economic importance of Pseudohylesinus tsugae Swaine and P. grandis Swaine in young coastal stands of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Rafn.) Sarg.). The life and seasonal histories of P. tsugae and P. grandis and the association of these two <b>scolytids</b> with the hemlock bark maggot (Cheilosia alaskensis Hunter) are presented. Both P. tsugae and P. grandis were found to have one generation a year with two broods. Both species had four larval instars. P. grandis overwintered either as a fourth instar larva or as a teneral adult. P. tsugae usually overwintered as a fourth instar larva. Within thinned stands of western hemlock P. tsugae preferred fresh stumps for breeding material, whereas P. grandis preferred fresh slash. The teneral adults of both P. tsugae and P. grandis fed in the inner-bark region of standing live host trees before initiating egg galleries in suitable breeding material. Within the thinned stands these feeding sites provided entry to the cambial region of the tree for the hemlock bark maggot. Both the number of maggot infestations and Pseudohylesinus spp. feeding sites within a stand increased after the stand was thinned. A potential method of control of both P. tsugae and P. grandis and the hemlock bark maggot was found...|$|E
40|$|Following a very sudden, {{early and}} deep frost {{at the end}} of autumn 1998, the {{availability}} of weakened trees (mainly beech trees) reached very high levels in Southern Belgium in the spring of 1999. Consequently, the ambrosia beetles Trypodendron domesticum L. and T. signatum (Fabricius) (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) initiated outbreaks and, in 2000 and 2001, they heavily contributed to the depreciation of nearly 1, 600, 000 m 3 of stem volume (to upper limit girth of 22 cm) in the natural regions of “Ardenne” and “Belgian Lorraine”. Because of the lack of biogeographical data on both insects, of their conspicuous aggressiveness towards apparently healthy trees and of the economic importance of the beech wood chain in Belgium, a large-scale survey was undertaken in 2001, in order to outline the range of both ambrosia beetles in Wallonia. To this effect, a network of 172 traps baited with ethanol was set up, attempting to cover the Walloon beech forest as representatively as possible. Two other <b>scolytids</b> and one lymexylonid were also frequently caught, which made it possible to outline their regional distribution too. Although the damage was limited to the Ardenne and Belgian Lorraine, T. domesticum and T. signatum are widespread throughout Wallonia. We discuss these results, their long-term validity, the secondary pest status of these insects and the need for a permanent monitoring of the major forest pest species and diseases.

40|$|For decades, {{secondary}} {{ambrosia beetle}} {{species have been}} increasingly observed to attack apparently healthy trees. Some of them cause mortality to living trees. In Japan, Platypus quercivorus that is widely distributed in Asia has caused mass mortality of trees belonging to the family Fagaceae by vectoring Raffaelea quercivora. Similar disease has been in epidemic in Korea by attacks of Platypus koryoensis. On the other hand, unexpected introduction of ambrosia beetles to non-indigenous area has been increasing because of globalization. Some has become major components of ambrosia beetle fauna in the non-indigenous area. The worst example among invasive ambrosia beetles is Xyleborus glabratus that causes laurel wilt in US by vectoring Raffaelea lauricola. The laurel wilt has caused enormous economic damage to avocado farmers in US. However, ecological backgrounds of these phenomena are still unclear. Therefore, ecological information on ambrosia beetles is needed from a view point of biodiversity conservation {{as well as economic}} importance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine ambrosia beetle guild, factors influencing the guild, and niche of each species attacking on an oak tree Quercus serrata. Risks of invasion and of vectoring tree-killing disease were evaluated for each species. The study was conducted in three locations of the University of Tokyo Forests in the Central Japan. Timing of cutting trees (= TC) was controlled by preparing bolts monthly from March to September in Chichibu. They were covered by metal mesh to protect from insect attacks and left on the forest floor in the three locations: Aichi (LOC-A), Chiba (LOC-B), and Chichibu (LOC-C) (= LOC). The LOC-A had Japanese oak wilt (JOW). However, the LOC-B and the LOC-C had no historical records of JOW. Timing of exposure (= TE) was controlled by removing the metal mesh so that wood oldness (= WO) at the timing of exposure after cutting tree was also experimentally controlled. Bait bolts were exposed to insect attacks for one month in a Normal experiment, while they were left until the end of September in a Conditioning experiment. Twenty eight regimes, each consisted of four bolts, were set in each of a Normal and a Conditioning experiment so that the total number of bolts on each location was 224. Ambrosia beetles were collected by dissecting the bolts after the exposure and identified into species. The number of entry holes was used as an indicator for abundance of each species. In the Normal experiment, twenty morphospecies of Scolytinae and six species of Platipodinae were collected. In the Conditioning experiment, six <b>Scolytid</b> and two Platypodid species disappeared, whereas one <b>Scolytid</b> species recruited so that fifteen species of Scolytinae and four species of Platypodinae were collected. In total, twenty one morphospecies of Scolytinae and six species of Platipodinae were collected. Species richness and abundance peaked on bolts prepared in April–May, on bolts exposed in July, and on 2 – 3 -month-old bolts. Eliminating greatest influences of LOC on abundance, results of hierarchical partitioning showed that TC had a strong influence on both species richness and abundance. LOC-A (Aichi), in which Japanese oak wilt disease (JOW) incidence occurred, showed the greatest species richness and the smallest value of Pielou’s evenness. Abundance of the most abundant (“the major”) species was more than twice that of the second major species, which was a likely cause of the smallest evenness in LOC-A. Trees killed by JOW may have increased the abundance of the major species. On the contrary, in LOC-C (Chichibu), Pielou’s evenness and alpha and gamma diversity and the Shannon index were greatest among the three locations although species richness was smallest. High similarity between guilds in LOC-A and LOC-B (Chiba) was probably caused by similarity in vegetation. The LOC had the greatest effect on determining guild structure. Effect of TE was greater than TC. The effect of WO was negligible. A hierarchical structure among the three factors was a likely cause of their relative importance determining guild structure. Niche center and niche breadth were estimated for the three niche contexts. Colonizing ability of ambrosia beetles for bolts that had been exploited by other species. Abundance was compared between the Normal and the Conditioning experiments before each species stated to attack in Normal experiment. If the number in a regime No. 1 was smaller than 3 and no galleries were found in a regime No. 2 and 8, the species was included in the analysis. A paired t-test was employed to test if the difference was significant. Species that have been reported as an alien species tended to have broader niche. All <b>Scolytid</b> species collected in my study have a habit of haplodiploidy and sibling mating so that <b>Scolytid</b> have a higher risk of invasion than Platypodid. Platypodid species tended to attack fresh bolts compared to <b>Scolytid</b> so that Platypodid have higher risk to vector tree-killing disease than <b>Scolytid.</b> Among Platypodinae, Crossotarsus niponicus and Platypus calamus significantly increased in the Conditioning experiment so that they are good competitors and high risk species of invasion. However, they did not show strong preference to fresh bolts compared to other Platypodid species. Xylosandrus germanus and Xylosandrus crassiusculus, which attack living trees in non-indigenous area, also did not show a strong preference to fresh bolts so that there are no guarantees that C. niponicus and P. calamus are safe enough in non-indigenous area. Xylosandrus germanus and of X. crassiusculus supported that they became invasive alien species. Euwallacea validus significantly decreased in the Conditioning experiment compared to the Normal experiment so that this species seemed a poor competitor, whereas this species tended to attack fresh bolts. Xyleborus ganshoensis was considered as the highest potential to establish population in non-indigenous area because of its broad niche. Xyleborus ganshoensis was also likely to attack living trees since many individuals attacked fresh bolts but unlikely an invasive alien species. Platypus quercivorus, a vector of the Japanese oak wilt, showed the highest mean abundance on 0 -month-old bolts. On the other hand, Xyleborus seiryorensis had the smallest value of WO niche center, indicating that this species could be aggressive enough to attack living trees. The method developed in this study would be applicable to similar risk assessment of ambrosia beetles on other host species and in other countries. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 05 - 14; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士（農学）; 学位記番号: 博農第 3850 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学生命科学研究科生圏システム学専...|$|R

Due to lack of information concerning the insect fauna in this kind of environment, this paper aims to analyze on a quali-quantitative basis the <b>scolytid</b> species associated with a population of Acacia mearnsii De Wild, in order to identify species that may cause damage to this species. For this, 36 ight-interception ethanolic traps were installed in a plantation located in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The species Hypothenemus eruditus, Xyleborinus saxeseni, Hypothenemus sp. 2, Microcorthylus quadridens, and Corthylus pharax were the most representative within the population. The Xyleborini tribe was among the most frequent and, as it has species that cause damage, it deserves attention with regard to potential outbreaks.
