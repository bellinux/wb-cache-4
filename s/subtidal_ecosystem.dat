40|$|The canopy-forming {{macroalga}} Gelidium corneum (Hudson) J. V. Lamouroux plays a {{major role}} in the functioning of the <b>subtidal</b> <b>ecosystem</b> of the Cantabrian Sea (northern Spain). Despite its importance, little is known about the factors that may potentially affect the distribution pattern of its epiphytic flora. Here we examine two indirect factors: coastal orientation (N and NW) and depth (3 and 7 m), as proxies for wave exposure and light availability, respectively. We test their effects on the total epiphytic load, alpha diversity (species richness, Shannon, Simpson and evenness measures) and multivariate structure of the epiphytic flora growing on G. corneum in subtidal waters off the Basque coast. Plocamium cartilagineum, Dictyota dichotoma and Acrosorium ciliolatum were found to be the most common epiphytes. Significant interactive effect of coastal orientation and depth were observed for species composition and abundance of epiphytic flora. Increased wave exposure resulted in a lower epiphyte load and a less diverse community, suggesting that under high hydrodynamic conditions epiphytes were more likely to become dislodged from hosts. However, light availability only had a significant effect on the distribution of epiphytes below a certain threshold of wave action, with the epiphytic load being 30 - 40 % greater on shallow bottoms...|$|E

In this study,we present a sediment record fromArraial do Cabo Bay, Rio de Janeiro State. In order to improve {{the understanding of the}} upper subtidal palaeoecosystemevolutionary dynamics of this Bay,we provide a microfacies analysis of Holocene carbonate and mixed siliciclastic-carbonate deposits cropping out today from the supratidal to the subtidal zones. The age depth model is based on 14 C dating and revealed a basal age of ~ 7000 cal. years BP. In the six distinguished microfacies, the biogenic components are dominated by vermetids and coralline algae. A number of subordinate components are also present, including the microfacies determining thin-shelled bivalves. Fossil vermetids are represented by monospecific clusters of overgrowing Petaloconchus varians. Coralline red algae are represented by Lithophyllumpustulatum, Spongites fruticulosus, Spongites yendoi,Mesophyllum engelharti, and unidentified geniculate corallines. The microfacies analysis revealed that the substrate of the benthic community in the upper <b>subtidal</b> <b>ecosystem</b> of the Bay changed according to the relative sea level: (1) during the rapid sea transgressive trend it was coarse soft substrate, (2) after the postglacial sea level maximumsucceeding a slow decline to present sea level it changed into fine soft substrate. At ~ 7000 years ago the coarse soft substratewas characterised by fruticose corallines and composed of quartz grains from continental run off input. After the postglacial sea level maximum the highstand elevation along with the established upwelling system brought about a predominantly carbonate deposition.

Almost no similarity was observed between these two environments at the species level, and only minor similarity was observed at levels of sequence clustering representing clades of bacteria within family and genus taxonomic groups.

We quantified spatial (m [depth] to km [sites]) and temporal (hourly to monthly) patterns in the abundance of larvae of M. membranacea, and a morphologically similar native species, Electra pilosa, in relation to physical structure (temperature, salinity, density) of the water column in St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, on 8 dates from September to November 2007. During the study period, the water column ranged from strongly stratified to well mixed, and cross-shore movements of water masses (wind-driven upwelling and downwelling) were indicated by shoaling of the isoclines. When a strong pycnocline was located between the 2 sampled depths (4 and 12 m), larvae of both species were more abundant in the shallower, warmer, fresher layer. The linear relationship between strength of stratification and the relative abundance of larvae between depths was significant over 2 temporal (hourly, weekly) and 1 spatial (km) scale examined for M. membranacea, but not for E. pilosa. Highest abundance of larvae of both species in the warm fresh surface layer suggests onshore transport during wind-driven downwelling events. Dissimilar patterns in size-frequency distributions between the indigenous and nonindigenous bryozoan larvae suggest that species-specific characteristics of larvae of M. membranacea may be a contributing factor to its success as an invader {{in the western}} North Atlantic...|$|R

Yet, knowledge about the mechanistic underpinnings of foraging variability in A. rubens in these highly seasonal systems is sparse. The present research tested effects of key biotic (body size, starvation, chemical cues from potential competitors) and abiotic (temperature, wave action) factors on: 1) displacement, microhabitat selection, and ability to contact blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, prey; and 2) mussel prey consumption and size selection in A. rubens from southeastern Newfoundland. Experiments in laboratory microcosms (wave tank and aquaria), as well as analysis of seabed imagery and sea temperature and wave data from one subtidal site, showed that wave action, {{and to a lesser}} extent starvation, are key modulators of the sea star’s inclination and ability to explore its environment and localize prey. In southeastern Newfoundland, the behavioral response of A. rubens to wave action and starvation is adaptable, being generally stronger in summer than winter, when sea temperature differs markedly. Starvation, body size, and their interaction strongly affect prey consumption and size selection. Consumption is relatively stable across the natural temperature range in late summer, significantly lower in winter than summer, and unaffected by the chemical presence of indigenous rock crab, Cancer irroratus, and invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas. Collectively, results speak to the importance of considering the interplay between organismal traits and ongoing changes in ocean climate to more accurately predict causes and consequences of alterations to northern reef communities...|$|R

It was hypothesised that both biodiversity and biomass would decrease with increasing height along the shore, as well as that sediment would have an effect on the community composition of the turfs. The community was sampled over a vertical range of 1. 2 m and found to be dominated by the red alga Jania intermedia (24. 21 % of total algal coverage) followed by Tolypiocladia glomerulata (18. 05 %), Dictyota sp. (13. 39 %), Jania adhaerens (12. 32 %) and Sphacelaria tribuloides. (5. 83 %). No significant vertical zonation patterns were found, though certain species showed vertical trends such as Asparagopsis taxiformis and Sphacelaria tribuloides, which occurred in greatest biomass lower down on the shore, while Tolypiocladia glomerulata occurred higher up on the shore. Sand was found to affect certain species more than others, with Tolypiocladia glomerulata, Jania adhaerens and Asparagopsis taxiformis occurring in greatest biomass when the amount of sediment found in the quadrat was low, while Sphacelaria tribuloides. showed the opposite pattern and Jania intermedia showed no distinct pattern. Sampling took place over 1. 2 m vertical height along the shore at spring low tide therefore covering 60 % of the intertidal zone vertically (maximum tidal range in South Africa is 2 m). It is therefore possible that the turfs are the cause of a decline in zonation by remaining damp and decreasing desiccation gradients vertically along the shore...|$|R

The Gulf's marine resources are described {{in the context of}} possible environmental consequences of the 1991 Gulf War. While emphasis is given to living resources, in particular ecosystems and fisheries, non-living resources are also briefly considered (e. g. oil and gas), as is availability of clean seawater for production of fresh water. The focus is on the western and Arabian coasts; the eastern (Iranian) coast remains one of the least known in the world in biological terms. Of the <b>subtidal</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> coral reefs are the most diverse. They are highly productive, but cover only a small area and so are of relatively minor importance in a regional sense. Seagrasses are common in shallow areas (< 10 m), forming the basis of many food chains. At least four seagrass species are known for the region, but most communities are dominated by Halodule uninervis. Seagrasses are also an important habitat for commercial shrimp (e. g. Penaeus semisulcatus), pearl oysters and many other organisms. Mudflats occupy extensive areas of the intertidal zone. Their productivity is often enhanced by Cyanophya-dominated algal mats. Naturally occurring mangroves are found in association with tidal flats and are represented by a single species, Avicennia marina. Mangroves are much less extensive in the Gulf (125 - 130 km 2) than the Red Sea (400 - 500 km 2).

Environmental characteristics, nutrient concentrations, and benthic and planktonic biomass and productivity rates were measured every 2 - 4 weeks between February 1991 and August 1992. Chlorophyll-aconcentrations in the surficial sediments ranged from 0. 2 to 30. 7 mg m- 2, {{with a mean of}} 9. 5 ± 1. 5 mg m- 2 for the study period. Over an annual cycle, benthic microalgae contributed 25. 2 % of total microalgal biomass. Daily production rates for the benthic microalgae ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 75 gC m- 2 d- 1, with a mean of 0. 22 ± 0. 05 gC m- 2 d- 1. Annual production of the benthic microalgae was 90. 1 gC m- 2, or 20. 6 % of total microalgal production in Weeks Bay. Stepwise multiple regression revealed that nitrate, planktonic chl-a, benthic production, and seston accounted for 33 % of the variability in benthic microalgal biomass, while light, seston, nitrate and benthic chl-a accounted for 36 % of the variability in benthic microalgal production. This study suggests that, in this environment, the relative importance of benthic microalgal production is not regulated by any single factor, but rather is highly variable as a result of physical mixing and resuspension processes...|$|R

When the tunnels are exposed, animals are able to use tunnels as refuges. In this study, the effect of teredinid tunnelling upon mangrove forest faunal diversity was investigated. Mangrove forests exposed to long emersion times had fewer teredinid tunnels in wood and wood not containing teredinid tunnels had very few species and abundance of animals. However, with a greater cross-sectional percentage surface area of teredinid tunnels, the numbers of species and abundance of animals was significantly higher. Temperatures within teredinid-attacked wood were significantly cooler compared with air temperatures, and animal abundance was greater in wood with cooler temperatures. Animals inside the tunnels within the wood may avoid desiccation by escaping the higher temperatures. Animals co-existing in teredinid tunnelled wood ranged from animals found in terrestrial ecosystems including centipedes, crickets and spiders, and animals found in <b>subtidal</b> marine <b>ecosystems</b> such as fish, octopods and polychaetes. There was also evidence of breeding within teredinid-attacked wood, as many juvenile individuals were found, and they may also benefit from the cooler wood temperatures.

An assessment was undertaken {{of changes in the}} abundance of large {{brown seaweeds}} around the British Isles using historical survey data, and determination of whether any changes were linked with climate change. Data were analysed from multiple surveys for 14 habitat-forming and commercially important species of Phaeophyceae, covering orders Laminariales, Fucales and Tilopteridales. Changes in abundance were assessed for sites over the period 1974 â�� 2010. Trends in distribution were compared to summer and winter sea surface temperatures (SST).

Abundance patterns of 10 of the 14 species showed a significant association with SSTs, but there was a mixture of positive and negative responses. This is the first British Isles-wide observation of declining abundance of large brown seaweeds.

40|$|This {{body of work}} {{examines}} the influence of land use on nearshore water quality, and how this can drive changes to algal and invertebrate communities along Australia's southern coastline. The overall aim of the thesis was to investigate links between increasing coastal water-column nitrogen concentrations (derived from terrestrial inputs) {{and the expansion of}} turf-forming habitats that can alter the structure and function of <b>subtidal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> I initially tested whether human activities in coastal catchments can increase subsidies of nitrogen to open rocky coasts. I identified landscape-scale variation in the supply of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) to coastal waters adjacent to natural, agricultural and urban catchments. Compared to natural catchments, subsidies of DIN were 8 - 407 times greater in urban catchments, and 1 - 63 times greater in agricultural catchments. Subsidies of nitrogen from urban catchments were attributed to the release of sewage effluent, as delineated by δ¹ ⁵N isotopic values of transplanted algae. Having made this link, I then assessed whether catchment-scale variation in nitrogen subsidies may predict patterns of subtidal habitat structure, particularly as related to theories of regime shifts from forested landscapes to structurally depauperate turf-forming habitats. I validated this hypothesis, demonstrating that both relative covers and patch-sizes of turfed habitat were greater where the ratio of terrestrial nitrogen inputs to ambient coastal resources was large. An important realisation was that loss of forests may be more strongly related to the size of subsidy (i. e. the relative increases in water column nitrogen concentrations along urban coasts) rather than the size of coastal populations. Together, these data link coastal development with modified land-to-sea subsidies, and indirectly support the model that ecological effects may be proportional to the disparity between donor and recipient resources. Having demonstrated a link between nitrogen subsidies and subtidal habitat change, I then investigated factors likely to initiate and maintain such shifts. My results demonstrate that nutrient elevation can alter the natural phenology of turfs, sustaining dense covers throughout periods of natural senescence (winter). Perennial turf covers are able to accumulate large volumes of sediment; a synergy can impede the winter recruitment of canopy-forming species (kelps and fucoid algae). My observations of reduced forest recovery along urban coasts serve to highlight the complex interaction between elevated nutrients, persistent turf covers and increased sediment accumulation, which can reduce the resilience of coastal ecosystems to disturbance. In recognition that regime shifts are likely to have consequences for higher trophic levels, I compared the diet of invertebrate herbivores from healthy and degraded coastlines using stable isotope analysis (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N). Dietary modelling showed that turfs contributed more to the diet of consumers along degraded coastlines where turfed landscapes have replaced extensive covers of macroalgal forest. Additionally, there were strong correlations between covers of turfed habitat, herbivore diet and relative densities. Changes to ambient food quality associated with regime shift may be an important aspect of nutrient-driven change along human-dominated coastlines. The final component of my thesis redressed some of the uncertainty about restoration initiatives for urban coasts by demonstrating that regime shifts are not necessarily permanent. I showed that turf removal can facilitate the recovery of degraded forests. Future restoration, therefore, is a possible outcome of polices that aim to decouple the link between nutrient inputs and recalcitrant turfed habitats that prevent forest recovery. Initiatives that reduce nutrient discharge to coastal waters (e. g., wastewater recycling) are likely to restore the resilience of nearshore marine ecosystems and promote their rehabilitation.

40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase in}} intensity {{and frequency of}} storm events combined with the undeniable rise in sea water level, both connected to climate change, {{poses a threat to}} coastal low lands. As it safeguards the natural dynamics of the coast, beach nourishment has rapidly become the preferred protective and restoring measure in coastal zones worldwide. We tested whether optimizing the main technical aspects of a nourishment according to ecological recommendations, e. g. a gentle sloped beach with nourished sand resembling the original sediment very closely (average median grain size of 224 µm), leads to an ‘ecological’ nourishment with minor to no impact effects on the macrobenthos. Monitoring of nourishment impact effects on the macrobenthic community structure can be regarded as a ‘natural experiment’ and is based on a BACI (Before/After, Control/Impact) design. A putatively impacted area and a matching control site are monitored in a time series (2000 – 2012) straddling the impact event (2009). Impact effects should then show up as interactions between the temporal and spatial factors. A wider, higher and flatter intertidal beach with coarser sediment (from 215. 89 ± 3. 63 µm in 2008 to 280. 23 ± 8. 94 µm in spring 2010) was created and no return to the pre-nourishment conditions in sedimentology was visible three years after nourishment. The sediment grain size distribution had changed as well, showing slow recovery in the three post-nourishment years. The analysis of the macrobenthos community structure showed that the nourishment under ecological optimal conditions on the beach of Lombardsijde yielded no significant effects on both the intertidal and shallow <b>subtidal</b> beach <b>ecosystem</b> 6 months after the nourishment. Within this time frame, the macrobenthos community had seemingly recovered from the impact of the ecological nourishment. Ecological nourishment thus proves to be the least ecologically damaging way of combating erosion, compared to all other coastal engineering activities...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Urbanization {{is a major}} process {{altering}} nearshore habitats in {{many parts}} of the world. One important aspect of urbanization in marine settings is the proliferation of artificial structures, such as seawalls, breakwaters, and jetties. Urban artificial structures can fundamentally shift marine communities and alter ecological processes at multiple spatial scales. Though they are common in both intertidal and subtidal habitats, their effect on <b>subtidal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> is particularly understudied. I examined the communities that form in association with subtidal artificial structures and their effects on surrounding sedimentary habitats in an urbanized estuary. In the first chapter, I evaluated detrital influx from artificial structures to surrounding sediments. Photoquadrat and sediment surveys indicated that red macroalgae and epilithic invertebrates were the major producers of detrital material on artificial structures in the Seattle area and that detritus from artificial structures was moving into adjacent sediments. Through a series of experiments, I then assessed the potential effects of these detrital inputs on macrofaunal assemblages. Sediments receiving one-time additions of red macroalgae and shell material were relatively resilient to detrital influx and exhibited little to no change in macrofaunal composition. However, rapid reductions in sediment chlorophyll and phaeopigment following detrital additions suggested that delivery of red macroalgae into sediments surrounding artificial structures may be frequent. In a follow up experiment, sediments were enriched with red macroalgae on a weekly basis to reflect more frequent delivery rates. Though I hypothesized that red macroalgae would serve as a subsidy for macrofaunal assemblages, I observed no positive opportunistic responses among macrofauna to weekly additions. Rather, frequent inputs of red macroalgal detritus led to decreases in abundance for the majority of macrofaunal taxa. Red macroalgae may therefore have negative impacts on macrofaunal assemblages, though this effect is likely minor compared with hydrodynamic alterations and other changes to sedimentary habitats that are associated with artificial structures. In the second chapter, I examined urban-related spatial distribution patterns and habitat-use the giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini). Urbanization is known to facilitate certain terrestrial mesopredators and I sought to evaluate whether similar patterns relative to urbanization were evident for this marine mesopredator. Modeling of citizen-contributed octopus presence/absence data suggested that urbanization impacts differed with depth. Octopus occurrence probability was positively correlated with urbanization intensity in deeper habitats only (> 24 m). In shallower environments (< 18 m), occurrence probability was higher in rural areas than in urban areas. In separate field surveys, I found that octopus diets were unrelated to urbanization, and that octopus abundance was positively correlated with the number of artificial structures on the seafloor. Though trophic mechanisms for urban-related distribution patterns of giant Pacific octopus are therefore unlikely, provisioning of shelter and denning habitat from artificial structures may be an important factor for octopus populations in urban areas. In the final chapter, I examined benthic composition on rocky artificial structures and natural reefs across an urban gradient. Photoquadrats were collected at 36 sites across Puget Sound. Consistent with studies in other regions, I found that artificial structures supported distinct and more variable benthic assemblages than natural reefs. In addition, rocky subtidal habitats in heavily urban areas had fewer kelps and more filamentous algal turf than those in less urban areas. Importantly, analyses from this study highlighted an important challenge in evaluating benthic composition relative to urbanization. Coastal cities tend to be located in protected bays and at the mouths of rivers, where benthic communities are subject to strong salinity gradients and low water flow. Strong collinearity in these naturally occurring environmental variables and urbanization intensity will be an important consideration for future studies that aim to characterize effects of urbanization on marine ecosystems...|$|R

In some regions of the world, however, such idiosyncratic ecosystems are largely absent and are often replaced by less notable ecosystem formers. In the present study, we empirically compared the structure and functioning of two distinct shallow-water habitats present in the Azores: one dominated by smaller frondose brown macroalgae (Dictyotaceae and Halopteris) and one dominated by low-lying turfs. Two replicated areas of each habitat were sampled at two different times of the year, to assess spatial and temporal consistency of results. Habitats dominated by small fronds were significantly (ca. 3 times) more productive (when standardized per algal mass) compared to the turf-dominated habitats, and supported a distinct assemblage (both in terms of composition and abundance) of associated macrofauna. Unlike other well-known and studied vegetated habitats (i. e. kelp forests), however, no effects of habitat were found on the structure of benthonic fish assemblages. Results were spatially and temporally consistent suggesting that, in warmer temperate oceans, habitats dominated by species of smaller frondose brown algae can also play an important role in the structure and functioning of subtidal communities and may, to a certain extent, be considered analogous to other well-known vegetated habitats around the world (i. e. kelp forests, seagrass beds).

40|$|Amongst {{the many}} {{ecological}} processes {{that can have}} an influence on community structure within marine ecosystems, herbivory is recognised as having an important role. Algae are not only living components of the community, they often provide a physical structure, food and protection indispensable for many other species. Therefore, understanding herbivore behaviour and their effects on the surrounding habitat is vital to further comprehend benthic marine ecosystem dynamics. Strength of herbivory is often determined by simple numbers of individual herbivores. There are however, other factors that may influence herbivore feeding behaviour such as food quantity and quality. Changes in food availability can have a strong influence on the dynamics of consumers that rely on allochthonous sources as their main supply of energy. I tested the hypothesis that a decrease in per capita food supply to a sedentary herbivore has {{a negative effect on}} herbivore condition and also affects the surrounding habitat through changes herbivore feeding behaviour. The reduction in food supply had a negative influence on herbivore gonad condition, whilst concomitant increases in consumer density caused greater foraging of the surrounding habitat. Poor consumer condition can be the result of food limitation and in some cases can lead to stronger herbivory. This process could help explain barrens creation across many subtidal rocky coasts. Ecological traits may have a stronger influence on population and community dynamics than currently acknowledged; particularly sedentary herbivores that may be incapable of migrating to alternate environments. I assessed the effects of origin of food and its frequency of delivery on sea urchin behaviour and condition. Higher consumption rates and poorer condition were associated with food originating from sheltered coasts; coinciding with observations of urchin over-grazing in this type of Environment. Whilst algae derived from exposed coasts caused lower consumption rates and better condition; coinciding with no urchin over-grazing on exposed reefs. Understanding such trait-mediated responses to allochthonous food may assist the development of more comprehensive models that account for variation in strength of herbivory. Many studies have focussed on foraging of canopy-forming algae by sea urchins associated with barrens, however, foraging effects of urchins not associated with barrens is less clear. I tested the hypothesis that the sedentary (largely site attached) sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma has detectable effects on the canopy-forming and understory algae. In a location where densities were at the upper limits of their range of a region that lacks sea urchin barrens, algal cover was estimated beneath and immediately around sea urchins. The area under the urchins was consistently bare rock. Sea urchin removal experiments showed that canopy-forming algae were able to develop in greater covers after 16 months and approached those in areas that naturally lacked urchins. In the area immediately surrounding the sea urchins, turf-forming algae dominated the first 5 - 6 cm, whilst at 8 cm canopy-forming algal cover matched areas without urchins. Cover of canopy-forming algal can be reduced in the presence of non-barren forming urchins, albeit only within a few centimetres of individual urchins. This suggests that such organismal-scale effects may have an influence on the ecology of rocky coasts with dense populations of these urchins (e. g. sheltered coasts). In conclusion, strength of herbivory can depend on many factors that vary across a broad range of scales. In this thesis, I provide knowledge on some of the factors associated with herbivory by the purple sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma. I show that herbivore abundance and condition which can directly affect strength of herbivory vary at regional (i. e. Eastern Australian Current v. Leeuwin Current) and local scales (ie. sheltered v. exposed coasts). I also demonstrate that drift-algal quantity and origin can have a strong influence on sea urchin condition and feeding behaviour. Finally, the organismal scale effect (i. e. centimetres) may not only be detectable but also influential at some places and scales. Together, these results suggest that populations of herbivores, their condition and impact, may have predictable effects from local through regional scales. The integration of such dependencies to general models may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of rocky <b>subtidal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Research on <b>subtidal</b> {{hydrothermal}} vent <b>ecosystems</b> at Milos, Hellenic Volcanic Arc (Aegean Sea), suggested that vent activity increased the species richness of sessile epibenthic assemblages. Based on 303 species found in 6 sites (3 close to vents, 3 farther away), {{the present paper}} uses correspondence analysis and species/samples curves to examine the species composition and richness of these assemblages. Differences due to vent proximity were more important than those due to bottom depth and distance from the shore. Diversity was confirmed to be higher near the vents, although none of the 266 species found at the vent sites {{can be considered as}} obligate vent-associated species. Seven different, although not mutually exclusive, hypotheses are discussed to explain the pattern of increased epibenthic species diversity at the vent sites, namely: (i) vents represent an intermediate disturbance, inducing mortality by the emission of toxic fluids; (ii) higher winter temperature allows for the occurrence of warm-water species, which add to the regional background; (iii) venting disrupts the homogeneity of the water bottom layer, increasing bottom roughness and hence habitat heterogeneity; (iv) deposition of minerals and enhanced bioconstruction by Ca enrichment increment habitat provision; (v) fluid emission induces advective mechanisms that favour recruitment; (vi) vents emit CO 2, nutrients and trace elements that enhance primary productivity; and (vii) bacterial chemosynthesis add to photosynthesis to provide a diversity of food sources for the fauna...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Population connectivity, {{which is}} {{essential}} for the persistence of benthic marine metapopulations, depends on how life history traits and the environment interact to influence larval production, dispersal and survival. Although we have made significant advances in our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of these individual processes, developing an approach that integrates the entire population connectivity process from reproduction, through dispersal, and to the recruitment of individuals has been difficult. We present a population connectivity modelling framework and diagnostic approach for quantifying the impact of i) life histories, ii) demographics, iii) larval dispersal, and iv) the physical seascape, on the structure of connectivity and metapopulation dynamics. We illustrate this approach using the <b>subtidal</b> rocky reef <b>ecosystem</b> of Port Phillip Bay, were we provide a broadly-applicable framework of population connectivity and quantitative methodology for evaluating the relative importance of individual factors in determining local and system outcomes. RESULTS: The spatial characteristics of marine population connectivity are primarily influenced by larval mortality, the duration of the pelagic larval stage, and the settlement competency characteristics, with significant variability imposed by the geographic setting and the timing of larval release. The relative influence and the direction and strength of the main effects were strongly consistent among 10 connectivity-based metrics. CONCLUSIONS: These important intrinsic factors (mortality, length of the pelagic larval stage, and the extent of the precompetency window) and the spatial and temporal variability represent key research priorities for advancing our understanding of the connectivity process and metapopulation outcomes.

40|$|Surveys of fish, {{invertebrates}} and algae {{were conducted}} on subtidal rocky reefs within the Batemans Marine Park (BMP) in December 2005 (11 sites), 2006 (25 sites) and 2007 (22 sites). At {{the time of the}} 2005 and 2006 surveys, the BMP had been created but legislation to implement the zoning scheme and hence enforce fishing restrictions was not in place. Data obtained in 2005 and 2006 thus represent baseline conditions. The zoning came into effect in June, 2007. The BMP surveys form part of a broader study into the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Australian temperate waters. Surveys were undertaken with identical methodology to studies in the nearby Jervis Bay Marine Park (Barrett et al., 2006) as well as in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. Surveys assessed the diversity and abundance of fish and macro-invertebrates and percentage cover estimates of algae and sessile invertebrates. One hundred and nine species of fish, fifty five species of macro-invertebrates and seventy three species of algae were counted throughout the surveys. Schooling fish species such as Chromis hypsilepis (One-spot puller), Atypichthys strigatus (Mado sweep) and Trachinops taeniatus (Eastern hulafish) were the most abundant at most sites. The most abundant resident reef fish were Parma microlepis (white-ear), Crinodus lophodon (Rock cale) and Notolabrus gymnogenis (Crimson-banded wrasse). The most abundant invertebrates were Centrostephanus rodgersii (Long spine urchin), Astralium spp. (Turban shells), Heliocidaris spp. (common urchins) and Turbo spp. (Turbo). In many locations C. rodgersii were very abundant and formed extensive barrens. This most probably impacted on algal assemblages, with many sites devoid of canopy forming algae in the depth ranges (5 and 10 m) surveyed. Algae covering most substrata sampled were crustose coralline algae, species of Peyssonnelia (red algae) and Ecklonia radiata (brown kelp). The survey methodology was designed to detect changes at all levels of species interaction and the response of sanctuary zones to protection. Ideally surveys should be repeated each year, producing a time-series of data documenting changes in the abundance and distribution of species of interest. This would also provide an indication of MPA performance as observed changes between management zones could be differentiated from chance divergence. It would also provide a reference for assessing the extent of fishing related influence on the regions <b>subtidal</b> reef <b>ecosystems.</b> Surveys of fish and mobile invertebrates should be repeated on an annual basis and surveys of algal assemblages be conducted on at least a biannual basis, until biotic changes associated with MPA protection stabilise. Because the sites surveyed in 2005 & 2006 were deliberately different (utilising available resources to maximise sampling coverage of the BMP and sanctuary zones), the large number of sites surveyed overall meant not all could be re-surveyed in the time available in 2007. The 2007 sites therefore represent a random sample of those covered by previous surveys, and as many as could be sampled within the time and logistical constraints imposed. If there are to be ongoing annual surveys in BMP, a subset of the existing sites need to be chosen, such that they can all be reliably repeated on an annual basis within the time frame that budgets will allow. The work to date provides a comprehensive baseline from which an ongoing program may be developed and refined within those budgetary constraints...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{unconsolidated sediments}} {{constitute}} the largest ecosystems on earth {{in terms of}} spatial coverage, {{but there are still}} critical gaps in the science required to support conservation and ecosystem-based management. This is mainly due to the inaccessibility of these ecosystems in wave-exposed environments or deeper waters and the difficulty in observing biota in their three-dimensional sedimentary habitat. Currently, the physical driving processes of intertidal unconsolidated sediment ecosystems are much better understood than those of the <b>subtidal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> However, these ecosystems are linked through water and sediment movement. This thesis, therefore, considers the continuum of unconsolidated sediment ecosystems across the entire continental shelf (i. e. intertidal to the shelf edge). The aim of this thesis was two-fold; (i) to advance the foundational understanding of biodiversity patterns and driving processes in unconsolidated sediment habitats, and (ii) to apply this knowledge {{in the development of a}} systematic conservation plan for marine unconsolidated sediment ecosystems. The South African west coast continental shelf was used as a case study in order to represent Eastern boundary upwelling regions. This study sought to investigate biodiversity patterns in macro-infaunal communities and determine their driving processes for incorporation into habitat classifications and the development of a habitat map. Systematic conservation plans require a map of biodiversity patterns and processes, and quantitative conservation targets to ensure representation of all biodiversity features including habitats. in marine protected areas. This thesis provided these key elements by classifying the unconsolidated sediment habitats and determining habitat-specific evidence-based conservation targets to support conservation of these important ecosystems. The application of these elements was then demonstrated in a systematic conservation plan for the unconsolidated sediment ecosystems of the South African west coast. Diversity patterns were examined using physical and macro-infauna data, ranging from the beach to the shelf edge (0 - 412 m). These data were analysed to develop two different habitat classifications, namely seascapes derived from geophysical and biophysical data, and biotopes derived from the combination of macro-infaunal and physical data. Multivariate analyses of 13 physical variables identified eight seascapes for the unconsolidated sediment samples from 48 sites on the South African west coast. These were based on depth, slope, sediment type, and upwelling-related processes (i. e. maximum chlorophyll concentration, sediment organic carbon content and austral summer bottom oxygen concentration). Latitude and bottom temperature were not considered major drivers of seascapes on the west coast because latitude closely reflected changes in upwelling-related processes and the temperature range was narrow across the shelf. This study revealed that productivity, a biophysical variable not usually included in geo-physical habitat classifications, played a significant role in the definition of seascapes on the South African west coast. It is therefore recommended that productivity be included in future seascape classifications to improve the utility of these classifications particularly in areas of variable productivity. Seascapes should, however, be tested against biological data to improve the understanding of key physical drivers of communities in unconsolidated sediment ecosystems. Macro-infaunal community distributions were determined along with their physical drivers for the unconsolidated sediments of the South African west coast. A total of 44 828 individuals from 469 taxa were identified from 48 sites representing 46. 2 m 2 of seafloor. Seven distinct macro-infaunal communities were defined through multivariate analyses and their key characteristic and distinguishing species were identified. These communities reflected five depth zones across the shelf, namely beach, inner shelf (10 - 42 m), middle shelf (60 - 142 m), outer shelf (150 - 357 m) and shelf edge (348 - 412 m). The processes driving the community structure of these depth zones were postulated to be tides, wave turbulence, seasonal hypoxia, habitat stability and homogeneity, and internal tides and/or shelf break upwelling, with drivers listed in order of increasing influence with depth. The middle shelf was further separated into three distinct communities based on sediment type, sediment organic carbon content and frequency of hypoxia. Variations in water turbulence, sediment grain size, upwelling-related variables and riverine sediment input were identified as the likely primary drivers of macro-infaunal community patterns. This chapter culminated in the development of a biotope classification based on the combination of macro-infaunal communities and their physical habitats (i. e. biotopes). South Africa has developed an expert-derived National Marine and Coastal Habitat (SANMC) Classification System which is used as a biodiversity surrogate in ecosystem assessment and spatial planning. This thesis tested the validity of this classification and the data derived Seascape classification against macro-infauna species abundance and biomass data in an effort to determine how well the different classifications represent macro-infaunal diversity of the west coast. These two classifications were also compared to the Biotope classification which combines macro-infaunal communities with their physical habitats. A canonical analysis of principle coordinates (CAP) was utilised to test the success with which each sample was allocated to the relevant habitat type in each classification. The total allocation success for each classification was used as a measure of effectiveness in terms of representing biodiversity patterns. Both classifications had similar allocation successes of 89 - 92 percent and 92 - 94 percent for the Seascape and National Habitat Classification respectively, but either over- or under-classified the macrofauna communities. The Biotope classification had the highest allocation success (98 percent), therefore it is the most accurate reflection of the macrofauna biodiversity patterns on the west coast. A key finding of this study was the increasing accuracy of classifications from physically- to expert- to biologically-derived habitat classifications. In this thesis, the Biotope classification was deemed the best representative of biodiversity patterns and was therefore used to produce the Biotope map for use in spatial assessment and planning. The distinct depth patterns that emerged in both the Seascape and Biotope classifications highlighted the need for further investigation of the relationship between depth and biodiversity. Despite variability in macro-infaunal communities, a general unifying pattern in biodiversity across the shelf was sought. Three relationships between depth and species richness have been described in the literature; namely a unimodal pattern, a positively linear relationship with depth, and no relationship between depth and species richness. These hypotheses were tested on the west coast. Two different species richness metrics were utilised to test the depth-diversity relationship, namely observed species density (spp. 0. 2 m- 2) and estimated species richness (spp. site- 1). Observed species density increased from the beach to the shelf edge (350 m), then decreased to 412 m. The decline may have been due to difficulty in detecting species at greater depths as a result of sampling challenges. The inclusion of an innovative extrapolative method for estimating species richness (the capture-recapture heterogeneity model) within the Bayesian statistical framework mitigated the effects of species detection heterogeneity and revealed that species richness actually increased continuously across the shelf from beach to shelf edge. Thus the general relationship between depth and species richness is positively linear on the west coast of South Africa The new macro-infauna dataset and biotope map provided the opportunity to develop the first habitat-specific evidence-based conservation targets for unconsolidated sediments of the west coast. Species-Area Relationship (SAR) based conservation targets were developed for the biotopes using a modification of the generally accepted methodology. The accepted methodology has three steps (i) the estimation of total species richness for each habitat using the Bootstrap asymptotic estimator, (ii) the calculation of the slope of the species area curve (i. e. the z-value), and (iii) the calculation of targets representing 80 percent of the species. The inclusion of an innovative extrapolative species richness estimator, the Multi-species Site Occupancy Model (MSOM) provided better species richness estimation than the more conventional bootstrap species richness estimator, even though both are based on species accumulation. The MSOM, applied in the Bayesian statistical framework takes detectability of a species into accoun...|$|R
