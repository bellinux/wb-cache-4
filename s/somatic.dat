5|$|<b>Somatic</b> effects: {{myoclonus}} (muscle twitching), hyperreflexia (manifested by clonus), tremor.|$|E
5|$|The {{onset of}} primary tooth loss {{has been found}} to {{correlate}} strongly with <b>somatic</b> and psychological criteria of school readiness.|$|E
5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the <b>somatic</b> cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, <b>somatic</b> cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no known}} fossil remains. The marsh shrew's {{karyotype}} <b>somatic</b> number is 2n = 54, and its fundamental number = 70.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of {{research}} an untested HIV vaccine has been created. Bi-specific antibodies that target both the surface of T-cells and viral epitopes can prevent entry of the virus into <b>somatic</b> cells. Another group has utilised the same technology to develop a bi-specific antibody that neutralises viral particles by cross linking of envelope glycoproteins.|$|E
5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains {{of the heavy}} and light chains undergo {{a high rate of}} point mutation, by a process called <b>somatic</b> hypermutation (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.|$|E
5|$|One set of {{characteristics}} relate to body size and temperature. The metabolic theory of ecology provides a predictive qualitative set {{of relationships between}} an organism’s body size and temperature and metabolic processes. In general, smaller, warmer organisms have higher metabolic rates and {{this results in a}} variety of predictions regarding individual <b>somatic</b> growth rates, reproduction and population growth rates, population size, and resource uptake rates.|$|E
5|$|The affective {{subscale}} contains eight items: pessimism, past failures, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal {{thoughts or}} wishes, and worthlessness. The <b>somatic</b> subscale {{consists of the}} other thirteen items: sadness, loss of pleasure, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, loss of energy, change in sleep patterns, irritability, change in appetite, concentration difficulties, tiredness and/or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex. The two subscales were moderately correlated at 0.57, suggesting that the physical and psychological aspects of depression are related rather than totally distinct.|$|E
5|$|The <b>somatic</b> motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the vagus nerve in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E
25|$|The {{duplicated}} germ-line nucleus then develops {{into the}} new <b>somatic</b> nucleus. The genomic structure of the <b>somatic</b> nucleus is being created by chromosomal fragmentation with single-gene chromosomes and amplification of these <b>somatic</b> chromosomes. It is unknown what determines the copy number of each chromosome or if the copy number of the <b>somatic</b> chromosomes are heritable between sexual conjugations.|$|E
25|$|This amitotic process {{causes the}} two {{daughter}} cells to potentially have identical germ-line nucleus but a different <b>somatic</b> nucleus {{in regards to}} the copy numbers of the chromosomes. As the <b>somatic</b> nucleus is the nucleus that is transcriptionally active, this <b>somatic</b> copy number mutation derived by the amitotic process could have fitness consequences for the individual cell.|$|E
25|$|C. uncinata {{goes through}} asexual {{reproduction}} for cell division and duplication called amitosis. As C. uncinata has two nuclei, {{it goes through}} two different styles of division of the nuclei. The germ-line nucleus goes through mitosis during asexual division while the <b>somatic</b> nucleus undergoes amitosis. Amitosis is a stochastic process where unlike in mitosis, there is no spindle formation to segregate chromosomes during nuclear division. Instead, the chromosomes within the <b>somatic</b> nucleus are duplicated, and the nucleus goes through binary division. The precise mechanism is unknown, but {{it is believed that}} <b>somatic</b> chromosomes that are located {{on one side of the}} dividing <b>somatic</b> nucleus are distributed to one daughter cell, and the <b>somatic</b> chromosomes on the other side of the nucleus are distributed to the other daughter cell.|$|E
25|$|As a {{certified}} practitioner of the Feldenkrais Method and a <b>somatic</b> therapist, he gives workshops on somaesthetics that include practical exercises and demonstrations, {{and he also}} has experience in treating different cases of <b>somatic</b> disabilities.|$|E
25|$|In <b>somatic</b> cell nuclear {{transfer}} ("SCNT"), {{the nucleus of}} a <b>somatic</b> cell is taken from a donor and transplanted into a host egg cell, which had its own genetic material removed previously, making it an enucleated egg. After the donor <b>somatic</b> cell genetic material is transferred into the host oocyte with a micropipette, the <b>somatic</b> cell genetic material is fused with the egg using an electric current. Once the two cells have fused, the new cell can be permitted to grow in a surrogate or artificially. This is the process {{that was used to}} successfully clone Dolly the sheep (see section on History in this article).|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} <b>somatic</b> cell nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (<b>Somatic</b> Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a <b>somatic</b> cell, referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a <b>somatic</b> cell and an unnucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the <b>somatic</b> cell into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the <b>somatic</b> cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the <b>somatic</b> cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning {{or in the case of}} reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the <b>somatic</b> cells {{of an individual}} or a species is called the <b>somatic</b> number and is designated 2n. In the germ-line (the sex cells) the chromosome number is n (humans: n = 23).p28 Thus, in humans 2n = 46.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} SCNT {{is used for}} cloning is because <b>somatic</b> cells can be easily {{acquired}} and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point {{to remember is that}} cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor’s <b>somatic</b> cell nucleus. The oocyte will react on the <b>somatic</b> cell nucleus, the same way it would on sperm cells.|$|E
25|$|Box turtles have diploid <b>somatic</b> {{cells with}} 50 chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} cloning a {{particular}} farm animal using SCNT is relatively {{the same for}} all animals. The first step is to collect the <b>somatic</b> cells from the animal that will be cloned. The <b>somatic</b> cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use. The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the <b>somatic</b> nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped <b>somatic</b> cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{generation}} of TCR diversity {{is similar to}} that for antibodies and B cell antigen receptors. It arises mainly from genetic recombination of the DNA encoded segments in individual <b>somatic</b> T cells by <b>somatic</b> V(D)J recombination using RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases. Unlike immunoglobulins, however, TCR genes do not undergo <b>somatic</b> hypermutation, and T cells do not express Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase (AID). The recombination process that creates diversity in BCR (antibodies) and TCR is unique to lymphocytes (T and B cells) during the early stages of their development in primary lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells).|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{determining}} Grade A milk quality are well-established and {{outlined in the}} FDA Grade A Pasteurized Milk Ordinance. These grades are typically related to a measurement known as the <b>somatic</b> cell count (SCC) and the bacteria plate count. Generally a lower <b>somatic</b> cell count indicates better animal health, while the bacteria plate count indicates improved equipment sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} syndromes {{contributing}} to megalencephaly. Typically MCAP and MPPH can be distinguished by <b>somatic</b> features. In differentiation to MCAP, MPPH lacks consistent <b>somatic</b> features other than postaxial polydactly. Furthermore, brain and body development is normally symmetric in the majority of patients that appear to have MPPH symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>somatic</b> {{treatment}} {{that produced a}} permanent genetic change was performed in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} (PNS) is divided into the <b>somatic</b> nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, and the enteric nervous system. However, it is the <b>somatic</b> nervous system, responsible for body movement and the reception of external stimuli, which allows one to understand how cutaneous innervation is {{made possible by the}} action of specific sensory fibers located on the skin, as well as the distinct pathways they take to the central nervous system. The skin, {{which is part of the}} integumentary system, plays an important role in the <b>somatic</b> nervous system because it contains a range of nerve endings that react to heat and cold, touch, pressure, vibration, and tissue injury.|$|E
25|$|The <b>somatic</b> {{cell count}} shall be {{not more than}} one million (1,000,000) cfu cells per milliliter.|$|E
25|$|POIS {{is prone}} to being erroneously {{ascribed}} to psychological factors such as hypochondriasis or <b>somatic</b> symptom disorder.|$|E
25|$|In <b>somatic</b> cell {{gene therapy}} (SCGT), the {{therapeutic}} genes are transferred into any cell {{other than a}} gamete, germ cell, gametocyte, or undifferentiated stem cell. Any such modifications affect the individual patient only, and are not inherited by offspring. <b>Somatic</b> gene therapy represents mainstream basic and clinical research, in which therapeutic DNA (either integrated in the genome or as an external episome or plasmid) is used to treat disease.|$|E
25|$|Mitosis and meiosis are {{types of}} cell division. Mitosis occurs in <b>somatic</b> cells, while meiosis occurs in gametes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Somatic</b> practices, {{especially}} {{deprivation and}} diminishment. Deprivation aims to purify the body. Diminishment concerns the repulsement of ego-oriented impulses. Examples include fasting and poverty.|$|E
25|$|Port-wine stains {{were shown}} {{to be caused by}} a <b>somatic</b> {{activating}} c.548G→A mutation in the GNAQ gene. An association with RASA1 has also been described.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to methods that align reads from individual sample(s) to a reference genome {{in order to}} detect germline genetic variants, reads from multiple tissue samples within a single individual can be aligned and compared in order to detect <b>somatic</b> variants. These variants correspond to mutations that have occurred de novo within groups of <b>somatic</b> cells within an individual (that is, they are not present within the individual's germline cells). This form of analysis has been frequently applied {{to the study of}} cancer, where many studies are designed around investigating the profile of <b>somatic</b> mutations within cancerous tissues. Such investigations have resulted in diagnostic tools that have seen clinical application, and are used to improve scientific understanding of the disease, for instance by the discovery of new cancer-related genes, identification of involved gene regulatory networks and metabolic pathways, and by informing models of how tumors grow and evolve.|$|E
25|$|A {{change in}} the genetic {{structure}} that is not inherited from a parent, and also not passed to offspring, is called a <b>somatic</b> cell genetic mutation or acquired mutation. <b>Somatic</b> mutations are not inherited because this type of mutation {{does not affect the}} reproductive cells (sperm and egg) but it can affect any other type of cell. These types of mutations are usually prompted by environmental causes, such as ultraviolet radiation or any exposure to certain harmful chemicals. This type of mutation can cause various diseases; a common one is cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{psychotherapy}} approaches {{have been designed}} with the treatment of trauma in mind—EMDR, progressive counting (PC), <b>somatic</b> experiencing, biofeedback, Internal Family Systems Therapy, and sensorimotor psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Access to {{cancerous}} {{and normal}} tissue {{samples from the}} same patient {{and the fact that}} most cancer mutations represent <b>somatic</b> events, allow the identification of cancer-specific mutations.|$|E
25|$|Next, the {{significance}} of this newly identified relay system was evaluated by placing lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the front of the midbrain. Cats with mesancephalic interruptions to the ARAS entered into a deep sleep and displayed corresponding brain waves. In alternative fashion, cats with similarly placed interruptions to ascending auditory and <b>somatic</b> pathways exhibited normal sleeping and wakefulness, and could be awakened with <b>somatic</b> stimuli. Because these external stimuli would be blocked by the interruptions, this indicated that the ascending transmission must travel through the newly discovered ARAS.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{investigations}} {{have resulted in}} the development of software tools especially optimized for the detection of <b>somatic</b> mutations from multiple tissue samples. Probabilistic techniques have been developed that pool allele counts from all tissue samples at each locus, and using statistical models for the likelihoods of joint-genotypes for all the tissues, and the distribution of allele counts given the genotype, are able to calculate relatively robust probabilities of <b>somatic</b> mutations at each locus using all available data. In addition there has recently been some investigation in machine learning based techniques for performing this analysis.|$|E
