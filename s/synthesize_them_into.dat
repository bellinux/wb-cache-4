Ongoing globalization, increasing complexity and a strong trend towards project customer integration make this an important endeavor.

40|$|Regardless {{of studies}} and debates over a century, the {{statistical}} {{origin of the}} second law of thermodynamics still remains illusive. One essential obstacle {{is the lack of}} a proper theoretical formalism for non-equilibrium entropy. Here I revisit the seminal ideas about non-equilibrium statistical entropy due to Boltzmann and due to Gibbs, and <b>synthesize</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a coherent and precise framework. Using this framework, I clarify the anthropomorphic principle of entropy, and analyze the evolution of entropy for classical Hamiltonian systems under different experimental setups. I find that evolution of Boltzmann entropy obeys a Stochastic H-Theorem, which relates probability of Boltzmann entropy increasing to that of decreasing. By contrast, the coarse-grained Gibbs entropy is monotonically increasing, if the microscopic dynamics is locally mixing, and the initial state is a Boltzmann state. These results clarify the precise meaning of the second law of thermodynamics for classical systems, and demonstrate that it is the initial condition as a Boltzmann state that is ultimately responsible for the arrow of time.
