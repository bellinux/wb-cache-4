5000|$|On 12 July 1984, a C-141B {{experienced}} an uncontained failure of its number 3 engine immediately after takeoff from NAS Sigonella, on the Italian island of Sicily. Ejected debris caused number 4 engine to also fail. Debris also entered the cargo compartment {{and started a}} fire in a pallet containing paint. The cargo fire produced thick poisonous smoke which made visual control of aircraft extremely difficult. The aircraft entered a steep bank and crashed within 198 seconds of takeoff. All 8 crew men and a passenger on board were killed. Post crash toxicology indicated the crew had received potentially fatal levels of cyanide poisoning from the smoke, prior to impact. Subsequent to this accident, <b>smoke</b> <b>goggles</b> were added to crew oxygen masks.|$|E

60|$|One {{impatient}} {{little fellow}} clawed his way upon his mother's back and thrust his face out between her ears, and then I {{had a chance}} to see it better--a wonderful face, full of whims and drollery, with a white ring about its pointed muzzle, and a dark line running from the top of its nose and spreading into ebony rings around each eye, as if he were wearing queer <b>smoked</b> <b>goggles,</b> behind which the eyes twinkled and shone, or grew sober with much gravity as he heard the duck quacking. A keen face, yet very innocent, in which dog intelligence and fox cunning and bear drollery mingled perfectly; a face full of surprises, that set you smiling and thinking at once; a fascinating, inquisitive face, the most lovable and contradictious among the Wood Folk,--the face of Mooweesuk the coon, the Little Brother to the Bear, as Indian and naturalist unite in calling him.|$|R
60|$|The {{blinding}} {{glare of}} the sun had caused all to put on their <b>smoked</b> glasses, or <b>goggles,</b> but now, as the great orb of day was lost to sight behind the mountain tops, these protectors for the eyes were removed, that they might see their way clearer. The Alaskan twilight was creeping on them, causing all their surroundings to turn to a pale blue color. The mists of the mountains were also rising, and on every hand were weird, ghostlike shadows which enhanced this scene of wild desolation.|$|R
