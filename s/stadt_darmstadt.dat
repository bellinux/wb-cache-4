40|$|The European ICT Poles of Excellence (EIPE) {{research}} {{project is a}} joint project of DG CNECT and the JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies that established the conditions for defining, identifying, analysing and monitoring the existence and progress of current and future European ICT Poles of Excellence (EIPE), in order to distinguish these among the many European ICT clusters, observe their dynamics and offer an analysis of their characteristics. A case study report investigates 5 selected EIPEs – Inner London East, Paris, Kreisfreie <b>Stadt</b> <b>Darmstadt,</b> Dublin and Byen Kobenhavn. It presents and interprets the data collected {{during the course of}} the project to understand the actual facts, context and story of each location, i. e. its R&D, innovation and business activity. The case study report is complemented by 4 short notes, which offer the summarised views of local experts on the role played by public policies in the emergence and the sustainability of ICT activity in their region. The present note is on Copenhagen. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the EIPE case study report {{is to provide a}} more {{thorough}} analysis of five EIPEs, presenting and interpreting the data collected within the course of the project to understand the actual facts, context and story of each location, i. e. its R&D, innovation and business activity. This way, each case study gives a detailed picture of the type of activity and actors located in each EIPE organized along the methodological dimensions (activities and characteristics) explained in the methodological EIPE Report 2 (De Prato and Nepelski 2013 b). This exercise is meant to cast more light on the type of activity and actors in each location and to reveal their strengths and weaknesses. This information is expected to give a better overview of the ICT environment in each of the location and to help to understand their role in the European ICT landscape. The report attempts to give a detailed overview of ICT-related activity in five selected regions: •	Inner-London East (UKI 12), •	Paris (FR 101), •	Kreisfreie <b>Stadt</b> <b>Darmstadt</b> (DE 711), •	Dublin (IE 021), •	Byen Kobenhavn (DK 011).
