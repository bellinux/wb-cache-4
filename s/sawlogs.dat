25|$|The {{eucalyptus}} species most planted are E. grandis, E. globulus and E. dunnii; {{they are}} used mainly for pulp mills. Approximately 80,000 ha of E. grandis situated in the departments of Rivera, Tacuarembó and Paysandú is primarily earmarked for the solid wood market, although a portion of it is used for <b>sawlogs</b> and plywood. The current area under commercial forest plantation is 6% of the total. The main uses of the wood produced are elemental chlorine free pulp mill production (for cellulose and paper), <b>sawlogs,</b> plywood and bioenergy (thermoelectric generation). Most of the products obtained from sawmills and pulp mills, as well as plywood and logs, are exported. This has raised the income of this sector with respect to traditional products from other sectors. Uruguayan forestry plantations have rates of growth of 30 cubic metres per hectare per year and commercial harvesting occurs after 9 years.|$|E
30|$|A dataset from PFSQ {{containing}} 2418 individual {{trees with}} assigned product categories of quality <b>sawlog</b> was used. For each tree, the measured length of harvestable log {{was used for}} estimating the biomass harvested for <b>sawlog.</b> The remaining tree components were used for estimating biomass retained on-site following a <b>sawlog</b> harvest operation. The whole tree biomass for these trees was calculated using individual tree allometric equations (Eqs. 1, 2, and 3). The volume of the recoverable <b>sawlog</b> was calculated using Huber’s formulae (Husch et al. 2002), and converted to dry weight by multiplying log volume by wood density for each species (Ilic et al. 2000). Biomass retained on-site as <b>sawlog</b> residual was the difference between whole tree biomass and the harvested biomass. The mean proportion of whole tree biomass that is harvested as a <b>sawlog</b> was derived from these estimates.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Two econometric {{models were}} {{developed}} to forecast consumption, production, and price of hardwood lumber, and removals and price of hardwood <b>sawlog</b> stumpage. Four eastern U. S. regions were represented in the models. Hardwood lumber consumption by manufacturing, shipping, residential construction, and nonresidential construction industries was recognized. Hardwood <b>sawlog</b> stumpage removals from nonindustrial private and forest industry ownerships were identified {{in each of the}} four eastern regions. Each model consisted of behavioral relationships which explain consumption, production, or removals as a function of price and other explanatory variables. Estimates of these relationships were developed using annual time series data for the sample period 1960 to 1976. Based on the analysis of historical simulations, the models appeared to provide adequate predictive ability to be used to develop forecasts. Hardwood lumber consumption, production, and price were forecast to increase to the year 2030. Manufacturing and shipping industries increase their share of hardwood lumber consumption over this time period. Hardwood lumber production shares increase for the two southern regions. Hardwood <b>sawlog</b> stumpage removals for the nonindustrial private and forest industry ownerships were forecast to increase. The nonindustrial private share of hardwood <b>sawlog</b> stumpage removals declines. Hardwood <b>sawlog</b> stumpage prices were forecast to decline in three of the four eastern regions...|$|R

30|$|Current timber {{harvesting}} in private native hardwood forests in Queensland is mainly for <b>sawlog.</b> This harvest removes {{a high quality}} <b>sawlog</b> portion and retains a considerable portion of the felled tree on-site as non-merchantable. This is unlike in adjacent state of New South Wales (NSW) where native hardwood forest harvesting removal can include removal of high quality trees for veneer, and others for <b>sawlog</b> and a small fraction for pulp, and individual trees are harvested up to the non-merchantable upper diameter (Ximenes et al. 2008). Following a similar approach to NSW, {{a portion of the}} non-harvested tree biomass during <b>sawlog</b> harvesting in Queensland can potentially be harvested for biomass for bioenergy while still retaining the upper top portion of the tree for environmental purposes. The amount of tree biomass that can be recovered for commercial use and the portion retained for environmental purposes can be estimated by partitioning aboveground tree biomass into proportions: commercial stem log, stump, bark and crown. Since no comprehensive biomass harvest partitioning data were available for native hardwood forests in Queensland {{at the time of this}} study, generalised estimates from the NSW were used. These were based on detailed published data for two common commercial timber species (Corymbia maculata (spotted gum) and Eucalyptus obliqua (messmate)) in NSW (Ximenes et al. 2008).|$|R

30|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to provide an {{estimate}} of current harvestable biomass for bioenergy in living trees from private native forests within the Southeast Queensland bioregion. This is in recognition that in addition to biomass residual from wood processing (ABBA Qld 2016), residual biomass from <b>sawlog</b> harvesting and silvicultural thinning of poorly formed trees and those suppressing growth of timber trees (i.e., normal silvicultural treatment) has potential bioenergy value. Specific objectives were to: (1) map the extent and location of harvestable forest types within private native forests in the Southeast Queensland bioregion; (2) determine surplus recoverable biomass for bioenergy following conventional <b>sawlog</b> harvest; (3) determine and provide baseline biomass for bioenergy yield estimates from integrated <b>sawlog</b> and non-merchantable silvicultural treatment harvest; and (4) estimate the proportion of biomass retained on-site following a biomass for bioenergy harvest to address protection of soil productivity, water quality, and site-level biodiversity values.|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} various inter-market {{relationships of}} forest products using cointegration and causality tests together. Of the six Douglas fir domestic <b>sawlog,</b> export <b>sawlog,</b> and lumber {{markets in the}} Pacific Northwest, {{we find that the}} two log markets and the two lumber markets are integrated, respectively. However, the two export log markets are not, nor is any cross-grade combination. In conjunction with cointegration restrictions, our causality tests demonstrate that export and lumber prices lead the movement of domestic <b>sawlog</b> prices; and similarly, the movements of domestic lumber prices follow the movements of export log prices. A close examination further reveals that export log prices for Region 1 lead the price formation process in all the lumber markets and log markets. We believe that these results have significant implications for understanding and thus dealing with forest products market behavior and price forecasting. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Continuous forest {{inventory}} (CFI) {{is an effective}} method for studying forest changes over time; it provides growth and yield information which forest planners and managers can use for planning and managing forests to meet long-term sustained yield. This thesis reports results from a 30 year series of successive CFI measurement at Mt. Cole State Forest in west-central Victoria, commencing in 1963. With an area of 12, 352 ha, Mt. Cole State Forest consists of three sub areas; {{the northern and southern}} Blocks totalling 11, 250 ha, and the Mt. Lonarch Block comprised of 1, 102 ha. Permanent sample plots (CFI plots) were first established in the Mt. Cole Blocks in 1963 and these have been measured on seven occasions, including the most recent 1994 assessment. During this period, various changes to the inventory data-base have occurred, which have impacted on the analysis and interpretation of the data. Since 1983 the forest area of the Mt. Cole Blocks have been classified according to land use and management zoning, resulting in a reduction of the net productive area available for <b>sawlog</b> production to 2, 758 ha. This area has also been stratified into four homogenous areas (strata) and the number of CFI plots has been reduced from an initial 114 to 66 plots. In the latest (1994) remeasurement, the 66 permanent sample plots for the four strata of the Northern and Southern Mt. Cole Blocks were rechecked and the data has been analysed to determine current growth and yield, and to estimate future volume growth and an available cut for the forest. The above analyses show that the structure and yield of the forest have changed from time to time, with a trend towards decreasing levels of available growing stock over time. The current (1994) growing stock levels of the Mt. Cole Blocks are approximately 80, 676 m 2 � 27 % (P= 0. 95) or 28. 6 � 3. 7 m 2 /ha for basal area, and 237, 684 m 3 � 36 % (P= 0. 95) or 83. 7 � 13. 9 m 3 /ha for 'sawlog plus potential <b>sawlog</b> volume'. The current available <b>sawlog</b> volume is approximately 177, 672 m 3 � 44 % (P= 0. 95) or 63. 5 � 12. 5 m 3 /ha. Additional analyses of periodic and annual growth rates of the growing stock for each stratum and the whole forest (Mt. Cole Blocks) show that the average diameter increment (underbark) of the forest is approximately 0. 51 � 0. 03 cm/yr; the net annual increment including ingrowth (Gn+i) of the growing stock in the Mt. Cole Blocks is approximately 0. 63 � 0. 11 m 2 /ha/yr for basal area, 2. 16 � 0. 75 m 3 /ha/yr for <b>sawlog,</b> and 1. 78 � 0. 68 m 3 /ha/yr for <b>sawlog</b> plus potential <b>sawlog.</b> The net annual changes in growing stock levels (Gd) are approximately 0. 11 � 0. 29 m 2 /ha/yr for basal area, - 0. 15 � 1. 52 m 3 /ha/yr for <b>sawlog,</b> and - 0. 65 � 1. 52 m 3 /ha/yr for <b>sawlog</b> plus potential <b>sawlog.</b> Models for predicting the current and future growing stock levels were developed using multiple regression based on the three parameters of initial basal area (BO), initial volume (Yo), and the interval of time between successive measurements (t). Regulating forests to obtain long-term sustained yields requires a continuous flow of information on growth and yield and the development of comprehensive management strategies based on this information. In this study, such growth and yield information have been used to determine an annual available cut for the Mt. Cole Blocks of approximately 5, 364 � 1, 854 m 3 /yr.
