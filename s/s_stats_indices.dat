Although total STAT 3 levels were the same between the hepatic lesions and normal livers, <b>S</b> 727 -phosphorylated <b>STAT</b> 3 was enhanced in adenomas and HCCs, whereas Y 705 -phosphorylated STAT 3 was detected mainly in HCCs.

When HCCs were simultaneously treated with FBS/IL- 6, selective suppression of S 727 phosphorylation by an MEK inhibitor prevented STAT 3 nuclear accumulation and cell proliferation.

A link between leptin receptor-signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (LepR-STAT 3) signalling pathway and FTO was recently suggested in the hypothalamus.

[br/] Results: [br/] We found that FTO protein expression is regulated by both leptin and IL- 6, concomitantly to an induction of STAT 3 tyrosine phosphorylation, in leptin receptor (LepRb) expressing HuH 7 cells. In addition, FTO overexpression in vitro altered both leptin-induced Y 705 and <b>S</b> 727 <b>STAT</b> 3 phosphorylation, leading to dysregulation of glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 P) expression and mitochondrial density, respectively. In vivo, liver specific FTO overexpression in mice induced a reducetion of Y 705 phosphorylation of STAT 3 in nuclear fraction, associated with reduced SOCS 3 and LepR mRNA levels and with an increased G 6 P expression. Interestingly, FTO overexpression also induced <b>S</b> 727 <b>STAT</b> 3 phosphorylation in liver mitochondria, resulting in an increase of mitochondria function and density. Altogether, these data indicate that FTO promotes mitochondrial recruitment of STAT 3 to the detriment of its nuclear localization, affecting in turn oxidative metabolism and the expression of leptin-targeted genes. Interestingly, these effects were associated in mice with alterations of leptin action and hyperleptinemia, as well as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance.

The data from radio to VHE gamma-rays do not show any significant variability. Conclusions. The lack of a massive stellar counterpart disfavors the binary hypothesis, while the soft VHE spectrum would be very unusual in case of a pulsar wind nebula. In addition, the distance estimates for Galactic counterparts places them outside of the Milky Way. All available observations favor an interpretation as an extreme, high-frequency peaked BL Lac object with a redshift z > 0. 14.

M 33 remains undetected, and we computed an upper limit of´-of´of´- 2. 0 10 erg cm s 12 2 1 on the – 0. 1 100 GeV energy flux (95 % confidence level). This revised upper limit remains consistent with the observed correlation between gamma-ray luminosity and star formation rate tracers and implies an average CR density in M 33 that is at most half of that of the MW. M 31 is detected with a significance of nearly s 10. Its spectrum is consistent with a power law with photon index G =  + 2. 4 0. 1 stat syst and a – 0. 1 100 GeV energy flux of ()  ´ +- 5. 6 0. 6 10 erg cm <b>s</b> <b>stat</b> syst 12 2 1. M 31 is detected to be extended with a s 4 significance. The spatial distribution of the emission is consistent with a uniform-brightness disk with a radius of 0 °. 4 and no offset {{from the center of the}} galaxy, but nonuniform intensity distributions cannot be excluded. The flux from M 31 appears confined to the inner regions of the galaxy and does not fill the disk of the galaxy or extend far from it. The gamma-ray signal is not correlated with regions rich in gas or star formation activity, which suggests that the emission is not interstellar in origin, unless the energetic particles radiating in gamma rays do not originate in recent star formation. Alternative and nonexclusive interpretations are that the emission results from a population of millisecond pulsars dispersed in the bulge and disk of M 31 by disrupted globular clusters or from the decay or annihilation of dark matter particles, similar to what has been proposed to account for the so-called Galactic center excess found in Fermi-LAT observations of the MW...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a detailed {{overview of the}} rationale for key aspects of the protocol of the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial. It also highlights unusual aspects of the study implementation and the baseline characteristics. The DIG trial is a large, simple, international placebo-controlled trial whose primary objective {{is to determine the}} effect of digoxin on all cause mortality in patients with clinical heart failure who are in sinus rhythm and whose ejection fraction is {{less than or equal to}} 0. 45. An ancillary study examines the effect in those with an ejection fraction > 0. 45. Key aspects of the trial include the simplicity of the design, broad eligibility criteria, essential data collection, and inclusion of various types of centers. A total of 302 centers in the United States and Canada enrolled 7788 patients between February 1991 and September 1993. Follow-up continued until December 1995 with the results available in Spring 1996.

40|$|Abstract. The gas {{explosion}} in spherical vessel vented into a dump vessel (“dump vessel vented”) was studied by experimental and numerical simulation. The CFD model used provided a reasonable {{agreement with the}} experimental results. The maximum pressure of the explosion vessel {{is more than the}} direct venting. But when ratio of dump vessel volume (vd) to explosion vessel volume (ve) is more than or equal to 5, the maximum pressure in the explosion vessel approximately equal to the maximum pressure of simple vented.
