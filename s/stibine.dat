5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas <b>stibine</b> (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E

5000|$|In chemistry, {{nitrogen}} inversion is a fluxional {{process in}} compounds with a nitrogen atom {{that has a}} pyramidal geometry, such as ammonia (NH3), whereby the molecule [...] "turns inside out".

For a compound {{that would otherwise be}} chiral due to a nitrogen stereocenter, nitrogen inversion allows its enantiomers to rapidly interconvert, making chiral resolution impossible unless the inversion process is prevented by steric or electronic effects. The concept of nitrogen inversion can be extended to other compounds that contain atoms of other elements with trigonal pyramidal geometry, such as carbanions, phosphines, arsines, <b>stibines</b> and sulfoxides, in which case it is called pyramidal inversion.|$|R
25|$|Ammonia reacts violently {{with the}} halogens. Nitrogen triiodide, a primary high {{explosive}}, is formed when ammonia {{comes in contact}} with iodine.

The gas is swept into a glass tube and decomposed by means of heating around 250–300°C. The presence of arsenic is indicated by formation of a deposit in the heated part of the equipment.

The experiments were performed in dichloromethane and in ethyl acetate, at 298 K and 268 K respectively for the first reaction step, and for the second reaction step over a temperature range from 278 to 313 K in both solvents. The first step is very fast (up to 1630 s(- 1)) and on the limit of what is observable with the stopped-flow technique. Introduction of the five-coordinate complex trans-[Rh(Cl) (CO) (SbPh 3) (3) ] (2) in equilibrium with (1), by adding an excess SbPh 3, led to {{a significant decrease in}} overall reaction rate for the formation of the intermediate trans-[Rh(Cl) -(CO) (SbPh 3) (2) (2, 4 -TBPP) ] (3). Activation parameters for the second substitution reaction, in which 3 is converted to 4, has been determined as Delta H double dagger = 22. 85 +/- 0. 17 and 28. 38 +/- 0. 10 kJ mol(- 1) and Delta S double dagger = - 144. 7 +/- 0. 6 and - 100. 9 +/- 0. 4 J mol(- 1) K- 1 for CH 2 Cl 2 and EtOAc respectively, supporting an associative pathway.

5000|$|Arsine, <b>stibine</b> and bismuthine {{are highly}} toxic, {{thermally}} unstable, and colourless gases. No appreciable hydrogen bonding {{is found in}} phosphine, arsine, <b>stibine</b> or bismuthine, {{and there is no}} appreciable tendency to dissociate like ammonia to [...] and [...] (M = P, As, Sb, Bi). The pnictogen hydrides become denser down the group and the M-H bond lengths increase, while the H-M-H bond angle decreases slightly. The standard enthalpies of formation reflect the increasing thermal instability going down the group. Arsine decomposes to arsenic and hydrogen at 250-300 °C, <b>stibine</b> to antimony and hydrogen at room temperature, and bismuthine to bismuth and hydrogen above −45 °C. Arsine and <b>stibine</b> are very easily oxidised to arsenic or antimony trioxide and water; a similar reaction happens with sulfur or selenium.

50|$|Four allotropes of {{antimony}} are known: {{a stable}} metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Elemental antimony is a brittle, silver-white shiny metalloid. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a trigonal cell, isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride. When scratched {{with a sharp}} implement, an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor. It has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100 °C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of <b>stibine</b> (SbH3) at −90 °C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.|$|E
50|$|Angered and {{frustrated}} by this, especially when John Bodle confessed {{later that he}} indeed killed his grandfather, Marsh decided to devise a better test to demonstrate the presence of arsenic. Taking Scheele's work as a basis, he constructed a simple glass apparatus capable of not only detecting minute traces of arsenic but also measuring its quantity. Adding a sample of tissue or body fluid to a glass vessel with zinc and acid would produce arsine gas if arsenic was present, {{in addition to the}} hydrogen that would be produced regardless by the zinc reacting with the acid. Igniting this gas mixture would oxidize any arsine present into arsenic and water vapor. This would cause a cold ceramic bowl held in the jet of the flame to be stained with a silvery-black deposit of arsenic, physically similar to the result of Metzger's reaction. The intensity of the stain could then be compared to films produced using known amounts of arsenic. Not only could minute amounts of arsenic be detected (as little as 0.02 mg), the test was very specific for arsenic. Although antimony (Sb) could give a false-positive test by forming <b>stibine</b> (SbH3) gas which decomposes on heating to form a similar black deposit, it would not dissolve in a solution of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), while arsenic would.|$|E

Results indicated that <b>stibine</b> {{was formed by}} the electrochemical discharge of a water molecule upon an antimony atom which was in contact with either two adsorbed hydro-gen atoms or an adsorbed hydrogen molecule.
