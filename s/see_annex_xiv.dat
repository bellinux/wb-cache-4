30|$|A SVHC {{will become}} subject to {{authorisation}} by inclusion into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the Regulation. Responsible for the decision on inclusion in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> is the REACH committee of the European Commission. In advance of this decision, ECHA is requested to recommend which substances of the candidate list {{should be included in}} <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> with high priority. Once included in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV,</b> production and use of the substance in the EU is limited by a sunset date. From this date on, every single use needs to be assessed by ECHA and authorised by the European Commission for a limited period on request of manufactures or users.|$|R
50|$|As {{of today}} (2015/05/26), 161 {{substances}} are {{listed on the}} Candidate List and 31 substances {{are listed in the}} <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV.</b> The candidate list is usually updated every 6 months and the <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> is updated every 12 to 18 months.|$|R
50|$|Recommendations {{to include}} SVHCs in the <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> {{are made by}} ECHA and are debated by all {{relevant}} stakeholders (Member States, companies, NGOs, etc.). The final decision of inclusion of the substance into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> is taken by the European Commission.|$|R

30|$|By September 2012, 14 SVHC {{are already}} {{included}} in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV.</b> Among these substances are four phthalates and some lead pigments. For 11 of these substances, the last possibility {{to apply for}} an authorisation is in 2013 [17]. If no authorisations are applied for and granted, marketing and use of these SVHC will terminate between August 2014 and August 2015. In addition, ECHA suggested 10 substances to be prioritised for inclusion into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> in 2012.|$|R

30|$|For {{substances}} {{with certain}} properties {{of very high}} concern (SVHC), the REACH Regulation gives the option of inclusion in the candidate list and possibly in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> (list of substances subject to authorisation). This brings information requirements for manufacturers, importers and suppliers of articles. Furthermore, an application for authorisation must be made for substances listed in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the REACH regulation [8]. After a transitional period, substances included in this list can be used only for expressly authorised uses for limited time spans.|$|R
5000|$|This list is {{referred}} to as the [...] "candidate" [...] list because all substances placed on it are candidates for inclusion in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of REACH. If a substance is added to <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV,</b> it is given a [...] "latest application date" [...] and a [...] "sunset date". The sunset date is the date after which the substance cannot be used or imported into the EU without authorisation from the ECHA, and the latest application date is the date by which any applications for use must be submitted to the ECHA.|$|R
30|$|Eventually, the {{commission}} will {{decide on the}} inclusion in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> which prohibits all uses of the substance unless authorisation for a specific use is granted. An application date and the latest date of use (‘sunset date’) will be announced and industry can decide whether to apply for authorisation or switch to suitable alternatives. Taking account of ECHA's capacities and the undefined period of time for comitology to take place, {{only a limited number}} of SVHC can be included into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> at a time. The REACH legal text does not specify if and when prioritisation from the candidate list into <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> will take place which causes great planning uncertainties for industry. Authorisation shall be granted if the risk to human health or the environment is demonstrated to be adequately controlled (article 60 (2)). If adequate control cannot be demonstrated, authorisation may only be granted if it is shown that socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks (article 60 (4)).|$|R
50|$|The {{formulation}} of a mixture is {{considered as a}} use under REACh and {{the substance of the}} <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> is only subject to authorisation if it exceeds the required concentrations.|$|R
50|$|While {{according}} to ICAO Regulations (<b>Annex</b> <b>XIV)</b> the new runway {{would have to}} be named 08L/26R (renaming the existing north runway to 08C/26C), it is currently assigned the working title 09/27 in all plans.|$|R
50|$|When {{listed in}} <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the REACh regulation, a {{substance}} is therefore assigned a “sunset date” after which its use will be banned, unless an Authorisation is granted for a definite period of time.|$|R
30|$|The {{authorisation}} requirement applies with {{effect of the}} sunset date stipulated in the specific <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> entry, while {{in the case of}} the restriction according to Article  69 (2) REACH ECHA starts to consider action only after such date.|$|R
50|$|<b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> is {{the last}} step of this {{prioritisation}} process. It lists SVHCs which exhibit a particularly high risk for human health or the environment (based on their inherent properties, quantities and uses) in order to forbid their use in the EU market.|$|R
50|$|The {{authorisation}} procedure {{is one of}} the regulatory tools of the European regulation (CE) REACh n°1907/2006 aiming to ban the use of substances of very high concern (SVHC) included in the <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of REACH, so as to substitute them by technically and economically feasible alternatives.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} whether the domestic and the imported articles are ‘like products’ the following product pair has to be assessed: article A, produced in the EEA and not containing any SVHC, and a similar article B, produced in a third country and containing one or more <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> SVHC.|$|R

30|$|For {{substances}} registered under REACH, {{the revised}} Annex XIII [7] not only gives the criteria {{but also the}} information relevant for the screening and assessment of P, vP, B, vB and T properties. Also, ECHA provides extensive guidance on PBT/vPvB assessment [8, 9]. Substances of very high concern (SVHC) (e.g. PBT/vPvB) {{are included in the}} ‘candidate list’ for authorisation, based on the outcome of the scientific assessment of intrinsic properties. Substances on the ‘candidate list’ can then be prioritised for authorisation and finally listed in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> of the REACH regulation. Some substances may be listed with specific exemptions that do not require authorisation. For each substance included in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV,</b> a deadline will be set after which use of that substance in the EU must stop (known as the ‘sunset date’), unless authorized by the European Commission.|$|R

30|$|According to Art. 59 (1) REACH all {{identified}} SVHC are {{candidates for}} inclusion in Annex XIV REACH, this candidate status being {{the first step to}} subject a substance to the authorisation scheme. By mid-July 2016 <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> lists 31 substances [10]. Examples of listed SVHC are DEHP and lead chromate [10]. Following Art.  56 (1) REACH a manufacturer, importer or downstream user shall not place an <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> substance on the market for use or use it himself, unless this use is exempt from the authorisation requirement or the actor, or his supplier, respectively, attained an authorisation for the corresponding use. The authorisation scheme thus establishes a use specific ban that is effective from a specified sunset date with permit reservation: by applying for authorisation actors may temporarily—according to Art. 60 (8) REACH every authorisation decision is subject to review—overcome the barrier of the ban. For this they must, prior to the placing on the market or usage, prove that the risks posed by the substance use are adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks [11].|$|R

30|$|In the PBT-subgroup, the German {{experts were}} {{rapporteur}} for anthracene and six anthracene derivatives. In order {{to transfer the}} results of this evaluation into the legislative framework of REACH, Germany suggested these substances as SVHC due to the persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic properties. The Member State Committee (MSC) unanimously supported these proposals. In October 2008 and January 2010 anthracen and six anthracen derivatives were taken up in the candidate list for eventual inclusion in <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> (Art. 58 (1)).|$|R
30|$|As of March 2013, {{none of the}} {{isocyanates}} {{were included}} in the European Commission initiated Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV,</b> a list of substances that require authorisation for continuous use in the EU (Agency 2015). However, there are ongoing REACH substance evaluations for the most commercially important isomers of TDI and MDI that in the future may lead to further action such as restrictions in usage or authorisation (No et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|The {{process of}} {{authorisation}} for SVHCs will achieve its full potential in promoting substitution of hazards when companies proactively change formulations and downstream users demand that suppliers avoid using SVHCs in their products. The process of identifying SVHC and their prioritisation within <b>Annex</b> <b>XIV</b> leaves {{room for improvement}} in assessing risks of exposure to these substances in the occupational setting. Granted authorisations cannot be evaluated so far as no decision on an application has been made.|$|R
