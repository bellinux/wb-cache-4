There are so many fine young women longing for something to fill up the empty places that come when the first flush of youth is over, and the serious side of life appears; so many promising young men learning to conceal or condemn the high ideals and the noble purposes they started with, because they find no welcome for them.

Was {{this going to be}} one of those moments in which everything changes? Fortunately, my fears were groundless, and I was soon restored to my usual sense of self. But the unsettling experience was a timely reminder of why health policy – an area often obfuscated by impenetrable jargon and self-interested powerbrokers – matters <b>so</b> much. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> find health policy debates mind-numbingly dull – as news editors have been complaining in the United States, where even the Obama factor is not enough to stop audiences switching off – there will come a time when they are suddenly, awfully relevant [...] .

When she found out she was pregnant while on the drug, both she and, admittedly, I were very scared to learn that the drug is teratogenic in that it causes MÃ¶bius syndrome. How great is the risk? ANSWER: Very small. Although women who use misoprostol during the first trimester have a 30 -fold higher risk of having babies with MÃ¶bius syndrome, the malformation is <b>so</b> rare that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> see 1000 women who took misoprostol during embryogenesis, you might not see a single child with the syndrome.

When you play a game, you should play it all the way or not at all. <b>So,</b> for instance, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don’t like your face you should embrace it, emphasise it, even!

60|$|In some few cases, indeed, {{among the}} shark and ray family, the {{mechanism}} for protection goes {{a step or}} two further than in these simple kinds. That well-known frequenter of Australian harbours, the Port Jackson shark, lays a pear-shaped egg, with a sort of spiral staircase of leathery ridges winding round it outside, Chinese pagoda wise, <b>so</b> that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> bite it (I speak in the person of a predaceous fish) it eludes your teeth, and goes dodging off screw-fashion into the water beyond. There's no getting at this evasive body anywhere; when you think you have it, it wriggles away sideways, and refuses to give any hold for jaws or palate. In fact, a more slippery or guileful egg was never yet devised by nature's unconscious ingenuity. Then, again, the Antarctic chimæra (so called from its very unprepossessing personal appearance) relies rather upon pure deception than upon mechanical means for the security of its eggs. The shell or case in this instance is prolonged at the edge into a kind of broad wing on either side, so that it exactly resembles one of the large flat leaves of the Antarctic fucus in whose midst it lurks. It forms the high-water mark, I fancy, of protective resemblance amongst eggs, for not only is the margin leaf-like in shape, but it is even gracefully waved and fringed with floating hairs, as is the fashion with the expanded fronds of so many among the gigantic far-southern sea-weeds.|$|R
40|$|The {{labor market}} is a {{relationship}} between the demand (persons who seek work) and supply (job vacancies). The labor market is very complex, to study it we have to know better the characteristics of its variables, ie demand and supply. The Good compatibility between demand and supply is the golden key to well-functioning of labor market. Using the data obtained from questionnaires issued to study the labor market, many shortages are revealed in some sectors, especially in some professions, in terms of labor power, Identification of the skills and training needs of companies is the essence of consultation, orientation to career and training services. The survey through questionnaires is used as a means of research. The Information obtained from the research on needed skills ought to {{become an integral part of}} the Information System on Labor Market (ISLM). The Information on Labor Market that was usually collected through employment services, education and vocational training departments and national training agencies, facilitates the analysis on the efficiency and effectiveness of the training system and estimation of training demand, and enables the employment services and training providers to make possible the adjustment of both, demand and supply. as well. Concerning Albania, it is important to develop effective institutions and policies on labor market in order to reduce the inefficiencies and to create more job vacancies. In this aspect, we need to understand better what is happening with the economy. The results of the study suggest the existence of strong national divisions and regional labor market in terms of age and gender, which are <b>so</b> strong that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have in mind the caution that is dictated by the given samlpe it is felt that further investigation will be justified...|$|R

5000|$|E. Pariser, {{author of}} The Filter Bubble, {{explains}} how {{there are differences}} that search personalization has on both Facebook and Google. Facebook implements personalization {{when it comes to}} the amount of things people share and what pages they [...] "like". An individual's social interactions, whose profile they visit the most, who they message or chat with are all indicators that are used when Facebook uses personalization. Rather than what people share being an indicator of what is filtered out, Google takes into consideration what we [...] "click" [...] to filter out what comes up in our searches. In addition, Facebook searches are not necessarily as private as the Google ones. Facebook draws on the more public self and users share what other people want to see. Even while tagging photographs, Facebook uses personalization and face recognition that will automatically assign a name to face. Facebook’s like button utilizes its users to do their own personalization for the website. What posts the user comments on or likes tells Facebook what type of posts they will be interested in for the future. In addition to this, it helps them predict what type of posts they will “comment on, share, or spam in the future.” The predictions are combined together to produce one relevancy score which helps Facebook decide what to show you and what to filter out. In 2016, Facebook introduced reactions (Love, Thankful, Haha, Wow, Sad, and Angry) in addition to liking a post. “Facebook has learned that any Reaction left on a post is a strong indicator that the user was more interested in that post than any other ‘liked’ posts.” Facebook is starting to weigh reactions the same way as likes. <b>So</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> leave the “angry” reaction on a post, Facebook will show posts on the user’s feed because the user showed an interest in it.|$|E
