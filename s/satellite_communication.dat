5|$|The {{datalink}} for Malaysia Airline's avionics {{communications at}} the time of the incident was supplied by SITA, which contracted with Inmarsat to provide a <b>satellite</b> <b>communication</b> link using Inmarsat's Classic Aero service. Aeronautical <b>satellite</b> <b>communication</b> (SATCOM) systems are used to transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may also be used to transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax, and data links using other protocols. An appropriate comparison of ACARS' relationship to the SATCOM system is that of a messaging application to a smartphone; the smartphone functions and will remain registered on a mobile phone network even if the messaging application is closed.|$|E

5|$|The {{analysis}} of the <b>satellite</b> <b>communication</b> relies on {{a limited number of}} data points that were analysed using innovative techniques that were only developed after the incident. The analysis has worked to determine useful information about in-flight events and the location of Flight370 at the 08:19MYT signal—believed to have occurred near the time of fuel exhaustion and thus is close to the final location of Flight370.|$|E
5|$|The {{communications}} between Flight 370 and the <b>satellite</b> <b>communication</b> network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} clues {{to the location of}} Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT.

5|$|Cuba and Puerto Rico, {{neither of}} which were {{expected}} to experience the worst of Dean's strength, prepared more modestly.

5|$|Telecommunication and {{broadcast}} networks {{can be affected}} by volcanic ash in the following ways: attenuation and reduction of signal strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through user demand. Signal attenuation due to volcanic ash is not well documented; however, {{there have been reports}} of disrupted communications following the 1969 Surtsey eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Research by the New Zealand-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to low frequency services such as <b>satellite</b> <b>communication.</b> Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{established}} the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) {{to investigate the}} incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's <b>satellite</b> <b>communication</b> network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E

5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a <b>satellite</b> <b>communication</b> network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} for security of <b>satellite</b> mobile <b>communication</b> networks to design an efficient access authentication process. A two-way access authentication scheme among mobile users, gateways and the Network Control Centre (NCC) is designed in this study. The authentication scheme consists of four phases: mobile users registration, mobile users management, mobile authentication and mobile authentication update. Furthermore, the Syverson-van Oorschot (SVO) logic is introduced to reason the authentication scheme to verify the security. This scheme highlights the authentication role of gateways, and decreases the authentication computation load of the NCC. The access authentication scheme can resist attacks from any side, including the identity spoofing, tampering, replay etc. The integrity of the transmission data is also protected. Therefore the security for <b>satellite</b> mobile <b>communication</b> networks is enhanced. This access authentication scheme is implemented on the developed <b>satellite</b> mobile <b>communication</b> simulation platform. The obtained simulation {{results suggest that the}} authenticated overheads for audio service and video service are low, and the proposed scheme does not degrade the quality of service (QoS) of the <b>satellite</b> mobile <b>communication.</b> © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology...|$|R
