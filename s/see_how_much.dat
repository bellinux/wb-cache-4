25|$|During {{the first}} half of the first season, the show's set resembled that of an ancient Roman gladiatorial arena, with the stands raised high above the ground.

25|$|Heidegger himself, who is {{supposed}} to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, {{we will not be able}} to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why he left it unfinished.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} drivers and TSRs, {{is that they}} would use {{different}} amounts of conventional and/or upper memory, based on the order they were loaded. This {{could be used to}} advantage if the programs were repeatedly loaded in different orders, and checking to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> memory was free after each permutation. For example, if there was a 50 KB UMB and a 10 KB UMB, and programs needing 8 KB and 45 KB were loaded, the 8 KB might go into the 50 KB UMB, preventing the second from loading. Later versions of DOS allowed the use of a specific load address for a driver or TSR, to fit drivers/TSRs more tightly together.|$|E

Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
