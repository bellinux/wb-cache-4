5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} whether Leigh {{was in the}} <b>shower</b> {{the entire}} time or a body double was used for {{some parts of the}} murder sequence and its aftermath. In an interview with Roger Ebert and in the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Leigh stated she was in the scene the entire time and Hitchcock used a stand-in only for the sequence in which Norman wraps Marion's body in a <b>shower</b> curtain and places it in the trunk of her car. The 2010 book The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock's <b>Shower</b> by Robert Graysmith contradicts this, identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh's body double for some of the <b>shower</b> scene's shots. Graysmith also stated that Hitchcock later acknowledged Renfro's participation in the scene.|$|E

5|$|Two {{established}} meteor showers {{originate from}} within Corvus' boundaries. German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister discovered and named the Corvids in 1937, after observing them between June 25 and July 2.

Hoffmeister noted the trajectory of the <b>shower</b> {{was similar to that}} of the comet 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, though this was not confirmed by Zhukov and colleagues in 2011. The <b>shower</b> has been tentatively linked with 4015 Wilson–Harrington. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the Eta Corvids, assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.|$|E
