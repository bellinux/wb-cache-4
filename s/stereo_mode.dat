50|$|When used {{within the}} MP3 {{compression}} process, joint stereo normally employs multiple techniques, and can switch between them for each MPEG frame. Typically, a modern encoder's joint <b>stereo</b> <b>mode</b> uses M/S stereo for some frames and L/R stereo for others, whichever method yields the best result. Encoders use different algorithms {{to determine when}} to switch and how much space to allocate to each channel; quality can suffer if the switching is too frequent or if the side channel doesn't get enough bits. With some encoding software, {{it is possible to}} force the use of M/S stereo for all frames, mimicking the joint <b>stereo</b> <b>mode</b> of some early encoders like Xing.

40|$|An {{instrumentation}} system {{to provide a}} noncontact method for measurement of target positions was evaluated. The system employs two electro-optic camera units which give stereo information for use in determining three dimensional target locations. Specially developed, infrared sensitive photodetectors {{are used in the}} cameras to sense radiation from light emitting diode targets. Up to 30 of these targets can be monitored with a sampling rate of 312 Hz per target. An important part of the system is a minicomputer which is used to collect the camera data, sort it, make corrections for distortions in the electro-optic system, and perform the necesssary coordinate transformations. If target motions are restricted to locations in a plane which is perpendicular to a camera's optical axis, the system can be used with just one camera. Calibrations performed in this mode characterize accuracies in single camera operation. This information is also useful in determination of single camera contributions to total system errors. For this reason the system was tested in both the single camera and two camera (<b>stereo)</b> <b>modes</b> of operation...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} stated that operating an amplifier pair in bridge mode can give {{four times the}} power (of one of the pair). This statement makes reference {{to the fact that}} power is proportional to the square of the voltage, implying that if the output voltage is doubled - as it is in bridge mode - then the power available increases by a factor of four. This would be true if the amplifier in bridged mode were used to drive loudspeakers of the same impedance used in <b>stereo</b> <b>mode.</b> However, in this case, the current through the loudspeaker and the amplifier would also double, which could exceed the amplifier ratings and lead to overheating and finally destruction of the amplifier. In fact, the minimum impedance of the loudspeaker in bridged mode should be double the minimum impedance rated for <b>stereo</b> <b>mode.</b> Consequently, operating a pair of existing amplifier channels in bridge mode doubles available power output to the load.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} stereo coding on Japanese speech localized in 3 -D virtual space. We encoded localized speech using Joint Stereo and Parametric <b>Stereo</b> <b>modes</b> within the HE-AAC (High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding) encoder at identical data rates. First, the sound quality of the localized speech signal was checked using MUSHRA subjective tests. The result showed that the speech quality for Joint Stereo is higher than Parametric Stereo when localized at 45 (where 0 refers to localization {{directly in front of}} the listener) by 20 to 30 MUSHRA score points. The scores for Joint Stereo were relatively proportional to bit rate. However, Parametric Stereo scores were not proportional to bit rate, and remained fairly constant with bit rate. Next, the Japanese word intelligibility tests were conducted using the Japanese Diagnostic Rhyme Tests (JDRT). Test speech was localized in front, while competing noise were localized at various angles. The result showed that speech could not be separated from the noise for Joint Stereo when the noise was in located in the frontal region, from 45 to 45, and intelligibility degrades significantly. However at other azimuth, the intelligibility improves dramatically. On the other hand, intelligibility with Parametric Stereo remained constant, at about 70 to 80 %. 1...|$|R

Realistic, three-dimensional information is preferred over conventional two dimensional maps. The paper describes objectives, methodology and results of an operational system being developed for generation of site model from Cartosat- 2 multiview images. The system is designed to work in operational mode with varying level of manual interactivity. A rigorous physical sensor model based on collinearity condition models the "step n stare" mode of image acquisition of the satellite. The relative orientation of the overlapping images is achieved using coplanarity condition and conjugate points. A procedure is developed to perform digitization in mono and <b>stereo</b> <b>modes.</b> A technique for refining manually digitized boundaries is developed. The conjugate points are generated by establishing a correspondence between the points obtained on refined edges to analogous points on the images obtained with view angles ± 26 deg.
