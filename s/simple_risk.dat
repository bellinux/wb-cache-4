Data is {{not generally}} {{available on the}} specifics, however Divers Alert Network (DAN) has an ongoing citizen science based programme run by DAN (Europe) which gathers data from volunteer recreational divers for analysis by DAN research staff and other researchers.

Data on hundreds of thousands of real dives is analysed to investigate aspects of diving safety. The large amounts of data gathered is used for probabilistic analysis of decompression risk.

5000|$|The “Privacy Paradox” is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when individuals, who state that they have concerns about their privacy online, take no action to secure their accounts. Furthermore, while individuals may take extra security steps for other online accounts, such as those related to banking or finance, this does not extend to social media accounts. Some of these basic or simple security steps would include deleting cookies, browser history, or checking one’s computer for spyware. [...] Some may attribute this lack of action to “third-person bias”. This occurs when people are aware of risks, but then {{do not believe that}} these risks apply or relate to them as individuals.

It deviates from the traditional venture capital model, which focuses on <b>simple</b> <b>risk</b> and reward.

40|$|Operations {{which form}} new risk {{measures}} from {{a collection of}} given (often <b>simpler)</b> <b>risk</b> measures have been used extensively in the literature. Examples include convex combination, convolution, and the worst-case operator. Here we study the risk measure that is constructed {{from a family of}} given risk measures by the best-case operator; that is, the newly constructed risk measure is defined as the one that is as restrictive as possible under the condition that it accepts all positions that are accepted under any of the risk measures from the family. In fact we define this operation for conditional risk measures, to allow a multiperiod setting. We show that the well-known VaR risk measure can be constructed from a family of conditional expectations by a combination that involves both worst-case and best-case operations. We provide an explicit description of the acceptance set of the conditional risk measure that is obtained as the strictest common relaxation of two given conditional risk measures.

While innovations lead {{the evolution of}} our societies and permeate all domains of human life, they also pose significant risks both to humans and the environment.

However, assessing new technological risks confronts deep uncertainty and limited knowledge. In contrast to <b>simple</b> <b>risks</b> (e. g. car accidents), technological risks (such as risks stemming from new health technologies, nanotechnology, biotechnology, or robotics as discussed in this special issue) cannot be calculated according to traditional technocratic models, namely as a statistically foreseeable function of probability and effects.

To address this challenge it is crucial to study the ways in which law and regulation can successfully respond and adapt to technological progress...|$|R

50|$|There {{is often}} a {{confusion}} between 'risk management' and 'risk appetite', with the rigor of the former now recovering some of its lost ground from the vagueness of the latter. Derived correctly the risk appetite {{is a consequence of}} a rigorous risk management analysis not a precursor. <b>Simple</b> <b>risk</b> management techniques deal with the impact of hazardous events, but this ignores the possibility of collateral effects of a bad outcome, such as for example becoming technically bankrupt. The quantity that can be put at risk depends on the cover available should there be a loss, and a proper analysis takes this into account. The 'appetite' follows logically from this analysis. For example an organization should be 'hungry for risk' if it has more than ample cover compared with its competitors and should therefore be able to gain greater returns in the market from high risk ventures.|$|E

30|$|Effective {{mitigation}} of post-fire {{debris flow}} impacts requires rapid {{assessment of the}} risk they pose. This {{is one reason why}} BAER teams are directed to identify both element-at-risk from debris flows and proposed mitigation measures within 10  day after containment of the wildfire. At its <b>simplest,</b> <b>risk</b> represents the product of the probability of a hazard event occurring and the elements-at-risk (their vulnerability and value) from such an occurrence (Varnes [1984]; van Westen et al. [2006]). Consequently, mitigation is dependant on knowing the likelihood and location of possible debris flows to define the potential hazard. Effective mitigation also requires identifying the elements-at-risk, i.e., people, structures, infrastructure, natural resources, ecological habitat, which may be destroyed, damaged or functionally impaired by debris flows. The elements-at-risk also will have varying degrees of vulnerability to the destructive force of debris flows ranging from complete loss to minor damage. The post-fire risk posed by debris flows will be the product of the defined hazard for all elements-at-risk. Defining the risk facilitates comparing different mitigation strategies for their potential cost and benefit and pinpoints constraints important to designing mitigation measures.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{validated}} 2 clinical risk {{models for}} perioperative mortality in patients scheduled for elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery (AAA surgery). They studied 361 patients who underwent elective AAA surgery between 1991 and 1999 (validation population). Two clinical risk models were validated. The first {{was developed in}} 238 patients from Leiden University Hospital (Leiden risk model). The Leiden risk model was modified to provide predic-tions for the validation population based on 6 predictors including age, gender, a history of previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, renal disease, and pulmonary disease. The second was a recently published <b>simpler</b> <b>risk</b> model developed in 820 patients in the UK Small Aneurysm Trial (UK risk model) and included 3 predictors (age and renal and pulmonary comorbidity). Logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between predictors and outcome (mortality within 30 days of surgery). Validation further included the concor-dance statistic (c-statistic) for discriminative ability and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for model reliability. The perioperative mortality in the validation population was 6. 6 % (24 / 361). Predictors had similar odds ratios, with particularly strong effects of congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, and renal impairment.
