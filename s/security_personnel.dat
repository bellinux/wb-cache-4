40|$|Abstract—To {{facilitate}} {{users to}} interact with and share information without difficulty and faultlessly across various networks and databases nationwide, a secure and trusted information-sharing environment has been recognized as an imperative requirement and to advance homeland security effort. The key incentive following this research {{is to build a}} secure and trusted information-sharing approach for government departments. This paper presents an efficient role and cooperation based information sharing approach for secure exchange of confidential and top secret information amongst <b>security</b> <b>personnels</b> and government departments within the national boundaries using public key cryptography. The devised approach makes use of cryptographic hash function; public key cryptosystem and a unique and complex mapping function for securely exchanging confidential information. Furthermore, the proposed approach facilitates privacy preserving information sharing with probable restrictions based on the rank of the <b>security</b> <b>personnels.</b> The developed role and cooperation based information sharing approach ensures secure and stream-lined information sharing among <b>security</b> <b>personnels</b> and government intelligence departments to avoid threatening activities. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed information sharing approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of the strategy for ensuring <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> in a company takes place {{under the influence of}} a large set of external and internal factors. Each of these factors affects the content of its structural elements, the features of countering threats of <b>personnel</b> <b>security,</b> and thus determines the type of implemented strategy. It was revealed that the main factors influencing the choice of a strategic position of a company in relation to <b>personnel</b> <b>security,</b> is the competitive status of the company, as well as the attractiveness of the industry in which it operates to competitors. Based on the analysis of factors influencing the choice of managerial strategy to achieve <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> in a company, we proposed to distinguish aggressive, conservative and defensive strategic position in the area of <b>personnel</b> <b>security.</b> The author examined features and priorities of the personnel policy in the companies of the Irkutsk region in the field of <b>personnel</b> <b>security.</b> Following the results of the empirical analysis of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> state in the organizations of the region, we concluded that selection of a certain type of strategy for <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> actualizes the use of appropriate methods to ensure the <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> including the methods to counter threats posed by employees. The findings of the present study confirmed the predominantly endogenous character of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> threats in the modern organization...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{substantiate}} the methodical approach to determining the level of formation and provision of enterprise <b>personnel</b> <b>security.</b> By analyzing, systematizing and generalizing scientific achievements of many scientists, approaches to the evaluation of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> at the enterprise were considered, a set of indices for evaluation of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> was defined. There justified the urgency of creating a comprehensive approach to evaluation of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> that includes implementation of the following stages: defining a list of indices corresponding {{to the level of}} formation and provision of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> {{with the help of the}} expert evaluation method; calculating integral indices of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> for each component and the corresponding level by means of the taxonomic analysis; grouping enterprises by the level of formation and provision of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> with the use of the cluster and discriminant analysis. It is found that the implementation of this approach will allow not only determining the level of formation and provision of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> at the enterprise, but also developing appropriate recommendations on improving its state. Prospects for further research in this direction are evaluation of conditions for formation and provision of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> at the enterprise, which will enable revealing negative destabilizing factors that influence personnel securit...|$|R

She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent.

5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations {{of the laws of}} war, as civilians were caught in the ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state <b>security</b> <b>personnel.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} factors that {{influence}} the occurrence of threats is of particular importance in the {{theory and practice of}} ensuring <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> in the organization. The article aims at the identification of major threats to the organizational <b>personnel</b> <b>security.</b> As the latter, we suggest considering a set of causes related to the intention of the employee/ employer to harm each other and determine the ability to causes harm. Based on the content analysis of publications we identified the main causes of threats to the <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> of organization, sources of hazardous factors origin. Consequently, we compiled a list of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> threats consisting of 18 items. The authors assessed the acuteness and urgency of threats, their impact on the state of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> in the organizations (a study was carried out on the example of Irkutsk region). Using the technique of factor analysis, we extracted factors of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> threats in the organization, interpreted as the existence of vulnerabilities in the security system, poor quality of the labor force and its moral and ethical capacities, shortcomings and mistakes in the area of implemented personnel policy and in the policy of <b>personnel</b> <b>security.</b> The applied methods of analysis are as follows: content analysis; analysis of frequency tables and contingency tables; correlation and factor analysis. Materials of the expert survey conducted in the Irkutsk region (2015) serves as the analysis base. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance confirmed agreement among the experts. Obtained results can be used to investigate and identify <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> threats in the organization, can form the basis for prediction and analysis of <b>personnel</b> <b>security</b> threats, for development of methods of their prevention...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 May, Dönitz gave the order for all German {{military}} forces to unconditionally surrender, and on 8 May the German Instrument of Surrender was delivered to General Böhme. The Germans were to withdraw from all Norwegian towns and the Swedish border and gradually redeploy to areas pre-designated for disarmament; simultaneously, all senior Nazi party officials and <b>security</b> <b>personnel</b> were to immediately be arrested. Force 134 would be greatly outnumbered during its task; a total of 30,000 Allied troops would have to supervise the disarmament of more than 350,000 German troops. There were fears that the German forces might refuse to surrender and instead resist the Allied occupation forces, and there were particular concerns about what the large detachment of Kriegsmarine personnel at the port of Trondheim might do.|$|E
