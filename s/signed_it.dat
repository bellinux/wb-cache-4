5|$|During the 2008 {{legislative}} session, Roberts {{introduced a}} bill, drafted and lobbied for by Colorado students, {{to create a}} legislative youth advisory council.

Greinke later claimed that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, primarily because they offered more money.|$|E

50|$|The Reggae Compassionate Act was an {{agreement}} signed in 2007 by artists including Beenie Man, Capleton, and Sizzla. It {{has now been}} somewhat discredited as some artists have felt it was badly worded, while others have denied <b>signing</b> <b>it.</b> Others (including Elephant Man, T.O.K., Bounty Killa, and Vybz Kartel) have simply refused to <b>sign</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even think about that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States.

5|$|The {{popularity}} of the novel extended to Ukraine, where a baroness named Ewelina Hańska read about Balzac's novels in newspapers she received from Paris. Intrigued, she ordered copies of his work, and she read them with her cousins and friends around Volhynia. They were impressed by the understanding he showed toward women in La Physiologie du mariage, but felt that La Peau de chagrin portrayed them in a cruel and unforgiving light. Hańska {{wrote a letter to}} Balzac, <b>signed</b> <b>it</b> as L'Étrangère ("The Stranger"), and mailed it from Odessa on 28 February 1832.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never <b>signed</b> <b>it</b> and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} World War II, a {{group of}} {{physicians}} proposed that the University of California should establish a medical school in Southern California. One {{of them was the}} urologist Elmer Belt, whose patients included the Governor of California, Earl Warren.

5|$|Within a {{month of}} the 2010 midterm elections, Obama {{announced}} a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress before Obama <b>signed</b> <b>it</b> on December 17, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily <b>signed</b> <b>it</b> just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Convention, Hamilton {{was still}} not content with the final Constitution, but <b>signed</b> <b>it</b> anyway as a vast {{improvement}} over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also. Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution. He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, James Duane, Robert Livingston, and Richard Morris against the Clintonian faction led by Melancton Smith, Lansing, Yates, and Gilbert Livingston.|$|E
5|$|Barkley and {{his wife}} Dorothy took a {{vacation}} after the convention, returning to Kentucky in August 1928 to find that, in his absence, Barkley had been chosen state chairman of Smith's campaign. He campaigned for Smith, but Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory. After the election, Barkley led a coalition of liberal Democrats and Republicans that opposed Hoover's use of protective tariffs, a debate that took particular urgency following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Barkley opposed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, claiming it would cost Americans both jobs and exports, but Congress approved it, and Hoover <b>signed</b> <b>it</b> on June 17, 1930. When Congress adjourned, Barkley accompanied Sherwood Eddy and fellow senators Burton K. Wheeler and Bronson M. Cutting to the Soviet Union in August 1930. He {{was impressed by the}} industrial development brought about by Joseph Stalin's first five-year plan but did not advocate closer diplomatic ties with the Communist nation, as some of his colleagues did.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and <b>signed</b> <b>it.</b> Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
