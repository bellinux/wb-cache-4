The <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Service</b> consisted of four elements, the Ustaša Police, Ustaša Intelligence Service, Ustaša Defence Brigades, and Personnel.

25|$|On 18 March 1942, a law decree on {{the armed}} forces {{organised}} them into the Home Guard, navy and air force, the gendarmerie and the Ustaše militia. By special decree on 26 June 1942, the gendarmerie, which had previously {{been a part of}} the Home Guard, became part of the Ustaše militia and was placed under the command of a young Ustaše colonel, Vilko Pečnikar. In July and August 1942, the militia took control of all armed forces of the NDH other than the Home Guard, navy and air force. The militia then consisted of the regular militia, Pavelić's personal guard, the railroad security troops, the gendarmerie, the regular police, the Ustaša <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Service,</b> the Ustaša educational establishment, the Ustaša preparatory service and the disciplinary court. The Ustaša <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Service</b> included the Ustaša Defence Brigades, which had been established in late 1941. The Defence Brigades engaged in operations against both the Chetniks and Partisans, engaged in mass terror against the Serbian, Jewish and Romani segments of the NDH population, and administered the Ustaša concentration camps, including Jasenovac.|$|E

25|$|In late July 1942, all {{concentration}} {{camps in the}} NDH were officially transferred from the Ministry of Interior to the Ustaše <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Service,</b> which had been running the camps since August 1941. There were about 20 large and medium-seized camps, the largest {{of which was a}} cluster of camps near the confluence of the Sava and Una rivers at Jasenovac. The camps there were notorious for the brutality, barbarism and large number of victims. Even after the Service was disestablished in January 1943, Vjekoslav Luburić remained in charge of the camps through most of the war.|$|E
25|$|The Coast Guard has its {{basis in}} the defunct Fisheries <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Service,</b> which was {{established}} in 1908. It was a jointly military and civilian operation; it leased fishing vessels during the season to supplement larger navy vessels. This was converted into the Military Fisheries Surveillance in 1961. The Coast Guard was established on 1 April 1977, {{the same year as}} Norway delineated its EEZ. The restructuring led to the delivery of the Nordkapp-class and the Lynx helicopters. The Inner Coast Guard was established in 1996. The Coast Guard has participated in the 1990–91 Gulf War and the 2014 destruction of Syria's chemical weapons.|$|E
25|$|In May 1943, {{there were}} about 30 regular militia battalions of varying strength. At the time, 12 were {{deployed}} in the Italian zones of occupation, primarily in Zone III, while the remainder were working with the Home Guard light infantry and mountain brigades and the German-Croatian SS police. This pattern of deployment applied until the amalgamation of the Home Guard and militia in December 1944. In June 1943, the Ustaša <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Service</b> was abolished, and its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Interior. However, the Ustaša Defence Brigades under Luburić continued to operate independently. By September 1943, shortly after the Italian surrender, the Ustaše militia included 25 battalions (22,500 men) of the regular militia, plus Pavelić's personal guard of about 6,000 men, and the gendarmerie of about 18,000 men {{as well as many}} other smaller armed groups.|$|E

40|$|Surveillance systems became powerful. Objects can be identied and {{intelligent}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>services</b> can generate events when a specific situation occurs. Such <b>surveillance</b> <b>services</b> can be organized in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to fulfill surveillance tasks for specific purposes. Therefore the services process {{information on a}} high level, e. g., just the position of an object. Video data is still required to visualize a situation to an operator and is required as evidence in court. Processing of personal related and sensitive information threatens privacy. To protect the user and {{to be compliant with}} legal requirements it must be ensured that sensitive information can only be processed for a defined propose by specific users or services. This work proposes an architecture for Access Control that enforces the separation of data between different surveillance tasks. Access controls are enforced at different levels: for the users starting the tasks, for the services within the tasks processing data stored in central store or calculated by other services and for sensor related services that extract information out of the raw data and provide them...|$|R

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{fisheries}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>services</b> were reorganized. A number of whaling ships which had participated in the Arctic convoys were put into use as surveillance vessels while the navy focused on minesweeping. The surveillance was supplemented with Flower-class corvettes. Three used River-class frigates were taken into use in 1956, allowing Nordkapp to be decommissioned in 1956 and Senja two years later. The corvettes and later the frigates were used both for fisheries inspection and held in readiness for war. They, therefore, incurred high operational costs, were inefficient and had a large degree of conscripts.|$|R
