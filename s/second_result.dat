25|$|Another record {{performance}} {{happened on}} March 3, 2001 when Giedrius Pečiulionis realized 11 three-pointers from 16 versus BC Panevėžys. Totally, Pečiulionis scored 41 points {{that night and}} led BC Šiauliai to the excellent 107–69 triumph. This performance was just 2 three-pointers behind from the LKL record of 13 three-pointers held by Joey Vickery since 1996, and is the <b>second</b> <b>result</b> in the whole LKL history. Third result of 10 three-pointers per one game is also held by Giedrius Pečiulionis since 1998.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} these results is {{apparent}} by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (−π/2, π/2) andR (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel). The <b>second</b> <b>result</b> was proved by Cantor in1878, but only became intuitively apparent in1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves {{can be used to}} define a one-to-one correspondence between the points in the side of a square and those in the square.|$|E

Cantor's <b>second</b> <b>result</b> uses indexed numbers: a set of the form (a'n1,n2,…,n'ν) is the range of a function from the ν indices to the set of real numbers. His <b>second</b> <b>result</b> implies his first: let ν=2 and a'n1,n2=. The function can be quite general—for example, a'n1,n2,n3,n4,n5= + ...|$|E

2500|$|Declan Ganley, Libertas leader, {{said the}} {{unexpectedly}} high Yes vote demonstrated [...] "how scared people are" [...] {{of the state}} of the economy. This feeling was echoed by a certain proportion of voters, one of whose attitude was [...] "I'm here because I have a vote and, basically, I've been told what to do with it". The Socialist Party's MEP Joe Higgins praised the performance of the No campaign. Sinn Féin's President Gerry Adams asked why the first referendum had been ignored. Sinn Féin Vice-President Mary Lou McDonald criticised the [...] "dishonourable and depressing" [...] Yes campaign. Richard Greene of Cóir promised the war against the Treaty would continue despite the <b>second</b> <b>result,</b> saying Cóir was [...] "extremely disappointed that the voice of the people was not heard the first time around". Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic, described the vote as [...] "tarnished since this is a repeated referendum". Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, said the process had been no different from [...] "a corrupt election in Zimbabwe or Afghanistan".

2500|$|The [...] "false awareness" [...] (falsches Bewusstsein) in the {{classical}} sense used by Friedrich Engels does not necessarily refer to [...] "errors" [...] {{in the content of}} awareness. It refers rather to an absence of awareness of what is really behind the ideas being worked with, how they have originated, or what the real role or effect of the ideas is. The first result of that is, that the ideologists believe themselves to be performing certain intellectual operations with regard to an issue, which, in reality, have quite a different significance than what they imagine. The <b>second</b> <b>result</b> is that their intellectual creations can then function as a mask for what is really at stake, precisely because the issue is portrayed in a one-sided or distorted way – without the ideologists being aware of how that works. The ideologists are aware and unaware at the same time. The problem, says Engels, is that they exaggerate the power of ideas, even to the point where ideas seem to be the cause of all that happens. This occurs especially if the intellectual productions occur at quite some distance from the practical context to which they properly refer, or if they concern specialized, highly abstract ideas which cannot easily be verified (this concept differs from the Marxism–Leninism ideology, where [...] "false consciousness" [...] is thinking which deviates from the political line of the Communist Party).|$|E

60|$|Then, slowly, {{he turned}} his head. The {{professor}} {{was out of the}} room; the demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum, reading the Q. Jour. Mi. Sci.; the rest of the examinees were busy, and with their backs to him. Should he own up to the accident now? He knew quite clearly what the thing was. It was a lenticel, a characteristic preparation from the elder-tree. His eyes roved over his intent fellow-students, and Wedderburn suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his eyes. The mental excitement that had kept Hill at an abnormal pitch of vigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension. His book of answers was beside him. He did not write down what the thing was, but with one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it. His mind was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung upon him. Should he identify it? or should he leave this question unanswered? In that case Wedderburn would probably come out first in the <b>second</b> <b>result.</b> How could he tell now whether he might not have identified the thing without shifting it? It was possible that Wedderburn had failed to recognise it, of course. Suppose Wedderburn too had shifted the slide? He looked up at the clock. There were fifteen minutes in which to make up his mind. He gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he used in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat.|$|E

60|$|First, that in {{the lower}} grade the reproductions {{themselves}} seem merged in those of irritability, from the very circumstance that the latter constitutes no pole, either to the former, or to sensibility. The force of irritability acts, therefore, in the insect world, in full predominance; while the emergence of sensibility in the fish calls forth the opposite pole of reproduction, as a distinct power, and causes therefore the irritability to flow, in part, into the power of reproduction. The <b>second</b> <b>result</b> of this ascent is {{the direction of the}} organizing power, ad intra, with the consequent greater simplicity of the exterior form, and the substitution of condensed and flexible force, with comparative unity of implements, for that variety of tools, almost as numerous as the several objects to which they are to be applied, which arises from, and characterises, the superficial life of the insect creation. This grade of ascension, however, like the former, is accompanied by an apparent retrograde movement. For from this very accession of vital intensity we must account for the absence in the fishes of all the formative, or rather (if our language will permit it) fabricative instincts. How could it be otherwise? These instincts are the surplus and projection of the organizing power in the direction ad extra, and could not, therefore, have been expected in the class of animals that represent the first intuitive effort of organization, and are themselves the product of its first movement in the direction ad intra. But Nature never loses what she has once learnt, though in the acquirement of each new power she intermits, or performs less energetically, the act immediately preceding. She often drops a faculty, but never fails to pick it up again. She may seem forgetful and absent, but it is only to recollect herself with additional, as well as recruited vigour, in some after and higher state; as if the sleep of powers, as well as of bodies, were the season and condition of their growth. Accordingly, we find these instincts again, and with them a wonderful synthesis of fish and insect, as a higher third, in the feathered inhabitants of the air. Nay, she seems to have gone yet further back, and having given B + C = D in the birds, so to have sported with one solitary instance of B + D = A in that curious animal the dragon, the anatomy of which has been recently given to the public by Tiedemann; from whose work it appears, that this creature presents itself to us with the wings of the insect, and with the nervous system, the brain, and the cranium of the bird, in their several rudiments.|$|E
