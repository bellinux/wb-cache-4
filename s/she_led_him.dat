5|$|Fitzgerald's {{visits to}} Long Island's south shore and his {{experience}} attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsbys setting. Today, {{there are a}} number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party. Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success. Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich. In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as <b>she</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> toward everything he despised.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1797 Hamilton became the first major American {{politician}} publicly involved in a sex scandal. Six years earlier, in {{the summer of}} 1791, 34-year-old Hamilton started an affair with 23-year-old Maria Reynolds. According to Hamilton's recount, Maria approached him at his house in Philadelphia, claiming that her husband, James Reynolds, had abandoned her and she wished to return to her relatives in New York but lacked the means. Hamilton retrieved her address and delivered her $30 personally at her boarding house where <b>she</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> into her bedroom and [...] "Some conversation ensued from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable". The two began an illicit affair that lasted, with varying frequency, approximately until June 1792.|$|E

Claiming to be a prince and princess, they rented an {{apartment}} in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities, while studying Islamic mysticism and Arabic. According to Crowley's later account, Rose regularly became delirious and informed him [...] "they are waiting for you." [...] On 18 March, she explained that [...] "they" [...] were the god Horus, and on 20 March proclaimed that [...] "the Equinox of the Gods has come". <b>She</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary stele known as the Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit's number was 666, {{the number of the}} beast in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the [...] "Stele of Revealing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bishop {{was buried}} {{on the south}} hill above the cave in {{what became known as}} [...] "The Old Guides' Cemetery." [...] According to Mammoth Cave Historian Harold Meloy ("Stephen Bishop: The Man and the Legend", in Caves, Cavers, and Caving, [...] Bruce Sloane, Editor, 1977, pp. 290â€“91), James Ross Mellon, {{president}} of the City Deposit Bank, Pittsburgh, PA, visited the cave for one week in November 1878. He heard charming stories of Bishop, and he met Charlotte, who then managed the hotel dining room. <b>She</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to Stephen's gravesite, [...] "which had only a cedar tree to mark it." [...] Mellon promised to have a headstone carved for Stephen's grave. Three years after Mellon returned home to Pittsburgh he remembered his promise to Charlotte. He arranged for a monument carver to prepare the stone. In 1881 a stonemason used a second-hand tombstone that a Civil War soldier's family had not paid for, he chiseled off the original name and placed an inscription that read, ...|$|E
2500|$|She and Mia don't {{see eye to}} eye: Clarisse is {{concerned}} with attracting publicity to Genovia and ensuring Mia does not embarrass her country while Mia prefers to focus on politics. Though she and Mia butt heads often, she does care for her granddaughter and gives her advice about love and relationships that Mia takes {{with a grain of}} salt due to her grandmother's cold nature. For example, when Clarisse was married to the king of Genovia, <b>she</b> <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to believe that she was only interested in his status and money and never once said [...] "I love you", in order to keep her husband on his toes. Mia also mentions that her father is terrified of his mother because she would lock him in the palace dungeons whenever he misbehaved (although when she informs him that he gives the appearance of being a little bit scared of Clarisse in , her father replies that he is not scared of his mother and that she really isn't as bad as Mia thinks; in his view, Clarisse [...] "just needs proper handling").|$|E

60|$|A new {{existence}} opened upon Francis, as {{day after}} day <b>she</b> insensibly <b>led</b> <b>him</b> to a display of powers he was unconscious until now of possessing himself.
