30|$|According to Kim and Bai (1997), when a {{fishmeal}} {{mixed with}} animal protein sources including blood <b>meal,</b> <b>squid</b> liver <b>meal,</b> meat and bone meal, greaves, feather meal, and {{essential amino acids}} that were gradually substituted for to 20 – 60 % of the regular diet was fed to black rockfish for 6  weeks, growth performance did not significantly change at concentrations up to 40 % of the fishmeal. In addition, once black rockfish were fed the fishmeal mixed with 12.5 – 50 % animal protein supplement for 16  weeks, up to 12.5 % of the fishmeal could be substituted before the rate of gain and feed efficiency started showing large differences {{as the level of}} supplement increased. This was reported to be because of diet intake preferences, in vivo enzyme activity, and metabolism (Kim and Bai 1999). In the present study, although significant differences were not found between the control group and the FSM supplement groups, it tended to decrease gradually with an increase of the supplement. Such an FSM supplement at the same fishmeal ratio seems to be capable of facilitating the preference and metabolism of fish, and vitamin C addition would provide synergetic effects in the FSM supplement. Aksnes et al. (2008) added 0.7 – 5.6  g/kg of hydroxyproline to vegetable protein diets and fed them to salmon (Salmo salar L.) for 88  days. They found that adding 2.9  g/kg of hydroxyproline to the diet increased the growth of the salmon by approximately 14 %. The diet from the current study is also expected to improve the growth performance because the FSM used in this study contains abundant hydroxyproline, which is a collagen-specific amino acid.|$|R

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} only. The {{culture of}} Penaeus monodon has explicitly defined {{the need for}} diet formulations or supplementary feeds that would promote optimum growth and survival of the animal. A total of 28 feed combinations were developed for P. monodon. Fish meal, shrimp head <b>meal,</b> <b>squid</b> head <b>meal,</b> Ascetes spp. rice bran, and soybean cake were used as primary ingredients in these feeds. The commercial vitamin mix No. 22 {{was added to the}} dry ingredients. Gelatinized corn starch and wheat flour were used as binders. The pellets were extruded using a portable kitchen grinder with a diameter of 4 mm. The products were either sun-dried for 8 hours or oven-dried overnight at 50 degree C to stabilize moisture at 8 - 10 %. The pellets were then kept in covered glass bottles and stored in the laboratory at room temperature. The cost of the feeds excluding labour were also computed. The pellets were analyzed for protein, fat, carbohydrate, crude fiber, ash, and moisture contents using standard procedures. They were also analyzed for water stability. To test the stability of pellets in water, 2 -g samples were placed in plankton nets (mesh # 40) and suspended in water for two, and six hours. The undissolved samples were then vacuum-dried and the moisture determined. Cost of the feeds ranged from P 1. 10 to P 2. 60 per kg depending on the feed ingredient. Squid and Ascetes spp. were rather expensive for use as basic ingredients. Proximate analysis of dry weight showed percentage protein content ranged from 20 - 63 g; fat, 8 - 20 g; carbohydrate (by difference), 11 - 36 g; ash, 8 - 28 g; moisture, 6 - 11 g; and crude fiber, 5. 13 g. Stability tests showed that after two hours, 35 - 88 % of solids remained intact and after 6 hours, 20 - 55 % of the pellets remained undissolved. When a pellet disintegrates easily, pollution of the water occurs. Chances for the shrimp to feed on the pellet is minimized when the pellet is unstable. Thus, the search for a more compact feed pellet has to be continued...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} three feeding trials was {{conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} different marine protein sources on growth, survival and thyroid hormone (T 3 and T 4) levels in barramundi larvae. Experimental diets including various proportions of fish <b>meal,</b> <b>squid</b> powder, mussel <b>meal</b> and krill meal were assessed in 14 -day feeding trials. The suitability and appropriate inclusion levels of these protein sources for microbound diet formulations were assessed in an integrated manner, relating protein quality indices (amino acid profile and digestibility) to larval performance indices (growth, survival and thyroid hormone level) to elucidate mechanisms underlying the nutritional regulation of growth promotion in Lates calcarifer. Larvae fed diets containing a combination of fish <b>meal</b> and <b>squid</b> powder showed greater growth than larvae fed diets containing either mussel meal or krill meal. Larvae fed diets containing a 9 : 1 ratio of fish <b>meal</b> to <b>squid</b> powder, on a gross protein basis, had a higher final mean dry weight than those fed all other diets except the diet containing an 80 : 20 ratio of fish <b>meal</b> to <b>squid</b> powder, which had an intermediate value. Fish <b>meal</b> and <b>squid</b> powder were found to have a high nutritional value as protein sources for L. calcarifer larvae, by virtue of a synergistically favourable amino acid profile, moderate to high digestibility and low water solubility. The digestibility of squid powder was found to be significantly higher than that of fish meal, indicating that further development of this diet may benefit from processing techniques to increase fish meal digestibility. Thyroxine (T 4) levels were found to relate strongly to growth, but did not relate specifically to any particular dietary composition, indicating that T 4 is an appropriate indicator of growth performance in L. calcarifer larvae, though may not directly and quantitatively mediate nutritional growth promotion. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Elevated metal burdens in {{farmed fish}} can pose {{potential}} risks {{to public health}} {{as a result of}} fish consumption. It has been recognized that dietary exposure is a dominant route for metal accumulation in fish. In this study, we first assessed the metal contamination in commercial fish diet and its raw materials. <b>Squid</b> viscera <b>meal,</b> kelp meal and rapeseed meal had metal-specific contamination and contributed to high metal levels in commercial fish diet. We then quantified the metal assimilation efficiency (AE) in a juvenile marine fish blackhead seabream Acanthopagrus schlegelii using a radiotracer technique to assess the dietary bioavailability of cadmium (Cd), inorganic mercury (Hg(II)), and zinc (Zn). Different sources of protein in artificial diets did not significantly affect the metal AEs, except for Hg(II) from corn meal and Zn from corn meal and rapeseed meal. Generally, metal AEs tended to decrease with increasing dietary metal concentrations. Compared to meso- 2, 3 -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and L-cysteine in commercial fish diet, metal additives (i. e., 3000 mu g Fe/g or 200 mu g Cu/g) were more influential on metal AEs, probably due to metal competition. The relative bioavailability of metals in natural prey vs. artificial diet was inconsistent and complicated by metal chemical species and gut passage time. Our results indicated that metal contamination in commercial fish diet was probably underestimated in fish aquaculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Aquafeed {{production}} faces {{global issues}} related to availability of feed ingredients. Feed manufacturers require greater flexibility {{in order to develop}} nutritional and cost-effective formulations that take into account nutrient content and availability of ingredients. The search for appropriate ingredients requires detailed screening of their potential nutritional value and variability at the industrial level. In vitro digestion of feedstuffs by enzymes extracted from the target species has been correlated with apparent protein digestibility (APD) in fish and shrimp species. The present study verified the relationship between APD and in vitro degree of protein hydrolysis (DH) with Litopenaeus vannamei hepatopancreas enzymes in several different ingredients (n = 26) : blood meals, casein, corn gluten meal, crab meal, distiller`s dried grains with solubles, feather meal, fish meals, gelatin, krill meals, poultry by-product <b>meal,</b> soybean <b>meals,</b> <b>squid</b> <b>meals</b> and wheat gluten. The relationship between APD and DH was further verified in diets formulated with these ingredients at 30 % inclusion into a reference diet. APD was determined in vivo (30. 1 +/- 0. 5 degrees C, 32. 2 +/- 0. 4 %.) with juvenile L vannamei (9 to 12 g) after placement of test ingredients into a reference diet (35 g kg(- 1) CP: 8. 03 g kg(- 1) lipid; 2. 01 kcal g(- 1)) with chromic oxide as the inert marker. In vitro DH was assessed in ingredients and diets with standardized hepatopancreas enzymes extracted from pond-reared shrimp. The DH of ingredients was determined under different assay conditions to check for the most suitable in vitro protocol for APD prediction: different batches of enzyme extracts (HPf 5 or HPf 6), temperatures (25 or 30 degrees C) and enzyme activity (azocasein) : crude protein ratios (4 U: 80 mg CP or 4 U: 40 mg CP). DH was not affected by ingredient proximate composition. APD was significantly correlated to DH in regressions considering either ingredients or diets. The relationships between APD and DH of the ingredients could be suitably adjusted to a Rational Function (y = (a + bx) /(1 + cx + dx 2), n = 26. Best in vitro APD predictions were obtained at 25 degrees C, 4 U: 80 mg CP both for ingredients (R(2) = 0. 86 : P = 0. 001) and test diets (R(2) = 0. 96; P = 0. 007). The regression model including all 26 ingredients generated higher prediction residuals (i. e., predicted APD - determined APD) for corn gluten meal, feather meal. poultry by-product meal and krill flour. The remaining test ingredients presented mean prediction residuals of 3. 5 points. A model including only ingredients with APD> 80 % showed higher prediction precision (R(2) = 0. 98 : P = 0. 000004; n = 20) with average residual of 1. 8 points. Predictive models including only ingredients from the same origin (e. g., marine-based, R(2) = 0. 98; P = 0. 033) also displayed low residuals. Since in vitro techniques have been usually validated through regressions against in vivo APD, the DH predictive capacity may depend on the consistency of the in vivo methodology. Regressions between APD and DH suggested a close relationship between peptide bond breakage by hepatopancreas digestive proteases and the apparent nitrogen assimilation in shrimp, and this may be a useful tool to provide rapid nutritional information.

O crescimento e a taxa de conversão alimentar dos camarões arraçoados com a dieta a base de farinha de peixe tendeu a ser inferior àqueles alimentados com as outras fontes de proteína e/ou suas combinações. Estes resultados indicam que a farinha de peixe pode não ser a melhor fonte protéica para F. paulensis. Dietas contendo uma mistura de fontes protéicas foram mais bem utilizadas por F. paulensis e, portanto, resultaram em taxas de crescimento superiores àquelas contendo uma única fonte de proteína...|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{performed}} investigated vegetable and animal proteins that could replace fishmeal in fish feed. In particular, {{there have been many}} studies on the use of vegetable protein sources such as soybean meal (Lee and Jeon 1996; Murai et al. 1982 b; Robert et al. 1993), cottonseed meal, and rapeseed meal (Lee and Yoo 1996; Pham et al. 2005), which have a relatively stable supply compared to fishmeal, to replace fishmeal as a source of protein. However, plant resources are constantly in competition with livestock and human consumption, and the recent development of plant extract fuels such as bioethanol will eventually lead to an increase in the price of the plant resources usable as protein resources (Rena and Hasan 2009). The by-products of the processing of terrestrial livestock such as cows, chickens, and pigs could be used as animal protein sources, since they have a relatively high protein content and qualitatively similar amino acid composition to fishmeal, and are inexpensive and stably supplied. Various {{studies have been}} conducted on their use as protein sources to replace fishmeal in fish feed (Ai et al. 2006; Bai et al. 1998; Kikuchi et al. 1994; Kim and Bai 19971999; Lee and Lee 1998; Sato and Kikuchi 1997). However, the rise of safety issues due to serious infectious diseases like mad cow disease, swine fever, and avian influenza has gradually restricted the use of livestock by-products lately. Thus, as there are economic and safety issues with using terrestrial protein sources to replace fishmeal, securing economic and safe protein sources from marine products rather than terrestrial products is necessary. Many researchers have investigated by-products obtained from processing marine animal as potential protein sources, including shrimp by-products (Cruz-Suárez et al. 1993), tuna muscle by-products (Uyan et al. 2006), shrimp and fish by-products (Li et al. 2004), <b>squid</b> liver <b>meal</b> mixing soybean meal with by-products of squid processing (Kim and Bai 1997), fish bone and crab by-products (Goytortúa-Bores et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2010; Toppe et al. 2006), and fish by-products (Foster et al. 2005). Of the fishery by-products, even though fish skins obtained from the consumption of raw fish are a good protein source high in collagen content, by-products such as bones and internal organs are only partially used and mostly discarded.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the quality of selected feed ingredients as protein sources in grouper diets, based on their nutrient composition and apparent digestibility coefficients for dry matter (ADMD) and crude protein (APD). A total of 56 juveniles were used for the 1 st batch of test ingredients (Chilean fish meal, white fish meal, shrimp meal, defatted soyabean oilmeal, white cowpea meal and ipil-ipil leaf meal). 54, 72 and 48 juveniles were used for the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th batches of test ingredients (<b>squid</b> <b>meal,</b> local meat and bone meal, meat solubles, soya protein concentrates and rice bran; tuna fish meal, imported meat and bone meal, blood meal, maize gluten meal and wheat flour; and poultry feather meal, lupin seed meal and maize germ meal, respectively). Apparent digestibility coefficients were measured in vivo. The apparent digestibility coefficients for ADMD ranged from 37 - 99 %. <b>Squid</b> <b>meal</b> and meat solubles had the highest coefficients, whereas blood meal had the lowest. The APD of all feed ingredients tested were relatively high (79 - 99 %), except for rice bran (43 %) and blood meal (15 %). ADMD values varied with the levels of fibre and other carbohydrate substances in the feed ingredients. Groupers could utilize dietary protein efficiently regardless of whether it was of animal or plant origin. High APD values were generally obtained in feed ingredients with high protein content. Low digestibility coefficients for feed ingredients could also be attributed to the processing methods used in their preparation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the first}} {{experiment}} {{the effects of}} rotifer enrichment and feeding frequency on larval performance of red porgy Pagrus pagrus were studied. Larvae (2 days post-hatching= 2 dph) were fed s-type rotifers (∼ 20 rotifers/mL) enriched {{with one of the}} four different treatment media: Rotifer Diet (microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata and Tetraselmis chuii), DHA Protein Selco, Algamac 3000 (Schizochytrium sp.) and Algamac+ARA (arachidonic acid). Larvae were fed daily at full ration or twice daily at half ration. Larval growth and survival (mean= 22. 8 %) were satisfactory through 16 dph under all treatments; however, resistance to hyposaline challenge (Survival Activity Index=SAI) was positively correlated (P< 0. 01) with DHA concentration of rotifers, and SAI appeared highest in the Algamac+ARA treatment. In the second experiment the effects of Artemia enrichment on larval performance were compared from 18 dph through pre-metamorphosis (33 dph). Larvae were fed Artemia (0. 5 – 3. 0 /mL) enriched with two different media Algamac 3000 and DC DHA Selco, or unenriched Artemia (control). Both media improved DHA levels in Artemia and growth and survival (36. 7 – 54. 6 %) of larvae, while larvae fed unenriched Artemia showed poor growth and survival (5. 2 %). In the third experiment a University of North Carolina Wilmington microbound diet (MBD) and two commercial microdiets (Gemma Micro and Otohime) were evaluated. The MBD contained different protein sources (i. e., menhaden, <b>squid</b> and krill <b>meal,</b> soy protein concentrate) and attractants. Beginning 16 dph, live feeds and microdiets were co-fed to three treatment groups of larvae: (1) Gemma, (2) MBD, and (3) Otohime. Larval performance on the UNCW-MBD was comparable to the commercial microdiets, with no significant differences in larval survival, DHA, or total n- 3 PUFA content through 32 dph.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pelleted}} diets with different protein composition (fish, <b>squid</b> or soybean <b>meals</b> as main protein sources) on trypsin secretion and expression were {{studied in the}} lobster Panulirus argus. Trypsin secretion was shown to be maximal 4 h after ingestion. At this time, fish-and squid-based diets induced trypsin secretion, as well as up-regulation of the major trypsin isoform at the transcription level. While fish-and squid-based diets elicited a prandial response, soybean-based diet failed to stimulate the digestive gland to secrete trypsin into the gastric fluid or induce trypsin expression above the levels observed in fasting lobsters. In vitro assays showed that intact proteins rather than protein hydrolysates stimulate trypsin secretion in the lobster. However, the signal for trypsin transcription appears to be different to that for secretion and is probably mediated {{by the appearance of}} free amino acids in the digestive gland, suggesting a stepwise regulation of trypsin enzymes during digestion. We conclude that trypsin enzymes in P. argus are regulated at the transcription and secretion level by the quality of dietary proteins through two distinct signaling pathways. Our results indicate that protein digestion efficiency in spiny lobsters can be improved by selecting appropriated protein sources. However, other factors like the poor solubility of dietary proteins in dry diets could hamper further enhancement of digestion efficiency. © 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

40|$|Formulated ‘artificial’ diets {{have the}} {{potential}} to overcome inherent nutritional and financial drawbacks associated with live foods used for larvae fish culture. Artificial formulations also provide a vehicle for accurate manipulation of nutritional constituents, enabling investigations into the nutrient requirements of fish larvae. In order to develop species-specific larval food formulations, optimal macronutrient requirements and appropriate nutrient sources must be established. The nutritional value of a food ingredient is determined by its nutritional profile and nutrient availability, and therefore nutrient digestibility {{is an essential part of}} the evaluation of novel food ingredients. Since the proteolytic capacity of barramundi larvae is limited, optimal sources of dietary protein must be established to optimise both their amino acid profile, and protein digestibility. An integrated approach was therefore adopted in this study to evaluate protein sources for barramundi larvae in terms of their amino acid profile and digestibility and in their capacity to support optimal growth and survival when incorporated into food formulations. Furthermore, the endocrinal mediation of the nutritional control of growth is investigated through thyroid hormone analysis, and nutritional effects on digestive physiology are examined through pepsin development. The thyrotropic hormone system is a major regulatory mechanism for the control of growth in teleosts. Thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine, T 3 and L-thyroxine, T 4) mediate extrinsic processes, such as nutrition, to regulate growth in juvenile and adult fish, and are regulated by nutritional quality and quantity. While thyroid hormones regulate growth, survival, development and metamorphosis in fish larvae, data are lacking on an endocrine-nutrition link at the larval stage. By applying an endocrinal approach to the nutritional control of growth, we may achieve a better understanding of the underlying processes governing the physiological status of fish. The research described in this thesis was therefore designed to clarify the quantitative and qualitative protein requirement of barramundi, Lates calcarifer, larvae, and to investigate possible nutritional links to thyroid hormone concentration. Dietary protein and energy contents were initially manipulated in larval food formulations to determine baseline macronutrient inclusion levels. Barramundi larvae (14 days after hatch, DAH) were fed microbound diets (MBD), varying in gross dietary protein (45, 50 and 55 %) and energy (18 and 21 MJ. kg- 1) for a period of 14 days. All fish were then sacrificed, measured for total length and a sub-sample taken for dry weight analysis. Carcass T 3 and T 4 were measured by radioimmunoassay, following chloroform/NH 3 OH extraction. In following experiments, marine animal <b>meals</b> (fish <b>meal,</b> <b>squid</b> powder, Artemia <b>meal,</b> mussel meal, prawn meal and krill meal) were evaluated for their suitability for inclusion into MBD for barramundi larvae. Each of these meals was included in dietary formulations to a total of 50 % gross protein. These formulations were evaluated in terms of growth and survival of barramundi larvae, amino acid composition of protein sources, protein digestibility and resulting carcass thyroid hormone levels. To improve the limited digestibility of fish meal, subsequent experiments incorporated fish meal hydrolysates and acid-denatured fish meal into MBD for evaluation in growth trials with barramundi larvae. An optimal diet was found to contain at least 21 MJ. kg- 1 dietary energy and derived its protein from a combination of fish <b>meal</b> and <b>squid</b> powder (9 : 1 ratio). The limited digestibility of fish meal was improved approximately two-fold by acid denaturation, and the moderate inclusion of denatured fish meal into food formulations improved larval growth significantly, while the entire replacement of untreated fish meal with denatured fish meal did not improve growth above that of diets containing intact fish meal. The reasons for this are unclear, though carcass pepsin level was depressed for larvae fed the formulation containing no intact fish meal, indicating that larvae may adapt to less digestible protein sources. The high leaching rates typically attributed to MBD are assumed to be responsible for the poor growth and/or survival of larvae fed diets containing autolysates and hydrolysates in this study. Thyroid hormone levels had no direct correlation to dietary energy level, protein source or protein inclusion level, though T 4 correlated with growth independently of these nutritional manipulations. This finding indicates that T 4 is important in the growth process of barramundi larvae, but is not directly mediated by specific nutritional inputs. This study developed a microbound diet which supported up to 58 % survival and significant growth in barramundi larvae from 14 - 28 DAH. The diet that supported the best rates of growth and survival contained 21 MJ. kg- 1 utilisable dietary energy and at least 50 % dietary protein, comprised of a 9 : 1 ratio of fish <b>meal</b> to <b>squid</b> powder. This study utilised integrated methodology to improve diet composition to increase growth and survival in barramundi larvae fed MBD, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind growth promotion. Growth trials remain the most conclusive way to determine optimal nutrient requirements for formulated foods, however, biochemical composition and physical properties can be used to narrow-down the wide range of nutrient sources available. Digestibility is of critical importance to the study of protein sources in food formulations for fish larvae, and a major area for the improvement of native animal meal protein sources. The diet developed in this study is a critical step in the development of species-specific weaning and larval diets for barramundi. Amino acid profiles for optimal growth have been refined, and the digestibility of fish meal has been increased to improve larval growth, thus potentiating early weaning protocols and diminishing Artemia requirements. The development of co-feeding and weaning protocols with this diet is expected to increase growth through optimised amino acid profile and increased energy and fatty acid availability, while reducing costs in barramundi hatcheries through reduced Artemia requirements...|$|R

Survival was high for all fed treatments (73. 3 - 93. 3 %), while total mortality was recorded for the unfed control. Megalopae fed the fish meal based MBD demonstrated higher survival than that of megalopea fed live Artemia, suggesting that MBD have the potential to completely replace live food for the culture of P. pelagicus megalopae without adversely affecting their survival. These results also suggest that P. pelagicus megalopae are able to adapt to a range of dietary protein sources. For megalopae fed live Artemia nauplii, mean development time was significantly shorter (4. 0 ± 0. 4  days) and the mean carapace width and dry weight of newly settled first stage crabs were significantly greater, (3. 1 ± 0. 0  mm, 1. 3 ± 0. 1  mg, respectively) than megalopae in all other fed treatments. Among MBD treatments, no significant difference in mean development time was detected, however, the mean carapace width of crabs that metamorphosed from megalopae fed fish meal based MBD (2. 8 ± 0. 0  mm) was larger than those fed <b>squid</b> <b>meal</b> based MBD (2. 6 ± 0. 0  mm) and the mean dry weight of individuals fed fish meal based MBD (0. 87 ± 0. 04  mg) was also significantly heavier than those fed soybean meal based MBD (0. 72 ± 0. 04  mg). The outcome of this research provides valuable information regarding protein requirements of P. pelagicus megalopae and will aid in optimising formulated diet particles for potential use in commercial hatcheries. © 2008 Elsevier B.
