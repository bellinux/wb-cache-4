Some of its pet food brands include Purina Pro Plan, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Beneful and Purina ONE. The company {{was formed in}} 2001 by combining Ralston Purina, which was acquired by Nestlé for $10.3 billion, with Nestlé's Friskies Petcare Company. As consumers became willing to <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> their pets, the company grew. As of 2012, it is the second-largest pet food company globally and {{the largest in the}} United States.|$|E

In 2008, it formed a separate company called PurinaCare with headquarters in San Antonio, Texas that sold pet insurance. PetCare was later acquired by Pethealth Inc. in 2013. By 2009 Purina had also introduced pet litter products and built new manufacturing facilities in Russia and Thailand. Its Colorado plant built the largest privately owned solar panel system in the state. In September 2010, Nestlé reached an agreement to acquire Waggin' Train, a producer of pet treats with $200 million in annual revenues.|$|E

That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing {{a need to}} focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the project survived two separate votes in the Senate that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the U.S. Navy not to <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the V-22. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 {{in an effort to}} cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 provided more capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped it attain funding.|$|E

Defence spending was £766m in 1919–20, this was to be reduced to £135m of which £75m was to be on the army and air force.

40|$|Well-formed {{sentences}} of natural language usually state facts. Intuitively, such facts {{can be seen}} as consisting of two different types of items: firstly, there are some things and secondly there are some associations that are claimed to hold between that things.

Expenditure data also point to divergence across the two countries.

2500|$|The British opium was {{produced}} in the traditionally cotton-growing regions of India in Bengal and the Ganges River Plain. The East India Company itself neither produced nor shipped opium, but did set the horticultural laws allowing for opium cultivation and actively facilitating the transport of the drug. From Calcutta, the company's [...] "Opium Board" [...] concerned itself with quality control by managing the way opium was packaged and shipped. The board issued licencees to the independent princely states of Malwa, where significant quantities of opium was grown by free or tenant-caste farmers. Both company and Malwan farmlands (traditionally dependent on cotton growing) had been hard hit {{by the introduction of}} factory-produced cotton cloth, which used cotton grown in Egypt or the American South. Opium was considered a lucrative replacement good, and was auctioned in large amounts at Calcutta. Private merchants who possessed a company charter (to comply with the British royal charter for Asiatic trade) bid on and acquired goods at the Calcutta auction before sailing to Southern China. British ships brought their cargoes to islands off the coast, especially Lintin Island, where Chinese traders with fast and well-armed small boats took the goods inland for distribution, paying for them with silver. The Qing administration initially tolerated opium importation because it created an indirect tax on Chinese subjects, for increasing the silver supply available to foreign merchants through the sale of opium encouraged Europeans to <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> Chinese goods. This policy allowed the British to double tea exports from China to England, thereby profiting the Qing monopoly on tea exports held by the imperial treasury and its agents in Canton. However, opium usage continued to grow in China, adversely affecting societal stability. These factors led to the Qing government issuing an edict against the drug in 1780, followed by an outright ban in 1796, and an order from the governor of Canton to stop the trade in 1799. To circumnavigate the increasingly stringent regulations in Canton, foreign merchants bought older ships and converted them into floating warehouses. These ships were anchored off of the Chinese coast {{at the mouth of the}} Pearl River in case the Chinese authorities moved against the opium trade, as the ships of the Chinese navy had difficulty operating in open water. Inbound opium ships would unload a portion of their cargo at these floating warehouse, where the narcotic was eventually purchased by Chinese opium dealers. By implementing this system of smuggling, foreign merchants could avoid inspection by Chinese officials and prevent retaliation against the trade of their fellow merchants. However, the majority of the opium being traded in Canton prior to 1822 was transported directly upriver to Canton.|$|E
