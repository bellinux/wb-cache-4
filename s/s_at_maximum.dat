40|$|ABSTRACT: Low cycle {{fatigue tests}} were {{performed}} on IN 718 -DA alloy at 600 °C, both in air and under vacuum environment. The effect of an hold time (90 <b>s)</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> applied total strain was investigated. All the specimens were taken from forged discs. These test results were compared to those obtained on conventional 718 (annealed and aged) tested under vacuum. SEM observations of the fracture surfaces and of the gauge length of the specimens showed various types of initiation sites. Both in air and under vacuum, the fatigue cracks initiated from surface connected particles (carbides and nitrides) or from subsurface particles. The deleterious effect of oxidizing environment on the fatigue life is explained by a preferential oxidation of carbide particles.

The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to analyze the dose-response relationship of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on miR- 126 - 3 p and - 5 p levels. Methods: Sixty-one moderately trained individuals (females = 31 [50. 8 %]; 22. 0 ± 1. 84 years) were consecutively recruited and allocated into three matched groups using exercise capacity. During a 4 -week intervention a HIIT group performed three exercise sessions/week of 4 × 30 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> speed (all-out), a progressive HIIT (proHIIT) group performed three exercise sessions/week of 4 × 30 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> speed (all-out) with one extra session every week (up to 7 × 30 s) and a low-intensity training (LIT) control group performed three exercise sessions/week for 25 min < 75 % of maximum heart rate. Exercise miR- 126 - 3 p/- 5 p plasma levels were determined using capillary blood from earlobes. Results: No exercise-induced increase in miR- 126 levels was detected at baseline, neither in the LIT (after 25 min low-intensity running) nor the HIIT groups (after 4 min of high-intensity running). After the intervention, the LIT group presented an increase in miR- 126 - 3 p, while in the HIIT group, miR- 126 - 3 p levels were still reduced (all p < 0. 05). An increase for both, miR- 126 - 3 p and - 5 p levels (all p < 0. 05, pre- vs. during and post-exercise) was detected in the proHIIT group. Between group analysis revealed that miR- 126 - 3 p levels after LIT and proHIIT increased by 2. 12 ± 2. 55 and 1. 24 ± 2. 46 units (all p < 0. 01), respectively, compared to HIIT (− 1. 05 ± 2. 6 units).

40|$|The {{correlation}} between grain boundary microstructure and fatigue crack growth with hold-times was investigated for two {{conditions of the}} superalloy Allvac 718 Plus; a Standard condition with the recommended distribution of grain boundary phases and a Clean condition with virtually no grain boundary phases. Fatigue testing was performed at 704 degrees C using 10 Hz cyclic load with intermittent hold-times of 100 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> tensile load. Microstructural characterization and fractography were conducted using scanning- and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Auger electron- and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques were used for oxide analyses on fracture surfaces. It was found that in the Standard condition crack growth is mostly transgranular for 10 Hz loading and intergranular for hold-times, while for the Clean condition crack growth is intergranular in both load modes. The lower hold-time crack growth rates in the Standard condition are attributed to grain boundary delta-phase precipitates. No effect of delta-phase was observed for 10 Hz cyclic loading crack growth rates. Two different types of oxides and oxide colours {{were found on the}} fracture surfaces in the Standard condition and could be correlated to the different loading modes. For cyclic loading a bright thin Cr-enriched oxide was dominate and for hold-times a dark and slightly thicker Nb-enriched oxide was dominant These oxide types could be related to the oxidation of delta-phase and the matrix respectively. The influence of delta-phase precipitates on crack propagation is discussed...|$|E

Furthermore, the anticipated IHX operating temperature, up to 950 °C, is in the range of creep so that creep-fatigue interaction, which can significantly increase the fatigue crack growth, {{may be one of the}} primary IHX damage modes. To address the needs for Alloy 617 codification and licensing, a significant creep-fatigue testing program is underway at Idaho National Laboratory. Strain controlled LCF tests including hold times up to 1800 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> tensile strain were conducted at total strain range of 0. 3 % and 0. 6 % in air at 950 °C. Creep-fatigue testing was also performed in a simulated VHTR impure helium coolant for selected experimental conditions. The creep-fatigue tests resulted in failure times up to 1000 hrs. Fatigue resistance was significantly decreased when a hold time was added at peak stress and when the total strain was increased. The fracture mode also changed from transgranular to intergranular with introduction of a tensile hold. Changes in the microstructure were methodically characterized. A combined effect of temperature, cyclic and static loading and environment was evidenced in the targeted operating conditions of the IHX.

Herein we determined the rates, injury severity, and phase of flight for primary student solo accidents/incidents (mishaps) in Cessna 172 aircraft. Mishaps {{over the period}} spanning 1994 – 2013 were identified from the NTSB database. Student population data were from the FAA. Statistics employed proportion tests, Poisson distribution, and Mann-Whitney tests. Across the study period, 598 mishaps were identified. While the mishap rate increased nearly two-fold between 1994 / 1997 and 2002 / 2005, a 35 % decline was evident thereafter. Nevertheless, no statistical difference in mishap rates was evident between the initial and current periods. Over 90 % of mishaps resulted in no or minor injuries. However, 97 % of involved aircraft incurred substantial damage and no incidents were reported. While the percentage of takeoff accidents climbed two-fold, landing accidents accounted for. 70 % of all mishaps and remained unchanged over the 20 years.

40|$|Performance of {{the next}} {{generation}} microprocessors is rapidly reaching its limits due to inability to remove heat, especially at high power density from so-called local “hotspots”. Convective boiling heat transfer in microgap heat sinks has the potential to dissipate ultra-high heat fluxes. This thesis presents an experimental investigation of heat transfer performance of three dedicated microgap coolers for hotspot thermal management. In this study, a rectangular microgap, batch micromachined in silicon and instrumented with thin-film resistive thermometry, is employed to assess its capability of dissipating extreme heat fluxes of multiple kW/cm 2 while keeping the wall temperature within the limits dictated by electronics reliability. Convective boiling in microgap with heights of 5 μm and 10 μm was tested with and without pin fins in the microgap. The test section was heated from the bottom using resistive heaters and capped with glass to enable visual observation of two-phase flow regimes. Microgap pressure drop and wall temperature measurements, mapped into flow regimes, were obtained with R 134 a as the coolant, for heat fluxes up to 5 kW/cm 2, mass fluxes up to 7, 000 kg/m 2 <b>s,</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> pressures up to 1. 5 MPa and outlet vapor qualities approaching unity. These experimental parameters constitute extreme values in terms of microgap height, mass fluxes, and heat fluxes.

Dominant mechanism(s) of two-phase heat transfer responsible for each regime have been postulated based on flow visualization correlated with pressure drop and thermal resistance measurements.

40|$|Since 2007, {{many cases}} of fever, {{thrombocytopenia}} and leukopenia syndrome (FTLS) have emerged in Henan Province, China. Patient reports of tick bites suggested that infection could contribute to FTLS. Many tick-transmitted microbial pathogens were tested for by PCR/RT-PCR and/or indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). However, only 8 % (24 / 285) of samples collected from 2007 to 2010 tested positive for human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), suggesting that other pathogens could be involved. Here, we used an unbiased metagenomic approach to screen and survey for microbes possibly associated with FTLS. BLASTx analysis of deduced protein sequences revealed that a novel bunyavirus (36 % identity to Tehran virus, accession: HQ 412604) was present only in sera from FTLS patients. A phylogenetic analysis further showed that, although closely related to Uukuniemi virus of the Phlebovirus genus, this virus was distinct. The candidate virus was examined for association with FTLS among samples collected from Henan province during 2007 - 2010. RT-PCR, viral cultures, and a seroepidemiologic survey were undertaken. RT-PCR results showed that 223 of 285 (78. 24 %) acute-phase serum samples contained viral RNA. Of 95 patients for whom paired acute and convalescent sera were available, 73 had serologic evidence of infection, with 52 seroconversions and 21 exhibiting a 4 -fold increase in antibody titer to the virus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Deterioration of {{executive}} {{functions in the}} elderly {{has been associated with}} impairments in walking performance. This may be caused by limited cognitive flexibility and working memory, but could also be caused by altered prioritization of simultaneously performed tasks. To disentangle these options we investigated the associations between Trail Making Test performance [...] which specifically measures cognitive flexibility and working memory [...] and dual task costs, a measure of prioritization. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Out of the TREND study (Tuebinger evaluation of Risk factors for Early detection of Neurodegenerative Disorders), 686 neurodegeneratively healthy, non-demented elderly aged 50 to 80 years were classified according to their Trail Making Test performance (delta TMT; TMT-B minus TMT-A). The subjects performed 20 m walks with habitual and maximum speed. Dual tasking performance was tested with walking at maximum speed, in combination with checking boxes on a clipboard, and subtracting serial 7 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> speeds. As expected, the poor TMT group performed worse when subtracting serial 7 s under single and dual task conditions, and they walked more slowly when simultaneously subtracting serial 7 s, compared to the good TMT performers. In the walking when subtracting serial 7 s condition but not in the other 3 conditions, dual task costs were higher in the poor TMT performers (median 20 %; range - 6 to 58 %) compared to the good performers (17 %; - 16 to 43 %; p< 0. 001). To the contrary, the proportion of the poor TMT performance group that made calculation errors under the dual tasking situation was lower than under the single task situation, but higher in the good TMT performance group (poor performers, - 1. 6 %; good performers, + 3 %; p =  0. 035). CONCLUSION: Under most challenging conditions, the elderly with poor TMT performance prioritize the cognitive task at the expense of walking velocity. This indicates that poor cognitive flexibility and working memory are directly associated with altered prioritization...|$|E
40|$|In Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, fatigue cracks can {{nucleate}} internally {{instead of}} at the surface. Internal or subsurface cracks in titanium alloys are found to initiate at faceted features, which {{can be seen on}} the fracture surface after failure. These facets are fractured primary α (hcp) grains, which have broken in a very planar manner. The main purpose of this work is to study internal fracture in drawn Ti- 6 Al- 4 V wires, which has not been done before, since all published studies use forged or rolled samples. Fatigue tests with load ratio R= 0. 1 and a frequency of 60 Hz have been performed on wires with average α grain sizes of approximately 1, 2, 5 and 10 µm. In total, 50 samples were successfully tested. Four samples broke due to an internally initiated crack after testing at a maximum stress of 750 MPa: three samples with average alpha grain size 5 μm, which failed after 2. 6 x 10 ^ 7, 5. 7 x 10 ^ 7 and 9. 6 x 10 ^ 7 cycles, and one sample with average alpha grain size 10 μm, which failed after 7. 6 x 10 ^ 6 cycles. In general, an increase in grain size resulted in lower fatigue lives. In the four samples with internal crack initiation, a cluster of facets was observed at the initiation site on the fracture surface. The projected area size of the facet-containing area was not related to the fatigue life, and the estimated threshold stress intensity factor range was between 6 and 8 MPa√m. The actual surface area, taking into account the roughness, was correlated to the fatigue life. The facets were not smooth, but showed some nano-roughness with linear markings. As a result of the crystallographic texture, the facets were highly inclined, at angles mostly between 50 ° and 70 °. Nearly all facets were parallel to a prismatic lattice plane. The linear markings on these facets were parallel to the direction of the prismatic slip system, which means that facet formation most likely occurred by a prismatic slip band mechanism. One anomalous facet was observed in the sample with an average grain size of 10 µm. This facet coincided with a near-basal plane, and displayed a fan-shaped pattern instead of linear markings, which indicates that a cleavage mechanism took place. These observations suggest that both a slip-based and a cleavage-based mechanism are possible, depending on the grain size, local texture and possibly other parameters. A local comparison of Taylor factors showed that the Taylor factor of each faceted grain had a tendency towards being higher than the Taylor factors of its corresponding neighbouring grains. It is suggested that the Taylor factor may be used to distinguish between plastically hard and soft grain orientations, and therefore could be capable of explaining the stress distribution between grains, which is the root cause for facet formation. Fracture surface cross-sections revealed secondary facets, which in some cases extended through more than one grain. Short crack growth through a grain boundary occurred when two compatible slip systems were present in these grains. This compatibility could be expressed by calculating misalignment factors. Additionally, a limited number of dwell fatigue tests have been performed, with a hold time of 30 or 120 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> load. Introducing a hold time at maximum load drastically reduced the amount of cycles to failure by two to three orders of magnitude compared to regular fatigue tests, and promoted surface crack initiation. This was caused by strain accumulation due to cold creep, which occurred during each maximum load hold. A recovery process took place during each minimum load hold, which caused an increased initial strain rate during each following maximum load hold.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we report on}} the {{realization}} of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using a simple all-optical method in a crossed dipole trap formed by a 1 μm laser. We also briefly describe the experiments performed regarding the coherent manipulation of atomic matter waves. These experiments were performed on an atom chip based BEC which was already existing in the lab. In the coherent manipulation of atomic matter wave experiments we used standing wave pulses in the Raman-Nath regime to manipulate the BEC. Firstly, we investigated a novel method to realize analog sum computation with a BEC in an optical lattice potential subjected controlled phase jumps. We showed that Gauss sum algorithm for factoring numbers could be implemented using this method. In another experiment we showed that the energy of the atoms subjected to optical pulses with increasing noise shows resonant behavior in opposition to the usual expectation that noise drives a quantum system to classical limit. Additionally, we used similar methods to demonstrate a proof of principle signal analysis with atom optics. For the purpose of all-optical realization of 87 Rb BEC we constructed a double MOT experimental chamber to realize a large number of laser cooled atoms and high vacuum simultaneously. We could achieve a transfer rate of 108 atoms/s from the first MOT chamber to the second MOT chamber. We initially used a multimode laser of 1 μm wavelength for dipole trap. We found that the life time of the trapped atoms in this laser was only 3 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> a <b>maximum</b> power of 19 W. We realized that the laser consisted of closely spaced modes with a spacing of about 6 MHz thus making it highly likely for a stimulated Raman process to occur between the ground state levels of 87 Rb. As a result hyperfine changing collisions dominated, and atoms gained enough energy to escape out of the trap thus decreasing the trap life time. As the life time was not sufficient to perform efficient evaporation cooling we replaced the laser with a single mode laser. Using this laser the life time was found to be about 17 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> a <b>maximum</b> power of 20 W. A simple crossed dipole trap was formed by folding back a single beam on to itself with a beam waist size of 40 μm each. By optimizing various parameters we could efficiently load atoms into the crossed dipole trap with a relatively high initial phase space density of 7 × 10 ? 4. Evaporation cooling was performed by decreasing the trap depth in both the beams simultaneously. By carefully optimizing the evaporation cooling path, we could produce a BEC of 104 atoms within about 3 s. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R

In this paper we examine properties of B+f when f ∉ D. We start by establishing a general 0 - 1 law, which in particular implies that for any fixed f, the Hausdorff dimension of the image and the graph of B+f are constants a. s. (This 0 - 1 law applies to any Lévy process.) Then we show that if the function f is Hölder(1 / 2), then B+f is intersection equivalent to B. Moreover, B+f has double points a. s. in dimensions d 4 it does not. We also give examples of functions which are Hölder with exponent less than 1 / 2, that yield double points in dimensions greater than 4.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that being {{overweight or obese}} {{increases the risk of}} the development of hypertension. 1 – 10 Also, it has been noted that weight gain increases the risk of hypertension, 1, 2, 7, 11 – 17 whereas weight loss contributes to a reduction in risk. 18 – 20 However, it has not been fully clarified whether overall adiposity in early adulthood such as around age 20 years or <b>at</b> the lifetime <b>maximum</b> would irreversibly confer a residual risk of hypertension after considering the risk associated with current adiposity. In a study of a British birth cohort that analyzed the association of body mass index (BMI) across childhood and adulthood with blood pressure in midadulthood, it was suggested that high BMI and BMI gain at any life stage, especially when recent, were associated with elevated blood pressure levels. 21 A strong positive association between being overweight in early adulthood was reported to be associated with elevated midlife blood pressure levels. 22 To date, only a few large longitudinal studies investigated the role of BMI in early adulthood in the prediction of future hyper-tension, 7, 8, 23 and these studies did not clarify the effect of the lifetime maximum BMI (BMImax) on the development of hypertension. In addition, although a few studies suggested that the association between weight gain and incident hyper-tension tended to be greater in younger than in older partici-pants, 7, 24 it remains undetermined whether histories of elevated BMI in early adulthood such as the 20 s (BMIage 20 y) or the BMImax would be positively associated with an increased risk of hypertension even in later life.

40|$|Our {{research}} group has recently investigated POP contamination in the Nador Lagoon (N-E Morocco). Such studies have highlighted a peculiar situation: measurable total concentrations of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Polybrominated diphenyls ethers (PBDEs) {{were found at}} depths corresponding to times when these chemicals were not yet artificially produced [1, 2]. Post-depositional reworking processes were suggested in order to explain the presence of PCBs shortly before the 1930 s [1], but the case of PBDEs was considerably more puzzling: the latter compounds were detected at depths corresponding to the early 1950 <b>s</b> <b>at</b> the <b>maximum</b> value measured in the entire sedimentary record [2]. Physical mixing and/or bioturbation processes might have contributed to setting off vertical movements along the core, but {{it is unlikely that}} they alone could have produced the observed concentration peak at depth. An additional unforeseen process might therefore have been at work. Two of the most abundant naturally occurring structural analogues of PBDEs (i. e. 6 MeO-BDE- 47 and 6 OH-BDE- 47) are very similar to BDE- 47 (the most abundant congeners detected in our studied sediments). Therefore, we hypothesized that reducing conditions in buried sediments might have favoured demethylation and dehydroxylation of these compounds to BDE- 47. Following bromination processes might then have produced the other observed congeners. The formation of PBDEs from naturally synthesized polybrominated compounds in sediments is a fascinating hypothesis and, if verified, could pave the way to studies aimed at the definition of sources and origin of PBDEs. In this presentation we propose a rationale for a new experimental procedure aimed at studying this formation pathway and at verifying its presence in reducing sediments at laboratory scale. [1] S.
