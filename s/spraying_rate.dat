40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} Taguchi Method in optimizing coating hardness in a tangential fluidized bed coater using modified biopolymer. During the coating process, granular ureas collide among themselves and the wall surface at high velocity. This led to excessive attrition and likely to break the granular ureas into smaller sizes. Hence, hardness is the critical properties during operations such as packaging and stacking. A series of coating experiments were carried out by using the L 9 orthogonal array with 3 levels {{to determine the effect}} of inlet air temperature (40, 60 and 80 OC), disc rotation speed (40, 60 and 80 rpm) and <b>spraying</b> <b>rate</b> (0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 rpm) on hardness of coated granular urea. The optimized operating parameters in this work were 60 OC for inlet air temperature, 60 rpm for disc rotation speed and 2 rpm for <b>spraying</b> <b>rate.</b> The results show that the <b>spraying</b> <b>rate</b> was the most significant factor affecting the hardness of the coated granular urea since the contribution was 69. 2 %.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{spraying}} rapeseed {{oil on the}} reduction of dust and ammonia concentrations and emissions, and on animal parameters was investigated in a dose-response study in a broiler house during three growing periods in four (round 1) or five rooms (rounds 2 and 3). The spraying rates varied per room, from 0 (control) to 24 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1). Concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 in incoming and outgoing air were measured. Production results (growth rate, feed intake, mortality rate) and foot-pad lesions were also determined. Regression analysis showed that a <b>spraying</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1) reduced PM 10 concentrations by 44 % and PM 10 emissions by 48 %. At 24 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1), the reduction was 82 % for PM 10 concentrations and 87 % for PM 10 emissions. For PM 2. 5, the lowest <b>spraying</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1) was sufficient to reduce concentrations by 68 % and emissions by 84 %. The reduction achieved at higher spraying rates was not significantly greater. Emissions of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 increased exponentially with {{the age of the}} broilers. A clear diurnal pattern was observed, with lower dust concentrations during the dark periods. Production results were unaffected by the <b>spraying</b> <b>rate.</b> A high rate of 24 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1) increased the number and severity of foot-pad lesions. It is concluded that spraying rapeseed oil significantly reduces dust concentrations and emissions from broiler houses. To prevent adverse effects on broilers' foot-pad quality, it is recommended that the maximum rate should he 16 mL oil m(- 2) d(- 1) ...|$|E

In this thesis, there was evaluated a granulation process on a lab scale fluid Glatt bed granulator and optimized for highest possible yield. Product yield in the size range of 80 - 90 % of granules and process reproducibility were stated as most effective. The product was analysed for its particle size distribution, the API distribution within the different particle size fractions and the flowability of the final granules. For process optimization, the most critical parameters such as <b>spraying</b> <b>rate,</b> particle size of raw materials and fluid bed pressure were identified and evaluated.

Tablets coated at different <b>spray</b> <b>rates</b> (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mL/min) were analyzed to investigate the influence of different wetting conditions on the quality of coats formed. Scanning electron micrographs showed that tablet coats formed at a <b>spray</b> <b>rate</b> of 4 mL/min consisted of spray-dried droplets that did not coalesce. At a <b>spray</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 mL/min, surface roughness was found to be lower than at the other <b>spray</b> <b>rates,</b> and the coat appeared smoothest, whereby droplets seemed fused together.

40|$|AbstractFluidized bed spray {{granulation}} is {{an important}} process for the transformation of liquids into solid materials. Especially product properties like final particle size {{and structure of the}} granules are important. These properties are closely related to the selected process parameters such as temperature and <b>spraying</b> <b>rate.</b> By knowing the relationship between the thermal process conditions and resulting particle structure, the final product can be designed according to the wishes of the consumers. In the presented work, a correlation between the thermal process conditions and the achieved shell porosity, which is relevant for the particle structure, is revealed. Therefore two experimental series with different materials (non-porous glass particles and porous alumina) were performed in a lab-scale fluidized bed spray granulator. The lab-plant allows the precise measurement of the inlet and outlet temperatures and moisture contents of the gas. All process parameters were kept constant except the inlet gas temperature and the <b>spraying</b> <b>rate.</b> Although the amount of initial material as well as the amount of injected solution was the same for all experiments, the final particle size distribution and the structure of the formed shell were clearly different. The obtained experimental results were compared with a process model including a new expression for the growth kinetics, which takes into account an acceleration of the growth velocity due to the formation of a porous structure. The used model also considers the separation of the fluidized bed into two different zones, namely the spraying zone and the drying zone. With the given initial process conditions, the model calculates the time evolution of the particle size distribution, the theoretical outlet temperature and the moisture content of the gas. The introduction of the shell porosity into the growth kinetics reduces the underestimation of the particle size in the model, which occurs if the formed layer on the particle surface is assumed to be compact...|$|E

40|$|Strategies to {{eradicate}} the vector-borne infectious diseases (e. g. malaria and Japanese encephalitis) are often directed at controlling vectors with insecticides. Spraying insecticide, however, opens {{the way for the}} development of insecticide resistance in vectors, which may lead to the failure of disease control. In this paper, we examine whether the combined use of insecticide spray and zooprophylaxis can limit the development of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Zooprophylaxis refers to the control of vector-borne diseases by attracting vectors to domestic animals in which the pathogen cannot amplify (a dead-end host). The human malaria parasite Plasmodium spp. has a closed transmission cycle between humans and mosquitoes, and hence cattle can serve as a dead-end host.

Different amounts of miconazol (19 % and 38 %) and ratios of phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (8 : 2 and 10 : 0, w/w) were dissolved {{in a mixture of}} methanol/methylene chloride (2 : 8 w/w) with or without the addition of poloxamer 407. These solutions were sprayed through a nozzle with a diameter of 0.4 mm into a high-pressure vessel filled with scCO 2 to remove the organic solvents and precipitate the dried liposomes. In order to optimize the process of liposome formation, temperature, pressure, and CO 2 density ranges used were 308 to 328 K, 8.5 to 10.5 MPa, and 0.30 to 0.50 g mL- 1, respectively. The CO 2 flow rate was 6 kg h- 1 and <b>spraying</b> <b>rate</b> was 6 mL min- 1. After the atomization, the solution was washed with scCO 2 in order to extract the remaining organic solvents. Then, it was hydrated with phosphate buffer at different pH levels (4.0 and 7.2) and submitted to gentle agitation at 328 K. According to the authors, the percentage yield of liposome formation was higher when the temperature used was 308 K and the CO 2 density was 0.30 g mL- 1. Therefore, the optimized parameters utilized were 308 K, 8.0 MPa, and 0.30 g mL- 1.|$|E
40|$|Next to {{the coating}} formulation, process {{conditions}} play {{important roles in}} determining coating quality. This study aims to develop an operational window that separates layering from agglomeration regimes and, furthermore, the one {{that leads to the}} best coating quality in a fluidized bed coater. The bed relative humidity and the droplet size of the coating aerosol were predicted using a set of engineering models. The coating quality was characterized using a quantitative image analysis method, which measures the coating thickness distribution, the total porosity, and the pore size in the coating. The layering regime can be achieved by performing the coating process at a certain excess of the viscous Stokes number (ΔStv). This excess is dependent on the given bed relative humidity and droplet size. The higher the bed relative humidity, the higher is the ΔStv required to keep the process in the layering regime. Further, it is shown that using bed relative humidity and droplet size alone is not enough to obtain constant coating quality. The changes in bed relative humidity and droplet size have been identified to correlate to the fractional area of particles sprayed per unit of time. This parameter can effectively serve as an additional parameter to be considered for a better control on the coating quality. High coating quality is shown to be achieved by performing the process close to saturation and spraying droplets small enough to obtain high <b>spraying</b> <b>rate,</b> but not too small to cause incomplete coverage of the core particles...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Glyphosate {{tolerance}} is {{a dominant}} trait in modern biotech crops. RESULTS: A gene encoding a glyphosate-tolerant EPSP synthase (aroA(1398)) from bacterial strain ATX 1398 was cloned and characterized. The protein is initiated at a GTG translational start codon {{to produce a}} protein that provides robust glyphosate resistance in Escherichia coli (Mig) Cast & Chalm. The aroA(1398) protein was expressed and purified from E. coli, and key kinetic values were determined (K(i) = 161 microM; K(m) (PEP) = 11. 3 microM; k(cat) = 28. 3 s(- 1)). The full-length enzyme is 800 -fold more resistant to glyphosate than the maize EPSP synthase while retaining high affinity for the substrate phosphoenol pyruvate. To evaluate further the potential of aroA(1398), transgenic maize events expressing the aroA(1398) protein were generated. T(0) plants were screened for tolerance to glyphosate sprays at 1. 3 x commercial <b>spray</b> <b>rates,</b> and T(1) plants were selected that completely resisted glyphosate sprays at 1 x, 2 x and 4 x recommended <b>spray</b> <b>rates</b> in field trials. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that aroA(1398) is a suitable candidate for conferring glyphosate tolerance in transgenic crop plants...|$|R
