The model is novel and distinctive because it combines both multiscale partial differential equation and ordinary differential equation modeling techniques {{to represent the}} five separate sections occurring within the dryer, including both flighted and unflighted sections. The solid phase in the unflighted sections was modeled as an axial dispersed plug flow system. The solid transport in the flighted sections was partitioned into the usual series–parallel formulation of well-mixed tanks representing airborne and flight-borne solids. Parameter values and compartment numbers were estimated using mechanistic geometric modeling, dryer design loading constraints, and solids flow properties. Geometric modeling enabled the effects of internal scaling arising from solid materials sticking to the internal walls of the dryer to be accounted for in a realistic manner. Industrial residence time distribution data were collected {{for a range of}} operational scenarios and were used to estimate the remaining model parameters (axial dispersion coefficient and kilning velocity).

By incorporating a drying rate modifying system such as a desiccant dehumidifier as an add-on, these conditions are shown to be achievable due to the extra dehumidification which can be manipulated using the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the sorption system. Due to the adsorbent regulation properties which are enhanced by high-temperature regeneration, the resilience of energy performance to disturbances is significantly improved compared to conventional dryers.

The thesis deals with various aspects of heat transfer and energy use in infrared heaters and dryers as employed in the paper industry. Both gas-fired and electric IR dryers are considered and compared. The thesis also provides an introduction to infrared heaters and infrared drying, including a review of recent literature in the field. The transport of thermal radiation inside a paper sheet was investigated and different IR dryers were compared in terms of their ability to transfer energy to the internal parts of a paper sheet. Although there were evident differences in the absorption of radiation between gas-fired and electric IR dryers, the distinction was found to not be as important as has generally been believed. The main differences appeared to be due to the choice of a one- or a two-sided dryer solution, rather than the spectral distributions emitted by the dryers. A method for evaluating the radiation efficiency of IR heaters was proposed. An electric IR heater was evaluated in the laboratory. The radiation efficiency of the heater was shown to be strongly dependent on the power level. The maximum efficiency, found at high power level, was close to 60 %. A procedure for evaluation of the total energy transfer efficiency of an infrared paper dryer was proposed and used in the evaluation of an electric IR dryer operating in an industrial coating machine. The <b>efficiency</b> of the <b>dryer</b> was roughly 40 %. A model for an electric IR heater was developed.

The effect {{of many of the}} dryer parameters such as heater power, fan speed, drum speed, weight of clothes and initial moisture content were experimented, documented, and analyzed. The results were discussed and many new proposed techniques to improve the dryer performance were recommended.;Electric heaters are used in many industrial applications. There are many interacting parameters that affect the heater performance and contribute to its cost. Such parameters are coil length, coil diameter, the helix diameter, the number of turns, the coil emissivity, the heater wall emissivity, the applied voltage, the air flow rate, the air temperature at the heater outlet, and the heater dimensions. The heater coil was divided into four segments and the heater wall was divided into five sections. Energy and heat transfer equations were written for each segment of the coil, each section of the wall, and the air past each coil segment. Equations relating the configuration factors from the coil segments to the wall sections, to the heater dimensions were derived. EES was used to solve the system of two hundred non-linear equations.

40|$|Drying can add value, {{facilitate}} {{transport and}} extend the storage life of agro-products; therefore, in developing countries with poorly established cool-chains, drying is particularly effective. Furthermore, drying within small-scale village-based enterprises contributes to rural development. However, most equipment suitable to such operations yields a product of non-uniform quality and shows low levels of energy efficiency. The aim {{of this research was}} to improve the batch uniformity and the energy efficiency of a cabinet dryer suitable for smallholder farmers. Experiments were carried out with the cooperation of a dryer manufacturer and a group of users. On each trial 144. 5 kg of peeled and deseeded litchis were placed at the dryer’s 17 trays, that were stacked atop each other. Moisture content (wet basis) was reduced from 87 to 23 % in about 15. 5 h. It was found that a low-cost modification to the dryer chamber’s air inlet was able to improve heat distribution and increase the uniformity of the fruit’s moisture content. In the original design, {{at the end of the}} drying process, moisture content of the fruits on the top tray was 38 % while at the bottom tray was 12 %. The modification to the dryer reduced this disparity and the final moisture content of the fruits placed at the top tray was 25 % while at the bottom tray was 21 %. In addition, the modification reduced the dryer’s air mass flow from 0. 3 to 0. 1 kg s− 1 without jeopardizing drying forces, consequently the <b>dryer</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> increased from 33 to 42 %...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} with Sonaka seedless grapes with different pretreatments NaOH (0. 5 %), Olive oil (2. 5 %) plus K 2 CO 3 (6. 0 %) and Ethyl oleate (2. 0 %) plus K 2 CO 3 (2. 5 %). Drying was carried out under sun and also at 45, 55 and 65 °C in heat pump dryer. The initial moisture content of 456. 54 per (db) {{has been reduced to}} a final moisture content of 18 per cent (db). The time taken for drying varies with respect to different treatment and drying temperature. Drying at 45, 55 and 65 °C took 32, 27 and 21 hours for Ethyl oleate plus K 2 CO 3   pretreatment. The highest drying rate observed in heat pump dryer was 1. 549 kg/kg min. at 65 °C. The initial drying rate was found to be higher in case of heat pump dryer. The energy requirement for drying of grapes in heat pump dryer was found to be 35 per cent less than that of cabinet <b>dryer.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of the evaporator and condenser coils was found to be 68 and 60 per cent respectively. Moisture extraction rate (MER) and Specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) values were higher and increased with temperature because of the decreased drying time. The coefficient of performance of the heat pump dryer at 45, 55 and 65 oC were 1. 89, 4. 31 and 6. 58 respectively.
