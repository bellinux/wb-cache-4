25|$|The North American NA-64 (NA-64 P-2 or NAA-64 P-2 in French service, Yale in Canadian service) is a low-wing <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> {{monoplane}} advanced trainer {{aircraft that}} was built for the French Armée de l'Air and Aeronavale and served with the Royal Canadian Air Force and Luftwaffe as a captured aircraft or Beuteflugzeug during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Heintz {{migrated}} to Canada in 1973, {{and set up}} Zenair in 1974 to sell plans and kits of the Zénith. The Zenith, which gained the designation Zenith CH 200 when Heintz produced plans for larger and smaller derivatives, is a low-winged cantilever monoplane of all metal construction. The pilot and passenger sit side-by-side under a clear, sideways opening plexiglas canopy, while the aircraft is fitted with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage. It {{is designed to be}} powered by a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> of between 85 and 160hp (63.5 and 119kW).|$|E
25|$|The Skeeter {{possessed a}} {{relatively}} conventional configuration for a helicopter, being {{powered by a}} <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> which drove a 29-foot (8.84metre) three-bladed main rotor and a three-bladed anti-torque rotor, which was mounted {{at the end of}} a triangular-section tailboom. The main rotor-blades made used of a composite construction, utilising a steel-tube spar that was bonded to wooden veneers, formers, and ribs, as well as brass balance-weights; these reportedly delivered a cost-effective and relatively simplistic rotor blade that also possessed favourable fatigue properties. Saunders-Roe also developed a replacement metal light alloy rotor blade that possessed superior aerodynamic properties and provided increased performance. A fixed tricycle undercarriage arrangement, complete with interchangeable wheels and brake units, was also present.|$|E

25|$|The SR.N1 was {{powered by}} a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> driven by {{expelled}} air. Demonstrated at the Farnborough Airshow in 1960, it was shown that this simple craft could carry a load of up to 12 marines with their equipment {{as well as the}} pilot and co-pilot with only a slight reduction in hover height proportional to the load carried. The SR.N1 did not have any skirt, using instead the peripheral air principle that Christopher had patented. It was later found that the craft's hover height was improved by the addition of a skirt of flexible fabric or rubber around the hovering surface to contain the air. The skirt was an independent invention made by a Royal Navy officer, C.H. Latimer-Needham, who sold his idea to Westland (by then the parent of Saunders-Roe's helicopter and hovercraft interests), and who worked with Christopher to develop the idea further.|$|E

50|$|Rio {{operated}} various aircraft types {{through its}} history and initially flew <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> Piper Cherokee Six and twin piston engine Beech 18 aircraft. Turboprop aircraft were then operated, including the Beechcraft 99 until 1977 followed by de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters, Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners (Metro II models), de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7s and Beechcraft 1900Cs.|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{performance of}} the 25 kW Space Power Demonstrator (SPD) engine during an extensive testing period has provided a baseline of free <b>piston</b> Stirling <b>engine</b> technology from which future space Stirling engines may evolve. Much {{of the success of}} the engine was due to the initial careful selection of engine materials, fabrication and joining processes, and inspection procedures. Resolution of the few SPD engine problem areas that did occur has resulted in the technological advancement of certain key free <b>piston</b> Stirling <b>engine</b> components. Derivation of two half-SPD, <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> from the axially opposed <b>piston</b> SPD <b>engine,</b> designated as Space Power Research (SPR) engines, has made possible the continued improvement of these engine components. The two SPR engines serve as test bed engines for testing of engine components. Some important fabrication and joining processes are reviewed. Also, some component deficiencies that were discovered during SPD engine testing are described and approaches that were taken to correct these deficiencies are discussed. Potential component design modifications, based upon the SPD and SPR engine testing, are also reported...|$|R
25|$|A third design, {{for a small}} {{unmanned}} version {{powered by}} a <b>single</b> Gnome rotary <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> was constructed in 1918. It was intended to carry meteorological (weather) instruments or radio antennas aloft, {{but it is not}} known whether it ever flew.|$|R
50|$|The main {{challenge}} for the free-piston engine is engine control, {{which can only be}} said to be fully solved for <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> hydraulic free-piston <b>engines.</b> Issues such as the influence of cycle-to-cycle variations in the combustion process and engine performance during transient operation in dual <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> are topics that need further investigation. Crankshaft engines can connect traditional accessories such as alternator, oil pump, fuel pump, cooling system, starter etc.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the KD6G {{was based on the}} earlier Globe KD2G Firefly target drone, {{featuring}} a mid-wing configuration with a twin-fin empennage, but instead of a pulsejet powerplant as in the KD2G the KD6G was fitted with a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> in a tractor configuration. Launched via catapult, the KD6G was radio-controlled during flight, and, if it was not shot down in the course of its mission, would be recovered via parachute.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the Diamond DA40 a four-place IFR aircraft, {{received}} certification; it {{was followed}} by the twin diesel engine DA42 in 2004. According to Flight International, the DA40 was capable of outperforming many similar aircraft which at that time had carried substantially greater purchase costs than the DA40 outfitted with a basic configuration. When launched in 2001, the DA40TDI would be the production aircraft powered by a <b>single</b> diesel-based <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Z-26 {{was designed}} in the 1940s and produced in 1946 by the Czechoslovakian company, Moravan to meet a requirement for a basic trainer to replace the Bücker Jungmann and Bestmann. It was a low-wing monoplane of mixed construction, with wooden wings and a welded metal tube fuselage, powered by a <b>single</b> four-cylinder <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> the Walter Minor 4-III. It first flew in early 1947, proving superior to the competing Praga 112, and was declared the winner, entering production in 1948.|$|R
50|$|In March 2007, after {{remaining}} nearly dormant {{for nearly}} four years as the tea industry had experienced a slump, the estate was bought over by S K Bansal, of Ambotia Tea Group, which established a new factory within the premises, and started modernization process, replating and switching to organic farming. Finally, the estate reopened to public in 2008, with the original factory turned into a working museum. It also displayed <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> slow-speed <b>engines,</b> and the shaft machines and sells tea-related mementos. Today, over 1500 people worked in the tea estate and processing unit.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the types}} upon it was based, the Chupsi (Mosquito) is a {{single-engine}} monoplane with a braced high wing. The fuselage is of welded steel tube construction with a fabric covering, while the wings are of mixed construction, the aluminium spars and plywood ribs. An enclosed cockpit accommodates two seats side-by-side {{and can be}} fitted with dual controls. It {{is powered by a}} <b>single</b> Rotax 532 <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> driving a two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. Either a tailwheel or nosewheel undercarriage can be fitted.|$|R
50|$|The Interceptor 400 was a turboprop-powered single-engined light {{aircraft}} {{developed from the}} Meyers 200 <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> plane.

50|$|The RAF {{received}} its first Wellesleys in April 1937, serving with No. 76 Squadron RAF at Finningley and it eventually equipped six RAF Bomber Command squadrons in the UK. Five aircraft with provisions for three crew members were modified for long-range {{work with the}} RAF Long-Range Development Flight. Additional modifications included the fitting of Pegasus XXII engines and extra fuel tanks. On 5 November 1938, three of them under command of Squadron Leader Richard Kellett flew non-stop for two days from Ismailia, Egypt to Darwin, Australia (7162 mi) setting a world distance record. All three aircraft broke the record, but No. 2 aircraft landed in West Timor, 500 mi short of the objective. The Wellesley's record remained unbroken until November 1945. This flight is still the longest by an aircraft with a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{equipped}} with contra-rotating propellers, {{also referred to}} as CRP, coaxial contra-rotating propellers, or high-speed propellers, apply the maximum power of usually a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> or turboprop <b>engine</b> to drive two coaxial propellers in contra-rotation (rotation about the same axis in opposite directions). Two propellers are arranged one behind the other, and power is transferred from the engine via a planetary gear or spur gear transmission. Contra-rotating propellers {{should not be confused with}} counter-rotating propellers—airscrews on separate shafts turning in opposite directions.|$|R
40|$|Free-piston {{engines are}} under {{investigation}} {{by a number of}} research groups due to potential fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions advantages over conventional technology. The main challenge with such engines is the control of the piston motion, and this has not yet been fully resolved for all types of free-piston engines. This paper discusses the basic features of a <b>single</b> <b>piston</b> free-piston <b>engine</b> generator under development at Newcastle University and investigates engine control issues using a full-cycle simulation model. Control variables and disturbances are identified, and a control strategy is proposed. It is found that the control of the free-piston engine is a challenge, but that the proposed control strategy is feasible. Engine speed control does, however, represent a challenge in the current design. Free-piston Linear engine Dynamics Control...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present {{the design of a}} more {{environmental}} friendly aircraft that complies with existent and future emission regulations. Recent Market Outlooks were examined and a <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> <b>piston</b> prop was selected as a case study. Matching Charts were used to estimate the hybridization degree, meaning the ratio between the power provided by the electric motors and the total amount of power. This method allowed the over-boost advantage to be highlighted and pointed out secondary benefits of a hybrid Piston Prop. Furthermore, the zero-emission taxi possibility was evaluated. Both fuel savings forecast and safety analysis were performed, showing secondary advantages of a high hybridization degree for a <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> <b>Piston</b> Prop configuration. Furthermore, the additional weight related to electric motors and storage system is taken into account and state-of-the-art and innovative under-development technologies are considered. Thus, the conceptual design phase will produce many possible architectures; therefore, {{the last part of the}} work consists of a trade study necessary to select the optimal solution to design an innovative hybrid Piston Prop aircraf...|$|R
