The objects of study - original biological medicines Cortexin and Retinalamin. Comparative, systematic, analytical methods and reviews were used. Biological medical products have fundamental differences from synthetic medicines, due to their source - alive cells which are usually used in their production process. Each production cycle results in a unique finished pharmaceutical products and minimal differences in the modes of production can significantly effect on the properties of biological medical products. Therefore, even if the physical, chemical and biological properties of the product thoroughly studied and described, it does not guarantee therapeutic equivalence of two biological products which are manufactured in different conditions. One of the most important issues today is the problem of maintaining properties and quality of biological medicines. These issues are actively resolving on the native pharmaceutical market: quality control system are developing and implementing in accordance with international standards in order to maintain maximum efficiency of biological medicines and to protect consumers from defective products. Biological products require special conditions of storage and transportation. In order to save physical, chemical and therapeutic properties, strict compliance with the relevant conditions of packaging, transport and intermediate storage, related to deviations in temperature during transportation and storage is needed.

The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{scientific}} grounding and development of polyalternative biotechnology of multivariate antiseptic preparations based on bacteriolysin and other antimicrobial products of the selected producer Streptomyces albus UN 44 with activity heightened in 4 ? 4, 5 times. The scheme of the supporting selection of producers, that includes step treatment with mutagens of different nature (nitrous acid, ultraviolet radiation, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N- nitrosoguanidine) in set effective doses was proposed, and subsequent selection of overproducers. The complex taxonomic analysis of culture was first conducted, with the definition of the nucleotide sequence of 16 S rRNA gene and morphological, biochemical and biosynthetic features, that allowed to reidentify the culture as S. albus (initially S. recifensis var. lyticus). The possibility of replacing the hydrolyzed starch to molasses {{as a part of the}} nutrient medium for the biosynthesis of bacteriolysins by the selected strain was shown. Using the method of two-factor analysis of variance and central composite rotatable plan, the concentration of these components was optimized, which determined the price reduction of nutrient medium in 1, 5 - 2 times and the increase of the biosynthetic activity of the culture by 30 - 40 %. The increased stability and efficiency of the immobilized form of the bacteriolytic preparation from S. albus UN 44 were detected, which was prepared using adsorption on aerosil silica, and the main binding mechanisms in the enzymecarrier system were shown ? hydrogen bonds with silanol and OH-groups on the carrier surface, and the electrostatic interactions. The technological parameters of obtaining the immobilized drug were determined and became the basis of the Regulation (PR 20. 59 - 02070987 - 001 : 2015) and biotechnology of the bacteriolytic drug Cytorecifen-M, which has been implemented at SE "Enzyme". It was shown, that the antimicrobial action of the immobilized drug is not only useful on clinical strains of pathogens in a state of suspension, but leads to the inhibition (in 8 - 10 times) and the destruction of P. aeruginosa biomembrane. Stability of the bacteriolytic complex of S. albus UN 44 when stored in a liquid phase of culture fluid at a temperature to + 10 ?C and using of the <b>sterilizing</b> <b>filtration</b> has identified the possibility of developing a liquid form of antiseptics. Prospects for the use of this drug in veterinary medicine (and potentially medicine) are caused by the detected harmlessness of the producer, which is attributed to the group of the avirulent microorganisms (IV class of danger). The ability of the culture to synthesize complex antibiotics, which were identified using the matched system of two-stage extraction and fractionation, was detected for the first time. Using the methods of chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, the main antibiotic compounds of the culture were investigated and identified: bis (2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (C 24 H 38 O 4) and 3 -O-metylcyclopolic acid (C 12 H 14 O 6) with molecular masses of 390, 3 and 254, 1 respectively. For obtaining the antibiotics of antifungal and antibacterial specificity, the extraction and fractionation system was chosen, using column chromatography and the eluents, accordingly, chloroform:isopropanol (97 : 3 ? 80 : 20) and chloroform or hexane:chloroform (1 : 1). The determined conditions of allocation of antibiotics were used to develop the technological foundations for obtaining another form of medication-antiseptic from S. albus UN 44. For the first time was defined the high antagonistic activity of S. albus UN 44 towards relatively common phytopathogenes of genera Bipolaris, Fusarium, Phytium, Rizoctonia, along with the shown growth-stimulating activity determines the feasibility of using one of the developed forms of antiseptics in crop. The culture fluid preparation with a concentration 108 ? 109 CFU/cm 3 can be produced in the form of a suspension or dried and granulated form. The immobilized form of the enzyme preparation is used in the development of patented synthetic detergent with antiseptic effect, which is recommended for everyday use and for washing in hospitals. The possibility of the Cytal drug usage was shown in the processes of the food industry for the preparation of bakery improver, that improves the product quality in organoleptic characteristics and the porosity (7 %). The mode of biomass degradation of selected lactic acid bacteria cultures using bacteriolysins for obtaining dietary supplements was developed and put into production. The composition of the mild medical form (ointment) was matched, using the Cytal preparation, which contains formative components in certain concentrations (polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, proxanol 268, glycerin), anesthetic (lidocaine), preservative (ofloxacin) and reveals the prolonged antimicrobial action. Based on the research, the technical design for essential equipment and biotechnology of various forms of antiseptic drugs were developed, the normative documentation for the production and recommendations for the use of drugs were approved. Some technologies and processes were tested and put into production, practice and teaching process. The practical significance of the results was confirmed by relevant implementing regulations, recommendations for use and patents. ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????? ???? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ??????????????????? ?????????? ???????????????

The final product had high immunizing potency, as shown by both in vivo and in vitro assays, and was well tolerated in man. Stability of the product to accelerated aging was good, and storage at 4 C for 1 year caused only a minor loss in protective activity. Large volumes of the highly antigenic gel-adsorbed protective antigen were readily produced by the method described...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{production of}} exudative epidermitis of pigs following the inoculation of skin scrapings or cultures from field or experimentally-produced {{cases of the}} disease is described. Typical lesions of exudative epidermitis were produced following inoculation, either intravenously or by scarification, of broth cultures of 4 strains of a micrococcus isolated from field cases of the disease. The experimental inoculation of pigs with skin scrapings <b>sterilized</b> by <b>filtration</b> or antibiotic treated, yielded negative results. Cultures of CORYNEBACTERIUM PYOGENES and of STREPTOCOCCUS SP. also isolated from the affected pigs, likewise yielded negative results on experimental inoculation of pigs. The conclusion is drawn, that the micrococcus isolated from field cases and which produced the disease experimentally is the primary etiological agent of exudative epidermitis as seen in weaned pigs in this area. The histopathology of the experimentally produced disease is described...|$|R
40|$|Atropine (AT) and oximes, {{alone or}} in combination, have been proven greatly {{valuable}} therapeutics {{in the treatment of}} organophosphates intoxications. An injectable mixture of AT and obidoxime (OB) was formulated for the administration by automatic self-injector. The aqueous single dose solution contained 275 mg obidoxime chloride and 2. 5 mg atropine sulfate per 1 mL (220 mg and 2 mg per 0. 8 effective dose, respectively). The final solution was <b>sterilized</b> by <b>filtration</b> through a 0. 22 µm pore size filter. This more concentrated solution allowed to use a smaller size and lighter weight cartridge. Quality control tests, including assay of the two major compounds were performed separately, using reversed-phase HPLC methods. Besides, the stability test was carried out according to ICH guideline for the accelerated test. The obtained results showed that the proposed formulation is stable over a period of 2 years after preparation...|$|R
40|$|A sterile-filtered, {{liquid medium}} {{composed}} of one-half-strength APT broth and 4 % (wt/vol) yeast extract {{was found to}} support the production of bacteriocins by Streptococcus mutans strains BHT and GS- 5. Culture supernatants, adjusted to pH 7. 0 and <b>sterilized</b> by <b>filtration,</b> contained bacteriocin-like activity, which could be demonstrated by spotting dilutions onto top agar lawns seeded with Streptococcus pyogenes as the sensitive indicator and by adding dilutions to log-phase indicator broth cultures. A quantitative assay was developed for BHT bacteriocin, based on its lethal effects. Bacteriocin production did not occur until after the log phase of growth had ceased and was not inducible by ultraviolet irradiation or treatment with mitomycin C. Non-bacteriocinogenic clones of strain BHT occurred spontaneously at high frequency, suggesting control by a plasmid, but this frequency was not increased by treatment with the plasmid-curing agents acridine orange and ethidium bromide...|$|R
40|$|Similar stimulatory effects by {{gibberellic}} acid on germination of Erica junonia seed are obtained when solutions of this compound are <b>sterilized</b> by <b>filtration</b> or autoclaving at 100 °C or 120 °C for 15 min. Both {{gibberellic acid}} and temperature are important factors controlling germination. Incubation at 23 / 15 °C for periods of 1, 2, 3 or 4 {{weeks prior to}} stratification at 5, 5 °C for 12 weeks are equally effective in enhancing germination of 0, 5 mmol dm– 3 gibberellic acid treated seed. Gibberellic acid {{appears to be more}} effective when applied during the prechilling incubation period than during the chilling or post-chilling periods. Moderately low constant temperatures (10 – 12 °C) are effective in yielding high germination counts of gibberellic acid treated seed. It is postulated that dormancy breaking in Erica junonia seed is controlled by at least two processes with differing temperature coefficients...|$|R
30|$|C. hydrogenoformans (DSM 6008) was {{obtained}} from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). The strain was cultivated in shake-culture at 100 rpm under strictly anaerobic conditions at 70 °C in a basal mineral medium buffered with a bicarbonate-phosphate buffer. The medium as formulated by Zhao et al. (2011) contained (in g[*]·[*]L– 1 of demineralized water): KCl 0.33, MgCl 2 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O 0.102, CaCl 2 [*]·[*] 2 H 2 O 0.015, NH 4 Cl 0.33, KH 2 PO 4 0.136, NaHCO 3 0.42, yeast extract 0.05, Na 2 S[*]·[*] 9 H 2 O 0.7. The medium was supplemented with 10 mL[*]·[*]L– 1 trace metals solution and 10 ml[*]·[*]L– 1 of vitamins solution prepared as described previously (Stams et al. 1993). All stock solutions were autoclaved, except for the vitamin solution, which was <b>sterilized</b> by <b>filtration</b> through 0.22 μm filter membranes. The initial pH was adjusted between 6.8 and 7.0.|$|R
30|$|Materials and methods: Chemical {{precursors}} DOTA-NOC, DOTA-RGDfK dimer, DOTA-Ubiquicidin (29 - 41), and PSMA- 11 {{were acquired}} from ABX. Gallium- 68 {{was obtained from}} an ITG generator while labeling was performed in an iQS module (ITG GmbH). Stock solutions of different concentrations were prepared by dissolving the precursors in 0.25 M NaOAc. Aliquots of 100 μl of the stock solutions were dispensed in Eppendorf vials and stored at - 20 °C. For labeling, the aliquots were diluted with 900 μl of 0.25 M NaOAc, mixed with 4 ml of 68 GaCl 3, and incubated for 10 min. Purification was made by SPE eluting the product with 1 ml 50 % EtOH. Final product was diluted with physiological saline and <b>sterilized</b> by <b>filtration</b> (0.22 μm, Millex-GV). Radiochemical purity (RCP) was determined by gradient HPLC using a Nova-Pak C 18 column (3.9 x 150 mm), 2.5 ml/min flow rate. Eluents were A= 0.1 N TFA and B=MeCN.|$|R
40|$|During a {{study of}} {{certain aspects of the}} {{relationships}} between bacteriophage and Streptococcus lactis and Streptococcus cremoris, proliferation of the bacterio-phage on organisms growing in media of known chemical composition became desirable. So far as could be determined, proliferation of the lactic streptococcus bacteriophages on organisms growing in completely defined media has not been reported. METHODS Defined basal media. The medium of Niven (1944) was modified by omitting NaCl and also by substituting some amino acids of L-configuration for those of DL-configuration; when such substitutions were made, the quantities of the acids in question were decreased by half. These modifications were found to have no influence on the growth of the test bacteria. This medium was modified further for some of the test cultures by adding 0. 2 per cent sodium acetate and 0. 2 per cent sorbitan monooleate, as suggested by Collins, Nelson, and Parmelee (1950). Glutamine and asparagine, <b>sterilized</b> by <b>filtration,</b> were added aseptically afte...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of producing sterile and freeze-dried polyester nanoparticles was investigated. Various poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) and poly(D,L-lactide) were selected as biodegradable polymers. Using the salting-out procedure, process parameters were optimized to obtain sub- 200 nm particles. After purification, the nanoparticle suspensions containing different lyoprotectants were <b>sterilized</b> by <b>filtration.</b> Freeze-drying was performed using vials covered with 0. 22 microm membrane filters {{in order to}} preserve the suspensions from bacterial contamination. Sterility was assessed on the final product according to pharmacopoeial requirements using the membrane filtration method. With all polymers tested, sub- 200 nm particles could be obtained. Nanoparticles with a size as low as 102 nm were prepared with good reproducibility and narrow size distribution. Upon freeze-drying, it appeared that complete redispersion of all types of polyester nanoparticles could be obtained in presence of the lyoprotectants tested such as saccharides while aggregation was observed without lyoprotectant. Sterility testing showed no microbial contamination indicating that sterile nanoparticulate formulations have been achieved...|$|R
