5|$|For {{the next}} several days, Japanese forces {{launched}} air raids to counter the incursion. These included the first widespread use of the kamikaze suicide attack. Several days later, U.S. submarines in the South China Sea spotted two Japanese forces on approach: five battleships steaming toward <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Strait, and another force of four Japanese carriers in northern Luzon.|$|E

5|$|Several major premodern Native American groups {{eventually}} {{gained control}} of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived in the mountain headwaters of the Santa Ana River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> County, {{as well as in}} the foothills of the <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Mountains. The Tongva lived on the flat coastal plains of present-day Orange County south of the Santa Ana Mountains. They were also the larger of the two groups, controlling all the coastal lands from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Aliso Creek in the south, including all of the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E
5|$|A {{colder climate}} {{introduced}} cold-limited animal species which appeared at lower altitudes, and glaciers formed on the <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Mountains. A probable southward {{shift of the}} storm belts led to windier weather. According to data obtained from tufa in Lake Cahuilla, a wet period ended 9,000 years before present, and between 6,200 and 3,000-2,000 years before present extended droughts occurred.|$|E
5|$|Bob Lemon {{was born}} in <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> California. Lemon's father, Earl Lemon, ran an ice {{business}} and later moved the family to Long Beach, California. There, Lemon attended Wilson Classical High School and played shortstop on the school's baseball team. He was recognized as the state baseball {{player of the year}} by the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, Obama {{was joined}} by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a {{military}} base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.

5|$|Prior to truncation, US395 {{served the}} {{metropolitan}} areas of San Diego and <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino.</b> The highway {{serves as a}} connection to the Los Angeles area for the communities of the Owens Valley, Mammoth Lakes and Mono Lake. The highway is used as an access for both the highest point in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney, and the lowest point in North America, Death Valley.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{locations}} either were real, or were filmed {{with the use}} of stand-ins. The gate for the Area 51 set was filmed at a fence on the <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> county line, one hundred and twenty miles away from Los Angeles. The restaurant that the characters visit, the Little A'Le'Inn, is an actual cafe off Highway 375 in Rachel, Nevada. The inside, however, was an elaborate set, as the original is much too small.|$|E
5|$|State Route 247 (SR 247) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California in <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> County. The road passes through the Mojave Desert, {{connecting}} SR 62 in Yucca Valley to Interstate 15 (I-15). SR 247 was designated by the California State Legislature in 1969; the county roads along that route {{were given to the}} state in 1972.|$|E
5|$|While the Jacksonville chain kept expanding, {{two friends}} named James McLamore and David R. Edgerton, both alumni of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, were seeking an {{opportunity}} to open their own business. McLamore had visited the original hamburger stand belonging to Dick and Mac McDonald in <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> California, and sensing potential in their innovative assembly line-based production system, decided to open a similar operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, he left Hawaii for a {{job with}} the Office of the Inspector General at Norton Air Force Base in <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> California. While at Norton, he studied at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles before {{attending}} the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, which required him to relocate to Washington, D.C. Shortly thereafter he enrolled at Georgetown Law and completed his studies and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree. His next assignment was as vice wing commander of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing at George Air Force Base in Victorville, California.|$|E
5|$|Perez began {{training}} at Jesse Hernandez's School of Hard Knocks in <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> California, {{and made her}} in-ring debut in April 2002. Many officials stated {{that she had the}} most natural ability of any woman who came through their school. In late 2002, Perez auditioned for World Wrestling Entertainment's reality show Tough Enough III, making it through to the final twenty-one, before being eliminated in the final cut of the first episode. After she was eliminated from the contest, trainer Al Snow encouraged her to keep trying to pursue her dream as a wrestler.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{spent more}} than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost {{identical}} road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{creation}} following the 1930 census, the 12th district had been represented by Democrats. The 12th stretched from {{just south of}} Pasadena to the Orange and <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> county lines, encompassing such small towns as Whittier, Pomona and Covina. The area has since been entirely absorbed into the Los Angeles megalopolis, {{but at the time}} it was principally agricultural. The freeway system had barely touched the 12th district; only a small segment of the Pasadena Freeway cut across its northwest corner.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} the tour {{returning to the}} UK in May 2009 for a short string of dates with support from labelmates Cauldron. In November 2009 they announced the departure of Dominguez, who was replaced by bassist Jerry Garcia from <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> thrash metal band Taking Over. Meanwhile, the band was finishing the writing process of their second album, and in January 2010 they entered the Highland Recorders studio in Phoenix, Arizona to begin recording with producer Ralph Patlan. Bonded by Blood's second full-length, Exiled to Earth, was released through Earache on August 10 in North America and August 16 in Europe.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{recreational}} opportunities along the Santa Ana River. The Santa Ana River watershed includes {{parts of the}} Cleveland National Forest, <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> National Forest, Angeles National Forest, Mount San Jacinto State Wilderness Area, Chino Hills State Park, and Lake Perris State Recreation Area. Big Bear Lake, Lake Elsinore, and Lake Irvine are popular recreational lakes in the watershed. The river never actually flows through any of these lakes, but they each have drainage to the river via tributaries.|$|E
5|$|A {{predecessor}} to {{this road}} ran through Brea Canyon {{by the early}} 20th century and {{was added to the}} state highway system. The freeway was built in stages during the 1950s, one of which included the Brea Canyon Freeway; SR57 was designated as part of the 1964 state highway renumbering. The final portion of the present-day Orange Freeway was not completed until the mid 1970s. The latest piece of SR57 to be added was formerly part of I-210, after SR210 was legislatively extended to <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> in 1998. An unconstructed extension from Santa Ana south to Huntington Beach remains in the legal definition of SR57, and has been studied as a toll road above the Santa Ana River.|$|E
5|$|A short overlap carries SR57 {{traffic on}} the same roadway as SR60. The two routes head {{northeast}} through {{an arm of the}} San Gabriel Valley; after they split, SR57 ascends slightly and then slopes through the edge of the Puente Hills and into the west end of the Pomona Valley. Here it meets the <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Freeway (I-10) and Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) at the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange. In the north half of that interchange, SR57 enters the San Jose Hills, climbing to its highest elevation before descending back into the connected San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and ending at the Glendora Curve interchange with the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Glendora.|$|E
5|$|About 82% of Americans live {{in urban}} areas (including suburbs); {{about half of those}} reside in cities with populations over 50,000. The US has {{numerous}} clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston). There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million. Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South. The metro areas of <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by {{more than a million people}} between 2000 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Anthrax was {{announced}} as the headliner {{for the third}} annual Metal Alliance US tour, which endured through March and April 2013. Supporting acts included Exodus, Municipal Waste, and Holy Grail, with the headliner Anthrax performing Among the Living in its entirety. Charlie Benante has been taking time off from gigs outside the US because of personal reasons. His place was filled in by drummer Jon Dette during these shows. The group filmed their performance at Santiago, Chile, with Benante on drums, for the DVD album Chile On Hell. The tour ended with a show at <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> California, at the two-year anniversary of the album's release. After finishing the tour, the band took a short break before reconvening to start work on a new album.|$|E
5|$|Beale {{suggested}} that, {{in addition}} to a military fort, the route was also in immediate need of bridges and dams to ensure safe travel and provide a reliable water supply; he requested $100,000 to fund the improvements. Further complicating the journey, the only pockets of civilization between Albuquerque and <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> California, a distance of , were the Zuni and Laguna pueblos. According to Baley, US Army officers stationed in Albuquerque insisted the emigrants hire Jose Manuel Savedra, a Mexican guide who had traveled with Beale during his initial survey of the route, and his interpreter, Petro. Unbeknownst to the group, Beale was unhappy with Savedra's scouting abilities, and had demoted him to helping with the animals in the pack train. The Rose–Baley Party paid Savedra's fee of $500 in advance.|$|E
5|$|Halsey's orders, {{which gave}} {{priority}} {{to the destruction of}} the Japanese fleet, led to the most controversial episode of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Four Japanese task forces converged on Kinkaid's forces in Leyte Gulf: a carrier task force under Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, from the north; a force under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita through the Sibuyan Sea; and two task forces commanded by Vice Admirals Shōji Nishimura and Kiyohide Shima, which approached via the Surigao Strait. Carrier aircraft from Task Force 38 engaged Kurita in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, and forced him to withdraw. In a controversial decision, Halsey concluded that Kurita was no longer a threat and headed north after Ozawa's force but, due to a misunderstanding, Kinkaid believed that Halsey was still guarding the <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Strait. Kinkaid deployed all available Seventh Fleet vessels in the Surigao Strait under Oldendorf facing Nishimura and Shima.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, a {{much closer}} gold rush {{occurred}} in the <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Mountains when prospector William Holcomb discovered significant deposits, just over the northern drainage divide of the Santa Ana River. This discovery exploded into a full-scale gold mining operation in days. The Santa Ana River served as a conduit for miners traveling to the region {{and many of the}} forests in the upper basin experienced clearcutting {{as a result of the}} high resource demands of the boom. Gold was also discovered in Lytle Creek in that same year. Following the gold rush, the cultivation of citrus became the mainstay of the economy of the lower Santa Ana River area. Through the late 19th century, citrus fields covered much of the coastal plain and led to the naming of Orange County.|$|E
5|$|James J. Murakami {{supervised}} the production design. Location scouting revealed {{that many of}} the older buildings in Los Angeles had been torn down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in San Dimas, <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> and Pasadena doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had changed since the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of comfort. For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged {{the third floor of the}} Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s Los Angeles City Council chambers.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{ships were}} {{generally}} not camouflaged. In special tactical situations, camouflage could be improvised, {{as when the}} battleships Yamato and Musashi had their decks blackened {{with a mixture of}} soot to help them hide while passing through the <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Strait at night in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. Japanese ships largely retained their pre-war dark gray paint scheme, although some major units like aircraft carriers changed to a dark sea green. Some aircraft carriers had their flight decks painted in a dazzle camouflage, but this seems to have been ineffective. By 1945, with the remnants of the Japanese Navy seeking to hide from American air power, its battleships were painted in a variety of camouflage measures. Haruna for example wore olive green overall, its turrets painted light green with gray stripes, whereas Ises olive dress was broken up with patches of gray, red-brown, yellow, and dark green.|$|E
5|$|Large swells {{produced}} by the storm resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in Orange County, California. High temperatures in southern California, exceeding 100°F (37.7°C) in places, and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575,000 people going to beaches during the Labor Day weekend. One incident required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 810ft (2.43m) waves. Officials in <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> County advised residents to take precautions {{for the possibility of}} flooding as a result of moisture from the remnants of Howard. Following wildfires in 2003, foothills were highly susceptible to flooding. Residents were advised to have sandbags ready, ensure their emergency supplies were stocked and have an evacuation plan. Despite all the preparations undertaken, Howard did not produced any rainfall in California. The moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of Arizona. This led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|The California State Legislature defined Route 26 as a {{route from}} Lucerne Valley to Morongo Valley in 1959. SR 247 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering as a route from SR 62 in Yucca Valley to SR 18 near Lucerne Valley, {{and then from}} there to I-15 in Barstow. That year, the Lucerne Valley Chamber of Commerce began an effort to have a state highway designated from Lucerne Valley to Yucca Valley along Old Woman Springs Road. By 1969, county roads had been constructed from Barstow to Lucerne Valley, {{and from there to}} Yucca Valley. Barstow Road and Old Woman Springs Road were given to the state by <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> County in 1972, although the county had agreed to perform some improvements on the two roads after the state began to maintain them.|$|E
5|$|This {{invasion}} {{brought on}} the last great sortie of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Its plan for the Battle of Leyte Gulf included a feint by a northern force of planeless heavy attack carriers to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings. This was to allow the Japanese Center Force to enter the gulf through <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Strait. At {{the opening of the}} battle planes from the carriers guarded by New Jersey struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship 23 October. The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted. Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese carriers, as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while New Jersey steamed south at flank speed to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force. It had been turned back in a stunning defeat when she arrived.|$|E
5|$|Though the Clash {{continued}} to tour, tension {{continued to}} increase. In early 1983, Chimes left the band after the Combat Rock Tour because of in-fighting and turmoil. He {{was replaced by}} Pete Howard for the US Festival in <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> California, which the Clash co-headlined, along with David Bowie and Van Halen. The band argued with the event's promoters over inflated ticket prices, threatening to pull out unless a large donation was made to a local charity. The group ultimately performed on 28 May, the festival's New Music Day, which drew a crowd of 140,000. After the show, members of the band brawled with security staff. This was Jones' last appearance with the group: in September 1983, he was fired. Shortly thereafter, he became {{a founding member of}} General Public, but left that band as they were recording their first album.|$|E
5|$|When the California Republic was assimilated {{into the}} United States in 1848, American {{settlers}} {{began to move}} into the Santa Ana River region in great numbers. The Mexican ranchos were divided into smaller individual properties, and irrigated agriculture began on a large scale. The city of Santa Ana Viejo, the original location of Santa Ana, was founded in this period. In 1854, Mormons settled in the upper Inland Empire area and started the city of <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino,</b> gaining prosperity by using water from the river, as well as Lytle Creek and Mill Creek, to irrigate crops. The cattle industry began to decline as farms began to replace ranches. Soon, white settlers in the region were more numerous than Hispanics as well. The California Gold Rush around this time was responsible for attracting many of these people to the state, but many remained in Southern California afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held in Placentia on January 30, 1967, to begin construction of the Orange Freeway. The first portion was dedicated on May 16, 1969, and opened soon after, extending north from the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) to Nutwood Avenue in Fullerton. Over the next few years, the freeway was completed from SR 91 north to I-10, and I-210 was built north to the present end of SR57; the Pomona Freeway (SR 60), which overlaps it through Diamond Bar, was constructed at the same time. The last pieces of that portion were the freeway through Brea Canyon, which opened March 13, 1972, and the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange at I-10, which was dedicated May 1, 1972, and opened soon thereafter. Finally, the Orange Freeway was extended south from SR91 to I-5 in the mid-1970s, allowing Route250 to be turned back to local governments, though the subsequent deletion from the Streets and Highways Code {{did not take place}} until 1981. With the extension of SR 210 around <b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> in 1998, the former easternmost piece of I-210 to the Kellogg Hill Interchange instead became a northerly extension of SR57, though it remains officially part of the Interstate Highway System.|$|E
5|$|Plans for freeways in Los Angeles County {{evolved from}} a 1937 Automobile Club of Southern California plan, which was {{modified}} by the city's Transportation Engineering Board (TEB) in 1939. The former included a single freeway connecting Los Angeles to Long Beach, beginning at Pasadena and heading south-southwest to Lynwood, then paralleling Long Beach Boulevard to Long Beach. The TEB's plan shifted this route farther east to near the present Long Beach Freeway, while keeping the route near Long Beach Boulevard as a second freeway leaving the Ramona Parkway (<b>San</b> <b>Bernardino</b> Freeway) east of downtown and heading south near Alameda Street and Long Beach Boulevard to Long Beach. This second freeway {{came to be known}} as the Long Beach Parkway or Alamitos Parkway, and connected in north Long Beach with a Terminal Island Freeway southwest to Terminal Island. Because the Long Beach Naval Shipyard was located on the island, the U.S. Navy paid for the construction of the $14 million freeway from the island to Willow Street, including the $5.3 million Schuyler Heim Lift Bridge. Construction began in early 1946, and the completed link was dedicated on January 10, 1948, replacing the older Henry Ford Bridge.|$|E
