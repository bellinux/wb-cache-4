5|$|The idea of Żydokomuna {{continued}} to endure {{to a certain}} extent in postwar Poland (1944–1956), because Polish anti-communists saw the Soviet-controlled Communist regime as the fruition of prewar anti-Polish agitation; with it came the implication of Jewish responsibility. The Soviet appointments of Jews to positions responsible for oppressing the populace further fueled this perception. Some 37.1% of post-war management of UB employees and members of the communist authorities in Poland were of Jewish origin. They were described in intelligence reports as very loyal to the Soviets (Szwagrzyk). Some Polish historians have impugned the loyalty of Jews returning to Poland from the USSR after the Soviet takeover, which has raised the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> Żydokomuna in the minds of other scholars.|$|E

5|$|Avenged is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a melodrama focusing on John Warren, a young clerk, who is struck by a taxi cab while crossing the street. The chauffeur who struck him, Allen, decides to flee as a crowd gathers around John. Allen ditches his taxi on a country road and takes a train, successfully escaping. Six years later, the poor, ill and crippled John has become a timekeeper in a mining town. John's wife, who has taken care of him, sickens and dies. Allen, unaware of John's identity, attempts to comfort him and listens to John's story. After learning Allen wrecked his life, John attempts to shoot him, but the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> his wife stays his hand. John goes to her grave, forgives Allen, and dies. No cast or production credits are known for this film. Released on October 7, 1910, the film was a distinct departure from other Thanhouser releases and was sharply criticized by reviewers. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

25|$|The {{watershed}} moment {{initiating the}} political emancipation {{process of the}} Eurasian segment of colonial society occurred {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, when Indos massively protested the discriminatory provisions implemented with the introduction of the 'Cultivation System' (1830–1870). The start of the 20th century also saw continued and increasing pauperism among poor Indos increasingly dependent on charity, which created the mental <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> indivertible impoverishment.|$|E
25|$|When the new Senate {{was first}} sworn in, {{the balance was}} 58–41 {{in favor of the}} Democrats, because of the {{unresolved}} Senate election in Minnesota.

In the speech, Kennedy called on the Soviet Union to work with the United States to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty and to reduce the considerable international tensions and the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> nuclear war during that juncture of the Cold War.|$|E

25|$|Gale McGee was not {{the first}} senator to propose a summer break. In 1959 Margaret Chase Smith warned of the Senate’s {{increasing}} workload. It creates disorder, she complained, as well as “confused thinking, harmful emotions, destructive tempers, unsound and unwise legislation, and ill health with the very <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> death hanging over Members of Congress.” If that sounds dramatic, keep in mind that in the 1950s senators died in office {{at a rate of about}} two per year. Smith proposed an annual break from August to October, but the Senate ignored her words of caution.|$|E
25|$|Within days of its passage, United Aircraft and Transport Company (UATC) {{acquired}} the controlling interest of National Air Transport after a brisk but brief struggle between UATC and Clement M. Keys of NAT. The merger, begun in February 1930 {{to plug the}} only gap in UATC's cross-country network of airlines, had been amicable until three weeks before its finalization, when Keys reversed his initial approval. Ironically Brown was angered by the negotiations, worried that the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> a potential monopoly would endanger the imminent passage of the Air Mail Act. The merger swiftly created the first transcontinental airline.|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Club secured its {{national}} {{reputation in the}} battle against the Echo Park Dam in Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, which had been announced by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, This Is Dinosaur was rushed into press. Invoking the <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the Colorado River project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear weapons {{continued}} to be tested in the Cold War, especially in the earlier stages of their development. The toll on the worst-affected populations and the growth since then in understanding about the critical threat to human health posed by radioactivity {{has also been a}} prohibitive complication associated with nuclear power. Though extreme care is practiced in that industry, the potential for disaster suggested by incidents such as those at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl pose a lingering <b>specter</b> <b>of</b> public mistrust. Worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters. Widespread support for test ban treaties has ended almost all nuclear testing in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The Senate voted 72 to 23 {{to invoke}} cloture on S. 181 on January 15, 2009. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act passed the Senate, 61-36, on January 22, 2009. Those in favor {{included}} every Democratic senator (except Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who was {{absent from the}} vote because of health issues), two independents who caucused with Democrats, and five Republican senators. The Republican senators voting for the bill included all four women in their ranks: Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as well as Arlen <b>Specter</b> <b>of</b> Pennsylvania.

Crucial to this account is the notion of the uncanny—the strange, terrifying effect resulting when something familiar becomes strange. Derrida, however, neglects the Freudian meaning of the uncanny as a “return of the repressed. ” Consequently, its radical implications are lost. This logic of the uncanny, as a return of the repressed, is fundamental to both Marx' and Stirner's...|$|R
