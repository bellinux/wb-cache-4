40|$|The biofilm {{formation}} of the oral fungal pathogen Candida on denture acrylic <b>strips</b> <b>coated</b> with saliva, serum and, saliva-serum pellicle were examined in vitro using Candida albicans (four isolates), Candida glabrata (three isolates) and Candida tropicalis (three isolates). The degree of biofilm activity varied depending upon both the isolate and the pellicle. Significantly increased biofilm activity on the pellicle (particularly serum) <b>coated</b> <b>strips</b> was observed with three isolates of C. albicans and another of C. glabrata on protein-coated acrylics, with increasing concentration of serum in the pellicle. Similar trends were observed with one isolate of C. albicans and C. glabrata, although the effects of pellicles were not significant. In contrast, with all three isolates of C. tropicalis and a single isolate of C. glabrata, although the biofilm activity on the protein-free control strips {{was significantly higher than}} that of saliva- <b>coated</b> <b>strips,</b> the increase in activity of pellicle-admixed biofilm depended upon the serum concentration. Candidal biofilm formation on acrylic surfaces is essentially promoted with increasing concentration of serum in the pellicle. This suggests that inflammation in the oral environment would facilitate fungal colonization on denture acrylic. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Polyethylene oxide solution coats a metal cylinder and is distributed in several separate annular subareas.

Aggregation of these <b>stripped</b> <b>coated</b> vesicles (s-CV) is observed when they are placed under conditions that approximate the pH and ionic strength of the cell interior (pH 7. 2,, ~ 100 mM salt). This s-CV aggregation reaction is rapid (tl/ 2 ~< 0. 5 min), independent of temperature within a range of 4 - 37 ~ and unaffected by ATP, guanosine- 5 '-O-(3 -thiophosphate), and in particular EGTA, distinguishing it from Ca 2 § membrane aggregation reactions.

Both the degree of biofilm formation and the amount of hyphae exhibiting thigmotropism varied depending upon both the species and strains of Candida. Although there was no significant correlation between the amount of hyphae induced by thigmotropic reaction of fungal isolates and biofilm formation on uncoated control specimens (r = 0. 577; p < 0. 05), the ability of hyphae induced by thigmotropic reaction significantly correlated with the amount of both saliva- and serum-admixed biofilms (r = 0. 734; p < 0. 05 and r = 0. 793; p < 0. 01, respectively).

With most isolates the glucose grown yeasts demonstrated significantly more bioflim activity than the galactose grown fungi, in the presence of pellicles (ANOVA, p ≤ 0. 01 or P ≤ 0. 01). In contrast, one isolate of galactose-grown yeast elicited significantly higher biofilm activity than glucose-grown yeasts on the control strips (ANOVA, p ≤ 0. 01).

40|$|A neutron {{detection}} {{concept is}} presented {{that is based}} on superconductive niobium (Nb) <b>strips</b> <b>coated</b> by a boron (B) layer. The working principle of the detector relies on the nuclear reaction, 10 B[*]+[*]n[*]→[*]α[*]+[*] 7 Li, with α and Li ions generating a hot spot on the current-biased Nb strip which in turn induces a superconducting-normal state transition. The latter is recognized as a voltage signal which is the evidence of the incident neutron. The above described detection principle has been experimentally assessed and verified by irradiating the samples with a pulsed neutron beam at the ISIS spallation neutron source (UK). It is found that the boron <b>coated</b> superconducting <b>strips,</b> kept at a temperature T[*]=[*] 8 [*]K and current-biased below the critical current Ic, are driven into the normal state upon thermal neutron irradiation. As a result of the transition, voltage pulses in excess of 40 [*]mV are measured while the bias current can be properly modulated to bring the strip back to the superconducting state, thus resetting the detector.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} and photophysical properties of a star-shaped, novel, fluoranthene-tetraphenylethene (TFPE) conjugated luminogen, which exhibits aggregation-induced blue-shifted emission (AIBSE). The bulky fluoranthene units at the periphery prevent intramolecular rotation (IMR) of phenyl rings and induces a blueshift with enhanced emission. The AIBSE phenomenon was investigated by solvatochromic and temperature-dependent emission studies. Nanoaggregates of TFPE, formed by varying the water/THF ratio, were investigated by SEM and TEM and correlated with optical properties. The TFPE conjugate {{was found to}} be a promising fluorescent probe towards the detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs), especially for 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenol (PA) with high sensitivity and a high Stern-Volmer quenching constant. The study reveals that nanoaggregates of TFPE formed at 30 and 70 % water in THF showed unprecedented sensitivity with detection limits of 0. 8 and 0. 5 ppb, respectively. The nanoaggregates formed at water fractions of 30 and 70 % exhibit high Stern-Volmer constants (K-sv= 79998 and 51120 m(- 1), respectively) towards PA. Fluorescence quenching is ascribed to photoinduced electron transfer between TFPE and NACs with a static quenching mechanism.

This research was conducted to assess the feasibility of using Palmyrah and Bamboo strips as reinforcing material in lintels.

The percentage saturated secondary electron emission was found to increase approximately as the square of the primary ion energy, reaching 22 percent of the primary ion current, for primary ions of energies corresponding to 380 volts.
