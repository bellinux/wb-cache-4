40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is often}} strong in amphipods (Barnard 1975).

5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after <b>sexual</b> <b>maturation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with <b>sexual</b> <b>maturation,</b> such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male <b>sexual</b> <b>maturation</b> is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E

Schistosomiasis japonica, a zoonosis caused by Schistosoma japonicum, is endemic to the Philippines and China. We utilised a 22, 575 feature custom oligonucleotide DNA microarray designed from public domain databases of schistosome-expressed sequence tags to explore differential gene expression between the Philippine (SJP) and Chinese (SJC) strains of S. japonicum, and {{between male and female}} S. japonicum.

Additionally, the study revealed that 1163 male- and 1016 female-associated probes were differentially expressed in SJP whereas 1047 male- and 897 female-associated probes were differentially expressed in SJC. The study greatly expands previously published data of strain and gender-associated differential expression in S. japonicum. Further, these new data provide a stepping stone for understanding the complexities of the biology, <b>sexual</b> differentiation, <b>maturation,</b> and development of human schistosomes, signaling new approaches for identifying novel intervention and diagnostic targets against schistosomiasis...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{development of}} animals is characterised by {{the production of}} gametes, the maturation of various tissues and the expression of behaviour related to mating and birth or oviposition.

40|$|The {{biological}} action of androgens is mediated through the androgen receptor (AR).

The transcriptional activity of AR is affected by coregulators that influence a number of functional properties of AR, including ligand selectivity and DNA binding capacity. As the promoter of target genes, coregulators participate in DNA modification, either directly through modification of histones or indirectly by the recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes, as well as functioning in the recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery. Aberrant coregulator activity due to mutation or altered expression levels may be a contributing factor in the progression of diseases related to AR activity, suc...|$|R
25|$|Although {{generally}} {{considered part of}} the process of puberty, pubarche is distinct and independent of the process of maturation of the gonads that leads to <b>sexual</b> <b>maturation</b> and fertility. Pubic hair can develop from adrenal androgens alone and can develop even when the ovaries or testes are defective and nonfunctional.|$|E
25|$|Puberty occurs {{through a}} long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of {{physical}} changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them {{into a state of}} rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until <b>sexual</b> <b>maturation</b> is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early <b>sexual</b> <b>maturation</b> in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, James Hamilton {{observed}} that prepubertal castration prevents the later development of male pattern baldness in mature men.

She reported {{on a group of}} intersex children in the Caribbean who appeared sexually ambiguous at birth, and were initially raised as girls, but then grew external male genitalia and other masculine characteristic after onset of puberty. Her research group found these children shared a genetic mutation, causing deficiency of the 5α-reductase enzyme and male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which was found to have been the etiology behind abnormalities in male <b>sexual</b> development. Upon <b>maturation,</b> these individuals were observed to have smaller prostates which were underdeveloped, and were also observed to lack incidence of male pattern baldness.|$|R

25|$|Male-to-male {{competition}} {{for access to}} females and for resources that the females require {{for themselves and their}} offspring is common and can explain the morphological phenotypic traits and behaviors, such as large body size, weapons, territoriality, and early <b>sexual</b> <b>maturation</b> that increase their possibilities of gaining access to the females. In many social insects, larger males are more competitive and tend to monopolize females or the resources that they need. In bees, females may choose males who are faster, more agile, or more persistent fliers. Sequestering of females and forced copulation may also favor large male size. Males with longer horns and mandibles can use them to fight, or for take over attempts when rivals are copulating. In beetle species, the male horns can be as long as the male’s body. Early sexually mature males can start their reproductive life before the rest of the male population. Under scramble competition to inseminate females, the early matured males are smaller but can be favored in some cases where courtship occurs on the ground and attain the highest reproductive success. Thus, in the fly Drosophila suboscura, smaller males are better than large males at tracking females during the courtship dance.|$|E
25|$|Romantic {{relationships}} tend {{to increase}} in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month {{over the course of}} the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by <b>sexual</b> <b>maturation</b> and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity. While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.|$|E

The [...] specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age.
