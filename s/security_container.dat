Martin Děcký Supervisor's e-mail address: decky@ksi. mff. cuni. cz Abstract: The {{goal of this}} thesis is to design and {{implement}} <b>security</b> <b>containers</b> (contexts) for tasks and access rights mechanisms for microkernel operating systems. The access rights mechanisms implement common paradigms such as user identification, groups of users, system entities (tasks, files) ownership, user capabilities and access control lists. Moreover, the design allows to implement hierarchical security domains, where each domain is able to delegate a subset of its permissions to its subdomains. The design also enables the implementa- tion of containers, which mutually isolate those tasks, which are situated in security domains with an empty intersection. The thesis comprises of an analysis and evaluation of possible approaches, a prototype imple- mentation in HelenOS with respect to its specific properties (emphasis on a small context switch overhead, delegation of security mechanisms to privileged user space tasks, etc.) and also com- parison with implementations of <b>security</b> <b>containers</b> and access rights mechanisms in generally available operating systems.

5000|$|Scoping a safe is {{the process}} of {{drilling}} a hole and inserting a borescope into the safe to get an intimate look into a specific part of the <b>security</b> <b>container.</b> When manipulation proof mechanical locks and glass re-lockers are implemented as security measures, scoping is the most practical option. One common method is called [...] "scoping the change key hole." [...] The safecracker will drill a hole allowing him to get his scope into a position to observe the change key hole. While spinning the dial and looking through the change key hole for certain landmarks on the combination lock's wheel pack, it is possible to obtain the combination and then dial open the safe with the correct combination. This method is common for a professional safe specialist because it leaves the lock in good working order and only simple repairs are needed to bring the safe barrier back to its original condition. It is also a common way to bypass difficult hard plates and glass re-lockers since the change key hole can be scoped by drilling the top, side, or back of the container.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, <b>container</b> <b>security</b> at nodes in the {{international}} supply chains such as inland dry ports {{has become a major}} concern on {{the international}} maritime agenda. If security measures and initiatives are not carefully designed and effectively implemented, they can negatively impact the entire maritime transport chain. Yet, there are limited studies conducted on this subject. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by devising a framework for measuring the quality of <b>container</b> <b>security</b> at dry ports by conducting an empirical study to verify the quality of <b>container</b> <b>security</b> at 26 Indian dry ports. The study was conducted by using the triangulation of both mail survey and in-depth interview techniques. It was evident from this study that the standards of <b>container</b> <b>security</b> at the said dry ports left much to be desired. The paper also analyses the reasons for such abysmal level of <b>container</b> <b>security</b> at the dry ports. Statistical analysis employed in this paper reveal that there is a clear consensus amongst all the respondents that quality of <b>container</b> <b>security</b> at dry ports is a construct consisting of five dimensions, namely, equipment, personnel, policy and planning, drills and training, and security audit. In the context of Indian dry ports, the quality gaps of <b>container</b> <b>security</b> service are currently related to policy and planning, as well as security equipment. The paper also argues that the positive outcomes of <b>container</b> <b>security</b> at dry ports could be realized only if the dry ports employ effective container secwity management stmtegies. Finally, academic and manage 1 ial implications are explained and future research directions along this research area will be outlined...|$|R

With the aim {{of improving}} the <b>security</b> for shipping <b>containers</b> used in a global supply chain, the Department of Homeland Security is developing the technical requirements for an open <b>Container</b> <b>Security</b> System communications interface. The primary purpose of this system is to monitor the status of shipping containers equipped with electronic chain of custody devices, and channel this information to a secure data consolidation server. This application is intended to integrate with and extend the functionality of the Department of Homeland <b>Security's</b> Advance <b>Container</b> <b>Security</b> System. By replicating most of the functionality provided by a Data Consolidation Server, a handheld unit {{can be used to}} provide users with a secure and convenient method to wirelessly monitor and control the status of the <b>container</b> <b>security</b> devices in the area. Once a user has obtained the necessary security keys to enable wireless communication with the security devices, the handheld unit will then join an existing IEEE 802. 15. 4 wireless network and permit the secure exchange of information between itself and the security devices.

They {{are appropriate for}} many usage scenarios, but there are scenarios that require system virtualization with high degrees of both isolation and efficiency. Examples include HPC clusters, the Grid, hosting centers, and PlanetLab. We present an alternative to hypervisors that is better suited to such scenarios. The approach is a synthesis of prior work on resource <b>containers</b> and <b>security</b> <b>containers</b> applied to general-purpose, time-shared operating systems. Examples of such container-based systems include Solaris 10, Virtuozzo for Linux, and Linux-VServer. As a representative instance of container-based systems, this paper describes the design and implementation of Linux-VServer. In addition, it contrasts the architecture of Linux-VServer with current generations of Xen, and shows how Linux-VServer provides comparable support for isolation and superior system efficiency. ...|$|R
