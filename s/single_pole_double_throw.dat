Firstly alternative teaching method, known as inductive teaching, are presented. Theirs propertis and hystorical development are described. Here discovery learning method, its features, design and its theory foundations is emphasized. This is followed by primary school engineering education (also physics) ccurricula, relative textbooks and other literature that suggests the use of inductive teaching methods and the discovery learning method in Slovenia and abroad overviewed.
