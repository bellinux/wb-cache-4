50|$|Human gastrodiscoidiasis is endemic in Assam, and to {{a lesser}} extent in Philippines. Highest {{incidence}} so far recorded is among children in Kamrup district of Assam, where prevalence was as high as 41%. First described from an Indian patient, it was initially believed to have a distribution restricted to India and the southeast Asia. However, investigations reveal that it is widespread, and are further spread by infected persons to other parts of the world, such as Guyana. Level of infection in laboratory animals can be very high among Asian mammals. Regions of high incidence can be attributed to low <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanitation,</b> such as rural farms and villages where night soils are used. Infection in both human and animals is most common through the ingestion of vegetation found in contaminated water. It is also assumed that transmission is from infected fish that is under-cooked or eaten in raw, as common among southeast Asian. There is a unique case report of a seven-year-old Nigerian who showed symptoms of malnutrition and anaemia and was eventually diagnosed with infections of G. hominis and Ascaris lumbricoides. The child quickly recovered after proper medication.|$|R
50|$|An El Tor {{infection}} is relatively mild, {{or at least}} rarely fatal, and patients are asymptomatic for about a week. El Tor is able {{to survive in the}} body longer than classical cholera vibrios. This characteristic allows carriers to infect a greater population of people. In fact, V. cholerae biotype eltor can be isolated from water sources {{in the absence of an}} outbreak of cases. In extreme cases, persons can become long-term carriers; for example, Cholera Dolores, who tested vibrio positive nine years after her primary infection. El Tor is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. This route is the consequence of infected persons defecating near a water source, and uninfected persons consuming contaminated water. In addition, the bacteria can be transmitted by consuming uncooked food fertilized with human feces. Treatment of a cholera infection consists of replenishing lost fluid and electrolytes by intravenous or oral solutions, and by antibiotics. El Tor outbreaks can be prevented by better <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanitation,</b> filtering and boiling water, thoroughly cooking seafood, and washing vegetables and fruits before consumption.|$|E

The safety of sludge, however, is questioned by some individuals and groups. Specifically, the risk of infectious agents and toxins to workers or other exposed individuals, and the potential for heavy metals and organic chemicals to be transferred from sludge-treated fields into crops are concerns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Greaves “delayed infection” {{hypothesis}} {{suggested that}} Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in children {{is caused by}} a lack of exposure to infection in infancy, which may be due higher <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanitation.</b> We have conducted an ecologic analysis of the relationship between sanitation, using Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) as the marker, and the incidence of childhood ALL in 127 cancer registries from 28 countries. Results There were inverse associations between H. pylori prevalence and ALL incidence rates in children. These associations were minor and only significant for ALL incidence rates for all cancer registries. They became non-significant and smaller in magnitude when the population source and/or the GNP per capita were added to the relationship. Furthermore, these results were unchanged when the associations were examined using the Generalized Estimating Equations. Conclusions Although the findings showed lower prevalence of H. pylori and improved sanitation is associated with increased incidence of childhood ALL, they do not conclusively support Greaves “delayed infection” hypothesis. </p...|$|E

H pylori seroprevalence is common in populations with poor <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanitation</b> and hygiene. Methods A two-stage cluster sampling technique was employed to draw the required sample.

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} {{sustainable}} energy systems based on solar and biomass technologies to provide solutions to utility challenges in Nigeria and acute water shortage both in rural and urban areas of that country. The paper highlights the paradoxes of oil-rich Nigeria and the stark reality of social infrastructure deprivations in that country. Perennial power outages over many years have translated {{to the absence of}} or poorly-developed basic social infrastructures in Nigeria. The consequences of this lack have been an increase in abject poverty in rural and urban communities as well as the erosion of social order and threats to citizen and their property. This paper proposes the adaptation of two emerging technologies for building sustainable energy systems and the development of decentralized and sustainable energy sources as catalyst for much-needed social infrastructure development through the creation of Renewable Energy Business Incubators, creative lending strategies, NGO partnerships and shifting energy-distribution responsibilities. These changes will stimulate grassroots economies in the country, develop large quantities of much needed clean water, maintain acceptable <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanitation</b> and improve the health and wellbeing of Nigerian communities. The proposed strategies are specific to the Nigerian context; however, the authors suggest that the same or similar strategies may provide energy and social infrastructure development solutions to other developing countries as well. sustainable energy; social infrastructure; solar energy; bio-energy; OPEC; NGO; Renewable Energy Business Incubators...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection {{is high in}} developing countries, in which low <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanitation</b> promote the transmission of the virus. In Latin America, which is considered an area of high HAV endemicity, most HAV-positive individuals are infected in early childhood. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that prevalence rates are decreasing. Herein, we review the data on HAV prevalence and outbreaks available in scien-tific databases. We also use official government data in order to evaluate mortality rates in Brazil over the last two decades. Studies conducted in the northernmost regions of Brazil have indicated that, although improved hygiene has led to a reduction in childhood exposure to HAV, the greatest exposure still occurs early in life. In the Southeast-ern region, the persistence of circulating HAV has generated outbreaks among individuals of low socioeconomic status, despite adequate sanitation. Nationwide, hepatitis A mortality rates declined progressively from 1980 to 2002. During that period, mortality rates in the Northern region consistently exceeded the mean national rate and those for other regions. Excluding the North, the rates in all regions were comparable. Nevertheless, the trend toward decline observed in the South was paralleled by a similar trend in the North.

A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey {{was carried out in}} a population of 3205 individuals belonging to 498 families from five villages in the Poyang Lake region, Jiangxi Province, China, to assess their helminth infection status and to collect information on risk factors for infection. The prevalences for Ascaris lumbricoides, Schistosoma japonicum and Trichuris trichiura were 30. 9 %, 15. 7 % and 47 %, respectively. Hookworm infection prevalence was low (0. 7 %). A significant association was observed between A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infection, and also between S. japonicum and T. trichiura infection. Variance components analysis was undertaken to investigate the aggregation of S. japonicum and the soil-transmitted helminths, A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. While A. lumbricoides was found to aggregate only at a household level, T. trichiura was shown to cluster predominantly in families. Both genetic and household effects were found to be important in determining the risk of infection with S. japonicum. Variance components analysis for A. lumbricoides/T. trichiura co-infections indicated a significant domestic environmental effect, attributable for 32. 7 % of the co-infection risk. Aggregation of S. japonicum/T. trichiura co-infection was also observed at a household level. The risk of infection with multiple helminth species, although mainly environmentally influenced, was also shown to have significant involvement of genetic and household components. The results {{of this study indicate that}} a shared household is a major contributing risk factor for helminth co-infections and emphasises the need for increased <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanitation</b> and hygiene to prevent parasite transmission. Further, the results suggest that susceptibility to one helminth infection is not completely independent of another, and that there exist common genetic factors underlying infection with multiple helminth species...|$|E
30|$|Within {{disaster}} management, {{a controversial}} {{matter is the}} risk of epidemics (Lopez-Carresi 2014). After the Bam earthquake, anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) or simply leishmaniases reached an epidemic stage. Massive destruction of houses, huge amounts of rubbles, dramatic alterations of the landscape, expansion {{of the city in}} the unhabituated areas, rapid changes in Bam demography, and poor sanitation conditions created favorable conditions for the propagation of sand-fly vector and transmission of ACL (Sharifi et al. 2011). The lesson concerned the disaster planning and preparedness in order to combat the outbreak of such diseases. The Iranian National Center for Disease Control prepared and implemented a national control program that targeted the improvement of diseases control strategies within the country. This program started in Bam and Kerman Province in 2006, three years after the earthquake (Sharifi et al. 2011). De Ville de Goyet (2007) highlighted also that in order to control the outbreak of various diseases after disasters, one of the first priorities has to be ensuring the function of sanitation services and the access to clean water. A rapid access to minimum <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanitation,</b> toilets, and showers {{is a part of the}} biological needs that is often overlooked after an earthquake disaster. After the earthquake in Bam, health and the environmental conditions were affected by the shortage of drinking water, toilets, showers, waste collection and disposal, and more (Tierney et al. 2005). The lesson brought to attention that local materials and human resources of Bam needed to be involved in the repair and construction of sanitation services, such as toilets and showers (Pinera et al. 2005). The implementation of this lesson affected positively the well-being of survivors and their health. Bathrooms were shared, maintained, and cleaned among families who knew each other well. Moreover, the rapid access to water was required by beliefs and cultural traditions; various categories of Nages (uncleaned or untouchable) required purification and ablutions need to be performed before daily prayers (Ibrion et al. 2015 b). After the 2013 Shonbeh-Bushehr earthquake, sanitation points and toilets were immediately installed in affected areas, but because they were not equipped with access to water, they cannot be used and survivors continued to use their own damaged places (IIEES 2013).|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study investigates the impact <b>of</b> seasonality on <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> water and <b>sanitation</b> in the mountainous district of Humla, Nepal. The research considers impact on two levels: community level access and service delivery. First of all, it examines annual variation in village level access to water and sanitation. Secondly, it looks at the wider picture of service delivery and considers how seasonal variations present opportunities and challenges for improvement in standards for water and sanitation. Three case studies from Humla are presented which illustrate village level access to water and sanitation over a calendar year. These case studies summarise the content of 45 semi-structured interviews, 9 focus group discussions and 9 months of observational work in the district. Variations in weather, village population, infrastructure functionality, and environmental conditions are found to influence the experienced levels of access to water and sanitation at any given time. The impact of seasonality on service delivery was investigated via 39 key informant interviews. Both climatic (e. g. weather) and non-climatic (e. g. budget timings) sources of seasonality are found to impact programme implementation. The mismatch of local seasonal calendars and those imposed by central hubs is found to cause particular difficultly in effective delivery <b>of</b> water and <b>sanitation</b> services. The findings of this research have theoretical, methodological and practical implications. Theoretically, {{it is suggested that}} a mountain community s level of access to water and sanitation varies considerably {{over the course of a}} calendar year to the point where it needs to be considered if on the ground standards are to be improved. Methodological guidance is provided detailing means of investigating seasonality and its impact on <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> water and <b>sanitation</b> in other scenarios. Practical suggestions focus on incorporating seasonality into assessments of access to water and sanitation and programme delivery in mountain communities...|$|R
