40|$|Abstract. There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} design and funding of European pension systems. While many commentators emphasise the financial burden of underfunded European social security systems, less understood are the structure and performance of European <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions.</b> We introduce readers to the Dutch system of funded <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions,</b> focusing upon the governance structure of those pension funds in the context of European competition policy. From the early 1950 s the Dutch government has encouraged the development of employer-sponsored and industry-wide <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions</b> covering most employed Dutch workers. As the government has slowly discounted the real value of social security, <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions</b> have come to play an increasingly important role in maintaining high levels of income replacement upon retirement. From the perspective of Anglo-American competition policy, these pension institutions appear unusual. In many instances, firms are required to participate in sector schemes, denying them the right to make separate arrangements with competing financial institutions. Moreover, many sector schemes are mutually owned financial conglomerates selling services to captive internal markets. Referencing the decision of the European Court of Justice in Maatschappij Drijvende Bokken BV we assess the arguments for and against this model of pension provision in the light of European competition policy and the geography of finance. While we are sympathetic to the goals of social solidarity, the underlying structure of governance combines the risks of moral hazard with limited transparency and accountability...|$|R

The systems have mainly been based on public pay-as-you-go plans but as the systems have become mature they have increase the fiscal burden of nations and become a inadequate device for financial insurance for the old. Consequently, almost all the European countries will need either to prefund their retirement liabilities or reform their retirement systems to reduce or restrict benefits. The EU Green Paper on <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions</b> suggests that development of funded pensions in the Member States could reduce the threat to pension benefits by encouraging prefunding.

It is demonstrated that the size of the welfare gains varies significantly between alternative funding strategies. A nonindividualized funding strategy characterized by increased government asset accumulation triggers considerable welfare gains through increased asset returns in the future. Even larger welfare gains may be realized by an individual funding strategy characterized by increased asset accumulation accompanied by an adoption of actuarial <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions</b> (i. e. actuarial <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions</b> combined with a fixed minimum pension) which reduces future tax distortions drastically. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Basic public {{pension schemes}} and cut backs in {{earnings-related}} public pensions {{led to an}} increasing role of <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions</b> such as pension funds for old-age incomes. In addition to demographic changes that challenge public pensions, private pensions face financial market risks. To what extent are the scope of pension fund capitalism {{and the impact of}} financial crises on pension funds related to different institutional arrangements? Given that different production regimes reflect different pension systems, we expect systematic diversities with regard to the public-private pension mix and the specific design of <b>supplementary</b> <b>pensions.</b> These varieties should be mirrored in different forms of vulnerability of pension funds tofinancial market crises. We hypothesize a higher scope of pension fund capitalism and vulnerability to financial market crises in countries with predominant market-based coordination mechanisms and short term strategies on financial markets (i. e.

5000|$|Albany International BV, a Dutch company, {{claimed that}} it should not be bound by a {{collective}} agreement to remain with a collective pension fund, as it alleged it was an [...] "undertaking" [...] that restricted competition. Albany BV was obliged by Dutch law to join a <b>supplementary</b> <b>pension</b> fund for workers within its industrial sector. Albany was in the industry pension (Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds Textielindustrie) since 1975. In 1981 it decided the pension was not generous enough. Albany BV entered into an arrangement providing enhanced benefits for its employees with an insurer. In 1989, the basis on which benefits under the compulsory scheme were paid out was improved, making it comparable with Albany’s private arrangement. Albany therefore applied to be exempted from affiliation to the fund. The fund refused Albany’s application and refused to follow the advice of the Insurance Board, requiring it to grant an exemption. The national court adopted the Board’s decision, but stayed proceedings pending a reference to the ECJ on whether the Fund was an undertaking within the meaning of the EC Treaty article 85 (now TFEU article 101), article 86 (now TFEU article 102) and article 90 (now TFEU article 106). If so, it also asked whether compulsory fund membership nullified the effectiveness of competition rules applicable to undertakings, and if not, whether there were circumstances which could render compulsory membership incompatible with article 90.|$|E

However, despite the remarkable improvements made by anti-discrimination law, in terms of protection there seems to be a vacuum which still needs to be filled.

5000|$|In Case E-8/00 Landsorganisasjonen (commonly {{referred}} to as ‘LO’) the EFTA Court had to provide an Advisory Opinion. The issue before the national court was whether a number of Norwegian municipalities had breached certain provisions of the Basic Collective Agreement for Municipalities when they transferred their occupational pension insurance scheme from one supplier, KLP, a private mutual life insurance company wholly owned {{by members of the}} Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities, to other insurance companies. The municipalities submitted that several provisions in the Basic Collective Agreement were void because they infringed Articles 53 and 54 EEA, the provisions mirroring Articles 81 and 82 EC. The contested provisions stated, inter alia, that {{in the event of a}} change of the pension company, this should be discussed with union representatives; that before the decision-making body might begin to deal with a possible change of company relevant offers for a new occupational pension scheme should be put before those members of the pension committee who represent the parties to the collective agreement; that the occupational pension scheme had to be based on a financing system that is gender-neutral and does not have the effect of excluding older employees; that before the matter might be decided upon by the municipality there had to be approval from the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund; and that the pension scheme had to be taken note of by the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission. The EFTA Court found that the relationship between the national law of collective bargaining and the EEA competition rules must be assessed by applying the test established by the ECJ in Case C-67/96 Albany and in related cases. It concluded that on that basis, the contested provisions would prima facie fall outside the scope of Article 53 EEA. If, however, the national court found that the contested provisions do not pursue their purported objectives, the provisions, in light of the objectives actually pursued, fall within the scope of Article 53 EEA. If so, and if the national court found that these provisions in effect required the municipalities to obtain <b>supplementary</b> <b>pension</b> insurance services from specific insurers, thus excluding, or severely limiting, their possibility of selecting other qualified service providers, these provisions were also held capable of constituting a restriction of competition within the meaning of Article 53 EEA. The Court held that, in any case, the good faith of the parties in concluding and implementing a collective agreement must also be taken into account. When examining the several elements of a collective agreement, the national court must consider their aggregate effect. Whether an agreement restricts competition, and thereby infringes Article 53 EEA, is a legal question that must be examined in light of economic considerations. The EFTA Court found furthermore that Article 54 EEA may apply if the national court were to find that the supplier of the occupational pension scheme, KLP, enjoyed a dominant position in the relevant market, that an identification might be made between the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities and the supplier, and that their conduct in relation to the conclusion or the implementation of the contested provisions of the Basic Collective Agreement had in practice prevented transfers of <b>supplementary</b> <b>pension</b> insurance schemes from KLP to other insurance companies, in order to protect the position of KLP.|$|E

The Rent (Agricultural) Act 1976 provided security of tenure for agricultural workers in tied accommodation, while the Bail Act 1976 reformed bail conditions with courts having to explain refusal of bail. The Police Act 1976 set up a Police Complaints Board [...] "to formalise the procedure for dealing with public complaints." [...] The Education Act 1976 limited the taking up of independent and Direct grant school places and required all local authorities who had failed to do so [...] "to submit proposals for comprehensive schools," [...] while the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 extended local council responsibility [...] "to provide accommodation for homeless people in their area," [...] and instituted the right of homeless families to a permanent local council tenancy. In addition, efforts were made under the Environment Secretary Peter Shore to redistribute resources toward deprived urban areas. The Inner Urban Areas Act 1978 allowed local authorities to assist declining industrial areas and central government provided new subsidies to those inner city areas with the most problems, while the 1978 Finance Act introduced profit-sharing schemes.
