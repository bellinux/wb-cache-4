5000|$|While {{the shows}} {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic had much in common they {{differed}} in two important ways. First, the American shows tended to be larger, with seven operators and over thirty projectors not being exceptional. In contrast, the shows in England seldom had more than three operators and ten or so projectors. Second, American shows were generally built around the overhead projector with the liquids in large clock cover glasses. Shows in England and Europe, in contrast, used modified 2" [...] sq. slide projectors which had their Dichroic heat filters (one or both) removed and employed two layers of <b>slide</b> <b>cover</b> glasses with two liquids (oil and water based, in the early days) between each layer. Alternatively different coloured water based dyes were used in each layer, which slowly boiled producing pulsing vapour bubbles when exposed to the heat of the projector lamp with the heat filters removed. Consequently randomly pulsing and moving blobs of colour were projected on the screen creating the light show. Before the projected layers totally dried out a new slide would be switched in the projector slide holder, meanwhile the old glass would be removed, cleaned and refurbished with new dyes and the projection process would continue. The surface tension of the liquids largely retained the mixtures between the glass slides, but the process was nevertheless very messy indeed and operators had their hands almost permanently stained by the dyes. A popular choice of colored liquids for light shows was Flo-Master ink, a product developed for use in permanent marker pens. While this ink was very vivid it also had the problem of staining the operator's hands very deeply.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of the optical constants of absorbing films, particularly on opaque substrates, is a difficult problem when solely using spectroscopic ellipsometry. First, unwanted backside reflections are incoherent with the desired reflection from the front side, which makes the fitting of optical constants difficult. Second, the optical constants of substrate must be carefully characterized in advance, as any small absorption in the substrate would be mixed into the film's overall optical constants. Third, thickness and optical constants are strongly correlated with each other, which may prevent a unique solution for absorbing films. For the above reasons, quartz, glass <b>slide,</b> <b>cover</b> glass and float glass substrates are studied. Backside reflections of the substrates are suppressed by index matching technique.

The refractive index and extinction coefficient of the substrate are fitted by ellipsometric psi data and the normal spectral transmittance T- 0. The results are consistent with the literature reported.

The instrument automates the {{fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test}} for syphilis {{to the extent}} that only 4 hr of technician time is required to conduct approximately 200 tests daily. Evaluation to date suggests its efficacy. In addition, preliminary studies indicate the feasibility of detecting antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium malariae, and nucleoprotein (antinuclear factor). The instrument would seem to have broad application for routine and research immunofluorescence testing. Two elements comprise the instrument: a slide processor and a microscope attachment. The slide processor is an electro-pneumatically actuated device which automatically feeds special laboratory slides, on which antigen or other reagents are prefixed, through a series of operations which provide reagent application, incubation, washing, drying, and stacking of the finished slides for readout. The instrument provides flexibility in that incubation time and temperature as well as point, sequence, and duration of reagent application can be varied to accommodate a variety of immunofluorescence techniques. The microscope attachment can be fitted to all conventional dark-field fluorescence microscopes and makes possible the reading of three to six slides per minute. The reacted slides from the processor are injected sequentially onto the stage of the microscope by movement of a lever. As injected, slides are automatically in visual focus; fine focus is occasionally required. Scanning of the reacted field is accomplished by means of the normal microscope controls.

[...] The polycrystalline InN thin-films were grown between 200 and 570 °C on various types of substrates, including c-plane sapphire, n-type silicon, gallium nitride template, borosilicate glass, Schott glass, and cover glass (microscope glass <b>slide</b> <b>cover</b> slip). Trimethylindium and nitrogen gas were used as the precursors for indium and nitrogen, respectively. Nitrogen gas was also used as the carrier gas for the indium precursor vapour. Reactive nitrogen radicals were produced by a remote nitrogen-plasma discharge, which was induced by a microwave electromagnetic field with a frequency of 2. 45 GHz. [...] A comprehensive range of sample characterisation analyses was conducted. The sample optical properties were examined by optical transmission measurements. The electronic characteristics were determined by Hall effect measurements. The physical and morphological characteristics were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron-backscattered diffraction (EBSD). Compositional characterisation was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron-induced X-ray emission spectrometry (LEXES), elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA), and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). Finally, electronic structure characterisation was performed using synchrotron soft X-ray absorption (SXA) and soft X-ray emission (SXE) techniques. [...] The research outcomes are presented in six parts and include eleven publication works, which were either published or submitted for publication. [...] The growth kinetics of these polycrystalline InN thin-films {{were found to be}} sensitive to the growth conditions used, indicating a reaction limited process. This resulted in a regime where the thin-film characteristics had a strong dependency on growth temperature. The measured apparent band-gap was between ~ 0. 9 and ~ 2. 3 eV. This phenomenon was hypothesised to originate from the combined effects of changes in the In-N bonding characteristics and the presence of an increased free electron density in the material. The InN films with apparent band-gaps ~ 1. 8 eV were suggested to have a more covalent-like bonding characteristic. Thus, they should be treated as two different electronic materials.

40|$|Authors: Elliott Hagedorn & David Sherwood ### Abstract Green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) {{and other}} genetically encoded fluorescent proteins {{provide a means}} to study gene expression pattern and protein localization in living tissues. Recently discovered GFP-like fluorophores and engineered variants have further expanded the fluorescent protein toolkit for in vivo imaging. Here we describe a technique using transgenic C. elegans that contain laminin or type IV collagen fused to the green-to-red photoconvertible fluorophore Dendra 2, to track {{the fate of the}} basement membrane. The following protocol will allow researchers to optically highlight individual basement membrane components during developmental processes, tissue homeostasis, and aging. ### Introduction Genetically encoded fluorescent proteins provide a powerful means to determine gene expression patterns and localize dynamic molecular changes in living cells, eliminating the need for fixation with antibody or in situ staining procedures [1]. The usefulness of fluorescent proteins as experimental reagents in living tissues was first recognized when the green fluorescent protein (GFP), cloned from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria [2], was expressed in the nematode *C. elegans* [3]. These nematode worms harbored a genetic construct encoding a protein fused in frame with the gene encoding GFP, allowing that protein to be visualized in living worms [3]. Since then, numerous additional GFP or GFP-like fluorescent proteins have been discovered or engineered including spectral variants [4], and fluorophores that can be photoactivated (i. e., from a non-fluorescent state to a fluorescent state) [5], photoconverted (e. g., from green to red fluorescence) [6], or work as fluorescent timers (switching from green to red after a set period of time) [7]. Dendra 2, a mutated variant of Dendra–the fluorophore derived from octocoral Dendronephthya sp., is a highly stable photoconvertible fluorophore that switches its fluorescence state upon brief exposure to short wavelength light (e. g., 405 nm) [8]. Dendra 2 initially fluoresces green under blue light (similar to GFP), however, a brief exposure of short wavelength light induces an irreversible conformational change in Dendra 2 and it thereafter fluoresces red under green light. When tagged to a protein of interest, Dendra 2 allows real-time tracking of the spatial position of a cell, organelle, or a subset of protein molecules and their dynamics (i. e., half-lives and replacement by nonactivated protein) [9] {{over an extended period of}} time, in a manner analogous to a pulse-chase radioactive labeling experiment. Here we present a protocol for Dendra 2 photoconversion (also referred to as Optical Highlighting) that allows monitoring of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the two major structural components of basement membranes (BMs), laminin and type IV collagen, in *C. elegans*. BMs are the dense, sheet-like forms of extracellular matrix that provide structural underpinning for epithelia and endothelia and regulate diverse functions in the cells that adhere to them [10, 11]. Built of as many as 50 distinct molecules ordered in specific and complex arrangements, BMs cannot be synthesized in vitro and can thus only be fully studied in their native form [11]. The BM in *C. elegans* is highly conserved and is composed of all the major structural components found in vertebrate BM, including type IV collagen, laminin, perlecan, and nidogen [12]. Further, BM components can be easily tagged with GFP and visualized in living animals. The powerful genetic and molecular tools available in C. elegans provide a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms that regulate BM assembly and turnover. The following protocol can be used to photoconvert a region of laminin or type IV collagen within the BM of a worm at any developmental stage and then track the fate of the optically highlighted protein for up to several hours. This protocol should enable, for example, analysis of the half-lives of BM components or the fate of the BM during developmental processes, tissue homeostasis, and aging. ### Reagents 1. Dendra 2 transgenic C. elegans strains* - laminin::Dendra: NK 651 qyIs 108 [lam- 1 ::Dendra]; NK 652 qyIs 109 [lam- 1 ::Dendra] - type IV collagen::Dendra: NK 860 qyIs 161 [emb- 9 ::Dendra] - Dendra 2 DNA sequence [8] was engineered to contain C. elegans codon usage [13] and three synthetic introns (sequence is available upon request). Dendra 2 fusion constructs were made by inserting the *C. elegans* modified Dendra 2 into the mluI site of pGK 39 (laminin::GFP) and the Msc 1 and BsrG 1 sites of pJK 750 (type IV collagen::mCherry). Constructs were injected and integrated strains made as described previously [14]. ### Equipment 1. Standard equipment and reagents for culturing and working with *C. elegans* [15]. - 5 % Nobel agar containing 0. 01 M sodium azide (NaN 3; used as an aesthetic to immobilize worms for imaging) CAUTION––NaN 3 is TOXIC––WEAR GLOVES. - Standard microscope slides and coverslips. - Dissecting stereoscope to use for standard worm work (e. g., Zeiss, Leica, Nikon, Olympus, etc. for this and the following microscopes). - Laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with 405 nm laser for photoconversion. (488 nm light has also been reported to work well and is less phototoxic [8]). - Additional wide field fluorescence microscope or spinning disc confocal equipped with a digital camera (optional). - Image analysis software (such as Image J 1. 40 g) for quantitative measurements of changes in fluorescence intensity or position of optically highlighted BM (optional). ### Procedure **Step 1. Mount Worms on Agar Pad** (Timing ~ 2 min) Mount transgenic worms (laminin::Dendra or type IV collagen::Dendra) of appropriate developmental stage by picking worms into a 1. 5 µl drop of M 9 on a 5 % noble agar pad [with 0. 01 M of the anesthetic sodium azide (NaN 3) ] atop a standard microscope <b>slide.</b> <b>Cover</b> with standard glass coverslip and proceed to step 2. Helpful Suggestion: If examining a specific developmental stage, it may be beneficial to perform synchronized L 1 stage larval plating, which facilitates picking the appropriate developmental stage. **Step 2. Photoconversion using a 405 nm Ultra Violet (UV) Laser** (Timing ~ 5 - 10 min) Using a laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63 X or 100 X objective, acquire an image of the worm you wish to photoconvert. Next, photoconvert a region(s) of BM using a customizable region of interest (ROI) bleaching tool within your laser scanning confocal acquisition software. For our studies of the uterine-vulval BM in the late L 3 stage of hemaphrodite development, the optimal photoconversion was achieved using the 405 nm laser at 1 - 2 % power, and a high number (100 - 200) of iterations (See Figure 1 for laminin::Dendra and Figure 2 for type IV collagen::Dendra). Depending on your experimental design, you should be able to photconvert several regions within the same animal or a few worms per slide. When photoconverting several worms per slide it may be useful to carefully mark particular worms so that you can easily keep track of them when moving between microscopes. If working on an inverted microscope, this can be done with a marker on the underneath side of the microscope slide (opposite the coverslip). Troubleshooting: You may need to adjust the laser power or the number of iterations to optimize photoconversion of the BM in your context. Troubleshooting: Using the laser scanning confocal, if there is BM above and below the focal plane, some Dendra 2 will become photoconverted and may give undesirable results or interfere with experimental analysis. Reducing the pinhole size on the confocal can minimize this problem. Troubleshooting: Complete this and the following step as quickly as possible in order for the worms to remain healthy. If the worms are on the NaN 3 pad for longer than 15 - 20 min., they will likely not survive. After performing the procedure a few times, you will become familiar with the protocol and more efficient with your time. **Step 3. Image Worms Immediately following Photoconversion** (Timing ~ 2 min) If appropriate for your experiment, image worms on a wide field fluorescence microscope or spinning disc confocal. Be sure to use the same image acquisition settings (i. e, laser power, exposure, gain, binning, etc.), if you plan to do quantitative measurements amongst different images. Troubleshooting: Though sufficient, the signal from the photoconverted BM may be relatively weak (more so with type IV collagen::Dendra). If your experimental design requires you to image the worm at multiple time points or to acquire z-stacks, it would be best to use a spinning disc confocal, which uses less light than the laser scanning confocal. **Step 4. Recover Worms to Food Plates** (Timing ~ 1 min) Recover worms by sliding coverslip back and picking (with a glob of OP 50) or using a mouth pipette and M 9 to transfer animals to food (OP 50 E. coli) plates for the necessary amount a time at the appropriate temperature (e. g., 15 ˚, 20 ˚, or 25 ˚C). For example, your experimental design might require L 3 larval stage worms to develop for 4 hours at 25 ˚C before you reexamine them. **Step 5. Mount Worms and Reimage** (Timing ~ 5 - 10 min) If appropriate, mount worms on new noble agar pad with 0. 01 M NaN 3 and reimage. Image analysis softwares (e. g., NIH ImageJ, Imaris by Bitplane, or Volocity by Improvision) can be used to quantify changes in the position or fluorescence intensities of regions of photoconverted BM in 3 D, over time. As a reminder, if taking quantitative measurements, it will be important to ensure that image acquisition setting (e. g., exposure, gain, laser power, binning, etc.) are maintained between imaging sessions or experiments. ### Timing The photoconversion techniques associated with this protocol are rapid ~ 15 min. total time. See procedures for the time required for each step. Additional time may be required for your experimental design, for example, you might need to stage the worms several hours beforehand, or require a long time interval between photoconversion (Step 2) and reimaging at a later time point (Step 5). ### Troubleshooting **Step 2 **: Troubleshooting: You may need to adjust the laser power or the number of iterations to optimize photoconversion of the BM in your context. Troubleshooting: Using the laser scanning confocal, if there is BM above and below the focal plane, some Dendra 2 will become photoconverted and may give undesirable results or interfere with experimental analysis. Reducing the pinhole size on the confocal can minimize this. Troubleshooting: You will want to complete this and the following step as quickly as possible in order for the worms to remain healthy. If the worms are on the NaN 3 pad for longer than 15 - 20 min., they will likely become sick. After performing the procedure a few times, you will become familiar with the protocol and more efficient with your time. **Step 3 **: Troubleshooting: Though sufficient, the signal from the photoconverted BM may be relatively weak (more so with type IV collagen::Dendra). If your experimental design requires you to image the worm at multiple time points or to acquire z-stacks, it would be best to use a spinning disc confocal, which uses less light than the laser scanning confocal. ### References 1.

Hildebrandt ### Abstract Pre-determining fetal sex {{is against}} the random, equal {{opportunity}} both conceptus sexes have by nature. Yet, under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, populations shift their birth sex ratio from the expected unity. The prevailing assumption has been that males produce approximately equal numbers of X and Y chromosome bearing spermatozoa in large quantities and that they have no say in this regard. However, males {{seem to be able to}} manipulate the sex ratio of their ejaculates. Here we describe a protocol for fluorescence in situ hybridisation that can help evaluate the ratio between spermatozoa carrying either of the two sex chromosomes in the ejaculate, and determine the male’s contribution to the sexual conflict. We also discuss the benefits and shortcomings of the technique. The protocol can be completed within 31 h, 20 of which are hybridisation time. Although this protocol has been devised for the pygmy hippopotamus (*Choeropsis liberiensis*), with minor modifications and a change of probes it can be adapted to other species as well. ### Introduction The endangered pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis), an endemic species to freshwater systems and forests of West Africa in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Liberia, resembles the common hippopotamus but is much smaller in size. It is a long-lived, solitary species where the sexes only meet for mating and where males defend territories, sometimes in fierce fights with competing males, which may have fatal consequences (1). While little is known about their reproduction in the wild, the captive population reproduces well. In the captive population, offspring sex ratio is shifted towards an excess of females – at birth only 42. 5 % of offspring were reported to be males (2). The cause of this shift and the mechanism by which it is achieved are unknown. Noting the difference between the sexes in terms of investment in offspring and the benefits gained thereby, it has been assumed that owing to its usually much larger investment, the female has considerably more to win or lose and if mechanisms to bias offspring sex ratios do exist, they would be operated by the female (3). Hence, both empirical and theoretical work has traditionally concentrated on the female and dismissed any potential paternal contribution as minor and irrelevant. There is only a very limited body of literature that has actually evaluated the contribution of males to the determination of offspring sex. Most available studies, conducted on samples from domestic boar (4), domestic cattle (4 - 8) or humans (9 - 11), used inaccurate evaluation techniques such as fluorescence staining of the F-body or PCR amplification on pooled semen samples. A positive correlation between the ratio in the ejaculate and the birth sex ratio was found in those few studies which evaluated both parameters (6, 10, 11). The few studies that were based on the more accurate fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) evaluation technique (12 - 14) either suffered from a considerably smaller sample size compared to their control (176 samples compared to the pooled national data on birth sex ratio from several European countries and the USA) and counted too few cells to detect a deviation from an even sex ratio (only 200 cells per ejaculate) (12), dealt with samples obtained from infertile patients (where actually an excess of X-chromosome bearing spermatozoa was detected) (13), or had insufficient statistical power and a sample size too small to detect significant deviation from unity (N = 7 compared with N = 12) (14). Here we describe here a detailed protocol for determining the ratio between the X- and Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa in the ejaculates of the pygmy hippopotamus. ### Reagents 1. Carnoy’s fixative: 3 parts of methanol and one part of glacial acetic acid. Prepare fresh on the day used and keep in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC). Prepare about 40 mL for each sample of around 100 - 200 × 10 e 6 cells. - 0. 1 M Tris solution: 1. 21 g Tris-aminomethan (Tris base, Sigma # T 1503) in 100 mL of aqua bidist (can make less!). Adjust pH to 7. 0. Divide into 2 mL portions in Eppendorfs and keep in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC). Each portion is good for about 4 - 5 slides. - 1 M DTT stock solution: mix 770 mg Dithioerythritol (DTT; Sigma # D 9779) with 5 mL of 0. 1 M Tris solution. Split into 20 μL portions and keep in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC). (Can make less!). Each 20 µL portion is good for 4 - 5 slides. - 70 % formamid solution: Mix 0. 7 mL formamid (P 040. 1; Carl Roth GmbH+Co., Karlsruhe, Germany) with 0. 3 mL 2 ×SSC solution. Split into 100 µL portions and store in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC) till use. - X and Y chromosomes probes (0. 5 µL of each) with hybridisation mix (4 µL) – mix well on vortex. Enough for one slide. Pygmy hippopotamus-specific probes can be procured from Cambridge Resource Centre for Comparative Genomics, Cambridge, UK. - Rubber cement. - DAPI (4 ’, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole) with antifade mix (Vectashield from Vector Labs) – about 22 µL per slide with cover slip of 20 × 32 mm. - Ethanol solutions – keep in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC) : - a. 100 % ethanol: Put 120 mL in a Coplin jar - b. 90 % ethanol: Put 120 mL in a Coplin jar - c. 70 % ethanol: Put 120 mL in a Coplin jar - 20 × SSC stock solution (3 M NaCl, 0. 32 M Na 3 -Citrate•H 2 O) – keep at 4 ºC up to a year. - 2 × SSC working solution – keep at room temperature up to 6 month. - 2 × SSC / 0. 1 % NP- 40 (Tergitol Solution; Sigma # NP 40 S) solution – keep at room temperature up to 6 month. - 0. 4 × SSC solution – keep at room temperature up to 6 month. - Clear nail polish. ### Equipment 1. Vortex - Diamond pen - ThermoBrite Programmable Temperature Controlled Slide Processing System (Abbott Molecular, Wiesbaden, Germany) - Pipettes: 10 µL, 100 µL and 1000 µL - Fluorescence microscope with 3 -way filter for DAPI (blue), Cy 3 (red/pink) and FITC (green/yellow). - Microscope slides with frosted end. - Cover slips – 20 × 20 mm, 20 × 32 mm and 20 × 50 mm (or similar) - Plastic disposable pipettes - 15 -mL Falcon tubes - Parafilm, cut into slide-size pieces. - Pipette tips for 10 µL, 100 µL and 1000 µL pipettes. ### Procedure **A. Sperm sample washing and slide preparation** **Before starting** 1. Prepare fresh Carnoy’s fixative and put in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC) for at least 2 - 3 hours. Keep the fixative in the freezer throughout the handling of the sample. **Procedure**: 1. Centrifuge native sperm sample of (ideally) 200 × 10 e 6 spermatozoa at 400 g for 10 min and discard the supernatant. - Add 8 mL of Carnoy’s fixative, re-suspend the pellet by vortex and then centrifuge at 400 g for 10 minutes. If there is a smaller number of cells (50 to 100 × 106) then use only 4 mL of Carnoy’s fixative. - Remove supernatant, suspend again in fixative and centrifuge. Repeat these washing steps 3 - 4 times (or more). - Keep sperm in fixative in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC) until used for slides. Prepare slides on the day the FISH is being done. - Prepare the slides – make sure they are clean and properly marked on the frosted end. - Vortex the sample before use. - With a disposable plastic pipette drop (from about 10 cm above the slide) one drop of suspended semen on each slide and air-dry them horizontally. - Mark the area of the drop on the backside of the slide with diamond pen. **B. Slide treatment (bloating, aging, denaturation, hybridization) ** **Before starting** 1. Thaw one 2 -mL Eppendorf of 0. 1 M Tris solution and one 20 -µL tube of DTT solution for every 4 - 5 slides. - Thaw 100 µL of 70 % formamid solution for each slide. - Put about 120 mL of 2 × SSC solution in a Coplin jar at room temperature. - Put about 120 mL of distilled water inside a Coplin jar in the refrigerator at 4 ºC. - Thaw hybridisation mix. For each slide mix about 4 μL of hybridisation mix with 0. 5 µL of each of the X and Y chromosome-specific probes. Make sure to vortex the probes before taking the needed volume. Keep in ice in the dark or in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC) until just before use. Vortex before use. **Procedure**: 1. Mix well the DTT with the 0. 1 M Tris solution (one Eppendorf of each), resulting in 10 mM DTT solution. Make sure to take all the DTT by washing the DTT tube several times with 0. 1 M Tris solution taken from the other tube. - Put 0. 4 to 0. 5 mL of the 10 mM DTT solution on each slide, spread it evenly, cover with parafilm and leave at room temperature for 15 min. - Remove parafilm, discard access of liquid and then wash for 2 min in 2 × SSC solution at room temperature. - Air dry the slides. - Put 100 µL of 70 % formamid solution on each <b>slide,</b> <b>cover</b> with large (24 × 50 mm) cover slip while making sure the liquid spreads all over the slide (with no air bubbles). - Pre-heat the ThermoBrite to 80 ºC, load the slides and incubate for 10 min. If do not fill all slots on the ThermoBrite with samples then put empty slides in the empty slots. - Remove the slides from the ThermoBrite, remove the cover slips, discard of excess liquids and then wash in the cold distilled water for two minutes. - Air dry the slides. - Dehydrate the slides in the ethanol solutions – 1 min in each concentration going from 70 % to 90 % to 100 % and then air-dry the slides. Make sure the slides are absolutely dry before going to next step!! - Put on each 20 × 20 mm cover slip, at its center, 5 μL of probes with hybridization mix. Put the slide over the cover slip (face down) so the marked area aligns with the cover slip and let it stand for about one minute to let the hybridization and probes mix spread evenly. Make sure the entire area is covered and that no air bubbles are left. If needed, apply light pressure to spread the mix all the way to the edges of the cover slip. - Seal around with rubber cement. - Put in the ThermoBrite with some distilled water for humidity and run the following program: 10 minutes at 65 ºC for denaturation and then at 37 ºC over night for hybridization. **C. Washing and counter staining** **Before starting** 1. Heat water bath to 75 ºC and put 120 mL of 0. 4 × SSC solution in a Coplin jar in it for at least two hours. - Put 120 mL of 2 × SSC / 0. 1 % NP- 40 solution in a Coplin jar at room temperature. **Procedure**: 1. Remove rubber cement and cover slip. - Put for 1 minute in 0. 4 SSC at 75 ºC. - Drip excess solution and then put for 1 min in 2 × SSC / 0. 1 % NP- 40 at room temperature. - Air dry the slides in the dark. - Put a drop of DAPI with antifade (about 22 µL per slide) and cover with a 24 × 32 mm cover slip. - If intended for prolonged storage, seal around the edges of the cover slip with nail polish and then air dry it. Slides should be stored in the freezer (at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC). - View under fluorescence microscope at × 100 magnification with oil. The microscope should have a three-way filter – One for DAPI (blue), one for Cy 3 (red) and one for FITC (green). - IF successful, all cells will be stained blue, X-chromosome bearing spermatozoa should have red/pink spot on them and Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoa should have a green/yellow spot on them. ### Timing Entire procedure takes, from start to finish, about 30 - 31 hours. This is broken into the three stages as follow: **A. Sperm sample washing and slide preparation** 1. Carnoy’s fixative preparation and cooling: 3 h. - Sample washing: 1 h. - Slide preparation: 1 h. **B. Slide treatment (bloating, aging, denaturation, hybridisation) ** 1. Bloating and aging: 2 h - Denaturation and hybridisation: At least 20 h (longer hybridisation can result in a stronger and clearer signal). **C. Washing and counter staining** 1. Heating the 0. 4 × SSC solution: 2. 5 hours. - Washing and counter staining: 1 hour. Preparation of the Carnoy’s fixative, its cooling and sample washing in stage A can be done separately from all the rest. Washed samples in the fixative can be stored at - 18 ºC to - 20 ºC for months to years. A longer hybridisation time is likely to extend the duration of the entire procedure. ### Troubleshooting 1. Signal too weak: extend hybridisation time or increase the volume of hybridisation mix and probes. - Cells have disintegrated: reduce the time of incubation with DTT solution. - Cells have not bloated enough: increase incubation time with DTT solution. - Difficult to find cells on the slide: concentrate the sample by centrifugation and re-suspension in smaller volume of fixative. - Cells overlap or in big aggregates: further dilute the sample, vortex well and prepare new slides. - In general, if the end sample does not give acceptable results, it would be a good idea to view the slide after each stage up to the denaturation and hybridisation stage (i. e. after slide preparation, after DTT treatment, and after formamid treatment). ### Anticipated Results Assuming the procedure worked well, all spermatozoa will be stained in blue, those carrying the X-chromosome will have a red/pink spot and those carrying the Y-chromosome will have a green/yellow spot (Figure 1). In some cases, depending on the individual, there may be very small proportion of cells carrying both sex chromosomes and thus will have clear spots of both colours. In some cells hybridisation will not take place and there will be no spot in them. The probes may become slightly contaminated during their preparation and would thus give, in addition to the main larger spots, also one or more small spots of one or of both colours in some of the cells. ### References 1.
