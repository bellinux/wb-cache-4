6000|$|... 45. It belongs, {{as most of}} you know, to {{a family}} of birds called Fissirostres, or, literally, split-beaks. <b>Split</b> <b>heads</b> {{would be a better}} term, for it is the {{enormous}} width of mouth and power of gaping which the epithet is meant to express. A dull sermon, for instance, makes half the congregation [...] "fissirostres." [...] The bird, however, is most vigilant when its mouth is widest, for it opens as a net to catch whatever comes in its way,--hence the French, giving the whole family the more literal name, [...] "Gobble-fly"--Gobe-mouche, extend the term to the open-mouthed and too acceptant appearance of a simpleton.|$|E
50|$|Most {{production}} carbureted engines, {{as opposed}} to fuel-injected, have a single carburetor and a matching intake manifold that divides and transports the air fuel mixture to the intake valves, though some engines (like motorcycle engines) use multiple carburetors on <b>split</b> <b>heads.</b> Multiple carburetor engines were also common enhancements for modifying engines in the USA from the 1950s to mid-1960s, as well as during the following decade of high-performance muscle cars, fueling different chambers of the engine's intake manifold.|$|E

40|$|Most milling {{machines}} {{are equipped with}} <b>split</b> <b>heads</b> aimed at orienting the tool at any angle {{with respect to the}} workpiece. Typical examples are given in Fig. 1. The general geometry of these heads can be reduced to the linkage shown in Fig. 2. Each particular architecture is achieved by choosing angle θ between the member axis and by selecting the orientation of the tool with respect to the final member. The head features two degrees of freedom, embodied by the joint rotations α and β, through which the configuration can be changed to adjust the orientation ofthe tool. The kinematic analysis of the head can be posed in two ways: a) direct analysis if the values of the joint rotations, α and β, are given and the orientation of the tool axis with respect to the machine frame is sought; b) inverse analysis if the desired orientation of the tool axis is given and the joint rotations, α and β, are sought that enforce that orientation. This paper provides the analytical solution of both direct and inverse problems. The work falls within a research program carried out with the partnership of a renowned machine tool manufacturer of Reggio Emilia...|$|E

40|$|Nondestructive {{testing methods}} {{used for the}} testing of rail in tracks {{worldwide}} can be limited by discontinuity location or orientation within the rail. Vertical <b>split</b> <b>head</b> and rail base cracks are among those types of discontinuities {{that are difficult to}} detect, which in some cases may result in a reail failure in service. A noncontact and remote hybrid ultrasonic technique has been developed by combining laser generation with air coupled detection of ultrasonic signals in rails. The test apparatus mounts on a railroad pushcart and tests are performed in motion with all components kept above the running surface of the rail track. Tracks have been tested for vertical <b>split</b> <b>head</b> and rail base cracks with high success in detection...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} tracking two-dimensional propagation of internal cracks, in particular vertical <b>split</b> <b>head</b> (VSH) defects, due to contact loading in railhead. Generalised curved crack is assumed to have present in the railhead and its propagation is simulated by solving interaction of arbitrary shaped cracks successively. Furthermore, the finite shape of the rail section is also modelled as the continuous distribution of dislocation within an infinite plane. Crack propagation is simulated using the criterion of vanishing of Mode II stress intensity factors (SIF) at crack tips. Examples are provided for tracking the propagation of pre-existing internal cracks in railheads turning into VSH defects under centric contact loading...|$|R
