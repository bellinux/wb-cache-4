By 1990, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) had begun large-scale sequencing trials on Mycoplasma capricolum, Escherichia coli, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a cost of US$0.75 per base. Meanwhile, sequencing of human cDNA sequences called expressed sequence tags began in Craig Venter's lab, an attempt to capture the coding fraction of the human genome. In 1995, Venter, Hamilton Smith, and colleagues at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) published the first complete genome of a free-living organism, the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. The circular chromosome contains 1,830,137 bases and its publication in the journal Science marked the first published use of whole-genome shotgun sequencing, eliminating the need for initial mapping efforts.|$|E

The <b>sequencing</b> <b>machine</b> contains many picoliter-volume wells each containing a single bead and sequencing enzymes. Pyrosequencing uses luciferase to generate light for detection of the individual nucleotides added to the nascent DNA, and the combined data are used to generate sequence reads.

Prior to 2008, the Applied Biosystems brand was owned by various entities in a corporate group parented by PerkinElmer. The roots of Applied Biosystems trace back to GeneCo (Genetic Systems Company), a pioneer biotechnology company founded in 1981 in Foster City, California. Through the 1980s and early 1990s, Applied Biosystems, Inc. operated independently and manufactured biochemicals and automated genetic engineering and diagnostic research instruments, including the principal brand of DNA <b>sequencing</b> <b>machine</b> used by the Human Genome Project consortium centers.

40|$|Advent of next {{generation}} gene <b>sequencing</b> <b>machines</b> {{has led to}} computationally intensive alignment problems that can take many hours on a modern computer.

Fragmentation and size selection are performed to purify sequences that are the appropriate length for the <b>sequencing</b> <b>machine.</b> The RNA, cDNA, or both are fragmented with enzymes, sonication, or nebulizers. Fragmentation of the RNA reduces 5' bias of randomly primed-reverse transcription {{and the influence of}} primer binding sites, with the downside that the 5' and 3' ends are converted to DNA less efficiently. Fragmentation is followed by size selection, where either small sequences are removed or a tight range of sequence lengths are selected. Because small RNAs like miRNAs are lost, these are analyzed independently. The cDNA for each experiment can be indexed with a hexamer or octamer barcode, so that these experiments can be pooled into a single lane for multiplexed sequencing.|$|E

50|$|In FISSEQ, {{a series}} of {{biochemical}} processing steps, such as DNA ligations or single-base DNA polymerase extensions, are performed on a block of fixed tissue, interlaced with fluorescent imaging steps. The process is conceptually identical to the mechanism of fluorescent sequencing by synthesis in a commercial bulk DNA <b>sequencing</b> <b>machine,</b> except that it is performed in fixed tissue. Each DNA or RNA molecule in the sample is first “amplified” (i.e., copied) in-situ via rolling-circle amplification to create a localized “rolling circle colony” (rolony) consisting of identical copies of the parent molecule. A series of biochemical steps are then carried out. In the kth cycle, a fluorescent tag is introduced, the color of which corresponds to {{the identity of the}} kth base along the rolony’s parent DNA strand. The system is then “paused” in this state for imaging. The entire sample can be imaged in each cycle. The fluorescent tags are then cleaved and washed away, and the next cycle is initiated. Each rolony - corresponding to a single “parent” DNA or RNA molecule in the tissue - thus appears across {{a series of}} fluorescent images, as a localized “spot” with a sequence of colors corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the parent molecule.
