40|$|Characterisation of {{unbounded}} {{resources of}} a <b>social</b> <b>system</b> within the sociological interpretation {{has resulted in}} a large number of different notions, which are relevant in different situations. From the view point of statistical mechanics, these notions resemble free energy. In this paper the concept of social free energy is introduced and first steps toward its development presented. The social free energy is a function equal to physical free energy appropriately determined for the <b>social</b> <b>system,</b> with intrinsically sociological interpretation as a measure of social action obtainable in a given <b>social</b> <b>system</b> without changes in its structure. Its construction is a consequence of response of a <b>social</b> <b>system</b> to recognised parts of environment dynamics. It is argued that development of a <b>social</b> <b>system</b> response resembles exciting the normal modes of a general, physical system.

It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E

5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{diffusion}} model developed by Everett Rogers {{is widely used}} in consumer marketing because it segments consumers into five groups, based on their rate of new product adoption. [...] Rogers defines the diffusion of innovation as {{the process by which}} that innovation is [...] "communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system." [...] Thus the diffusion process has a number of elements, the innovation, the communication channels, time and the <b>social</b> <b>system.</b> An innovation is any new idea, object or process that is perceived as new by members of the <b>social</b> <b>system.</b> Communication channels are the means by which information about the innovation is transmitted to members of the <b>social</b> <b>system</b> and may include mass media, digital media and personal communications between members of the <b>social</b> <b>system.</b> Time refers to {{the rate at which the}} innovation is picked up by the members of the <b>social</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Spinozistic {{conception}} of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of autopoiesis in biological systems.

The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's conatus principle; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.|$|E

She was widely praised for making efforts {{to clean up}} the corruption in the Indian political system. References were made with the Hindu goddess Durga for taking action against the politically well-connected sand-mining mafia and real estate barons. According to Surinder S. Jodhka, professor and chair at the Centre for the Study of <b>Social</b> <b>Systems</b> in Jawaharlal Nehru University, the protest after Nagpal's suspension are due to the growing discontent within India's growing middle-class with criminalisation in politics. Due to the public protests, the UP government had to engage in damage control, highlighting its welfare schemes and announcing that it is considering to set up a task force to check illegal mining.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E

5|$|While the {{domestic}} horse and donkey (along with their feral descendants) exist worldwide, wild equine populations {{are limited to}} Africa and Asia. Wild equine <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> come in two forms; a harem system with tight-knit groups consisting of one adult male or stallion, several females or mares and their young or foals; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very fluidly. In both systems, females {{take care of their}} offspring but males may play a role as well. Equines communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild equine populations and out of the seven living species, only the plains zebra remains widespread and abundant.|$|E
5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but will remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial <b>social</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
