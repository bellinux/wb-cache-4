5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and <b>stays.</b> In the 1840s the trussing was changed from <b>stays</b> to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the wheel, along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the wheel in two.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{industry}} is subdivided into gambling, hospitality, restaurants, beach bars and cafés. National visitors are prevalent and from diverse localities. In 1876, Ramalho Ortigão noticed that Póvoa was {{very popular in}} all social ranks in Northern Portugal. In the contemporary period, the construction of motorways negatively affected overnight <b>stays</b> in local hotels. This has been leveled by a noticeable attraction of Portuguese living abroad and foreign tourists {{and the number of}} hotel rooms in 2014 increased to 1.774. Most of those tourists are French or from diverse countries in Northern Europe. International tourists sleeping in the city's hotels represented 35.1% of guests in 2013, up from 30.3% in 2001. Informal local accommodation, especially typical homes in rua Latino Coelho, is a popular alternative for long <b>stays.</b> Póvoa de Varzim has the longest overnight <b>stays</b> for foreign tourists in Metropolitan Porto who stay, on average, 3 days.|$|E
