5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's <b>suspensions</b> to work better on the circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear <b>suspensions.</b> McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E
5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was {{brought before the}} U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued that {{under the terms of}} the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out <b>suspensions</b> and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's <b>suspensions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} general {{administration}} of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory <b>suspensions</b> for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player <b>suspensions</b> incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.|$|E

Three type of <b>suspension</b> were tested and compared which is passive <b>suspension,</b> active <b>suspension</b> with PID controller and active <b>suspension</b> with AFC system. The quarter car model is designed. Passive <b>suspension</b> is a <b>suspension</b> system that not equipped with any controller or actuator. For the active <b>suspension,</b> PID controller is used. This controller design deals with selection of proportional gain, derivative gain and integral gain. This parameters (Kp, Kd and Ki) is tuned by using try and error method. For the active <b>suspension</b> with AFC scheme, incorporated with PID controller, it also important to get the optimum value of estimated mass. From the result, active <b>suspension</b> with AFC scheme can reduce more vibration compared to active <b>suspension</b> with PID controller and passive <b>suspension.</b> In conclusion, the AFC system is the most robust and simple system in reducing the vibration on <b>suspension</b> system compared to active <b>suspension</b> with PID controller and passive <b>suspension...</b>|$|R
