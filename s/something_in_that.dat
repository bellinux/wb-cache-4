He left Microsoft for Id Software to write <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction, the result being Quake. The story for the 3DO game Immercenary was also heavily influenced by Snow Crash.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... I just thought that is really not fair and I {{think we have to}} put <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{dissected}} the Anarchist League and [...] "the contradictory {{nature of}} their organization" [...] which patrolled a [...] "poor and dirty" [...] world, and juxtaposed this with the [...] "opulent organization of the (state)". In particular, he highlighted dialogue by the robot master, Bors, as illustrating the importance of his leadership {{to the success of}} the micro-state. In the story, a conversation with a mechanic leads the robot to state, [...] "You know I'm the only one who can keep all this together. I'm the only one who knows how to maintain a planned society, not a disorderly chaos! If it weren't for me, all this would collapse, and you'd have dust and ruins and weeds. The whole outside would come rushing in to take over!" [...] Barlow concluded that while the story ended in triumph for the anarchists, the story did not go so far as to validate their society. [...] "Dick does not vindicate them," [...] writes Barlow, [...] "keeping it clear that the robot had certainly accomplished <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> valley, though it had eventually gone too far." ...|$|E

500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, I know you have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E
500|$|Ian Brennan {{conceived}} Glee {{based on}} his own experience {{as a member of}} the Prospect High School show choir in Mount Prospect, Illinois. He initially envisioned Glee as a film, rather than a television series, and wrote the first draft in August 2005 with the aid of Screenwriting for Dummies. He completed the script in 2005, but could not generate interest in the project for several years. Mike Novick, a television producer and a friend of Brennan's from Los Angeles, w{{as a member of the}} same gym as Ryan Murphy, and gave him a copy of Brennan's script. Murphy had been in a show choir in college, and felt he could relate to the script. Murphy and his Nip/Tuck colleague Brad Falchuk suggested that Glee be produced as a television show. The script was entirely rewritten, and was picked up by Fox within fifteen hours of being received. Murphy attributed that, in part, to the network's success with American Idol. [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> vein", he said. Murphy and Falchuk became the show's executive producers and showrunners, Brennan became a co-executive producer and Novick a producer. Brennan, Falchuk and Murphy started by writing [...] "all the episodes".|$|E
500|$|Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan created Glee. Murphy drew {{inspiration}} from his own childhood, which saw him play the lead role {{in all of his}} high school's musicals. Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs. Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series. Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part {{to the success of the}} network's American Idol, commenting: [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> vein". Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism, explaining: [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why 'Idol' worked. It's pure escapism." [...] With regards to Glee audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads. Glee is set in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana, and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the show is actually filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.|$|E

2500|$|When Bernabeu {{learned about}} this, he resorted to {{district}} attorney Glenn, {{who in turn}} demanded an explanation from the Customs head James H. McCulloh, who replied that he had kept the ship [...] "under the constant supervision of an officer [...] " [...] which was now [...] " [...] ready to navigate with the same individual weapons that had been brought" [...] ' and that [...] "if you [...] know of <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> procedure contrary to the law, I'll be happy that you tell me so I can correct my mistakes." [...] Glenn then filed a new complaint against Almeida brig's for violating the neutrality laws.|$|E

"Now, {{people are}} coming back and almost {{adopting}} it as their own anthem, and it's hard, I think, to write an anthem that's not cheesy, and I hope {{that this could be}} <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> category.

But I also don't want to be cheesy, it's a fine line, and I think 'Firework' ... would be like the opus or my one song — if I had to pick a song to play — 'cause it has a great beat. But it also has a fantastic message. Many people refer to the lines 'like the 4th of July; however the original lyrics were 'like a firefly' as they reminded me of fireworks at night whenever I saw them. However the trend caught on and in live performances I now sing 4th of July, which happens to make great sense for the song name." ...|$|E
