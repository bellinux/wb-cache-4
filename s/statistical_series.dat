I soon got into the way of doing all this in a very methodical and automatic manner, keeping the mind perfectly calm and neutral, but intent and, as it were, at full cock and on hair trigger, before displaying the word. There was no disturbance occasioned by thinking of the forthcoming revulsion of the mind the moment before the chronograph was stopped. My feeling before stopping it was simply that I had delayed long enough, and this in no way interfered with the free action of the mind. I found no trouble in ensuring the complete fairness of the experiment, by using a number of little precautions, hardly necessary to describe, that practice quickly suggested, {{but it was a}} most repugnant and laborious work, and it was only by strong self-control that I went through my schedule according to programme. The list of words that I finally secured was 75 in number, though I began with more. I went through them on four separate occasions, under very different circumstances, in England and abroad, and at intervals of about a month. In no case were the associations governed to any degree worth recording, by remembering what had occurred to me on previous occasions, for I found that the process itself had great influence in discharging the memory of what it had just been engaged in, and I, of course, took care between the experiments never to let my thoughts revert to the words. The results seem to me to be as trustworthy as any other <b>statistical</b> <b>series</b> that has been collected with equal care.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The general {{problem of}} {{conformance}} monitoring {{with respect to}} preassigned 4 -dimensional (4 D) trajectories equipped with corresponding 4 D margins (4 D contracts) is considered within an adaptive <b>statistical</b> time <b>series</b> framework. The specific issues tackled within this context are: (a) Present conformance monitoring and quality of conformance evalua-tion via statistical tools, which also leads to abnormal event detection; (b) future conformance monitoring, in which the conformance is predicted ahead of time, allowing for potentially corrective or other actions. The performance of the developed methods is assessed via simulations. In present conformance monitoring, an alarm is shown to be issued instantaneously, following {{the emergence of an}} abnormal event. In future conformance monitoring, the comparison with a scheme based on nominal probabilistic trajectory prediction demonstrates the benefits of the adaptive <b>statistical</b> time <b>series</b> framework.

40|$|Abstract — The Czech Republic is a {{showcase}} {{example of a}} very open and essentially very liberal economy, {{especially in terms of}} its relations with other countries. While industrial production, with manufacturing in particular, remains the key economic segment, tourism and services associated with it have their significance as well. As a state outside the Euro Area, the Czech Republic is faced with currency (CZK) fluctuations vis-à-vis the major foreign currencies, including the euro and U. S. dollar, with the importance of the euro being by far the highest in tourism. Using <b>statistical</b> time <b>series,</b> the present work analyses the development of tourism in the Czech Republic, uprooting the general belief that the crisis in the tourism industry came {{as a result of the}} global economic crisis (2008 - 2010). Based on mathematical analysis and identification of correlations between <b>statistical</b> time <b>series,</b> it has become apparent that the crisis had hit the travel industry before the global economic recession and came as the direct result of the strengthening of the CZK compared to the major foreign currencies, particularly the euro and U. S. dollar. A factual and mathematical analysis is performed, examining the relationship between the key data on consumption concerning local and foreign visitors. It has become apparent that the crisis curve applying to local visitors lags behind the curve applying to foreign visitors, with the time shift being equal to difference in the period where the strengthening of the Czech currency adversely affected the spending of foreign tourists and the period where the income of local residents was negatively impacted by the global crisis.
