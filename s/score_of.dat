40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between interpersonal decentering and symptoms of psychopathology among 48 clients from the Psychology Clinic at the University of North Texas. The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) and the Symptom Checklist 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R®) instrument were administered to clients along with demographic packets. Interpersonal decentering was assessed using Melvin Feffer's Interpersonal Decentering Scoring System for the TAT. It was hypothesized that higher <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> global symptom severity would be associated with lower <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal decentering. Higher <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> paranoid ideation, psychoticism, and hostility were also hypothesized to be associated with lower <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal decentering.

The {{aim of this study}} is to observe the impact of chemotherapy on quality of life and emotion among lung cancer patients. Methods Fourty lung cancer patients were assessed with clinical outcomes, the EORTC QLQ-C 30, SDS questionnaires before chemotherapy, one week after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, one week after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Results Before chemotherapy, the <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> functioning scales were high, the rate of depression was 65 %. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, effective rate was 42. 5 %, the <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> cognitive function increase, the <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> role, emotional, social function decrease, the <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> dyspnoea decrease, the <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> pain, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea increase, the <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> Global quality of life decrease; the rate of depression was 70 %.

40|$|Background:The {{use of a}} {{standard}} immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to detect the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein in lung cancer is challenging. There are no universally accepted, evidence-based guidelines on identifying patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer using IHC. Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 465 resected specimens of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} using a tissue microarray as a test set. ALK protein expression using IHC with 5 A 4 monoclonal antibody (Novocastra) and ALK gene rearrangement using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with dual-color break-apart probes (Abbott molecular) were examined. Immunoreactivity was scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the results were compared with the FISH results. A diagnostic algorithm was derived from the correlation of the IHC and FISH results and applied to an additional 187 adenocarcinoma samples used as a validation set. Results:In the test set, ALK protein expression was detected in 40 patients (40 / 465, 8. 6 %), consisting <b>of</b> IHC <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 1 (n = 14), 2 (n = 10), and 3 (n = 16), whereas 19 patients (19 / 453, 4. 2 %) were FISH-positive. All the FISH-positive patients were assigned IHC <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 2 or 3. All the patients with ALK IHC <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 3 were FISH-positive, those with <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 0 or 1 were FISH-negative, and those with <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 2 were FISH variable. In the validation set, ALK protein expression was detected in 14 patients (<b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 1, n = 2; <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 2, n = 6; and <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 3, n = 6), of which nine patients (9 / 187, 4. 8 %) were FISH-positive. All the patients with IHC <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 0 or 1 were FISH-negative, and those with <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 3 were FISH- positive. Among the patients with IHC <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 2, three (3 / 6, 50 %) were FISH-positive. Conclusions:The sensitivity and specificity of IHC was 100 % and 95. 8 %, respectively. These data supported an IHC scoring algorithm in which ALK IHC <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 0, 1, or 3 were highly compatible with FISH results, and IHC <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 2 were variable. Based on these findings, the IHC assay using the 5 A 4 antibody reliably detected non-small cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement and may be useful as a screening method to identify these tumors...|$|R
