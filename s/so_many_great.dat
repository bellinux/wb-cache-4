The New York Times named Fringe one of the top 10 television shows in 2010.

500|$|For the cape, {{director}} Christopher Nolan {{wanted to}} have a [...] "flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>great</b> graphic novels". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show [...] "a man who has angst", so his character would be revealed through the mask.|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} putting {{together}} All the Way... A Decade of Song was laborious for all involved, from balancing {{the number of}} hits and new songs to ensuring {{that each of the}} latest tracks showed a new side of Dion. [...] "We had hourly conversations, back and forth, about what the combination should be," [...] said John Doelp, the album's co-executive producer. [...] "We wanted to make sure we had some new sounds and {{that we were able to}} go to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number. But we had <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>great</b> songs coming in that we ended up recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven." ...|$|E

Said Jones, [...] "I've never seen <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>great</b> performers come together with so much love and selflessness." [...] The celebration included a performance of [...] "We Are the World", which involved Clinton, his daughter Chelsea, and his wife Hillary singing the song along with USA for Africa's Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. The New York Times Edward Rothstein commented on the event, stating, [...] "The most enduring image may be of Mr. Clinton singing along in 'We Are the World', the first President to aspire, however futilely, to hipness." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1925 the Oxford {{production}} of The Cherry Orchard {{was brought to}} the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Gielgud again played Trofimov. His distinctive speaking voice attracted attention and led to work for BBC Radio, which his biographer Sheridan Morley calls [...] "a medium he made his own for seventy years." [...] In the same year Noël Coward chose Gielgud as his understudy in his play The Vortex. For the last month of the West End run Gielgud took over Coward's role of Nicky Lancaster, the drug-addicted son of a nymphomaniac mother. It was in Gielgud's words [...] "a highly-strung, nervous, hysterical part which depended a lot upon emotion." [...] He found it tiring to play because he had not yet learned how to pace himself, but he thought it [...] "a thrilling engagement because it led to <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>great</b> things afterwards." ...|$|E

Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>great</b> prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that.

I can’t imagine that he would, but it’s a 'you never know' kind of thing. I haven’t talked to him in quite a while. I don’t know where he’s at these days. He’ll obviously be more than welcome, and embraced if he does. If he doesn’t, that’s cool too." [...] Flea also spoke about Frusciante by saying [...] "He left us <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>great</b> gifts. He’s a phenomenal musician and songwriter who gave so much to our band. All the feelings I have for him not being in the band any more... He really took us to a higher level."

500|$|Several bonus tracks follow on {{separate}} editions; some continue the teenage theme, {{while others are}} joke tracks. Barker used Afro-Cuban influences for his drum track on [...] "Don't Tell Me It's Over", and DeLonge used something other than his punk influences for [...] "What Went Wrong". [...] While DeLonge felt [...] "staple acoustic songs" [...] were big for groups at the time (such as Green Day's [...] "Good Riddance"), the band wrote all of their songs from their inception on acoustic guitars, and he felt he would rather have [...] "What Went Wrong" [...] in its original form. [...] "You grow up and realize, 'Fuck! Who gives a fuck about punk rock?'" [...] he said. [...] "There are <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>great</b> forms of music out there, and you grow beyond wanting to listen to or write something because your parents will hate it."

500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>great</b> films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E
500|$|McEntire {{made a major}} {{comeback}} {{into the}} music industry the following year with her twentieth studio album, What If It's You.

5000|$|In {{the final}} peroration of his notable lecture on Folk-tale and History in Beowulf, given last year 1939, Mr Girvan said:::"Confessedly there is matter for wonder and scope for doubt, but {{we might be}} able to answer with {{complete}} satisfaction some of the questionings which rise in men's minds over the Beowulf poet's presentment of his hero, if we could also answer with certainty the question why he chose just this subject, when to our modern judgment there were at hand <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>greater,</b> charged with the splendour and tragedy of humanity, and in all respects worthier of a genius as astonishing as it was rare in Anglo-Saxon England."There is something irritatingly odd about all this. One even dares to wonder if something has not gone wrong with 'our modern judgement', supposing that it is justly represented. Higher praise than is found in the learned critics, whose scholarship enables them to appreciate these things, could hardly be given to the detail, the tone, the style, and indeed to the total effect of Beowulf. Yet this poetic talent, we are to understand, has all been squandered on an unprofitable theme: as if Milton had recounted the story of Jack and the Beanstalk in noble verse.|$|R
