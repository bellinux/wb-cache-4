5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy.

This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E

5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance.

Pulsating <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect.
