2500|$|A {{project to}} build a $3-billion nuclear plant in eastern Utah was {{initially}} proposed in 2007 by Transition Power Development (TPD). TPD planned to have {{a minimum of two}} 1500 megawatt reactors active when the plant went live, though the proposed site could support three reactors. The plant is projected to [...] "increase Utah's electrical capacity by approximately 50 percent". The plant was proposed in part to support a projected 2016 need for power from Rocky Mountain Power, the main supplier of electrical power to the state of Utah. Jon Huntsman Jr., the governor of Utah at that time, stated that he was opposed to any plan for a plant that did not include onsite <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing.</b> At the time of the proposal, TPD had obtained rights to about half of the water needed to run the proposed two reactors.|$|E

50|$|The {{nuclear fuel}} cycle, also called nuclear fuel chain, is the {{progression}} of nuclear fuel {{through a series of}} differing stages.

50|$|Arktika and {{the entire}} Arktika-class {{icebreaker}} fleet are outfitted with two OK-900A reactors, which deliver 171 MW each. Each reactor is contained in its own closed compartment and weighs 160 tonnes. They are shielded by water, steel, and high density concrete, and ambient radiation is monitored throughout the ship by 86 sensors. The reactors were originally fueled by a 90% enriched, zirconium-clad, uranium fuel. Those reactors still in operation today now use a 20%-90% enriched with 60% average enrichment uranium dispersed in an aluminum matrix. The chain reaction can be stopped in 0.6 seconds by the full insertion of safety rods. Arktika consumes up to 200 grams of fuel a day when breaking ice. There are 500 kg of Uranium isotopes in each reactor, allowing for at least 13.7 years between changing reactor cores. The used cores are extracted and replaced in Murmansk, the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessed</b> and waste disposed of at a radioactive waste plant.|$|R
40|$|The International Atomic Energy Agency {{requires}} {{nuclear facilities}} {{around the world}} to abide by heavily enforced safeguards to prevent proliferation. Nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> facilities are designed to be proliferation-resistant and to use surveillance systems.

First, a hypothetical <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> facility is described along with proliferation resistance methods typically used in actual facilities.

40|$|Routing {{neptunium}} to {{a single}} product in <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> is a significant challenge. In this work, we have further improved the simulation of neptunium extraction in an advanced PUREX flowsheet by applying a revised model of the Np(V) -Np(VI) redox reaction kinetics, a new nitric acid radiolysis model and by evaluating various models for the nitrous acid distribution coefficient. The Np disproportionation reaction is shown to have a negligible effect. The models are validated against published ‘cold test’ experimental results; the ‘hot test’ simulation suggests high neptunium radiolysis could help to achieve high recoveries using this flowsheet...|$|R
50|$|However, as of 2009 {{the total}} amount in the {{atmosphere}} is estimated at 5500 PBq due to anthropogenic sources.

The most important of these human sources is nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing.</b> Nuclear fission produces about three atoms of krypton-85 for every 1000 fissions; i.e. it has a fission yield of 0.3%. Most or all of this krypton-85 is retained in the <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> rods; <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> on discharge from a reactor contains between 0.13-1.8 PBq/Mg of krypton-85. Some of this <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> is <b>reprocessed.</b> Current nuclear reprocessing releases the gaseous Kr-85 to the atmosphere when the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> is dissolved. It would be possible in principle to capture and store this krypton gas as nuclear waste or for use. The cumulative global amount of krypton-85 released from reprocessing activity has been estimated as 10,600 PBq as of 2000. The global inventory noted above is smaller than this amount due to radioactive decay; a smaller fraction is dissolved into the deep oceans.|$|R
