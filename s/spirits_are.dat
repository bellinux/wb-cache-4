5|$|Elemental Spirits, {{also called}} Mana <b>Spirits,</b> <b>are</b> beings who govern the magic {{elements}} of the series' world, and are {{at the core of}} the games' magic system as they are used to cast magic spells. Eight types of spirits have appeared in the series since Secret of Mana, and each embodies a different element. Their names are homonyms of mythological beings or phenomena. In Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, usage of their power is enabled upon the main characters' meeting with them. In Legend of Mana, the spirits serve as factors in the Land Creation System. In Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana, multiple spirits of the same elemental type appear. In terms of storyline, in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Heroes of Mana, the <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight elemental benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of SD3). In Dawn of Manas North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> {{forced into}} {{the head of a}} Krazoa statue, which reveals itself to be the revived Andross, the mastermind behind the spirit scheme, who flies off to resume his conquest of the Lylat System. When Falco Lombardi arrives in space, he helps Fox defeat Andross, {{restoring}} and repairing the Krazoa spirits to the planet. Afterwards, Falco rejoins the Star Fox team and Krystal is recruited.|$|E
5|$|King Neptune {{wants to}} {{celebrate}} his 5,000th birthday at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and the crew spare no expense for the gala, rolling out the red carpet to welcome the royal family. Despite the party itself, the king's <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> brought down {{by the absence of}} his son, Triton, spoiling the festivities for everyone, especially his wife, Queen Amphitrite. Triton was banished to a cage on the deserted Island in the Sky, until he is ready to be a proper god, having displeased his father with his growing interests in the mortal world.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> {{cause of}} the {{universe}} and life in all its forms and dimensions. The <b>spirit</b> <b>is</b> ruled by unchangeable, universal laws of love, affinity and justice. The purpose the <b>spirit</b> <b>is</b> to demonstrate the rational life through these laws. Wisdom is accumulated only with experience. As the <b>spirit</b> <b>is</b> eternal, this is possible through reincarnation. In the world this is seen in civilization, community, and harmony of all social orders, especially in economic achievements and scientific development proceeding largely unimpeded.|$|R
60|$|Q. How then is {{the true}} God {{distinguished}} from other spirits?--A. Thus: No <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> eternal but HE, no <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> almighty but HE, no <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> incomprehensible and unsearchable but HE: HE is also most merciful, most just, most holy (Deut 33:27; Gen 17:1; Psa 145:3; Micah 7:18; Job 34:17; 1 Sam 2:2).|$|R
5|$|Kitsune are {{associated}} with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice. This association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. Originally, kitsune were Inari's messengers, but {{the line between the}} two is now blurred so that Inari Ōkami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave offerings. Fox <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called aburage, which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba. Similarly, Inari-zushi is a type of sushi named for Inari Ōkami that consists of rice-filled pouches of fried tofu. There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as kami.|$|E
5|$|The United States Capitol is {{considered}} one of the most haunted buildings in Washington. The first apparition to be seen there was in the 1860s as the Capitol was being completed. Several <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> said to haunt the Capitol due to tragedies associated with its construction. One such ghost is said to be that of a worker who died after a fall during the construction of the rotunda, and who now is occasionally seen floating beneath the dome carrying a tray of woodworking tools. Another spirit is allegedly a stonemason who died (crushed to death beneath a wall which collapsed, or murdered by a co-worker) and is seen in the Old Senate chambers or passing through a wall in the basement beneath the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Heathenry {{does not}} have a unified {{theology}} and is typically polytheistic, centering on a pantheon of deities from pre-Christian Germanic Europe. It adopts cosmological views from these religions, including an animistic view of the cosmos in which the natural world is imbued with spirits. The faith's deities and these <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> honored in sacrificial rites known as blóts in which food and libations are offered to them. These are often accompanied by symbel, the act of ceremonially toasting the gods with an alcoholic beverage. Some practitioners also engage in rituals designed to induce an altered state of consciousness and visions, most notably seiðr and galdr, with the intent of gaining wisdom and advice from the deities. Although many solitary practitioners follow the religion by themselves, members of the Heathen community often assemble in small groups, usually known as kindreds or hearths, to perform their rites outdoors or in specially constructed buildings. Heathen ethical systems emphasize honor, personal integrity, and loyalty, while beliefs about an afterlife vary and are rarely emphasized.|$|E
50|$|The Gillig <b>Spirit</b> <b>was</b> a high floor {{medium-duty}} transit bus {{manufactured by}} the Gillig Corporation throughout the 1989-early 1990s. It was offered as low-cost {{alternative to the}} Gillig Phantom. 250 were built before the <b>Spirit</b> <b>was</b> discontinued in the early 1990s. Its only available in the 28 foot Bus. The Gillig <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> only seen in the United States.|$|R

5|$|Two millennia ago, humans {{developed}} spyrix, a {{power source}} which absorbs spirits to supply power. In response, the spirit Maxwell gathered humans, {{who share a}} symbiotic relationship with spirits, onto an isolated land protected by a barrier; the isolated land became known as Rieze Maxia and the outer lands as Elympios. As <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> needed to sustain nature, Maxwell waits for the day all humans on Elympios die off before dispelling the barrier. Twenty {{years prior to the}} present, an Elympion cruise ship becomes trapped in Rieze Maxia, eventually forming a terrorist group known as Exodus. Exodus works with the Elympios military {{to find a way to}} destroy the barrier. In the present era, Rieze Maxia is ruled by two countries called Rashugal and Auj Oule. While the two countries appear to live in harmony, they both initiate black operations in attempts to conquer the other in hopes of uniting Rieze Maxia as a single country.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E
50|$|The Great <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> {{portrayed in}} American Indian {{history as a}} {{powerful}} force that guides the people in wisdom and survival.

5|$|Other <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> {{also said}} {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spirits</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} four broad categories: demons, elementals, ghosts, and gods. With the {{exception}} of elementals, <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> naturally immaterial, generally require Charms to materialize in Creation, and will reform when killed unless some supernatural effect prevents them from doing so. Rules for playing ghosts in 1st edition are presented in Exalted: The Abyssals, and rules for 2nd edition are presented in The Books of Sorcery, Vol. V: The Roll of Glorious Divinity II: Ghosts & Demons. Rules for playing elementals and gods are presented in The Books of Sorcery, Vol. IV: The Roll of Glorious Divinity I: Gods & Elementals.|$|E

25|$|It {{includes}} singing {{praise and}} victory songs, {{reading from the}} Scripture, prayer and confronting the spirit {{in the name of}} Jesus. Dialogue with the <b>spirit</b> <b>is</b> another important part of the exorcism ceremony. It helps the counselor (exorcist) to know how the <b>spirit</b> <b>was</b> operating {{in the life of the}} demoniac. The signs and events mentioned by the <b>spirit</b> <b>are</b> affirmed by the victim after deliverance.|$|R
5000|$|Armstrongites, {{such as the}} Living Church of God, {{believe that}} the Logos and God the Father are co-equal and co-eternal, {{but they do not}} believe that the Holy <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> an actual person, like the Father and the Son. They believe the Holy <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> the Power, Mind, or Character of God, {{depending}} on the context. They teach, [...] "The Holy <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> the very essence, the mind, life and power of God. It is not a <b>Being.</b> The <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> inherent in the Father and the Son, and emanates from Them throughout the entire universe." ...|$|R
25|$|Hantu laut (sea <b>spirits)</b> <b>are</b> animistic water spirits who assist {{fishermen}} and sailors. Until the 1960s, Malays in Trengganu used to regularly pay {{respects to the}} sea spirits through the puja pantai or puja laut ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Rectified spirit, an {{azeotropic}} {{composition of}} 96% ethanol containing 4% water, {{is used instead}} of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes. Wine <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> about 94% ethanol (188 proof). The impurities {{are different from those}} in 95% (190 proof) laboratory ethanol.|$|E
25|$|While the Portuguese wine Port is {{similarly}} {{made with a}} mutage halting the fermentation, there are some distinct differences in how vin doux naturels like Maurys are made. For one, the fortifying spirits used in Port are of a lower alcohol strength (traditionally 77%) while those used for vin doux naturels are often 95%. The <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> then added to the VdNs later in the fermentation process than with Port. More of the fortifying <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> often used in Port production, representing up to a fifth (20%) of the finished volume of wine compared to the spirits accounting for around 15% of the finished volume of the VdNs. This means that most VdNs contain less water and alcohol than the typical Port wine.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, These {{three are}} {{distinct}}. 1. So distinct {{as to be}} more than one, only: There are three. 2. So distinct as to subsist without depending. The Father is true God, the Son is true God, the <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> true God. Yet the Father is one, the Son <b>is</b> one, the <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> one: The Father is one of himself, the Son is one by the Father, the <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> one from them both. Yet the Father is not above the Son, nor the Spirit inferior to either: The Father is God, the Son <b>is</b> God, the <b>Spirit</b> <b>is</b> God.|$|R

50|$|Coconut brandy {{is a clear}} {{distilled}} spirit {{produced from}} borassus flower nectar and matured in wood casks. The <b>spirit</b> <b>is</b> produced by Mendis Brandy, a Georgia, U.S.-based company. The <b>spirit</b> <b>is</b> not made with coconuts.|$|R
25|$|Negative <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to be irritated or angered by human presence. Negative <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> responsible for accidents, illnesses, and deaths befalling those who have had contact with their habitation. Thus even today, haunted places are especially sacrosanct, {{to the point that}} many people refuse to develop perfectly suited properties or live next to beautiful areas because they have been judged to be inhabited by a negative spirit. An especially famous example of this is the half-finished Nakagusuku Hotel ruins that stand within walking distance from Nakagusuku Castle in Kitanakagusuku, which was abandoned during its construction as the result of several deaths both on- and off-site and still stands as it was; most Okinawan people will not go near the hotel.|$|E
25|$|Many Wiccans also {{adopt a more}} {{explicitly}} polytheistic or animistic world-view of the universe as being replete with spirit-beings. In many cases these <b>spirits</b> <b>are</b> associated with the natural world, for instance as genius loci, fairies, and elementals. In other cases, such beliefs are more idiosyncratic and atypical; the prominent Wiccan Sybil Leek for instance endorsed a belief in angels.|$|E
25|$|Shamans (known in Malay as dukun or bomoh) {{are said}} {{to be able to make}} use of spirits and demons for either benign or evil purposes.
