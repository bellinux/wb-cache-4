He makes a special effort to invite Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), whom he hopes to win back with a good performance. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is especially hard to convince, since he is still upset {{that he was not}} asked to play the part of Sweeney Todd after his own audition. Andy informs him that no one auditioning got the part of Sweeney Todd, which was instead given to a veteran [...] "world class" [...] actor, and Michael agrees to go.

500|$|Nevertheless, {{like many}} other U.S. media sources, the Times had {{suffered}} from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012. A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that they believed [...] "all or most" [...] of the [...] Timess reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The Timess score was {{comparable to that of}} USA Today. Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's On the Media, writing for The New York Times, says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that [...] "Americans <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation." ...|$|E

500|$|Merton Council {{had been}} recommending that Wimbledon {{move to a}} site in nearby Beddington, but this {{proposal}} fell through soon after the move to Selhurst Park. With the inflation in costs {{brought on by the}} foundation of the FA Premier League in 1992, the club soon began to lose money heavily. Rumours that the groundshare would eventually result in the Dons and the Eagles merging led Hammam to say [...] "I’d rather die and have vultures eat my insides than merge with Crystal Palace". In 1992 the Greyhound Racing Association offered to redevelop Wimbledon Stadium (less than a mile from Plough Lane) into a 15,000-seater dog racing and football ground. Hammam was outraged two years later when the council, attempting to retain the Plough Lane site for public use, refused to sanction its sale for a supermarket redevelopment that Hammam said would finance a new ground at the dog racing site. Hammam angrily declared he would look elsewhere, and threatened to change the club's name and remove the double-headed eagle device, a symbol of Wimbledon Borough, from the team's badge. [...] "We have been betrayed," [...] he told the press. [...] "The council <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> us back, {{but when it comes to}} taking action they don't want to know." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in Salon, David Sirota, a {{progressive}} political commentator compared The Dark Knight Rises {{and the game}} Call of Duty to 1980s popular culture reflecting the political period of the time, accusing them of perpetuating a conservative agenda: [...] "Just as so many 1980s pop culture products reflected {{the spirit of the}} Reagan Revolution's conservative backlash, we are now seeing two blockbuster, genre-shaping products not-so-subtly reflect the Tea Party's rhetorical backlash to the powerful Occupy Wall Street zeitgeist." [...] An article in Variety reported Chuck Dixon, the co-creator of the Bane character, as saying that Bane is [...] "far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street type if you're looking to cast him politically." [...] Catherine Shoard of the center-left British publication The Guardian claimed the film [...] "is a quite audaciously capitalist vision, radically conservative, radically vigilante, that advances a serious, stirring proposal that the wish-fulfilment of the wealthy is to be championed if they <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do good." [...] In contrast, liberal commentator Jonathan Chait opined in New York that [...] "What passes for a right-wing movie these days is The Dark Knight Rises, which submits the rather modest premise that, irritating though the rich may be, actually killing them and taking all their stuff might be excessive." [...] Writing in USA Today, Bryan Alexander called Bane [...] "the ultimate occupier" [...] and reported that Christian Bale was amazed that the script had [...] "foreseen" [...] the Occupy movement.|$|E

You, too, have the need livingly to yield to a more heroic soul, to give yourself. You know you have. And you know it isn't love. It is life-submission. And you know it.

6000|$|No {{one seemed}} {{able to say}} whether he was mistaken or not; and, after waiting a moment, he proceeded: [...] "I feel pretty {{sure that it is}} so in the city {{companies}} and regiments, at any rate, and that if every working-man left them it would not seriously impair their effectiveness. But when the working-men have left the militia, what have they done? They have eliminated the only thing that disqualifies it for prompt and unsparing use against strikers. As long as they are in it we might have our misgivings, but if they were once out of it we should have none. And what would they gain? They {{would not be allowed to}} arm and organize as an inimical force. That was settled once for all in Chicago, in the case of the International Groups. A few squads of policemen would break them up. Why," [...] the banker exclaimed, with his good-humored laugh, [...] "how preposterous they are when you come to look at it! They are in the majority, the immense majority, if you count the farmers, and they prefer to behave as if they were the hopeless minority. They <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> an eight-hour law, and every now and then they strike and try to fight it. Why don't they vote it? They could make it the law in six months by such overwhelming numbers that no one would dare to evade or defy it. They can make any law they want, but they prefer to break such laws as we have. That 'alienates public sympathy,' the newspapers say; but the spectacle of their stupidity and helpless wilfulness is so lamentable that I could almost pity them. If they chose, it would take only a few years to transform our government into the likeness of anything they wanted. But they would rather not have what they want, apparently, if they can only keep themselves from getting it, and they have to work hard to do that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{that is a}} {{criticism}} by the way. Chesterton and Belloc agree with the Socialist that the present world does not give at all what they want. They agree that it fails to do so through a wild derangement of our property relations. They are {{in agreement with the}} common contemporary man (whose creed is stated, I think, not unfairly, but with the omission of certain important articles by Chesterton), that the derangements of our property relations are to be remedied by concerted action and in part by altered laws. The land and all sorts of great common interests must be, if not owned, then at least controlled, managed, checked, redistributed by the State. Our real difference is only about a little more or a little less owning. I do not see how Belloc and Chesterton can stand for anything but a strong State as against those wild monsters of property, the strong, big private owners. The State must be complex and powerful enough to prevent them. State or plutocrat there is really no other practical alternative before the world at the present time. Either we have to let the big financial adventurers, the aggregating capitalist and his Press, in a loose, informal combination, rule the earth, either we have got to stand aside from preventive legislation and leave things to work out on their present lines, or we have to construct a collective organisation sufficiently strong {{for the protection of the}} liberties of the some-day-to-be-jolly common man. So far we go in common. If Belloc and Chesterton are not Socialists, they are at any rate not anti-Socialists. If they <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> an organised Christian State (which involves practically seven-tenths of the Socialist desire), then, in the face of our big common enemies, of adventurous capital, of alien Imperialism, base ambition, base intelligence, and common prejudice and ignorance, I do not mean to quarrel with them politically, so long as they force no quarrel on me. Their organised Christian State is nearer the organised State I want than our present plutocracy. Our ideals will fight some day, and it will be, I know, a first-rate fight, but to fight now is to let the enemy in. When we have got all we want in common, then and only then can we afford to differ. I have never believed that a Socialist Party could hope to form a Government in this country in my lifetime; I believe it less now than ever I did. I don't know if any of my Fabian colleagues entertain so remarkable a hope. But if they do not, then unless their political aim is pure cantankerousness, they must contemplate a working political combination between the Socialist members in Parliament and just that non-capitalist section of the Liberal Party for which Chesterton and Belloc speak. Perpetual opposition is a dishonourable aim in politics; and a man who mingles in political development with no intention of taking on responsible tasks unless he gets all his particular formulae accepted is a pervert, a victim of Irish bad example, and unfit far decent democratic institutions ...|$|E
