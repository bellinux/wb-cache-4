5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a <b>schizocarp</b> {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.|$|E
25|$|<b>Schizocarp</b> fruits {{form from}} a syncarpous ovary {{and do not}} really dehisce, but rather split into {{segments}} {{with one or more}} seeds; they include a number of different forms {{from a wide range of}} families. Carrot seed is an example.|$|E
2500|$|Coriander is {{native to}} regions {{spanning}} from southern Europe and northern Africa to southwestern Asia. It is a soft plant growing to [...] tall. The leaves are variable in shape, broadly lobed {{at the base of}} the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} work was to {{determine}} pathogenicity of three Colletotrichum dematium isolates to caraway. The ef-fect of post-culture liquids and water suspension of conidia on germination of caraway <b>schizocarps</b> was studied in laboratory conditions. The effect of C. dematium on shooting up and heal-thiness of the seedlings {{was carried out in}} the climatic chamber using the method with infested soil and solidified plaster of cul-ture medium overgrown by the mycelium of the pathogen. The studied isolates of fungus made the germination of parts of tested <b>schizocarps</b> impossible. On the other hand, all isolates caused necrosis of germs and roots of the other germinated <b>schizocarps.</b> The method with Colletotrichum dematium post-culture liquids was recognized as the best to a fast estimation of pathogenicity of fungus to caraway. Based on the positive results of pathoge-nicity tests the studied isolates of C. dematium were recognized as pathogenic to caraway. Considering this fact and repeated frequency of isolation of the fungus from various organs of this plant (M a c h o w i c z- S t e f a n i a k, 2010), C. dematium was recognized as a potentially pathogenic species to caraway...|$|R

50|$|Palaua is a genus of malvaceous plants {{native to}} the Andes. It shares with Malope and Kitaibelia the {{property}} of possessing capitate <b>schizocarps,</b> and was formerly classified with them in a subfamily Malopoideae or tribe Malopeae. It is now considered to be {{more closely related to}} Sphaeralcea, and to other Andean mallows.|$|R
50|$|Each plant {{produces}} easily distributable bristle-textured, rosy or white/green fruits {{that eventually}} turn brown when mature. The fruits are <b>schizocarps</b> and then mericarps when split into two. The schizocarpic fruits are dry, remain closed until maturity, and have two pollen-containing chambers. Each mericarp {{of the fruit}} is five-ribbed, making its dispersal highly effective and competitive towards native vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Abutilon grandifolium, or hairy Indian mallow, {{is a large}} shrub that is up to 3 m {{high with}} broad, 3 - 18 cm leave blades.

50|$|The small fruits are pale brown <b>schizocarps</b> {{and have}} an oval shape, {{resembling}} caraway and cumin. It has a bitter and pungent taste, with a flavor similar to anise and oregano. They smell almost exactly like thyme because it also contains thymol, but is more aromatic and less subtle in taste, as well as slightly bitter and pungent. Even {{a small number of}} fruits tends to dominate the flavor of a dish.|$|R
50|$|The fruits are <b>schizocarps</b> of two mericarps {{derived from}} mature fused carpels, often narrow-oblong with 4-5 mm {{in length and}} 1-1.5 mm in diameter. A single seed is formed with each mericarp. When mature, it is {{dispersed}} by wind. The cremocarp of the fruits is narrow-oblong and slightly flat. The oil tubes in the fruit, 3 or 4 vittae, form in wrinkles of ridges of the fruit, while 4 to 8 vittae {{can be found in}} commissure. The plant bears fruit from August to September.|$|R

50|$|A {{mericarp}} is {{a portion}} of the fruit that separates from the ovary to form a distinct locule unit which encloses the seed, usually-nut-like, as in Apiaceae in which the mericarps are joined by a stalk (carpophore). Thus a <b>schizocarp</b> of mericarps is a structure in which the carpels of a single ovary split to form mericarps. A <b>schizocarp</b> of nutlets is derived from a carpel that becomes lobed, and the lobes become nutlets that split apart. Examples include Boraginaceae and most Lamiaceae, where the styles are attached between the ovary lobes.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} small, {{elliptic}} with crenate margins, and turn bright red in winter before dropping. The petiole has 2 small glands at the distal end. The grey-black rough bark is distinctively split into neat rectangles. The catkin-like flowers appear {{in early spring}} before the leaves. Male and female flowers are borne separately on the same tree (monoecious). The small 3-lobed capsules or <b>schizocarps</b> split into three equal indehiscent segments (mericarps or cocci) when ripe; on a warm day this splitting (dehiscence) can sound like a distant fusillade of shots. The seeds are globose with a chartaceous testa.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{quantity}} and quality of the herb material are reduced by pathogenic fungi. In the case of caraway this pathogen is Septoria carvi. In the vegetation periods the fun-gus occurs with varying intensity, which is related to the requirements of life. The present study found that the growth of fungal colonies is possible at the temperatures from 0 to 30 째C, the optimum being from 20 to 25 째C, and sporulation is possible at the temperatures from 10 to 30 째C, with the optimum at 25 째C. It was shown that the most useful medium for the isolation of S. carvi from caraway plants is malt medium and malt medium with decoction of the leaves of this plant. Pycnidia and conidia of the fungus, which are neces-sary to identify the species, are formed the fastest on the malt medium with decoction of the leaves or <b>schizocarps</b> of caraway and on PDA medium and it is these substrates that should be used for the cultivation of S. carvi.

50|$|The parsnip is a {{biennial}} {{plant with}} a rosette of roughly hairy leaves {{that has a}} pungent odor when crushed. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible, cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are cylindrical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tends to be favored by food processors as it is more resistant to breakage. The plant's apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves, each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins. The lower leaves have short stems, the upper ones are stemless, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The leaves are once- or twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins; they grow up to 40 cm long.The petioles are grooved and have sheathed bases. The floral stem develops {{in the second year}} and can grow to more than 150 cm tall. It is hairy, grooved, hollow (except at the nodes), and sparsely branched. It has a few stalkless, single-lobed leaves measuring 5 to 10 cm long that are arranged in opposite pairs. The yellow flowers are in a loose, compound umbel measuring 10 to 20 cm in diameter. Six to 25 straight pedicels are present, each measuring 2 to 5 cm that support the umbellets (secondary umbels). The umbels and umbellets usually have no upper or lower bracts. The flowers have tiny sepals or lack them entirely, and measure about 3.5 mm. They consist of five yellow petals that are curled inward, five stamens, and one pistil. The fruits, or <b>schizocarps,</b> are oval and flat, with narrow wings and short, spreading styles. They are colored straw to light brown, and measure 4 to 8 mm long.|$|R
