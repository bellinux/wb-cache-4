40|$|A 5 -year-old boy and {{his father}} with Pfeiffer {{syndrome}} are described. They had acrocephaly, hypertelorism, antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures, protrusion of the eyes, large and broad nose, small mandible, irregularly placed teeth, additional upper canine, high-arched palate, partial syndactyly of fingers and toes, brachydactyly of toes, valgus deformity of hypertrophied triangular great toes, broad phalanges of the great toes and broad first metatarsals, accessory epiphyses lateral to the interphalangeal joint of the great toes, and normal intelligence. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} family in which the syndrome is almost totally confined to the head and feet [...] it spares the upper limbs except for partial <b>skin</b> syndactyly <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> [...] and <b>the</b> third family showing inheritance through three successive generations suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The published papers are reviewed and the clinical and x-ray signs are tabulated...|$|R

40|$|When {{grasping}} {{an object}} using three fingered end-effectors, a certain geometrical entity {{can be created}} based on the grasping points and a definition of an auxiliary point. This geometric configuration {{is referred to as}} the invariant configuration of <b>the</b> three <b>fingered</b> grasp. This paper exploits the geometric properties of such configuration using screw theory and inner product spaces. The results are shown to present themselves as an elegant and efficient framework in calculating <b>the</b> friction forces <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> and <b>the</b> grasped object and/or in defining the instantaneous motion of the finger-tips in accomplishing the desired motion of the grasped object. 1 Introduction When grasping objects with a dexterous mechanical end-effector, <b>the</b> contact <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> hand and the object must satisfy a number of conditions 1; 2; 3. These range from the forceclosure to stability conditions such as, ensuring that the grasped object does not slip <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers.</b> Manipulat [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Small {{patches of}} {{wrinkled}} skin were also preserved, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> and <b>the</b> styliform bone, indicating that unlike all other known dinosaurs, the planes of Yi qi were formed by a skin membrane rather than flight feathers. <b>The</b> membrane stretched <b>between</b> <b>the</b> shorter <b>fingers,</b> <b>the</b> elongated third <b>finger,</b> <b>the</b> styliform bone, and possibly {{connected to the}} torso, though the inner part of the wing membrane was not preserved in the only known fossil. This {{would have given the}} animal an appearance similar to modern bats, in an example of convergent evolution. However, in bats, <b>the</b> membrane stretches <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> only, no styliform wrist bone being present. Ossified styliform bones are found, however, in the wings of some modern gliding animals like flying squirrels. The Greater glider, as well as the prehistoric gliding rodent Eomys quercyi, has a long cartilaginous styliform element.|$|R

5000|$|An {{electrostatic}} force {{is created by}} applying a time varying voltage between an electrode and an insulated ground plane. When a finger scans over an insulated plate with a time varying voltage, <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> works as <b>the</b> induced ground plane. The induced static electricity creates an electric force field <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> and <b>the</b> surface. [...] A parallel-plate capacitor model {{can be used to}} approximate the skin-surface interface. The electrode acts as one plate, while the conductive subcutaneous layer in the skin acts as the other, thus representing a hybrid natural/artificial electrostatic actuator. The following equation approximates the {{electrostatic force}} experienced <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> and <b>the</b> electrode.|$|R
