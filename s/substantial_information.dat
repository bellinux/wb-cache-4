5|$|With Gustave Bertrand's 1973 {{publication}} of his Enigma, <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> {{about the origins of}} Ultra began to seep out; and with F. W. Winterbotham's 1974 best-seller, The Ultra Secret, the dam began to burst. Still, many aspiring authors were not averse to filling gaps in their information with whole-cloth fabrications. Rejewski fought a gallant (if, into the 21st century, not entirely successful) fight to get the truth before the public. He published a number of papers on his cryptologic work and contributed generously to articles, books, and television programs. He was interviewed by scholars, journalists, and television crews from Poland, East Germany, the United States, Britain, Sweden, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Brazil.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} source for this period in Kentish history is The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in 731 by Bede, a Benedictine monk from Northumbria. Bede was primarily {{interested in the}} Christianization of England, but he also provides <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> about secular history, including the reigns of Æthelberht and Eadbald. One of Bede's correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine's) in Canterbury. A series of related texts known as the Legend of St Mildrith provides additional information about events {{in the lives of}} Eadbald's children and throws some light on Eadbald himself. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals assembled in about 890 in the kingdom of Wessex, also provides information. Other sources include papal letters, regnal lists of the kings of Kent, and early charters. Charters were documents drawn up to record grants of land by kings to their followers or to the church, and they provide some of the earliest documentary sources in England. None survive in original form from Eadbald's reign, but some later copies exist.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{for this}} period in Kentish history include the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in 731 by Bede, a Northumbrian monk. Bede was {{interested}} primarily in England's Christianization. Since Æthelberht {{was the first}} Anglo-Saxon king to convert to Christianity, Bede provides more <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> about him than about any earlier king. One of Bede's correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine's) in Canterbury. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals assembled c. 890 {{in the kingdom of}} Wessex, mentions several events in Kent during Æthelberht's reign. Further mention of events in Kent occurs in the late sixth century history of the Franks by Gregory of Tours. This is the earliest surviving source to mention any Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Some of Pope Gregory the Great's letters concern the mission of St. Augustine to Kent in 597; these letters also mention the state of Kent and its relationships with neighbours. Other sources include regnal lists of the kings of Kent and early charters (land grants by kings to their followers or to the church). Although no originals survive from Æthelberht's reign, later copies exist. A law code from Æthelberht's reign also survives.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the threat}} of {{punishment}} and the potential scrutiny he feared from his peers within the scientific community, Newton may have deliberately left his work on alchemical subjects unpublished. Newton was well known as being highly sensitive to criticism, such as the numerous instances when he was criticized by Robert Hooke, and his admitted reluctance to publish any <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> regarding calculus before 1693. A perfectionist by nature, Newton also refrained from publication of material that he felt was incomplete, as evident from a 38-year gap from Newton's conception of calculus in 1666 and its final full publication in 1704, which would ultimately lead to the infamous Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy.|$|E

They enlisted a fellow Dubliner and IRA man to infiltrate the barracks by joining the British Army.

25|$|The {{pioneering}} {{nature of}} Ricketts' book may be appreciated {{by comparison with}} another classic work, now in its fourth edition, that was published two years later, in 1941: Light's Manual, by S. F. Light, of the University of California, Berkeley. Light's Manual is technical, difficult for laymen, but essential for specialists. On the other hand, Ricketts' Between Pacific Tides is readable, full of observations and side comments, and readily accessible to anyone with a genuine interest in seashore life. It cannot serve as a thorough manual to marine invertebrates, but it addresses the common and conspicuous animals in a style that invites and educates newcomers and offers <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> for experienced biologists. It is not organized according to taxonomic classification, but instead by habitat. Thus, crabs are not all treated in the same chapter; crabs of the rocky shore, high in the intertidal, are in a separate section from crabs of lower intertidal zones or sandy beaches.|$|E

500|$|Being {{distant from}} the Sun and major planets, Kuiper belt objects {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} unaffected by the processes that have shaped and altered other Solar System objects; thus, determining their composition would provide <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> on the makeup of the earliest Solar System. Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is spectroscopy. When an object's light is broken into its component colors, an image akin to a rainbow is formed. This image is called a spectrum. Different substances absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called absorption lines) appear where the substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every element or compound has its own unique spectroscopic signature, and by reading an object's full spectral [...] "fingerprint", astronomers can determine its composition.|$|E
500|$|Half-Life: Opposing Force {{was first}} {{announced}} by developer Gearbox Software on April 15, 1999. In their press release, founder Randy Pitchford stated that [...] "our number one {{goal is to}} preserve the integrity of Half-Life and provide new experiences that expand upon the sensation of the original", and also announced that the expansion pack would allow the player to play {{as one of the}} soldiers featured in the original game. The name Opposing Force has a double meaning, referring both {{to the fact that the}} player is now one of the enemies in the original game, as well as to Newton's third law of motion. In a later interview, Pitchford stated that he believed that Valve Software offered Gearbox the chance to make a Half-Life expansion was from a wish [...] "to focus on their future titles". In addition, Pitchford commented that Valve and Gearbox had agreed not to [...] "severely modify" [...] the game engine used by Half-Life and Opposing Force as it [...] "risks breaking all of the wonderful work" [...] that the game's custom content community was creating. <b>Substantial</b> <b>information</b> on Opposing Forces development direction, as well as new locations, characters and story were revealed at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo convention.

2500|$|Acorn {{woodpeckers}} provide <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> on breeding systems {{because they}} practice monogamy, polyandry, and polygyny. In polyandry {{the presence of}} more male breeders in acorn woodpeckers has shown that females reproduce the optimal clutch size and that with paternity sharing between males it is behaviorally more stable increasing male and female fitness. As opposed to polygyny, {{where it has been}} observed that polygynous females that lay a large number of eggs exceeding the optimal clutch size reduces the fitness of the group. Polygynous trios compared to polyandrous trios showed that having more eggs lowered the group fitness. Chao (1997) studies using acorn woodpeckers suggest that other mating systems are practiced at a lower rate when compared to polyandry because it is polyandry that can maximize the fitness of males and females when obtaining optimal clutch size. In polyandrous mating, optimal clutch size is obtained because there is only one female and it becomes more stable when all members remain together.|$|E

2500|$|The {{failure of}} Galileo high-gain antenna meant that data storage {{to the tape}} {{recorder}} for later compression and playback was absolutely crucial {{in order to obtain}} any <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> from the flybys of Jupiter and its moons. In October 1995, Galileo four-track, 114-megabyte digital tape recorder, which was manufactured by Odetics Corporation, remained stuck in rewind mode for 15 hours before engineers learned what had happened and sent commands to shut it off. Though the recorder itself was still in working order, the malfunction possibly damaged a length of tape {{at the end of the}} reel. This section of tape was subsequently declared [...] "off limits" [...] to any future data recording, and was covered with 25 more turns of tape to secure the section and reduce any further stresses, which could tear it. Because it happened only weeks before Galileo entered orbit around Jupiter, the anomaly prompted engineers to sacrifice data acquisition of almost all of the Io and Europa observations during the orbit insertion phase, in order to focus solely on recording data sent from the Jupiter probe descent.|$|E
2500|$|A former RUC {{assistant}} chief constable told the Tribunal that Breen and Buchanan {{had been warned}} against going to Dundalk at a meeting on 16 March 1989, but that they had disobeyed orders.

The security conference with Gardaí in Dundalk {{had been set up}} after a dinner at Stormont House on 6 March, which had been attended by both Breen and Buchanan. It was there that Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Tom King had suggested the meeting after receiving reports from a British Army colonel about the cross-border smuggling activities of a well-known IRA man whose property straddled the Armagh/Louth border. According to Sgt Alan Mains, Breen was [...] "specifically directed to speak with the Guards [...] and the Army, and {{to come up with some}} kind of reply for the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State".

In the year 1778 the provision for the investment from the revenues and from the monopolies stood very high. It was estimated at a million four hundred thousand pounds; and of this it appears that a great deal was realized. But this was the high flood-tide of the investment; for in that year they announce its probable decline, and that such extensive supplies could not be continued. The advances to the Board of Trade became less punctual, and many disputes arose about the time of making them. However, knowing that all their credit at home depended on the investment, or upon an opinion of its magnitude, whilst they repeat their warning of a probable deficiency, and that their [...] "finances bore an unfavorable aspect," [...] in the year 1779 they rate their investment still higher. But their payments becoming less and less regular, and the war carrying away all the supplies, at length Mr. Hastings, in December, 1780, denounced sentence of approaching dissolution to this system, and tells the Directors that [...] "he bore too high a respect for their characters to treat them with the management of a preparatory and gradual introduction to an unpleasing report: that it is the only <b>substantial</b> <b>information</b> he shall have to convey in that letter."
