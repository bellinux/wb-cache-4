5|$|The <b>Shuttle</b> fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the Space <b>Shuttle</b> Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's Space <b>Shuttle</b> program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space <b>Shuttle</b> Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.|$|E

5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} <b>Shuttle</b> Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space <b>shuttle</b> fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the <b>shuttle.</b> During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} airport services are further transportation connections, including rail networks, taxi and <b>shuttle</b> services at curbside pick-up areas, and public buses. Large areas for automobile parking, often in co-located multi-storey car parks, are also typical to find at airports. Some airports provide <b>shuttle</b> services to parking garages for passengers and airport employees. Due to the very large scale of international airports, some have constructed <b>shuttle</b> services to transport passengers between terminals. Such systems operate for example, in Singapore Changi Airport and Zurich Airport.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street <b>Shuttle</b> {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the <b>shuttle</b> will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the <b>shuttle</b> mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this part of the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the <b>shuttle.</b> The cost of this part of the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E
50|$|Some believe tatting {{originated}} over 200 years ago, often citing <b>shuttles</b> seen in 18th-century {{paintings of}} women such as Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Princess Marie Adélaïde of France, and Anne, Countess of Albemarle. A close inspection of those paintings, however, {{shows that the}} <b>shuttles</b> in question are too large to be tatting <b>shuttles,</b> {{and that they are}} actually knotting <b>shuttles.</b> There is no documentation of or example of tatted lace that dates prior to 1800.

2500|$|The revamp of Rapid KL {{bus service}} {{involved}} redrawing all its routes and reorganising them {{based on the}} [...] "hub and spoke" [...] concept. Four types of bus services were created, namely express routes (EKSPRES), city <b>shuttles</b> (BANDAR), trunk routes (UTAMA) and local <b>shuttles</b> (TEMPATAN). Buses are labelled with a number and a prefix identifying different service, E for express routes, B for city <b>shuttles,</b> U for trunk routes and T for local <b>shuttles.</b> Whereas for Metrobus Nationwide buses and others, they continue using the conventional numbering system which are considered confusing.|$|R
5000|$|Revamp of Rapid KL bus network: Prasarana {{scrapped}} the old Intrakota and Cityliner routes it inherited {{and introduced}} {{three types of}} bus services: City <b>shuttles</b> (BANDAR), trunk buses (UTAMA),, local <b>shuttles</b> (TEMPATAN), and express buses (EKSPRES). City <b>shuttles</b> will operate within Kuala Lumpur's central business district while trunk buses will link hubs {{at the edge of}} the CBD with suburban transportation hubs. At these suburban hubs, local <b>shuttles</b> will radiate out from rail-based public transport stations and fan out to residential areas.

5|$|Each Space <b>Shuttle</b> {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space <b>Shuttle</b> orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space <b>Shuttle</b> external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space <b>Shuttle</b> Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the <b>shuttle</b> to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the <b>shuttle</b> stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractICP 27 is an {{essential}} herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) nuclear protein which regulates viral early and late genes during infection. The exact mechanism by which ICP 27 modulates viral gene expression is unknown, but considerable evidence suggests that it functions posttranscriptionally. In this study, we have asked whether ICP 27, like some other viral and cellular posttranscriptional regulatory proteins, <b>shuttles</b> between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell. Using an interspecies heterokaryon assay, we demonstrate that ICP 27, but not the HSV- 1 nuclear proteins ICP 4 or ICP 8, is an efficient <b>shuttling</b> protein. ICP 27 's <b>shuttling</b> ability {{does not depend on}} viral infection or other HSV- 1 proteins, as it <b>shuttles</b> even when transiently expressed in uninfected cells. To understand the importance of <b>shuttling</b> for ICP 27 's regulatory functions, we examined several mutant forms of ICP 27 to see whether they exhibited altered <b>shuttling.</b> We identified three ICP 27 mutations which partially disrupt <b>shuttling,</b> as well as one mutation, M 15, which completely abrogates this activity. The M 15 mutation alters residues 465 and 466 near the carboxyl terminus of ICP 27 and was previously shown to inactivate ICP 27 's ability to induce certain viral late mRNAs. These results suggest that ICP 27 's nuclear <b>shuttling</b> activity is involved in its viral late gene activation function...|$|R
