40|$|Both {{researchers}} and managers {{have suggested that}} price promotion-induced <b>stockpiling</b> can increase a household’s usage frequency of a product. Empirical evidence of any <b>stockpiling</b> effect, however, is mixed. In reconciling the inconsistent findings of these empirical studies, this paper shows that <b>stockpiling</b> only increases a person’s usage of a product when that person has highly salient thoughts of the product. This model and these findings have critical implications for the advertising versus promotion debate. They suggest that consumer promotions and advertising play a joint and complementary role in increasing usage: promotions by encouraging <b>stockpiling,</b> and advertising by building the salience needed to deplete the <b>stockpiled</b> inventory. 2 How Pantry <b>Stockpiling</b> Influences the Usage Frequency of a Brand Brand managers are witnessing an unprecedented emphasis on sales promotions and on the “stocking up ” and purchase acceleration that such sales promotions encourage. It is critical to understand the consumer behavior issues that influence {{the relationship between a}} household's <b>stockpiling</b> of a product and their usage frequency of it (Helsen and Schmittlein 1992).

40|$|Two manure {{management}} and storage methods, manure <b>stockpiled</b> anaerobically or composted aerobically for 104 days were evaluated. Nitrogen recovery was 85. 7 % and 56. 4 % for <b>stockpiled</b> and composted manure, respectively. Organic nitrogen concentrations were greater for composted manure while ammonium nitrogen concentrations were greater for <b>stockpiled</b> manure. Simulation of hot, dry conditions during field application indicated {{the amount of}} ammonia nitrogen lost from stock¬piled manure was not great enough to offset the total nitrogen recovery advantage of this method. When evaluated on a nutrient basis, <b>stockpiled</b> manure has greater value as a fertilizer compared with composted manure in this study...|$|R

5|$|As {{nuclear weapons}} {{development}} proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, {{and easier to}} store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became more involved in <b>stockpile</b> management and providing administrative, technical and logistical support. It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field agency of the Department of Defense.|$|E
