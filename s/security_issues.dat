40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse if the UN today {{constructs}} the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> and to argue about in which way the organization in that case does so alternatively why it can be said that the UN doesn’t construct the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue.</b> In order to reach this purpose the following questions will be answered: •Does the UN construct the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> today? -If yes, in which way? -If no, why can it be said that the organisation doesn’t? The methods used are qualitative literature studies of policy documents on water from the UN. The focus is to analyze the ideas about water and to apply my theory on the concept of security, which is Barry Buzan’s framework on security, to these ideas. The main results showed that the UN strongly constructs the water issue as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for environments and species and in relatively strong terms also constructs it as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for civilisations. In rare cases the organisation constructs it as a societal <b>security</b> <b>issue,</b> but the UN doesn’t construct the water issue as a military, political or economic <b>security</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} if the Eurozone crisis {{affects the}} composition of security portfolios of households and non-financial firms. Using a unique dataset for all securities holdings by German investors, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the exposure to <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by stressed Eurozone economies in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, to offer the first comparison of how {{these two types of}} investors respond to the European sovereign debt crisis. Difference-in-differences tests show that households, unlike non-financial firms, rebalance their portfoliosby moving from bonds to stocks and from <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by financial institutions to <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by non-financials. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national <b>security</b> <b>issues.</b> The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E

Stations outside the center are unmanned since the 1995, with ticket machines for fare purchase; some stations feature kiosks. A system of turnstiles have been installed, but will never be activated due to <b>security</b> <b>issues.</b> All stations have step-free accessibility through at least one entrance (except the inbound platform at Frøen), and the platform height is aligned with the train cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} Winnipeg {{highlighted}} the chaotic and ill-coordinated management of <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> across Canada, the artificial division between policing organisations {{in the west}} and east of the country, and the absence of a single senior leader for security work. Commissioner Perry recommended creating a new federal police force, ideally by amalgamating the Dominion Police into the existing mounted police force. The mounted police, he argued, were much larger, militarized, experienced and had a proven capacity to carry out secret intelligence work. They were also free from union influence and enjoyed high prestige among the public.|$|E
5|$|With so {{many people}} involved, {{security}} was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the Manhattan Project's <b>security</b> <b>issues.</b> By 1943, {{it was clear that}} the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. The most successful Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs of the British Mission. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades.|$|E

5|$|During the Queen's tenure {{much has}} been done, not only to restore and {{maintain}} {{the fabric of the}} building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing {{a significant portion of the}} Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988–92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> and the castle's role as a working royal palace. In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project will be completed at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected {{when there were}} equipment failures. While there were some problems {{believed to be the}} result of careless or disgruntled employees, there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage. However, on 10 March 1945, a Japanese fire balloon struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down. With so many people involved, security was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the project's <b>security</b> <b>issues.</b> By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. Lieutenant Colonel Boris T. Pash, the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command, investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley, Haakon Chevalier, about passing information to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the development, the game was intended to be released on the PlayStation 2. In May 2005, however, after the positive reception of the tech demo of Final Fantasy VII, the team decided to move the game to the PlayStation 3 and developed it with the new Crystal Tools engine, a seventh generation multiplatform game engine created by Square Enix for its next generation games. Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to XIII. Another factor in the platform move was the delayed release of Final Fantasy XII, which came out a very short time before the release of the PlayStation 3. A PC port was considered during development, but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform, such as <b>security</b> <b>issues.</b> Final Fantasy XIII was first shown at the 2006 E3 convention. The trailer shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game. Announced alongside the game was Final Fantasy Versus XIII, later retitled as Final Fantasy XV, and the PlayStation Portable game Final Fantasy Type-0, originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, the three of which form the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy series. Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story.|$|E
