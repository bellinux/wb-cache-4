5|$|In {{some ways}} the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} <b>stalemate</b> in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this <b>stalemate</b> were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E

5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. <b>Stalemate</b> was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the <b>stalemate</b> rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for {{different versions of the}} rule).|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} to move has no legal move, {{the game is}} over; it is either a checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal moves) if the king is under attack, or a <b>stalemate</b> (a draw) if the king is not.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} their {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the British War Cabinet began to consider the future of Palestine. By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a <b>stalemate,</b> with two of Britain's Allies and Associated Powers not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were distracted by internal upheaval. A <b>stalemate</b> in southern Palestine was broken by the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{flanking}} maneuver {{was successfully}} deflected and the Battle of Chantilly was fought to a <b>stalemate.</b> But the 21st had suffered severely with 35 percent casualties (38 killed, 76 wounded, 26 missing).|$|E
2500|$|A {{player who}} captures the opponent's sole {{remaining}} king or prince wins the game. Thus {{a player who}} is checkmated or <b>stalemated</b> will lose. This situation extends to [...] "smothered stalemates" [...] where the king's safety is not at issue, but no moves are possible: these also result in a loss for the <b>stalemated</b> player to move {{by the rules of}} The Chess Variant Pages.|$|R
25|$|A <b>stalemated</b> king {{can take}} one of the enemy pieces that would check the king if the king moves.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} shown when {{communication}} between opponents in negotiations is strong, negotiators {{are more likely to}} avoid <b>stalemates.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Frankish {{invasion}} of Croatia, {{the destruction of}} Tarsatica, the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor, and negotiations from 802–815 between the Franks and Byzantines led to a <b>stalemate.</b> The Dalmatian Croatia consequently peacefully accepted a limited Frankish overlordship.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflicts}} in Georgia remained at a <b>stalemate</b> until 2004, when Mikheil Saakashvili {{came to power}} after Georgia's Rose Revolution, which ousted president Eduard Shevardnadze. Restoring South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgian control was a top-priority of Saakashvili's.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of <b>stalemate,</b> Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied Greek army, similar in size and occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line, which then dissolved into a rout.|$|E
5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war on Nazi Germany by Britain and France {{in the aftermath of}} the German invasion of Poland, nine months of <b>stalemate</b> took place along the Western Front. After the Polish Campaign, in October 1939, the planners of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Luftwaffe High Command) and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) turned their attentions to Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's {{study of the}} Campaign of 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting <b>stalemate</b> than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the next}} two decades, the western reaches of Mysore {{remained}} vulnerable to attacks by the Coorg army. In the border district of Yelusavira, the Coorg and Mysore forces fought to a <b>stalemate</b> and, in the end, had to work out a tax sharing arrangement.|$|E
5|$|From 1965 through 1968, {{the war in}} the {{northeast}} followed the monsoon cycle, with dry season communist offensives followed by wet season Hmong (and later Thai) counteroffensives. Each year the conflict slowly escalated. PAVN would introduce more (and better equipped) units and the U.S. would counter by the application of more airpower, producing a strategic <b>stalemate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Remarks: This match {{resulted}} in a rook ending where Black was down a pawn, but both sides were effectively <b>stalemated</b> as neither were able to advance their pawns.|$|R

5|$|In June 1717, Cosimo {{declared}} his {{wish that the}} House of Este should succeed the Electress. Charles VI had previously offered the Grand Duke territorial compensation—in {{the form of the}} State of Presidi—if he chose quickly, but reneged. In 1718, Charles VI repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union of Tuscany and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. Hereafter, a <b>stalemate</b> existed between them.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby islands and end the <b>stalemate</b> that had existed since September 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army planned a major ground {{offensive}} on Guadalcanal for 20–25 October 1942. In support of this offensive, and {{with the hope of}} engaging Allied naval forces, Japanese carriers and other large warships moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. Allied naval forces also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the <b>stalemate</b> and decisively defeating their adversary.|$|E
5|$|Throughout June and July, Bennett's {{battalion}} {{occupied the}} front line {{during a period of}} reduced tempo fighting as a <b>stalemate</b> developed. On 7 August, when the Allies launched their August Offensive to break the <b>stalemate,</b> the 6th Battalion was involved in one of the supporting attacks {{at the start of the}} Battle of Sari Bair. While the best known attack was made by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at the Nek, the 6th was required to make a similar attack against a neighbouring Turkish position known as German Officers' Trench from which machine guns enfiladed the Australian positions as far north as the Nek. Two attempts to capture the trench failed. A third attempt was organised and Bennett resolved to lead it himself but the commander of the 1st Division, Major General Harold Walker, after consulting with the corps commander, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, agreed to abandon the attack. The 6th Battalion's losses totalled 80 killed and 66 wounded.|$|E
50|$|In the {{standard}} game, {{the player who}} captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner. Alternatively, <b>stalemating</b> the enemy's pieces by not allowing them to move is a win for a player.|$|R
25|$|This diagram {{shows an}} example of how having the pawn makes things worse for Black (here Black's pawn is past the Troitsky line), by making Black have a move {{available}} instead of being <b>stalemated.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{decision-making}} groups {{the tendency}} to split two against two can lead to frustrating <b>stalemates.</b> Differences can be resolved more easily if the group starts out with three or five rather than four members.|$|R
