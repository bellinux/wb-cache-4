In this study the mechanical properties which are important in materials selection in mechanical design are investigated.

40|$|Materials {{to be used}} in {{thermal power}} plants have to resist creep {{deformation}} for time periods up to 30 years. The role of alloying elements for creep strength of 9 - 12 % Cr steels is analysed. The creep strength in these steels relies on minor additions of alloying elements. Precipitates give rise to the main strengthening and remaining elements produce <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>hardening.</b> Nucleation, growth and coarsening of particles are predicted by thermodynamic modelling. Phase fractions and size distributions of M 23 C 6 carbides, MX carbonitrides and Laves phase are presented. The size distributions are needed {{in order to determine the}} particle hardening during creep. At elevated temperatures the climb mobility is so high that the dislocations can climb across particles instead of passing by making Orowan loops. By solving Fick's second law the concentration profile around a moving dislocation can be determined. The results show an accumulation of solutes around the dislocation that slows down dislocation movement. When Laves phase grows a decrease in creep strength is observed due to a larger loss in <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>hardening</b> than strength increase by particle hardening. <b>Solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>hardening</b> also gives an explanation of the low dislocation climb mobility in 9 - 12 % Cr steels.

The {{effect of}} Hf {{additions}} to single- and two-phase titanium aluminide alloys was investigated by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, metallographic characterization by scanning electron microscopy, and mechanical testing.

There is a relatively large size misfit between Hf and Ti atoms, which provides a good potential for <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>hardening.</b> Hf additions {{in the amount of}} 2 and 5 at. % significantly strengthen α 2 +γ alloys, whereas the effect in single-phase γ alloys is almost negligible. This observation, together with structural characterization, gives rise to the assumption that Hf additions do not lead to significant <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>hardening.</b> Thus, the strengthening of α 2 +γ alloys by Hf additions was mainly attributed to structural changes, which are probable associated with a shift of the phase boundaries in the Ti-Al system.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} microstructure of Ti(C, N) based cermet materials used in cutting tool applications. Several techniques have been used to study the microstructure of cermets, in particular transmission electron micro-scopy in combi-na-tion with energy dispersive X-ray analysis and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, energy-filtered transmission electron micro-scopy, atom-probe field-ion microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The carbon content of (Ti, W, Ta, Mo) (C, N) -(Co, Ni) cermet materials was found to control the dissolution of metal carbides and carbonitrides in the binder. The forma-tion of heavy (Ti, W, Ta) (C, N) cores was favoured by a high carbon con-tent, whereas a high amount of undissolved Ti(C, N) cores were found in the low carbon material. The perfor-mance of cermet materials was found to depend on the detailed microstructure in a complex way. Both a <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>hardened</b> binder phase and a high volume fraction of heavy cores seemed to be advan-ta-geous for a high wear resistance. Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy was found to be a very powerful technique for cermet investigations. Elemental maps provide the elemental distribu-tion and can be used to extract quantitative phase information. A comparison between atom-probe analysis and electron energy-loss spectroscopy showed that quantitative microanalysis of carbon and nitrogen in cermet carbonitride phases can be accurately performed in the transmission electron microscope. The formation of the microstructure of a Ti(C, N) -TiN-WC-Co cermet was studied from interrupted sintering experiments. The binder acts as the transport medium both in its solid and liquid state. Before melting the binder was found to be nanocrystalline. The inner rim repre-cipitates from the binder onto titanium carbonitride cores already during solid-state sintering, whereas the outer rim forms during liquid phase sintering. At the sintering temperature, grain growth is mainly due to outer rim formation enabled by preferen-tial dissolution of small carbonitride grains in contact with the binder phase. Post-sintering heat-treatments in a nitrogen atmosphere can be used to create gradient structured cermet materials. The high nitrogen activity causes dissolution of tungsten-rich phases in the surface zone, as well as diffusion of tungsten and cobalt inwards and of titanium towards the surface. During the heat-treatment, a nitrogen-rich titanium carbonitride phase reprecipitates onto carbonitride grains in the surface zone, often as irregularly shaped surrounding layers. This phase is responsible for the dramatically im-proved wear resistance of the nitrided cermet, probably by obstructing grain boundary sliding and thereby restricting plastic deformation...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium in {{solution}} in the ferrite in ferrite/pearlite steels {{has been found}} to have little influence on strength of the ferrite probably because up-till recently it has been added in very small amounts (0 ˙ 02 - 0 ˙ 08 wt-%Al) as a grain refining addition. There is indeed some doubt in the literature as to whether Al can solid solution harden. This lack of knowledge has not been important while Al additions are small but recently Al has been added in much greater amounts 0 ˙ 5 - 2 % in some new grades of transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels. These steels have often an essentially ferritic structure with retained austenite and bainitic ferrite.

Steels with varying Al levels from 0 ˙ 02 to ∼ 2 % at two C levels, 0 ˙ 02 and 0 ˙ 1 % were tensile tested after hot rolling so as to determine the <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>hardening</b> effect of Al. It was found in the 0 ˙ 1 %C steel that some of the pearlite transformed to martensite on raising the Al level to 1 % and this resulted in preyielding and lower strength levels than would have been obtained from a ferrite/pearlite structure. However, when the Al level was kept to the maximum allowable before martensite formed a marked <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> <b>hardening</b> by Al was observed. Hall-Petch plots were also obtained from steels in which martensite was not present and it was found that a 1 %Al addition increased the yield strength by 70 - 80 MPa and this increase was not dependent on the grain size as has been found for Si. It can be concluded that Al is a substantial solid solution hardener of steel but the strengthening effect of Al is often obscured at low additions by its ability to remove nitrogen from solution and at high additions by its tendency to favour martensite formation and cause preyielding of the ferrit...|$|E

The processing condition employed in this study provided micron-sized grains with a strong [111] preferential orientation along the extrusion direction and a bimodal size distribution of the icosahedral nano-quasicrystalline precipitates. Both were deemed to be a significant contributor to the high yield strength observed. The addition of pure Al fibres was found to decrease the yield strength linearly with increasing Al content, and to augment the ductility of the composites...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solution</b> <b>hardening</b> of Al–Si alloys at room {{temperature}} was investigated by tensile tests of several aluminum alloys containing various amounts of Si in solution but fabricated from the same commercially pure base material. It is found that Si has a weak strengthening effect but {{a significant impact on}} the work hardening. The strengthening was found to be very sensitive to water quenching, which enhances the solute strengthening. Despite the low strengthening effect, the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect was clearly observed during the tension of an alloy containing 0. 4 at% Si, suggesting the occurrence of dynamic strain ageing due to surprisingly low levels of Si in <b>solid</b> <b>solution...</b>|$|R
