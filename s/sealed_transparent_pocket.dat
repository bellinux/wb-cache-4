30|$|The vermicompost used in {{the present}} work was {{generated}} from paper waste and the epigeic species, Eudrilus eugeniae. As paper waste is almost entirely cellulosic, with only traces of elements other than C, H, and O, the feed was spiked with 9  % w/w of cow dung to provide NPK and other nutrients in adequate amounts. The vermicomposting was accomplished with a high-rate process recently developed by the author’s group [23]. The vermireactors were fabricated with aluminum sheets and each had a volume of 135  l (15  cm height with surface area 150  ×  60  cm). The vermicast was harvested after 30  days. One part of it was stored in two types of packs: (a) airtight <b>sealed</b> <b>transparent</b> polyethylene bags of 20  μm thickness (AUD) and (b) partially sealed nylon mesh (0.3  mm) bags (PUD). Both types of bags were 25  cm long and 18  cm wide, each capable of holding half kg of vermicompost. Another part of the casts was pre-dried for 24  h at room temperature (29  ±  4  °C) and stored in both airtight <b>sealed</b> <b>transparent</b> polyethylene bags (APD) and partially sealed nylon mesh bags (PPD). In each set, 36 packs were utilized; overall 144 packs were studied. All storage was at room temperature (29  ±  4  °C) as this is the temperature at which vermicast is handled in the region where the authors work. Three packs of vermicast were taken once in a week for physical and biochemical analysis from each storage.|$|R

In addition, tritium concentrations indicate that pine trees (Pinus sylvestris) switch water source from soil water in the winter to groundwater in the summer.

50|$|The {{goal was}} to obtain the {{greatest}} imaging area in the smallest cylindrical volume using a consumer flatbed scanner. Typical flatbed scanners image an area of about 220 x 300 mm (660 cm2), so a system had to be found which could be reconfigured to fit inside a <b>sealed</b> <b>transparent</b> capsule. There are two basic imaging methods in modern flatbed scanners. From the 1980s to the late-1990s the market was dominated by systems that could capture an image from any depth of field. Most such digital imaging devices used a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) array. In a CCD, discrete dots of photosensitive material produce a specific charge based on the intensity of light hitting it. A CCD does not detect colour. In this technology, a scene is illuminated, a narrow band of reflected light from the scene passes through a slit (to eliminate light coming from other directions), is then concentrated by an array of mirrors (typically folded into a box) into a prism typically a few centimetres in length. The prism splits the light into its constituent colours. Small CCD arrays are carefully placed {{at the point where}} the primary colours are sharply focused. The separate colour intensities are combined to composite values and recorded by the computer (or scanner electronic assemblies) as a line of pixels. The moving scan head then advances a short distance to gather the next line of the scene. Thus resolution in one axis is determined by CCD array size and focused optics, while the other axis’ resolution is determined by the smallest reliable step the scan head advancing motor can make. The optical assemblies of this type of scanner are fairly robust to vibration, but the traditional light source (a cold cathode tube of balanced colour temperature) is not. It was therefore replaced with an array of solid-state white light emitting diodes (LEDs). Another advantage of this replacement is that the sources could be alternated between white light and ultraviolet (UV) of about 370 nm wavelength. This UV light source allowed detection of visibly fluorescing materials (typically tracer minerals or hydrocarbons) by the prototype.A suitable scan head model that could be reconfigured to fit within an 80 mm diameter cylinder was located, and the scanner’s standard stepper motor was modified to fit within the same space. The entire unit was then mounted on a stainless steel pivot and rotated by a spring-loaded friction wheel pressing against the inner wall of the cylinder. Since the perimeter of the cylinder (250 mm) was smaller than the typical scan path (300 mm) the motor gearing was reduced to improve along-path scan resolution, the resulting change in image geometry was relatively easy to correct in the image capture software. The resulting assembly is shown in Figure 8.|$|R

25|$|Platinum coins are {{a popular}} investment, {{and each year}} {{the number of such}} coins sold by Sberbank of Russia {{increases}} by 30–50%. Most experts agree that such investments should have a long-term character, as the rise of the platinum price is relatively slow– about 80% over the last 5 years, except for a rapid rise followed by decline in 2008. Also, whereas most banks can sell platinum coins, only a few buy them, as this requires evaluation by an experienced professional. For example, only 5% of offices of Sberbank (the major bank of Russia) in the capital city of Moscow redeem precious metal coins. The selling price is also much affected by visible scratches, spots, patina, and other defects introduced by bad handling. For this reason, most bullion coins are <b>sealed</b> in <b>transparent</b> plastic right after removal from the press. They are then stored in a dry room with relative humidity below 80% and at temperatures between 15 and 40°C. If a coin is removed from its plastic seal, it is recommended not to store it in PVC albums, as PVC molecules gradually break down, releasing organochlorine compounds which produce patina on the coins. These compounds may also form acids by reacting with moisture. Unlike silver, platinum does not corrode. However, as is true for all unprotected coins, platinum coins are prone to contamination which can be caused even by washing with (chlorine-containing) tap water.|$|R

High suction is continued until no more material is drained, usually after 7 ± 8 days. We have treated 15 patients by this method with good results; only in one case a further debridement was necessary with second inten-tion healing.
