40|$|AbstractThe human {{visual system}} encodes the {{chromatic}} signals conveyed {{by the three}} types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This opponency is thought to reduce redundant information by decorrelating the photoreceptor signals. Correlations in the receptor signals are caused by the substantial overlap of the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the receptors, {{but it is not clear}} to what extent the properties of natural spectra contribute to the correlations. To investigate the influences of natural spectra and photoreceptor <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> we attempted to find linear codes with minimal redundancy for trichromatic images assuming human cone <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> or hypothetical non-overlapping cone sensitivities, respectively. The resulting properties of basis functions are similar in both cases. They are non-orthogonal, show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance edges) and along chromatic directions, and they achieve a highly efficient encoding of natural chromatic signals. Thus, color opponency arises for the encoding of human cone signals, i. e. with strongly overlapping <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> but also under the assumption of non-overlapping <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Our results suggest that color opponency may in part be a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the cone <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities...</b>|$|R

There {{have been a}} number of studies to estimate camera response functions (gamma function), and vignetting effect from images. However less attention has been paid to camera <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and white balance settings. This is unfortunate, since those two properties significantly affect image colors. Motivated by this, a method to estimate camera <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and white balance setting jointly from images with sky regions is introduced. The basic idea is to use the sky regions to infer the sky spectra. Given sky images as the input and assuming the sun direction with respect to the camera viewing direction can be extracted, the proposed method estimates the turbidity of the sky by fitting the image intensities to a sky model. Subsequently, it calculates the sky spectra from the estimated turbidity. Having the sky RGB values and their corresponding spectra, the method estimates the camera <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> together with the white balance setting. Precomputed basis functions of camera <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> are used in the method for robust estimation.

25|$|The opsins (photopigments) {{present in}} the L and M cones are encoded on the X chromosome; {{defective}} encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of color blindness. The OPN1LW gene, which codes for the opsin {{present in the}} L cones, is highly polymorphic (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants {{in a sample of}} 236 men). A very small percentage of women may have an extra type of color receptor because they have different alleles for the gene for the L opsin on each X chromosome. X chromosome inactivation means that while only one opsin is expressed in each cone cell, both types occur overall, and some women may therefore show a degree of tetrachromatic color vision. Variations in OPN1MW, which codes the opsin expressed in M cones, appear to be rare, and the observed variants have no effect on <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} birds are tetrachromatic, with {{dedicated}} cone cells for perceiving wavelengths in the ultraviolet and violet regions of the light spectrum. These cells contain a combination of short wave sensitive (SWS1) opsins, SWS1-like opsins (SWS2), and long-wave filtering carotenoid pigments for selectively filtering and receiving light between 300 and 400 nm. There {{are two types of}} short wave color vision in birds: violet sensitive (VS) and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS). Single nucleotide substitutions in the SWS1 opsin sequence are responsible blue-shifting the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the opsin from violet sensitive (λmax = 400) to ultraviolet sensitive (λmax = 310-360). This is the proposed evolutionary mechanism by which ultraviolet vision originally arose. The major clades of birds that have UVS vision are Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous), Charadriiformes (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids), Trogoniformes (trogons), Psittaciformes (parrots), and Passeriformes (perching birds, representing {{more than half of all}} avian species).|$|E

40|$|Colour {{vision and}} colour signals are {{important}} to aquatic animals, but light scattering and absorption by water distorts spectral stimuli. To investigate the performance of colour vision in water, and to suggest how photoreceptor <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and body colours might evolve for visual communication, we model the effects of changes in viewing distance and depth on the appearance of fish colours for three teleosts: a barracuda, Syphraena helleri, which is dichromatic, and two damselfishes, Chromis verater and C. hanui, which are trichromatic. We assume that photoreceptors light-adapt to the background, thereby implementing the von Kries transformation, which can largely account for colour constancy in humans and other animals, including fish. This transformation does not however compensate for light scattering over variable viewing distances, which {{in less than a}} metre seriously impairs dichromatic colour vision, and makes judgement of colour saturation unreliable for trichromats. The von Kries transformation does substantially offset colour shifts caused by changing depth, so that from depths of 0 to 30 m modelled colour changes (i. e. failures of colour constancy) are sometimes negligible. However, the magnitudes and directions of remaining changes are complex, depending upon the specific <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the receptors and the reflectance spectra. This predicts that when judgement of colour is important, the spectra of signalling colours and photoreceptor <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> should be evolutionarily linked, with the colours dependent on photoreceptor <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> and vice versa...|$|R

Many ants are highly visual animals, however, and use vision extensively for navigation.

2500|$|The {{human eye}} with normal vision has {{three kinds of}} cone cells that sense light, having peaks of <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in short ("S", [...] – [...] ), middle ("M", [...] – [...] ), and long ("L", [...] – [...] ) wavelengths. These cone cells {{underlie}} human color perception in conditions of medium and high brightness; in very dim light color vision diminishes, and the low-brightness, monochromatic [...] "night vision" [...] receptors, denominated [...] "rod cells", become effective. Thus, three parameters corresponding to levels of stimulus of the three kinds of cone cells, in principle describe any human color sensation. Weighting a total light power spectrum by the individual spectral sensitivities of the three kinds of cone cells renders three effective values of stimulus; these three values compose a tristimulus specification of the objective color of the light spectrum. The three parameters, denoted [...] "S", [...] "M", and [...] "L", are indicated using a 3-dimensional space denominated the [...] "LMS color space", {{which is one of}} many color spaces devised to quantify human color vision.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{wavelengths}} stimulate two or {{all three}} kinds of cone cell because the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> curves of the three kinds overlap. Certain tristimulus values are thus physically impossible, for example LMS tristimulus values that are non-zero for the M component and zero for both the L and S components. Furthermore, LMS tristimulus values for pure spectral colors would, in any normal trichromatic additive color space, e. g. the RGB color spaces, imply negative values {{for at least one}} of the three primaries because the chromaticity would be outside the color triangle defined by the primary colors. To avoid these negative RGB values, and to have one component that describes the perceived brightness, [...] "imaginary" [...] primary colors and corresponding color-matching functions were formulated. The CIE 1931 color space defines the resulting tristimulus values, in which they are denoted by [...] "X", [...] "Y", and [...] "Z". In XYZ space, all combinations of non-negative coordinates are meaningful, but many, such as the primary locations , , and , correspond to imaginary colors outside the space of possible LMS coordinates; imaginary colors do not correspond to any spectral distribution of wavelengths and therefore have no physical reality.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{nonlinearity}} {{of neural}} color-coding, {{as evidenced by}} the classical understanding of the Abney effect and its use of white light to particular wavelengths of light, has been thoroughly studied in the past, a new method was undertaken by researchers at the University of Nevada. Rather than adding white light to monochromatic light, the bandwidth of the spectrum was varied. This variation of bandwidth directly targeted the three classes of cone receptors as a means of identifying any hue shifts as perceived by the human eye. [...] The overall goal of the research was to determine whether the appearance of color was affected by the filtering effects of the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the eye. Experiments showed that the cone ratios signaled a hue was adjusted so as to produce a constant hue that matched the central wavelength of the light source. Also, the experiments conducted essentially showed that the Abney effect does not hold for all changes in light purity, but is limited very much to certain means of purity degradation, namely the addition of white light. Since the experiments undertaken varied the bandwidth of the light, a similar albeit different means of altering the purity and therefore hue of the monochromatic light, the nonlinearity of the results displayed differently from what had traditionally been seen. Ultimately, the researchers {{came to the conclusion that}} variations in spectral bandwidth cause postreceptoral mechanisms to compensate for the filtering effects imposed by cone sensitivities and preretinal absorption and that the Abney effect occurs because the eye has, in a sense, been tricked into seeing a color that would not naturally occur and must therefore approximate the color. This approximation to compensate for the Abney effect is a direct function of the cone excitations experienced with a broadband spectrum.|$|E

Intracellular recordings demonstrated that the <b>spectral</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the proximal photoreceptors (R 5 - 8) of all ommatidia in both sexes are strongly tuned by the perirhabdomal pigments.
