40|$|In {{contrast}} to the usual Lipschitz <b>seminorms</b> associated to ordinary metrics on compact spaces, we show by examples that Lipschitz <b>seminorms</b> on possibly non-commutative compact spaces are usually not determined by the restriction of the metric they define on the state space, to the extreme points of the state space. We characterize the Lipschitz norms which are determined by their metric on the whole state space as being those which are lower semicontinuous. We show that their domain of Lipschitz elements can be enlarged so as to form a dual Banach space, which generalizes the situation for ordinary Lipschitz <b>seminorms.</b> We give a characterization of the metrics on state spaces which come from Lipschitz <b>seminorms.</b> The natural (broader) setting for these results {{is provided by the}} ``function spaces'' of Kadison.

40|$|A key tool {{in recent}} {{advances}} in understanding arithmetic progressions and other patterns in subsets of the integers is certain norms or <b>seminorms.</b> One example is the norms on /N introduced by Gowers in his proof of Szemerédi's Theorem, used to detect uniformity of subsets of the integers. Another example is the <b>seminorms</b> on bounded functions in a measure preserving system (associated to the averages in Furstenberg's proof of Szemerédi's Theorem) defined by the authors. For each integer k≥ 1, we define <b>seminorms</b> on ℓ^∞() analogous to these norms and <b>seminorms.</b> We study the correlation of these norms with certain algebraically defined sequences, which arise from evaluating a continuous function on the homogeneous space of a nilpotent Lie group on a orbit (the nilsequences). Using these <b>seminorms,</b> we define a dual norm that acts as an upper bound for the correlation of a bounded sequence with a nilsequence. We also prove an inverse theorem for the <b>seminorms,</b> showing how a bounded sequence correlates with a nilsequence. As applications, we derive several ergodic theoretic results, including a nilsequence version of the Wiener-Wintner ergodic theorem, a nil version of a corollary to the spectral theorem, and a weighted multiple ergodic convergence theorem...|$|R
