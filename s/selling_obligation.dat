30|$|Secondly, we analyze how a {{call option}} to buy {{electricity}} reduces the availability risk of power producers. Considering that a power producer {{has signed a}} forward contract to sell electricity and a call option {{to have the right}} to buy electricity during the same delivery period. In that case, if the generating unit owned by the producer fails just before the delivery period of both contracts and the pool price is expected to be high, the producer can exercise the call option to buy electricity. This way, the producer can comply with its contracting <b>selling</b> <b>obligation</b> by buying the electricity through the call option at the strike price, which will be probably lower than the average pool price during the delivery period. On the other hand, if either the generating unit does not fail or the pool prices are expected to decrease below the strike price, the call option is not exercised.|$|E
25|$|Credit risk: {{the risk}} that money owing will not be paid by an obligor. Since credit risk is the natural {{business}} of banks, but an unwanted risk for commercial traders, an early market developed between banks and traders that involved <b>selling</b> <b>obligations</b> at a discounted rate.|$|R
50|$|Bilateral {{trade was}} highly popular within Finnish {{business}} circles, as it allowed {{the commission of}} very large orders, additionally with less stringent requirements for sophistication or quality, if compared to Western markets. The Soviet side was motivated to participate in clearing trade because the arrangement essentially provided cheap credit. The option was to <b>sell</b> <b>obligations</b> to the international market, and pay interest in hard currency. Capital, such as icebreakers, train carriages or consumer goods, could be obtained from Finland, and the cost would simply become clearing account deficit, eventually to be paid back as e.g. crude oil, or as orders such as nuclear power plants (Loviisa I and II).|$|R

30|$|In short, {{this example}} {{illustrates}} that {{the acquisition of}} a call option can reduce the availability risk of generating units by allowing a power producer to <b>sell</b> contracting <b>obligations</b> to buy electricity at a fixed price, when there exists a high probability of suffering from unexpected unit failures.|$|R
50|$|The Commission manages over 52000 acre {{of parks}} in the two counties. Within the Maryland-Washington Metropolitan District, the Commission is {{empowered}} to acquire, develop, maintain, and operate parks systems. In all areas except Laurel, the Commission may spend public funds to acquire park land. Subject to county government approval, it also may <b>sell</b> general <b>obligation</b> bonds to fund park acquisition and development. All other expenses, including debt service, are paid from a park tax levied within the District.|$|R
25|$|The lenders (the {{people who}} put up the $9bn in the example) can insure against default by syndicating the loan to spread the risk, or by buying credit default swaps (CDSs) or <b>selling</b> {{collateralised}} debt <b>obligations</b> (CDOs) from/to other institutions (although this is no business of the private equity firm).|$|R
50|$|Non-domestic {{consumers}} can avoid paying the Climate Change Levy by acquiring Levy Exemption Certificates from renewable energy suppliers.

40|$|This Article {{establishes}} a Shari 2 ̆ 7 ah ruling for an important contemporary {{issue that has}} been the subject of much inquiry: whether Islamic law permits forward currency contracts (that is, hedging against currency risk). Specifically, this Article addresses what happens when a financial institution offers an <b>obligation</b> to <b>sell</b> or buy a specific currency at a specified time in the future at a pre-determined rate of exchange in return for a specified amount, regardless of whether the buyer decides to proceed with the exchange contract. Is it lawful for the client (a trader, manufacturing company, Islamic bank, government, or other transaction participant) to purchase that obligation in order to avoid potential losses resulting from market fluctuations in the prices of currencies? In other words, is it lawful, with respect to the Shari 2 ̆ 7 ah, to hedge against currency risk by purchasing a forward currency contract? This issue is particularly significant given the needs of Islamic financial institutions, trading houses, manufacturers, and even governments and their agencies. But the issue has yet to become the subject of serious academic research or proficient legal scholarship by those qualified to establish a Shari 2 ̆ 7 ah ruling on the matter. Since this Article focuses on the issue of 2 ̆ 2 <b>selling</b> <b>obligations</b> 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 obtaining compensation for obligations, 2 ̆ 2 part II of this Article will discuss the meaning of an 2 ̆ 2 obligation 2 ̆ 2 as understood here. Part III will provide context to the definition of 2 ̆ 2 obligation 2 ̆ 2 by considering how Islamic law, orfiqh, characterizes compensation for obligations. After this introductory, but essential, review, this Article will discuss, in part IV, the legal justifications for the conclusion that the obligations described above are consistent with the requirements of Islamic law. Finally, this Article will conclude with a discussion of the practical effect of the approval, from an Islamic law perspective, of the use of options...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, credit risk {{management}} {{of financial institutions}} has been subject to major changes due {{to the development of}} the credit derivatives market. In the past, financial institutions merely had the possibility to manage their credit portfolio by either approving or refusing a credit request. Having made a decision, there was hardly any chance to influence the portfolio at a later stage. Alternative solutions for risk mitigation like <b>selling</b> the <b>obligation</b> (e. g. via an Asset Backed SecurityTransaction) or claiming further collateral were relatively complicated, cost-intensive and of doubtable success primarily due to their dependency on legal requirements and/or negotiation skills. With the emergence of credit derivatives, risk management has received a broad range of possibilities to transfer credit risk easily without affecting the credit relationship. In other words, credit derivatives enable the separation of credit risk from the original obligation and trading of the risk by itself. Therefore, credit portfolios can be managed actively at every stage.

40|$|Nearly 400 pages long, bearing an arresting {{title and}} {{featuring}} {{a picture of}} a mounted policeman directing a crowd inside the Tate Modern, Claire Bishop's latest book seems to demand our full attention. With participation as its key subject, this impressive survey of its developmental role within art practice is set to be a key reference text for some time to come. But what does this buzzword 'participation' really mean after all? Is it a euphemism that <b>sells</b> the <b>obligation</b> to cooperate, to play along? Is it a moral imperative, a condition of the social? Is it just a way of emphasising the necessarily plural nature of activity in general? Can it describe the active contemplation of something without any expressive extension, or does it demand the extension of thought outwards, the connection of thought to action? This loose concept, used as a thread to connect some of the most uncompromising art of the 20 th and early 21 st century in Bishop's Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the Politics of Spectatorship, remains all too elusive. As does the implication of its title, for Bishop is in no simple sense condemning what has by now become a default virtue of 'progressive art', as one might infer. Instead, Artificial Hells, which takes its name from an essay by André Breton dissecting a disappointing Dada action in a Paris churchyard in 1921, opens up the aesthetic politics of art works that depend upon more or less active audiences to a wide, but sometimes vague, horizon of consideration...|$|R
3000|$|For the analysis, {{we first}} {{determine}} the recovery rate (RR j [...]) for every debtor j ∈(1, 2,..., 499). In our data set, the proceeds include the {{returns from the}} liquidation of any possible collateral {{as well as the}} payments made by the debtor. Costs include all external costs (e.g., costs for arbitration measures, the real estate agent’s commission fees, etc.). 9 Determining the EAD appears to be critical, since the exact time of the default event as well as the criteria for the default are not known. 10 Therefore, we use the definition of a default event specified under the Basel Accord. Following Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2006), a loan is considered to be in default if the bank is <b>selling</b> the loan <b>obligation</b> and thereby accepting an economic loss. Due to the reduction in the selling price, selling a receivable to BAG always satisfies this definition. 11 Hence, we take the debtor’s existing liabilities at the time of transfer to BAG as the exposure at default (EAD). Using this definition, the difficulty of employing inconsistent definitions of a default event among the 123 included banks can be avoided.|$|R
