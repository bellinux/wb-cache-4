50|$|During World War II, codebooks {{were only}} used {{each day to}} set up the rotors, their ring {{settings}} and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random <b>start</b> <b>position,</b> let's say WZA, and a random message key, perhaps SXT. He moved the rotors to the WZA <b>start</b> <b>position</b> and encoded the message key SXT. Assume the result was UHL. He then set up the message key, SXT, as the <b>start</b> <b>position</b> and encrypted the message. Next, he transmitted the <b>start</b> <b>position,</b> WZA, the encoded message key, UHL, and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up the <b>start</b> <b>position</b> according to the first trigram, WZA, and decoded the second trigram, UHL, to obtain the SXT message setting. Next, he used this SXT message setting as the <b>start</b> <b>position</b> to decrypt the message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.|$|R

5|$|Christopher Evenson Turner (born September 8, 1987) is an American {{football}} quarterback. He played {{quarterback for}} the Maryland Terrapins at the University of Maryland from 2007 to 2009.

5|$|The {{defensive}} play of Taylor, Oliver, and Johnson greatly {{affected the}} course of the game and is apparent in Georgia's time of possession and average <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> in each of the quarters. During the first and second quarters, Georgia had average starting positions on their own 19and26-yard lines, respectively. Their first-quarter time of possession was just 5:41, and their second-quarter possession time was 6:34. During the third and fourth quarters, when all four Virginia Tech turnovers took place, Georgia's time of possession jumped to 10:41 and 7:47, respectively. In the third quarter, their average starting possession gained tenyards to the Georgia 36, and during the final quarter, their average <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> was the Virginia Tech 36-yard line. This fact allowed Georgia to capitalize on the Virginia Tech turnovers, turning them into points on the scoreboard.|$|E

However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.|$|E
5|$|As {{with each}} All-Star Game since 1970, the eight <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> players (with no {{designated}} hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting.

The key plays were a 15-yard pass from McElroy to Darius Hanks and a 13-yard pass from McElroy to Richardson. After an exchange of punts gave Alabama good <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> at the Auburn 45, the Tide quickly struck again with McElroy hitting tight end Colin Peek on a 33-yard touchdown pass that left the game tied 14–14 at halftime.|$|E

40|$|Iterative {{learning}} control (ILC) {{is an effective}} control technique for motion systems that perform repetitively the same trajectory (setpoint). The result of the learning procedure is a feedforward signal that perfectly compensates all deterministic dynamics in the system for the learned setpoint performed at a specific <b>start</b> <b>position.</b> For other setpoints and <b>start</b> <b>positions,</b> the learned feedforward signal will not be perfect, because the learned deterministic dynamics are setpoint- and position-dependent. In this paper cogging compensating piecewise ILC (CCPILC) is proposed that enables to use one learned feedforward signal for different setpoints and <b>start</b> <b>positions</b> without losing performance. The learned feedforward signal will therefore be decomposed into a setpoint- and a position-dependent part, such that both parts can be adapted individually according to the desired change in setpoint and/or <b>start</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R

Dick Jauron, who was then the Bears' head coach, {{recognized}} Urlacher's versatility as a middle and outside linebacker, and appointed him as the team's starting strongside linebacker. However, Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first professional game, and lost his <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> to Rosevelt Colvin. Jauron left Urlacher on the sidelines during the following week, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers shut out the Bears, 41–0.|$|E

By 24 December, the Fourth Panzer Army was in full retreat, returning to its <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> The inability to breakthrough to the 6th Army, and the latter formation's refusal to attempt a breakout, caused Operation Winter Storm to collapse on 24 December, as Army Group Don returned to the defensive.|$|E

Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season.|$|E

After that, he remained as the team's leader {{for the remainder of}} the season, and against eighth-ranked Boston College, engineered another upset victory. Turner also helped Maryland secure an appearance in the Emerald Bowl. At the start of the 2008 season, he was relegated to backup status, but soon regained the <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> That year, he led Maryland in wins over four of their five ranked opponents and to an appearance in the Humanitarian Bowl. He returned as the starter for the 2009 season, but suffered a knee injury and was replaced by Jamarr Robinson.|$|E
