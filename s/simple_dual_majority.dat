The Nice arrangements are unnecessarily complex, whereas the <b>dual</b> <b>majority</b> is <b>simpler</b> and more efficient. Moreover, Spain and Poland have a special interest.

Are EU citizens ready for a system based largely on relative population? The best outcome on balance is to move to a <b>dual</b> <b>majority,</b> but only in November 2009 as proposed in the draft Constitution. This is not optimal from the perspective of efficiency.

Assuming knowledge of the second-order statistics of channel state information (CSI), the opti-mal beamforming weights are determined so that the total transmitted power at the relays is minimized, while meeting signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) requirements at the destinations. Our formulation utilizes the Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR) technique to produce an efficient, tractable convex programming approximation {{of the problem in}} central-ized form. We propose a distributed optimization algorithm to calculate the optimal beamforming weights for scenarios where multiple clusters of source-destination node pairs, along with their dedicated relays, coexist in space.
