When converting forest monoculture to the forests close to nature there is also necessary to obtain information about stand climate that is created in the newly planted stands because the stand climate significantly affects the production processes of forest trees. In the thesis {{an analysis of the}} temperature {{regime in the}} fir-beech stand below the canopy of adult <b>spruce</b> <b>stand</b> was made at the study site of Rájec (Drahanská vrchovina Highlands) during the growing season (May-October) of 2013.

30|$|Although the {{analyses}} {{of this study}} suggest that N fertilization often improves the profitability of the management of boreal conifer forest, fertilization should be used with caution since N fertilization has several potentially harmful side effects. In addition, the results suggested that fertilization benefit is by far higher in <b>spruce</b> <b>stands</b> on mesic sites (MT site) than in pine stands and more fertile <b>spruce</b> <b>stands.</b> The effects of fertilization on timber drain and cash flows are clearly higher in mesic <b>spruce</b> <b>stands</b> than in other stand types.

On the fir-beech stand incident on average for the whole growing season only 11 % of photosynthetically active radiation incident on the adult <b>spruce</b> <b>stand.</b> Values of air temperature were decreasing in the vertical profile of fir-beech stand under the adult <b>spruce</b> <b>stand</b> canopy protection toward to the ground. Air temperature in the height of 2 meters above the ground was lower in the fir-beech stand in the gap compared with the adult spruce stands. The relative air humidity in the height of 2 meters above the ground was higher in the fir-beech stand compared with the adult spruce stands. Total precipitation sum was 447 mm at the ecosystem station of Rájec after the growing season (May [...] October) in 2014, which corresponds to the long-term averages for this locality. Different distribution of rainfall during the growing season were found out.

Analysis of the ß values was made for the values specified in the light part of the day characterized by positive values of net radiation of the <b>spruce</b> <b>stand.</b> Determined ß values showed considerable variability. Positive ß values were found out in a normal and inverse stratification of the atmosphere; negative values for unstable atmospheric conditions.
