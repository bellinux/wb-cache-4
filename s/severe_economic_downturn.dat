40|$|This paper reports {{results of}} a test of money demand and supply as {{predicted}} by recent studies applied to small economies with greater openness to external factors.

With open conditions generally prevailing in our tested small economy, increases in interest rates attract portfolio funds, which helped to spur asset price bubble to build up. When the economy came under strain as a result, the bubble bursts as happened {{at the time of the}} Asian financial crisis, which led to a severe currency crisis that lasted for about 18 months, causing <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturns</b> thereafter.

40|$|Until recent decades, {{government}} fiscal {{positions were}} rarely in deficit, except in exceptional circumstances, such as wars or <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturns.</b> Debt that was accumulated in those periods was usually repaid promptly afterward, and budget surpluses were run {{in order to}} do so. This situation changed in most industrial countries {{at some point in the}} postwar period—a period also characterized by increasing shares of government spending in GDP. To a large extent, these increases in spending have resulted from massive expansions in the “welfare state, ” notably in government health care expenditures, public pensions, and to a lesser extent, income support for the poor. Though the share of government revenues also rose strongly in this period, increases were not sufficient to balance budgets, and industrial countries have run persistent deficits over the past two decades or so.

40|$|The <b>severe</b> global <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> and {{the large}} {{stimulus}} programs that governments in many countries adopted in response have generated a resurgence in research {{on the effects of}} fiscal policy. One key lesson emerging from this research {{is that there is no}} single fiscal multiplier that sums up the economic impact of fiscal policy. Rather, the impact varies widely depending on the specific fiscal policies put into effect and the overall economic environment. Over the past three years, there has been a resurgence in economic research on the impacts of fiscal policy, as implemented through direct government spending and tax rates. This resurgence is due in large part to the <b>severe</b> global <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> and the massive fiscal stimulus programs put in place in many countries as a response. Now, as many countries pivot from stimulus to austerity despite uncertain recovery, the question of the economic effects of higher taxes and reductions in government spending takes on a new importance. This Economic Letter reviews recent research on the economic effects of fiscal policy. This research makes clear that many factors can affect the size and direction of fiscal effects, suggesting that policymakers must carefully consider the specific context of fiscal policy to understand the probable effects of new spending and tax initiatives...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund has maintained an economic value {{of at least two}} percent of the Fund's insurance-in-force, as required by law. GAO's and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) analysis show that the Fund had an economic value of $ 15. 8 billion (3. 20 percent) and $ 16. 6 billion (3. 66 percent), respectively. Given the economic value of the Fund and {{the state of the economy}} at the end of fiscal year 1999, a two-percent capital ratio appears sufficient to withstand moderately <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturns</b> that could lead to worse-than-expected loan performance. However, under more <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> conditions, the economic value of two percent of insurance-in-force would not be adequate. Because of the uncertainty and professional judgment associated with this type of economic analysis, GAO cautions against relying on one estimate or even a group of estimates to determine the adequacy of the Fund's reserves over the longer term. HUD could exercise several options under current legislative authority to reduce the capital ratio for the Fund. It is difficult, however, to reliably measure the impact of policy changes on the Fund's capital ratio and Federal Housing Administration borrowers without using tools designed to estimate the multiple impacts that policy changes often have. Nonetheless, any option that reduces the Fund's reserve, if not accompanied by a similar reduction in other government spending, would result in a budget surplus reduction or a deficit increase. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{the context}} of battling the aftereffects of <b>severe</b> <b>economic</b> <b>downturns</b> like the Great Recession, however, this {{perspective}} may be inappropriate. Compared with hiring credits targeting the disadvantaged, more explicit counter-recessionary hiring credits could be more effective. And although the official end date of the Great Recession is now well behind us, and labor markets are recovering, there are continuing problems of long durations of unemployment, 3 and research points to specific difficulties of the long-term unemployed in finding new jobs (Kroft et al., 2013). A broader hiring credit focused on the unemployed or {{those who have been}} out of the labor force may avoid the problem of stigma, because with high unemployment rates and low participation rates, eligibility for a hiring credit based on current unemployment or non-participation may not send employers much of a bad signal. Kroft et al. (2013) provide evidence consistent with this idea. In particular, they find evidence that employers pay attention to labor market conditions in interpreting unemployment as a negative signal. While employers are less likely to call back those unemployed for a longer spell, the stigmatizing effect of a long unemployment spell is weaker in a slacker labor market. Conversely, of course, the effectiveness of such credits in helping the long-term unemployed as the labor market tightens could decline, as stigma concerns associated with long-term unemployment strengthen.|$|R

There is no doubt that the minerals and energy boom of the 2000 s was responsible for much of the growth in commodity export earnings.
