25|$|One {{more recent}} {{application}} for flash memory is {{as a replacement}} for hard disks. Flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of hard drives, so a <b>solid-state</b> <b>drive</b> (SSD) is attractive when considering speed, noise, power consumption, and reliability. Flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device secondary storage devices; they are also used as substitutes for hard drives in high-performance desktop computers and some servers with RAID and SAN architectures.|$|E
25|$|The MacBook Air {{is a line}} of Macintosh {{subnotebook}} computers {{developed and}} manufactured by Apple Inc. It consists of a full-size keyboard, a machined aluminum case, and a thin light structure. The Air is available with a screen size of (measured diagonally) 13.3in (33.782cm), with different specifications produced by Apple. As of 2011, all MacBook Air models use <b>solid-state</b> <b>drive</b> storage and Intel Core i5 or i7 CPUs. A MacBook Air with an 11.6in (29.46cm) screen was made available in 2010 and was discontinued end of 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{overall goals}} of PIP are to {{increase}} the repetition rate of the Booster beam from 7Hz to 15Hz and replace old hardware to increase reliability of the operation. Before {{the start of the}} PIP project, a replacement of the pre-accelerator injector was underway. The replacement of almost 40-year-old Cockcroft–Walton generators to RFQ started in 2009 and completed in 2012. At the linac stage, the analog beam position monitor (BPM) modules were replaced with digital boards in 2013. A replacement of Linac vacuum pumps and related hardware is expected to be completed in 2015. A study on the replacement of 201-MHz drift tubes is still ongoing. At the boosting stage, a major component of the PIP is to upgrade the Booster ring to 15-Hz operation. The Booster has 19 radio frequency stations. Originally, the Booster stations were operating without <b>solid-state</b> <b>drive</b> system which was acceptable for 7-Hz, but not for 15-Hz operation. A demonstration project in 2004 converted one of the stations to solid state drive prior to the PIP project. As part of the project, the remaining stations were successfully converted to solid state in 2013. Another major part of the PIP project is to refurbish and replace 40-year-old Booster cavities. Many cavities have been refurbished and tested to operate at 15Hz repetition rate. The completion of cavity refurbishment is expected to be completed in 2015 and the repetition rate can be gradually increased to 15-Hz operation from that point. A longer term upgrade task is to replace the Booster cavities with a new design. The research and development of the new cavities is underway. The completion of the Booster cavity replacement is expected to be in 2018.|$|E

No usable segments of tape were found inside the recorder; according to the NTSB's report, [...] "he majority of the recording tape was fused into a solid block of charred plastic".

500|$|Syzygy tablebases were {{developed}} by Ronald de Man, released in April 2013, in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search. [...] This variety consists of two tables per endgame: a smaller WDL table (win-draw-loss) which contains knowledge of the 50-move rule, and a larger DTZ table (distance to zero ply, i.e. pawn move or capture). [...] The WDL tables were designed to be {{small enough to fit}} on a <b>solid-state</b> <b>drive</b> for quick access during search, whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game-theoretically quickest win instead of performing a search. Syzygy tablebases are available for all 6 piece endings, and are now supported by many top engines, including Komodo, Deep Fritz, Houdini, and Stockfish.|$|E

2500|$|In its {{original}} form, iMac G3 had a gumdrop or egg-shaped look, with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, translucent plastic case, which was refreshed early {{on with a}} sleeker design notable for its slot-loaded optical drive. The second major revision, iMac G4, moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, iMac G5 and the Intel iMac respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only {{up and down on}} a simple metal base. The fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the SuperDrive, and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes <b>solid-state</b> <b>drive</b> (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple Fusion Drive, a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives. This version of iMac was announced in October 2012, with the [...] version released in November and the [...] version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new Haswell processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and 802.11ac Wi-Fi cards.|$|E
