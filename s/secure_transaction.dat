40|$|The thesis contemplates {{the need}} for Nigerian policy makers to {{undertake}} a reform of <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law to meet international best standards, building upon earlier, unsuccessful, efforts by lawmakers, and drawing upon international benchmarks. It critically analyses the Registration of Security Interests in Movable Property by Banks and Other Financial Institutions in Nigeria (Regulation No. 1 2015) 'CBNR' published on 2 February 2015. The CBNR, with a primary aim of facilitating affordable credit, and to modernise <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law {{through the use of}} personal property as collateral, has departed from its previous position which it inherited from England. This thesis has drawn comparisons between the CBNR and prior reform initiatives particularly the Draft Law 2009 prepared by the Centre for the Economic Analysis of Law (CEAL). These reforms, which were not implemented, recommended wholesale changes to harmonise all existing <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law in Nigeria. The CBNR does not follow this approach, but instead, adopts a piecemeal approach to reform. Correspondingly, this forms the framework within which this study has been undertaken with reference to whether a piecemeal or wholesale reform is now required. This thesis has followed the International Finance Corporation (IFC) approach which focuses on a three-stage <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> reform strategy - modernisation of the existing legal framework; establishment of an electronic collateral registry; a concerted effort towards building capacity. With the assistance of international <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> legal frameworks such as the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on <b>Secured</b> <b>Transactions</b> 2007, and its Registry Guide 2014, the CBNR has been benchmarked against these adaptable legal frameworks for the purpose of harmonising <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law, in search of the international best practice which may be desirable for Nigeria. The thesis identifies and discusses at length several problems and inconsistencies associated with the CNBR, and the thesis makes suggestions for a wholesale reform of the Nigerian <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law. This thesis builds on existing knowledge on <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law reform with particular reference, and usefulness, to sub-Saharan African countries and other developing countries that wish to attempt a similar reform of this nature...|$|R

50|$|This key is used {{to allow}} the {{execution}} of secure transactions: every Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is required {{to be able to}} sign a random number (in order to allow the owner to show that he has a genuine trusted computer), using a particular protocol created by the Trusted Computing Group (the direct anonymous attestation protocol) in order to ensure its compliance of the TCG standard and to prove its identity; this makes it impossible for a software TPM emulator with an untrusted endorsement key (for example, a self-generated one) to start a <b>secure</b> <b>transaction</b> with a trusted entity. The TPM should be designed to make the extraction of this key by hardware analysis hard, but tamper resistance is not a strong requirement.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the law applicable to <b>secured</b> <b>transactions.</b> It addresses {{in particular the}} codification of the choice-of-law rules for <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> (STCOL rules). These rules address the laws applicable to the creation, perfection, priority, and enforcement of security interests (security rights) —a form of legislative or statutory dépeçage. It draws on the 2016 UNCITRAL Model Law on <b>Secured</b> <b>Transactions</b> (Model Law) as well as relevant North American law (Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 and the Canadian provincial Personal Property Security Acts). The STCOL rules {{lie at the heart}} of the emerged and emerging modern principles of <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law (Modern Principles) for personal property (movable assets). These Modern Principles are reflected by the Model Law and North American law as well as by various other model laws, other <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> ‘reforms’ over recent years, and laws that are currently being considered by various States. While disagreements exist, debates continue, and strict harmonization is unlikely, there is little doubt that there has emerged a global consensus as to a set of general principles to which <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law should adhere. The STCOL rules and their relationship to substantive legal doctrine remain somewhat underdeveloped and undertheorized. This essay seeks to remedy this situation. It situates the STCOL rules as fundamental components of <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and central to understanding the normative principles and factual assumptions underpinning that important body of law. Its principal contribution is to offer a framework for assessing the existing STCOL rules and for the codification of future rules. The framework is based on the interests of stakeholders that participate in or are affected by <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> and the Modern Principles. These stakeholders include third parties in general, assignors and assignees of security rights, third-party obligors on assigned assets (such as debtors on an assignor’s receivables), and the States that enact and whose interests are affected by STCOL rules. This framework also illuminates the factual bases for its application. But it can evaluated only through its application and analysis, which necessarily produces an assessment of STCOL rules and conclusions as to the appropriate rules. While the conclusions reached here may represent only a modest contribution to the literature, the more important offering is the framework for assessment itself—the identification of the questions to be asked and answered...|$|R

40|$|As {{international}} organizations adopt new legal standards to promote {{access to credit}} through the modernization of national <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law, the lack of coordination with regulatory standards for banking institutions thwarts {{the effectiveness of these}} efforts. In recognizing the relevance of the problem, UNCITRAL - {{for the first time since}} its establishment - is currently considering how to coordinate <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law reforms with the implementation of the Basel Accord. In a similar vein, the problem is currently approached by other international organisations. Although efforts at the national level to coordinate legal and regulatory standards are commendable, coordination between <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and capital requirements should be addressed at the highest level of the lawmaking process, i. e. when international soft-laws are defined. To advance this argument, the key functions of <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and capital requirements are isolated and a holistic understanding of the legal and regulatory rules governing the creation of credit is presented. The Article steers away from the idea that banks are mere intermediaries and offers a fresh understanding of the role of regulatory capital in controlling credit creation, through the management of risk. Within this context, the incentives created by <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and capital requirements are examined by comparing the capital charges for different credit protections, including credit derivatives and commercial loans to small business. First, it emerges that the implementation of new <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and the limited ability of security interests in personal property to reduce regulatory capital under the Basel Accords stimulate the creation of credit outside the banking system. Second, to control this phenomenon, the Article shows that it is essential to reconcile the incentive structures created by international legal and regulatory standards...|$|R
