500|$|In 1960 she and Olivier {{divorced}} and Olivier soon married actress Joan Plowright. In his autobiography, Olivier discussed {{the years of}} strain they had experienced because of Leigh's illness: [...] "Throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness– an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> be expected to take the trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|While Leigh made Streetcar in 1951, Olivier {{joined her}} in Hollywood to film Carrie, {{based on the}} {{controversial}} novel Sister Carrie; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and a BAFTA nomination. Olivier began to notice a change in Leigh's behaviour, and he later recounted that [...] "I would find Vivien sitting {{on the corner of}} the bed, wringing her hands and sobbing, in a state of grave distress; I would naturally try desperately to give her some comfort, but for some time she would be inconsolable." [...] After a holiday with Coward in Jamaica, she seemed to have recovered, but Olivier later recorded, [...] "I am sure that... must have taken some pains to tell me what was wrong with my wife; that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant—a possibly permanent cyclical to-and-fro between the depths of depression and wild, uncontrollable mania. He also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of Leigh's illness, writing, [...] "throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> be expected to take the trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{his second}} term, Roosevelt {{scrambled}} many of his diplomatic assignments. Norway, the fourth nation to grant woman suffrage (after New Zealand, Australia and Finland), was considered [...] "an obvious post for a woman diplomat." [...] Thus, in 1937, Harriman was appointed as the United States’ Minister to Norway. [...] (Her precise title was “Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary” for Norway.) [...] At {{the time of her}} appointment, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> have known that this role would soon require her to draw on her experience in helping refugees in the previous World War.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{was very}} short about it," [...] {{continued}} Ben, sourly; [...] "the old party got that excited <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>’ardly</b> keep still, {{but the young}} lady she said good riddance to bad rubbish, she ses. She hoped as ’ow he’d be punished." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She kept wiping {{down the}} counter in front of ’im over an’ over agin, an’ ’e could see ’er staring at ’is wrists as though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>’ardly</b> believe her eyes. Then she {{went back into the}} parlour, and Ginger ’eard her whispering, and by and by she came out agin with the blue-eyed barmaid.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned on}} one side, and they {{followed}} a paling. Susie could {{feel that they}} walked along a narrow path. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> see <b>hardly</b> two steps in front of her. At last he stood still.|$|R
2500|$|A {{large portion}} of Kampusch's time upstairs was spent doing {{housework}} for Přiklopil and cooking for him. Dietmar Ecker, Kampusch's media advisor, said Kampusch told him Přiklopil [...] "would beat her so badly <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> walk. When she was beaten black and blue, he tried to smarten her up. [...] Then he would take his camera and photograph her". [...] According to her autobiography, {{as part of her}} abuse, Přiklopil would starve her to make her physically weak, therefore unable to escape. Her body mass index (BMI) had reached as low as 14.8 during captivity (normal BMI: 18.5 to 25).|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> {{bear to look}} at it, but pride {{gave her}} strength.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> stand, but {{tried to}} jump up as Miss Hackett entered.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Married!' <b>she</b> faltered, and <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> check an {{involuntary}} 'So did I.' A moment after and her resolve to confess perished like a bubble.|$|R
60|$|Then she betook {{herself to}} her pocket handkerchief, for her tears came easily, and on this {{occasion}} <b>she</b> herself <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> have said whether they {{were the result of}} pleasure in Bertha's happiness, or regret at the downfall of the air castles she had once built.|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{was nice}} of you,” <b>she</b> smiled. “I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> help enjoying it. She’s a {{comfortable}} boat, and everybody has been pleasant. I suppose we’ll see Vancouver Island late to-morrow?” ...|$|R
60|$|She was so {{agitated}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> {{place the}} key in the keyhole.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Rintoul {{afterwards}} {{told her}} husband <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> say that she liked Miss Hannay.|$|E
60|$|When they rose, {{her feet}} were so numbed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> stand. She clung to Siegmund, laughing.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> smiled, but <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> {{restrain}} her sobs. The engrossing love of {{a mother}} for her child seemed joined in miraculous union with the worship of a mortal for his God.|$|R
60|$|He took {{no notice}} of Miriam. Later, {{she saw him}} remark her new blouse, saw that the artist approved, but it won from him not a spark of warmth. <b>She</b> was nervous, <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> reach the teacups from the shelves.|$|R
60|$|It made a {{great many}} smile; and no wonder, when you {{consider}} what a gentle and innocent little thing <b>she</b> looked. One <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> believe <b>she</b> had ever even seen men slaughtered, she look so little fitted for such things.|$|R
60|$|The boy was so joyously {{excited that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> {{withstand}} his delight, {{but she did}} not move.|$|E
60|$|Louisa made {{no answer}} in words. Her face spoke for her: <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> avoid {{thinking}} it strange.|$|E
60|$|Marie, as {{she thought}} {{of what she had}} said, repented so bitterly that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> refrain from tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "She was a wild, {{laughing}} thing, but {{pleasant to}} have in the room. She made lesson-time charming. <b>She</b> learned fast--you <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> tell when or how. French was nothing to her. She spoke it quick, quick--as quick as Mr. Moore himself." ...|$|R
60|$|After a {{while she}} began to see her way. She would not watch her uncle, but if chance brought her clear proof that he was helping her country's enemies, she would {{see that he was}} stopped. This was a {{compromise}} that <b>she</b> suspected <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> be justified; but the next decision was easier, because {{it had to do with}} those she loved. If Staffer or his friends plotted any harm to Dick or Andrew, she would remorselessly use every weapon she had against him.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{conversation}} died away again, and they completed their two turns in silence; but Henrietta's {{heart began to}} fail her when she thought of going in without having her to greet. <b>She</b> lingered and <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> resolve to go, but at length she entered, walked up the stairs, gave her shawl and bonnet to Beatrice, and tapped at Fred's door.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If Margaret Morville could marry him, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> be too worthy,' said Laura. 'Think of {{throwing}} away Philip's whole soul!' ...|$|E
60|$|Sally's {{momentary}} annoyance faded. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly,</b> she felt, {{have expected}} Fillmore {{to refrain from}} mentioning the matter to his wife.|$|E
60|$|This was a {{new light}} to Kate. She was so bewildered that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> realize the {{significance}} of the remark.|$|E
60|$|We {{were silent}} for a few moments, {{and listened to the}} wind. Perhaps we all had the same picture before us,--of Miggles walking through the rainy woods with her savage {{guardian}} at her side. The Judge, I remember, said something about Una and her lion; but Miggles received it, as she did other compliments, with quiet gravity. Whether she was altogether unconscious of the admiration <b>she</b> excited,--she <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> have been oblivious of Yuba Bill's adoration,--I know not; but her very frankness suggested a perfect sexual equality that was cruelly humiliating to the younger members of our party.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] {{interrupted}} Cherry quickly. [...] "That was why I {{went over}} to Oakland, and why mother forbade my walking with you again, and why she had a talk with friends about your conduct, and why she came near telling Mr. Carstone all about it until I stopped her." [...] <b>She</b> checked herself--he <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> believe his eyes--the pale, nun-like girl was absolutely blushing.|$|R
6000|$|But she yielded {{her hand}} to him. The shot had indeed pierced the fleshy portion between thumb and forefinger, leaving an ugly gash: the wound was {{bleeding}} profusely and already she felt giddy and sick. De Mortémar bound up the little hand with his handkerchief as best he <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> <b>hardly</b> heeded him, beyond that persistent appeal, terrible in its heartrending pathos: ...|$|R
60|$|Petite maman {{felt her}} heart beating so vigorously that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> breathe. She pressed her {{wrinkled}} hands tightly against her bosom.|$|E
60|$|Arthur looked {{round at}} her; {{his face was}} oddly twisted. She was drawing her breath with such {{difficulty}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> answer.|$|E
60|$|Cornelia's heart, {{which stood}} {{still at the}} threat she made, began to pound in her breast. She panted so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> speak.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Judson {{delighted to}} send him little surprises, once a mince-pie, which Moung Ing carried with the utmost pride to his imprisoned master. Mrs. Judson found herself obliged to wear the native dress, though she was so much taller than the Burmese women that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be <b>hardly</b> taken for one of them. It was a {{becoming}} dress; her hair was drawn into a knot on the forehead, with a cocoa-blossom, like a white plume, drooping from it; a saffron vest open in front to show a crimson tunic below; and a tight skirt of rich silk, sloping down behind, made her look to advantage, so that her husband liked to remember her as she stood at his prison door. She never was allowed to come further.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{examining}} the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated. One other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the housemaid. You will remember that on hearing {{the sound of}} the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants. On that first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her master and mistress were sunk so low that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hear <b>hardly</b> anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they had fallen out. On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she heard the word David uttered twice by the lady. The point is of the utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel. The Colonel's name, you remember, was James.|$|R
60|$|James sank back, baffled. Mary's ignorance was an impenetrable cuirass; {{she would}} not try to understand, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not even realise that she might {{possibly}} be mistaken. Quite seriously she thought that what <b>she</b> ignored <b>could</b> be <b>hardly</b> worth knowing. People talk of the advance of education; {{there may be a}} little among the lower classes, but it is inconceivable that the English gentry can ever have been more illiterate than they are now. Throughout the country, in the comfortable villa or in the stately mansion, you will find as much prejudice and superstition in the drawing-room as in the kitchen; and you will find the masters less receptive of new ideas than their servants; and into the bargain, presumptuously satisfied with their own nescience.|$|R
