5000|$|A {{soldering}} gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically powered tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder {{to achieve a}} <b>strong</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond</b> with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch {{so it can be}} easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured {{to the end of the}} transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms much less. A tap on the primary winding is often used to light a pilot lamp which also lights the workpiece.|$|E

This study presents five statistically designed experiments that were accomplished to investigate the grit blasting process. The experiments were conducted using a Box statistical design of experiment (SDE) approach. A substantial range of grit blasting parameters and their effect on the resultant substrate roughness were investigated, including grit type, pressure, working distance, and exposure time.

50|$|While {{through-hole}} mounting provides <b>strong</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonds</b> {{when compared}} to SMT techniques, the additional drilling required makes the boards more expensive to produce. They also limit the available routing area for signal traces on layers immediately below the top layer on multilayer boards since the holes must pass through all layers to the opposite side. To that end, through-hole mounting techniques are now usually reserved for bulkier or heavier components such as electrolytic capacitors or semiconductors in larger packages such as the TO220 that require the additional mounting strength, or for components such as plug connectors or electromechanical relays that require great strength in support.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{types of}} glass solders are used: vitreous, and devitrifying. Vitreous solders retain their {{amorphous}} structure during remelting, can be reworked repeatedly, and are relatively transparent. Devitrifying solders undergo partial crystallization during solidifying, forming a glass-ceramic, {{a composite of}} glassy and crystalline phases. Devitrifying solders usually create a <b>stronger</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond,</b> but are more temperature-sensitive and the seal {{is more likely to}} be leaky; due to their polycrystalline structure they tend to be translucent or opaque. Devitrifying solders are frequently [...] "thermosetting", as their melting temperature after recrystallization becomes significantly higher; this allows soldering the parts together at lower temperature than the subsequent bake-out without remelting the joint afterwards. Devitrifying solders frequently contain up to 25% zinc oxide. In production of cathode ray tubes, devitrifying solders based on PbO-B2O3-ZnO are used.|$|R
40|$|Wear-resistant iron aluminide-based {{composites}} were {{coated on}} steel substrates with the High-Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) technique using ball milled Fe 3 Al and TiC powders as feedstock. The phase composition, microstructure, microhardness, elastic modulus and dry sliding wear performance of unreinforced Fe 3 Al and Fe 3 Al–TiC composite coatings (reinforced with 30 and 50 vol. % TiC particles) were evaluated {{in order to}} reveal {{the relationship between the}} mechanical and tribological behaviors. Compared to the unreinforced coatings, the composite coating with 30 vol. % TiC particles exhibited much greater hardness and higher elastic modulus. The increase of the elastic modulus of the composite coatings did not result in deterioration of sliding wear behavior. The addition of 50 vol. % TiC resulted in a further increase in hardness, however, both composite coatings showed the same elastic modulus. The fractured cross sectional surface of the unreinforced coating showed a weakly bonded microstructure promoting delamination in wear tests, whereas the composite fractured surface showed <b>strong</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> between the matrix and carbide particles, leading to better cohesion. The Fe 3 Al–TiC coatings showed almost three orders of magnitude higher wear resistance under the dry sliding wear test compared to the unreinforced coatings...|$|R

The important qualitative differences between this reaction and the reaction seen around inert materials such as titanium are discussed. The nature of the anchorage of cemented implants in bone has been a matter of controversy for almost two decades. It is generally held that the normal response to bone cement is the development of a soft-tissue mem-brane between the cement and the bone. However, Charnley (1970, 1979) has suggested that in perfectly successful cases the cement may lie in direct contact with what appears to be living bone, even though there is uncertainty whether the tissue represents a transitional form of fibrocartilage and bone...|$|E
40|$|Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCL's) {{are high}} {{performance}} needle punched environmental reinforced composites which combine two durable geotextile outer layers with a uniform core of natural sodium bentonite clay {{to form a}} hydraulic barrier. Fibers from the non-woven geotextile are needle punched through the layer of bentonite and incorporated into the other geotextile (either a woven or non-woven). This process results in a <b>strong</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond</b> between the fabrics. These are made into large rolls for easy installation. Geosynthetics are used to improve soil conditions or allow the soil to perform in a better manner, similar to steel in concrete, where the steel gives the concrete the necessary strength e. g. to withstand bending. Additionally geosynthetics can improve the lifetime of a certain application and therefore save short-term maintenance costs. Increased awareness of our environment leads to "ecology " being taken more seriously in civil engineering. In continuing changing economic conditions, ecological aspects should not be ignored. On the other hand, economy and ecology aspects {{should not be allowed}} to mutually exclude each other. They have to be considered together. This is possible if the two aspects are balanced against each other. It is achieved by analysing the entire lifetime of a product and its effects on the environment and the extent to which the materials and energy are consumed throughout its product lifetime.

40|$|The Melt Attack and Coolability Experiments (MACE) {{program at}} Argonne National Laboratory {{addressed}} the issue of the ability of water to cool and thermally stabilize a molten core-concrete interaction when the reactants are flooded from above. These tests provided data regarding the nature of corium interactions with concrete, the heat transfer rates from the melt to the overlying water pool, and the role of noncondensable gases in the mixing processes that contribute to melt quenching. The Melt Coolability and Concrete Interaction (MCCI) program is pursuing separate effect tests to examine the viability of the melt coolability mechanisms identified as part of the MACE program. These mechanisms include bulk cooling, water ingression, volcanic eruptions, and crust breach. At the second PRG meeting held at ANL on 22 - 23 October 2002, a preliminary design 1 for a separate effects test to investigate the melt eruption cooling mechanism was presented for PRG review. At this meeting, NUPEC made several recommendations on the experiment approach aimed at optimizing the chances of achieving a floating crust boundary condition in this test. The principal recommendation was to incorporate a mortar sidewall liner into the test design, since data from the COTELS experiment program indicates that corium does not form a <b>strong</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond</b> with this material. Other recommendations included: (i) reduction of the electrode elevation to well below the melt upper surface elevation (since the crust may bond to these solid surfaces), and (ii) favorably taper the mortar liner to facilitate crust detachment and relocation during the experiment. Finally, as a precursor to implementing these modifications, the PRG recommended the development of a design for a small-scale scoping test intended to verify the ability of the mortar liner to preclude formation of an anchored bridge crust under core-concrete interaction conditions. This revised Melt Eruption Test (MET) plan is intended to satisfy these PRG recommendations. Specifically, the revised plan focuses on providing data on the extent of crust growth and melt eruptions as a function of gas sparging rate under well-controlled experiment conditions, including a floating crust boundary condition. The overall objective of MET is to determine to what extent core debris is rendered coolable by eruptive-type processes that breach the crust that rests upon the melt. The specific objectives of this test are as follows: (1) Evaluate the augmentation in surface heat flux during periods of melt eruption; (2) Evaluate the melt entrainment coefficient from the heat flux and gas flow rate data for input into models that calculate ex-vessel debris coolability; (3) Characterize the morphology and coolability of debris resulting from eruptive processes that transport melt into overlying water; and (4) Discriminate between periods when eruptions take the form of particle ejections into overlying water, leading to a porous particle bed, and single-phase extrusions, which lead to volcano-type structures...|$|E

Large grained textured superconductor with grain size over 10 mm along the growth direction and Jc over 3600 A/cm 2 (77 K, 0. 5 Tesla) has been produced in both one - zone and two - zone furnaces with good reproducibility. Two kinds of design of reactive metal contacts have been proposed and investigated, aiming to make low resistivity contacts with <b>strong</b> <b>mechanical</b> strength. Three possible reactive contact metals have been tested for contact making, and the microstructures at the interfaces have been studied to find the relations between contact resistivity and contact processing conditions. Titanium/noble metal multilayer contacts is a promising type of contact technique for low resistivity and <b>strong</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonds.</b> Gold and silver contacts give resistivities among the best reported results in the literature, and {{they turned out to}} be extremely stable in time, could withstand repeated thermal cycling from room temperature to 10 K and yield very reproducible R-T curves. The electrochemical titration method has been used to increase the oxygen stoichiometry of bulk textured YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x samples. The electrochemical titration method can further oxidize melt textured thick film YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x samples in which it may be difficult to further improve oxygen content by conventional annealing. The solid state electrochemical cell has been used to study the thermodynamic properties of the Y-Ba-Cu-O system at high oxygen pressure by measuring the oxygen activity versus time continuously immediately after the electrochemical titration. A series of computer models have been set up according to the microstructure of the contact interface to simulate the complicated contact resistivity behaviours. The nature of, and geometry of, the reaction products at the contact interfaces may be revealed by the temperature dependence of the contact resistance. This information combined with direct observations on the structure and chemistry of the contacts provided a fuller understanding of conduction mechanism at the contact interface. </p...|$|R

P. fucoides demonstrated better bioaccumulative properties towards most of the investigated radionuclides. As a result, P. fucoides can be recommended as a good bioindicator of radioactive environmental pollution. The bioaccumulation of radionuclides in F. lumbricalis was studied during an extended laboratory experiment. The initial extensive uptake of radioisotopes {{was followed by the}} rapid removal of cations; in general, concentrations tended to decrease with time. 137 Cs displayed a different behaviour, its concentration in the algae increasing over time mainly due to its large ion radius; this is a factor that could be responsible for the <b>stronger</b> <b>mechanical</b> and chemical <b>bonding</b> of Cs+ and that could hamper the movement of ions in both directions...|$|R
40|$|In this report, {{we present}} a study of diamond {{deposition}} on pure and nitrided chromium substrates using the hot filament-assisted chemical vapour deposition technique. Deposition was performed at substrate temperatures varying from 475 to 750 degreesC for different exposure times. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were employed to study the modified interlayers and diamond films. The high solubility and diffusivity of carbon in pure chromium result in an increased incubation time for diamond nucleation. However, even a 4 - 5 -mum-thick nitrided layer is efficient as a diamond-nucleating surface, with a reduced incubation time as compared to pure chromium. Fully covering and adhering diamond films were obtained on the nitrided Cr specimens at temperatures between 550 and 750 degreesC. As {{a result of the}} nitriding process, the nitride diffusion layer reduces the carbon solubility at the substrate surface, thereby reducing the incubation time for diamond nucleation. Due to the <b>strong</b> chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> of the diamond films to the nitrided Cr substrates, the residual compressive stresses are accommodated, leading to adherent, continuous diamond films. The present study, however, also indicates an optimal low-temperature deposition condition to obtain a continuous diamond film directly on pure Cr. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

In this paper, a bio-inspired artificial muscle actuator with artificial tendons is developed for robotic arm applications. The actuator uses dielectric elastomer as artificial muscle and functionalized carbon fibers as artificial tendons. A VHB 4910 tape is used as the dielectric elastomer and PDMS is used as the bonding material to mechanically connect the carbon fibers to the elastomer. Carbon fibers are highly popular for their high electrical conductivities, mechanical strengths, and bio-compatibilities. After the acid treatments for the functionalization of carbon fibers (500 nm - 10 pm), one end of carbon fibers is spread into the PDMS material, which provides enough bonding strength with other dielectric elastomers, while the other end is connected to a DC power supply. To characterize the actuation capability of the dielectric elastomer and electrical conductivity of carbon fibers, a diaphragm actuator is fabricated, where the carbon fibers {{are connected to the}} actuator. To test the <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> between PDMS and carbon fibers, specimens of PDMS bonded with carbon fibers are fabricated.
