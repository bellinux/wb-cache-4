500|$|The video {{opens with}} Stan {{and some of}} her male back-up dancers being {{presented}} in a dark white room. Subsequently, the room becomes enlightened and Stan is seen wearing transparent sunglasses, a white <b>sweatband</b> and a silver jacket. Following this, she retrieves a tennis racket from one of her background dancers and holds it {{in front of her face}} before returning the racket to a nearby dancer. Next, Stan performs the pre-refrain of the song, while two female performers clutch a hair dryer in their hands. For the refrain, she and ten other female background dancers are performing synchronized dances, with them having wigs on, and dressing white clothing and red accessories. Following this, Stan is presented standing on a yellow plate which is kept in the air by two threads. She wears a silver leotard and a multicolored wig. Next, Stan is shown walking into a tennis field, whereon she plays a tennis match against herself. For the breakdown of [...] "Cherry Pop", the video gets introduced into a dark-lighted room. There, [...] her previously shown male background dancers are presented; the video continues with Stan dancing accompanied by her dancers. The clip finally ends with a pink tennis ball dropping out of the ceiling, while the screen becomes black.|$|E

50|$|Changes to the 59Fifty {{over the}} next several decades were few, but there was some experimentation. During the 1970s and 80s, some teams experimented with nylon fabric as opposed to wool. Leather <b>sweatbands</b> fell out of favor to cloth <b>sweatbands</b> and were phased out by the late 80s. The {{underside}} of the visors were traditionally green, but beginning in the 70s, teams slowly switched over to gray. By 1995, all Major League Baseball teams were using gray. The New York Yankees were among the last teams to use green.|$|R
50|$|Headbands, or <b>sweatbands,</b> {{are worn}} around the {{forehead}} during physical activity to absorb sweat {{and keep it}} from reaching the eyes. <b>Sweatbands</b> are often made of a continuous loop of terrycloth, {{as it is a}} particularly absorbent fabric. Folded bandanas, usually knotted behind the head, also serve this purpose. Headbands are usually used for sports but have not been popular since the late 1970s or early 1980s. LeBron James {{is one of the most}} notable players who wears a headband during basketball games. They also come in the form of wristbands.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, New Era {{changed the}} Authentic Collection 59Fifty significantly. The {{material}} changed from wool to polyester, and all teams were now using black fabric under the visor {{as well as}} black <b>sweatbands.</b> New Era still continued to produce 100% wool 59Fifty caps.|$|R
2500|$|Earle Bruce {{took over}} for Hayes {{and led the}} Buckeyes to a 5–4 record against Schembechler's Wolverines between 1979 and 1987, perhaps the most {{balanced}} stretch of the rivalry, during which neither team won more than two consecutive games. In 1987, Bruce was fired in {{the week before the}} Michigan game due to a poor season record, but was allowed to coach anyway, and the inspired Buckeyes (each wearing a <b>sweatband</b> labeled [...] "Earle") won an upset over the heavily favored Wolverines. After the game, Bo Schembechler told Bruce, [...] "I always mind losing to Ohio State but I didn't mind so much today." [...] After 1987, the series stood at 46–33–5 in favor of UM.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1990s, teams began to {{experiment}} with black fabric under the visors {{to help with the}} sun's glare, and black <b>sweatbands</b> to make them appear less sweat-stained. The [...] "Diamond Collection" [...] label also changed to the [...] "Authentic Collection".|$|R
60|$|The sailors, goaded by the remorseless {{pangs of}} hunger, had eaten their leather belts, their shoes, the <b>sweatbands</b> from their caps, {{although}} both Clayton and Monsieur Thuran had done {{their best to}} convince them that these would only add to the suffering they were enduring.|$|R
50|$|Items {{that may}} be made from terrycloth include babies' {{reusable}} nappies (UK English) or diapers (US English), towels, bathrobes, bedlinen, and <b>sweatbands</b> for the wrist or head. Terrycloth is also sometimes used to make sweat jackets. Terry towelling hats with a shallow brim were once popular with cricketers (like English wicketkeeper Jack Russell), but {{are no longer in}} fashion.|$|R

5000|$|The Boss was {{designed}} {{with a high}} crown to provide insulation {{on the top of}} the head, and a wide stiff brim to provide shelter from both sun and precipitation for the face, neck and shoulders. The original fur-felt hat was waterproof and shed rain. Overall, the hat was durable and lightweight. On the underside, the hat included a <b>sweatband,</b> a lining to protect the hat, and, as a memorial to earlier designs, a bow on its <b>sweatband,</b> which had the practical purpose of helping distinguish the front from the back. The original designs were natural in color with four-inch crowns and brims; a plain strap was used for the band.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} [...] "Boss", {{manufactured by}} Stetson in 1865, was flat brimmed, had a straight-sided crown, with rounded corners. These lightweight, waterproof hats were natural in color, with four-inch crowns and brims. A plain hatband was fitted to adjust head size. The <b>sweatband</b> bore John B. Stetson's name.|$|E
50|$|This {{invention}} is {{an adaptation}} to the sewing machine that allows it to stitch a common chain stitch with one thread {{to be used to}} sew <b>sweatbands</b> and strips of linen onto the inside edge of the hat. Previously, this work had been done by hand, so this machine increased the rate of production by simplifying the work needed to be done.|$|R
50|$|Players {{may choose}} between {{a variety of}} grip materials. The most common choices are PU {{synthetic}} grips or towelling grips. Grip choice {{is a matter of}} personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, <b>sweatbands</b> may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his/her grip more frequently.|$|R
50|$|The risk of {{heat stroke}} {{can be reduced}} by observing {{precautions}} to avoid overheating and dehydration. Light, loose-fitting clothes will allow perspiration to evaporate and cool the body. Wide-brimmed hats in light colors help prevent the sun from warming the head and neck. Vents on a hat will help cool the head, as will <b>sweatbands</b> wetted with cool water. Strenuous exercise should be avoided during daylight hours in hot weather, as should remaining in confined spaces (such as automobiles) without air-conditioning or adequate ventilation.|$|R

5000|$|Berets are {{not usually}} lined, but many are {{partially}} lined with silk or satin. In military berets, the headband is worn on the outside; military berets often have external <b>sweatbands</b> of leather, pleather or ribbon. The traditional beret (also worn by selected military units, such as the Belgian Chasseurs Ardennais or the French Chasseurs Alpins), usually has the [...] "sweatband" [...] folded inwardly. In such a case, these berets have only an additional inch {{or so of the}} same woollen material designed to be folded inwardly.|$|R

[...] Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network was disappointed by Kaoru's lack of development in the series Rurouni Kenshin Restoration.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{students}} {{showed their}} support for the lacrosse team during the investigation in a variety of ways. [...] The Duke women's lacrosse team chose to wear [...] "Innocent" [...] <b>sweatbands</b> with the accused players' numbers during their games in the 2006 NCAA Final Four. [...] "We want to win a national championship for ourselves but definitely also for the university and the men's team," [...] one team member explained. [...] "They don't really have a chance to play their season, which is a shame." [...] The women came under fire from many in the media. [...] Kevin Sweeney of Salon argued that their actions will {{make it more difficult for}} rape victims to speak out in the future, while New York Times sports columnist Harvey Araton stated that their [...] "cross-team friendship" [...] made them lose common sense.|$|R

5000|$|The men's varsity {{team of the}} University of Santo Tomas used to {{be called}} the [...] "Glowing Goldies". The change to [...] "Growling Tigers" [...] came after the embarrassment {{suffered}} by the UST crowd who were present during the opening ceremonies of Season 54 (1991-92). Part of the program was the parade of school mascots. Host University of the Philippines which was the producer of the program was at a loss on how to represent the Glowing Goldies concretely. Since UST is a Dominican institute, the host decided to represent the school with an old Dominican friar holding a basketball, with <b>sweatbands</b> on the arms as well as band-aids all over its body and limbs. This personification drew a lot of laughter from the crowd. Due to this embarrassment, a search for a new mascot was held. Athletic Director Felicitas Francisco suggested the tiger as the new mascot due to its gold and white colors.|$|R
50|$|A Supporter is {{a person}} who is the main point of contact between their {{respective}} country and Andamiro Korea. Any events and tournaments held require a written report with photos/videos sent to Andamiro, in exchange for prizes and recognition of athletes to enter WPF. A Club Leader is the person in charge of their respective club and should use their best efforts to maintain a close relationship with their Supporter. Clubs are normally (but not exclusively) town specific and focus on events in their area. As of 2007 a minimum of 10 officially recognised clubs are required per country to validate them for WPF (150 club members). Excellent club organisers can be designated as jurors in competitions for selecting national team members and also the WPF competition itself. If this is the case, Andamiro pays for all WPF jurors expenses, like WPF athletes. Andamiro gives prize money two times a year to the club's treasurer for club activities. Members who make a forum post, upload a picture/video or high score for the home/arcade versions of the game receive points. These can be exchanged in the online store for T-shirts, <b>Sweatbands,</b> Visors, CD's/DVD's and signed MP3 players by Banya (musical group).|$|R
40|$|When Electronic Arts Inc. (Electronic Arts) {{launched}} its video game series NCAA Football in June 1993, the available technology limited developers to crafting avatars {{that looked like}} faceless figurines. Today, however, advancements in digital technology have enabled developers to create “virtual players” that strongly resemble their real-life counterparts. For example, in NCAA Football 12, the avatar that represents University of Florida running back Chris Rainey possesses Chris Rainey’s actual height, weight, skin complexion, and hair style. In addition, both Chris Rainey and his virtual counterpart wear the same jersey number, visor, gloves, and <b>sweatbands.</b> Recently, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Taylor Branch criticized video game publishers for failing {{to pay for the}} use of college athletes’ likenesses. According to Branch, failing to pay for college athletes’ likenesses not only leads to windfall profits for video game publishers, but also transforms college athletes into a “profit center” for their business partner, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). At the core of intellectual property law, there lies a well-established principle that “if you create something, then that something is... yours to exploit. ” Based upon this principle, courts have generally disallowed the unlicensed, commercial use of celebrity likenesses. Nevertheless, courts have failed to protect the publicity rights of Division I college athletes. Instead, they have created a First Amendment loophole to circumvent college athletes’ rights. This Article argues that despite First Amendment concerns, courts should protect college athletes’ publicity rights in commercial video games...|$|R

50|$|Since early mediæval {{times each}} papal tiara has {{included}} two lappets. Their origins remain a mystery, {{though they are}} obviously an imitation of the lappets on the bishop's mitre.

50|$|It can be {{used for}} {{anything}} a towel could be used for - as a washcloth, dishcloth, but often as a headband, souvenir, decoration, or for wrapping items such as bottles. Towels made from terry cloth have largely replaced it in household use. However tenugui are still popular as souvenirs, decorations, and as a head covering in kendo, where it functions as a <b>sweatband,</b> as extra padding beneath the headgear (men).|$|E

50|$|The visor {{portion of}} a sun visor may be either curved or flat and the strap is often {{equipped}} with an adjustable velcro fastener in back. The strap can function as a <b>sweatband.</b> This type of headgear was designed for use in outdoor sports (especially golf, tennis, and volleyball) where eye protection from direct sunlight is desirable, but is now often used by non-athletes at beach and other sunny outdoor events.|$|E
50|$|The {{first several}} races used an actual baton. Later, {{necklace}} medallions were added and racers had {{to place the}} medallion over {{around the neck of}} their teammate as they tagged off to the next event. For many years, a <b>sweatband,</b> worn on the wrist, took the place of the medallion. Racers would pass the <b>sweatband</b> to their teammate racing the next leg at the transition points. In recent years, the race has used transponder timing and teams have carried an electronic timing chip attached to a lanyard. The chip is swiped {{at the start of the}} race and is carried by the lanyard that is traded off from one teammate to the other at the exchange of each leg. At the transition point for each leg of the race, the chip is swiped again to register the end time of the previous leg, and the start of the next. The chip has to be swiped at the end of the race by the kayaker after ringing the ceremonial bell. For the 2011 edition of the race, the chip was mounted to a neoprene wristband instead of a lanyard. From 2012, the race has returned to chips on the wristbands.|$|E
