5000|$|In June 2011, the New South Wales (NSW) {{government}} {{was reported to}} have raised [...] million over the previous five years from <b>speed</b> <b>cameras.</b> [...] The Roads Minister accused the previous Labor government of using <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> to raise revenue; the Auditor-General was therefore tasked with investigating all 141 fixed <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> in use throughout the state. Following the release of the report, 38 <b>speed</b> <b>cameras,</b> located primarily on highways, were switched off after the Auditor-General determined that they had no significant road safety benefit. The report found the majority of fixed <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> had a proven road safety benefit. The report also concluded that it was [...] "too early" [...] to conclude if mobile <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> affected road safety, although early results indicated drivers might be speeding less. To address public concerns, the RTA would now monitor the effectiveness of individual fixed <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> annually.|$|R
40|$|Much {{research}} {{has been carried out}} into the effects of <b>speed</b> <b>cameras,</b> and the research shows consistently positive results. International review studies report that <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> produce a reduction of approximately 20 % in personal injury crashes on road sections where cameras are used. In the Netherlands, research also indicates positive effects on speed behaviour and road safety. Dutch drivers find <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> in fixed pole-mounted positions more acceptable than cameras in hidden police cars...|$|R

25|$|However {{recent studies}} of {{starling}} flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are. Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a topological rule rather than a metric rule. It {{remains to be seen}} whether this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high <b>speed</b> <b>camera</b> footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Speed limit {{enforcement}} {{is used to}} check that road vehicles are complying with the speed limits. Methods used include Fixed <b>speed</b> <b>cameras,</b> Average <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> and also police operated LIDAR speed guns and older radar speed guns. In addition Vehicle activated sign and Community Speed Watch groups also encourage compliance. For lower speed limits, physical Traffic Calming is normally required. Fixed <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> are controversial with various advocacy groups supporting and opposing their use.|$|R

500|$|Junos opening title sequence, {{depicting}} a rotoscoped Juno walking through her town while drinking {{a bottle of}} SunnyD orange drink, was put together over 7–8 months by a small design studio, Shadowplay Studio, based in Los Angeles. Reitman had met the studio's co-founder Gareth Smith in Japan on the short film festival circuit where they each had shorts screening. Shadowplay created the opening title sequence for Reitman's previous film, Thank You for Smoking, and he contacted them again {{when he found out}} he was going to direct Juno. With vintage 1970s punk-rock posters as inspiration, Smith and artist Jenny Lee decided to create a sequence that [...] "had texture {{and a little bit of}} edge, but also imparted the warmth and heart of the screenplay". In the last days of filming in Vancouver, Ellen Page was photographed with a high <b>speed</b> <b>camera</b> from a number of angles walking on a treadmill and drinking SunnyD. 900 still images of a walking and drinking Page were printed out and repeatedly run through a Xerox machine to degrade their quality until the pictures appeared hand-drawn. The pictures were cut-out and scanned back onto the computer then layered onto the background drawn by Lee with compositing software to create a stop motion animation sequence that corresponded to [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] by Barry Louis Polisar, the song Reitman had chosen. Shadowplay also designed the titlecards for each of the seasons for the film, hand-made a custom typeface for the opening title sequence and the closing credits, and collaborated on the design of the soundtrack and the DVD.|$|E

50|$|A first {{experimental}} {{system was}} tested {{on a short}} stretch of the A2 in 1997 and was deemed a big success by the police, reducing overspeeding to 0.66%, compared to 5 to 6% when regular <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> were used at the same location. The first permanent average <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> were installed on the A13 in 2002, shortly after the speed limit was reduced to 80 km/h to limit noise and air pollution in the area. In 2007, average <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> resulted in 1.7 million fines for overspeeding {{out of a total}} of 9.7 millions.
