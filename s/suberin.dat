These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of the epidermis may contain cutin. The Casparian strip in the endodermis roots and cork cells of plant bark contain <b>suberin.</b> Both cutin and <b>suberin</b> are polyesters that function as permeability barriers to the movement of water.

40|$|Soil water {{repellency}} or hydrophobicity {{is a common}} and important soil property, which may diminish plant growth and promotes soil erosion leading to environmentally undesired situations. Hydrophobic organic compounds in the soil are derived from vegetation (leaves, roots, mosses) or microorganisms (fungi, bacteria), and these compounds induce soil {{water repellency}} (SWR) and can be called SWR-biomarkers. As common hydrophobic constituents of organic matter, plant lipids are mainly from wax layers of leaves and roots, whereas cutins and <b>suberins</b> as aliphatic biopolyesters occur in leaves and roots, respectively. Their unique compositions in soil can indicate the original vegetation sources. To investigate the individual or combined effects of the hydrophobic compounds on SWR and their possible associations with each other, we conducted experiments to analyse the organic composition of Dutch coastal dune sandy soils in relation to SWR. DCM/MeOH solvent is used to remove solvent soluble lipids. BF 3 -methanol is utilized to depolymerize cutins and <b>suberins</b> from isopropanol/NH 3 extractable organic matter.

30|$|Humic {{substances}} (humics, HS) are refractory, dark-colored heterogeneous {{organic compounds}} {{produced in the}} decay of the total biota in the environment (Stevenson 1994). From the chemical point of view, they are a heterogeneous mixture of fragments of lignins, cellulose, <b>suberins</b> and cutins. Their unique structure makes them a versatile material with applications in industry, medicine, environmental protection, and agriculture. It is becoming clearer, {{that the presence of}} humics in soil is necessary for sustainable agriculture, due to their ability to condition the soil, enhance its stability and increase its resistance to erosion (Laker et al. 1993; Spaccini et al. 2002), ensure enhanced biological activity (Canellas et al. 2002; Canellas et al. 2008; Nardi et al. 2000 a, b; Zandonadi et al. 2007) and obtain higher crop yields (Antošová et al. 2008; Brownell et al. 1987; Eyheraguibel et al. 2008). In addition, humics have the ability to sequestrate soil pollutants (Evdokimov and von Wandruszka 1998; Sanjay et al. 1999; Senesi and Loffredo 2001; von Wandruszka 2000), and may be used in soil remediation (Fava et al. 2004; Stehlíčková et al. 2009; von Wandruszka 2000).|$|R
25|$|In plants, a {{secondary}} cell {{wall is a}} thicker additional layer of cellulose which increases wall rigidity. Additional layers may be formed by lignin in xylem cell walls, or <b>suberin</b> in cork cell walls. These compounds are rigid and waterproof, making the secondary wall stiff.

Algae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides such as carrageenan and agar that are absent from land plants. In bacteria, the cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan. The cell walls of archaea have various compositions, and may be formed of glycoprotein S-layers, pseudopeptidoglycan, or polysaccharides.

40|$|International audienceA two-step {{off-line}} thermochemolysis {{was developed}} to characterize successively free and bound compounds in humic fractions from a wooded Sphagnum-dominated mire peat (Frasne, Jura Mountains, France). Two reactants with different strengths were used: hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) followed by tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Analysis of the thermolysates showed obvious {{differences between the two}} steps regarding the nature and/or the distribution of the numerous identified products. The first step with HMDS revealed the occurrence of thermolabile compounds and/or molecular units occurring initially in (bio) polymers susceptible to be cracked by HMDS, mostly carbohydrates and aromatics. The second step with TMAH released products resulting from the cracking of units with a relatively high thermal and/or chemical stability (monomers from biopolymers such as lignin and cutins, <b>suberins</b> or waxes). Two-step thermochemolysis thus appears as an interesting tool to help deciphering the composition, origin and nature of soil and sediment organic matter.

These components of plants, like other lipoid ingredients (<b>suberins,</b> coutines, sporinins, natural rubbers) are resistant to microbial action, so they are well preserved in bacterial processing of organic matter in the stages of sedimento- and diagenesis, and are well diagnosed in microscopic studies.

40|$|Soil water {{repellency}} (SWR) interrupts water infiltration, diminish plant growth and potentially promote soil erosion. Hydrophobic organic compounds coating soil mineral surfaces that originate from plants (leaves/roots) and microorganisms can induce SWR. These SWR-causing compounds {{are defined as}} ‘SWR-markers’. We aim to investigate the relations between SWR-markers and SWR to predict the persistence of SWR, linking SWR-markers to their plant origins to interpret the influence of vegetation cover on the SWR and SWR-markers of the underlying soil and, conversely, to explore the effect of SWR on vegetation dynamics in ecosystems. Dutch coastal dune sandy soils are collected under various plant species at different depths. The degree of SWR of the soils increases with increasing content of total organic carbon. A sequential extraction method is applied to these soils to obtain individual fractions and are analysed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry: free lipids (the so-called D fraction) are removed by dichloromethane/methanol (DCM/MeOH); the residual soils are extracted by iso-propanol/ammonia solution (IPA/NH 3) and the extracts separated into a DCM/MeOH soluble part (AS fraction) and an insoluble part (AI fraction). The predominant groups in the D fraction originate from plant leaf waxes, while the AI fraction contains mainly root-derived <b>suberins.</b> The majority of compounds in the AS fraction are derived from <b>suberins</b> hydrolysed by microbes and a minor part is from leaf waxes. Therefore, plants are the primary sources of these SWR-markers, while microorganisms contribute a minor part. The soils become more hydrophobic after the D fraction is removed. The SWR of the residual soils dramatically decreases {{and the majority of}} them render wettable after the AI and AS fractions are extracted. Roots induce stronger SWR than leaf waxes. Suberin-derived ω-hydroxy fatty acids and α,ω-dicarboxylic acids both with C 22 and C 24 can well predict SWR. Due to a less mixed origin, more single long-chain (> 20) SWR-markers are correlated significantly to SWR in a simple ecosystem with only a few plant species than in a complex ecosystem with various vegetation species. Plant leaves and roots mainly contribute SWR-markers to the top- and subsoils, respectively and consequently influence the SWR of corresponding soil layers. However, roots can also affect the SWR of the topsoils resulting from their distribution in the soil upper layer. Consequently, depending on plant species and plant tissues, vegetation cover has different influences on the abundance and compositions of SWR-markers and, therefore, on the distribution of SWR. After upscaling SWR from the molecular to the ecosystem scale, theoretical modelling suggest that SWR may affect ecosystems by triggering cyclic vegetation dynamics. High water competitive species (e. g. woody plants) with a low SWR-marker content show stable temporal dynamics. By contrast, low water competitive species (e. g. grasses) with a high SWR-marker content in tissues are more likely to experience cyclic dynamics...|$|R

Py-FIMS of dissolved organic matter (DOM), FA, and HA gave highly reliable fingerprint mass spectra, thermograms describing the thermal properties and qualitative and quantitative data of 10 classes of characteristic molecular building blocks. Carbohydrates, phenols and lignin monomers; lignin dimers, lipids, alkylaromatics, aromatic nitrogen compounds, sterols, peptides, <b>suberins</b> and loosely bound fatty acids were determined. Complementary molecular structure information was obtained by Py-GC/MS which allowed the identification {{of a wide range}} of humic building blocks as main pyrolysis products. Our first results using the novel method of combined Py-GC/MS and Py-GC-C-IRMS indicate that the delta(13) C-values of the pyrolysis products are in agreement with generally accepted data for carbohydrates, lignin and benzenes from biological sources. This implies that the pyrolytical step does not have an isotopic effect. In contrast, some of the thermal products, e. g. 5 -methyl- 2 -furancarboxaldehyde and benzenemethyl, had stronger depletions in C- 13 in comparison to the mean delta(13) C-values of furans and benzenes, respectively. This result contradicts the enrichment of C- 13 due to trophic effects and therefore suggests the incorporation of light carbon sources, such as respiratory CO 2, methane, or anthropogenic pollution by fossil fuels, in the humification processes.

The aims {{of this study are}} to select important SWR markers to predict SWR based on their correlation with SWR and to determine their origin. In our study, sandy soils with different SWR were collected, along with their covering vegetation, i. e. plant leaves/needles and roots. A sequential extraction procedure was applied to the soils to obtain three organic fractions: dichloromethane (DCM) /MeOH soluble fraction (D), DCM/MeOH insoluble fraction of isopropanol/ammonia solution (IPA/NH 3) extract (AI) and DCM/MeOH soluble fraction of IPA/NH 3 extract (AS), which were subdivided into 10 dominant SWR marker groups: D fatty acid, D alcohol, D alkane, AI fatty acid, AI alcohol, AI ω-hydroxy fatty acid, AI α,ω-dicarboxylic acid, AS fatty acid, AS alcohol and AS ω-hydroxy fatty acid. Waxes and biopolyesters of the vegetation were also sequentially extracted from plants. The soils with higher SWR have significantly higher relative concentrations of AS alcohols. A number of indications suggest that AS alcohols are mainly derived from roots and most likely produced by microbial hydrolysis of biopolyesters (mainly <b>suberins).</b> In addition, the strong correlation between the biomarkers of plant tissues and SWR markers in soils suggests that it is more accurate to predict SWR of topsoils using ester-bound alcohols from roots, and to predict SWR of subsoils using root-derived ω-hydroxy fatty acids and α,ω-dicarboxylic acids. Considering the sandy soils studied here, the relationships we obtained need to be tested for other types of soils.

Key words: Helianthus tuberosus — Immunoprecipitation — NADPH-cytochrome P 450 (c) reductase — In vitro translation — Western blot. Cytochrome P- 450 monooxygenases from higher plants are involved in important biosynthetic pathways: the production of hormones (Hasson and West 1976), lignins and flavonoids (Benveniste and Durst 1974, Potts et al. 1974, Grand 1984), phytoalexins (Fujita et al. 1982), cutins (Soliday and Kolattukudy 1977), <b>suberins</b> (Kolat-tukudy 1980), hydroxyfatty acids (Salaiin et al. 1978), sterols (Rahier and Taton 1986) and alkaloids (Madyastha et al. 1976). The activity of these monooxygenases is de-pendent upon the NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 (c) reductase (EC 1. 6. 2. 4) which provides the electrons necessary for the activation of oxygen at the heme center of the cytochrome.

The compound assemblages released after the successive treatments were considered to reflect lipid speciation patterns in the different levels of the cuticular structure. In particular, after all the treatments, the dominance of a homologous series of α,ω-alkanedioic acids with maxima at C 9 and C 10 indicates a polymethylene network based on macromolecules; the units of this network contain in-chain unsaturations or substitutions in positions {{similar to those in}} precursor unsaturated C 16 and C 18 acids. The low yields of ω-hydroxyacids typical of cutins and <b>suberins</b> of extant plants are interpreted as an intense microbial alteration and/or diagenetic transformation of the fossil cuticle. In conjunction with data from infrared spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis, this suggests that the Squamastrobus remains consist of a macromolecular alkyl mixture in which the original C backbone has been defunctionalized, reoxidized, and subjected to additional condensation by the probable contribution of newly-formed, nonhydrolyzable bridges. It appears that this cellulose-lacking material includes a small moiety of altered lignin, and has been subjected to extensive oxidation, but not to further thermal alteration leading to decarboxylation. A possible result of this diagenetic alteration is that a portion of the resin constituents were transformed into lower molecular weight alkylbenzenes and alkylnaphthalenes, whereas another portion condensed into a very stable, nonhydrolyzable residue.
