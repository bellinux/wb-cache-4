Cows that were examined before the start of supplementation had average activity GPX in blood samples from group A  847, 06 +- 170, 77 ukat/l and group B 791, 30 +- 91, 20 ukat/l and concentration of Se of group A: 136, 70 +- 27, 97 ug/l and group B 95, 77 +- 20, 05 ug/l. It was found that cows postpartum had higher activity of GPx by 26 % in group A and by 45 % in group B. Difference between groups was statistically inconclusive (p < 0, 28). Increase in concentration of selenium in blood of cows in group A was 7, 5 % and in group B 5 %.

40|$|A diverse {{microbial}} population colonizes the sterile mammalian gastrointestinal tract {{during and after}} the birth. There is increasing evidence that this complex microbiome plays {{a crucial role in the}} development of the mucosal immune system and influences newborn health. Microbial colonization is a complex process influenced by a two-way interaction between host and microbes and a variety of external factors, including maternal microbiota, birth process, diet, and antibiotics. Following this initial colonization, continuous exposure to host-specific microbes is not only essential for development and maturation of the mucosal immune system but also the nutrition and health of the animal.

Accordingly, a {{study was conducted}} at Bbalitvet to identify the causal agents, reduce clinical incidence, and increase body weight gain <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>calves.</b> One potential control is application of suitable vaccines to pregnant cows. The study was begun by identifying cases of diarrhea followed by isolation and identification of the causal agents in 12 beef cattle farms in West Java. A field trial was then designed for controlling calf diarrhea in such farms. Inactive vaccines Ecoli-Closvak polivalen were administered to pregnant cows to increase specific resistance <b>of</b> the <b>newborn</b> <b>calves.</b> At 2 months prepartum, 12 pregnant cows were assigned either to a vaccination or a placebo group, with a booster vaccination 3 weeks prior to parturition. Strict hygenic management was provided to both groups, and all calves were provided adequately with colostrum. Subjects were observed for 5 months, starting {{from the time of}} initial vaccination until the calves were 3 months of age. In the initial farm surveys, entero-pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli serotype K 99 and Clostridium perfringens type A and C were isolated and identified in fecal samples from 4 beef cattle farms in 3 districts (Garut, Tasikmalaya, Ciamis) and 2 beef cattle farms in 2 districts (Tasikmalaya and Ciamis) of West Java. In the vaccination trial, good immune responses to E. coli and C. perfringens alpha toxin measured by ELISA were observed. Application of effective control of calf diarrhea including vaccination and good livestock management showed good results.

40|$|Vitamin A is a fat-soluble {{nutrient}} {{which is}} essential for optimal vision, growth and cell differentiation. Newborn animals have a less effective immune system than adults. Metabolites of vitamin A such as the retinoic acids (RA) modulate immune function. <b>Newborn</b> <b>calves</b> have negligible vitamin A (retinol) in the liver and circulation {{and high levels of}} a novel isomer of RA (9, 13 -di-cis-RA). The objective of this dissertation was to evaluate the effect of the vitamin A status <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> on their immune responsiveness. We show that physiologic concentrations of 9, 13 -di-cis-RA did not influence the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMNL) from neonatal, precolostral calves to proliferate or produce polyclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) or interferon-[gamma] (IFN-[gamma]) in response to pokeweed mitogen in vitro. Studies by others suggested that 9, 13 -di-cis-RA was a biologically inactive metabolite but it could generate biologically active 9 -cis-RA. To prevent high RA levels in circulation, <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> were fed a diet deprived of fat-soluble vitamins or their precursors. This procedure prevented the rise of [alpha]-soluble vitamins metabolites such as RAs, retinol, [alpha]-tocopherol and their precursors ([beta]-carotene) in the serum of these calves when compared to controls. However, the phenotype and in vitro immune responses of PBMNL were not different between control and treated calves. We show that ratios of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II+ cells/CD 3 + T lymphocytes, proliferation and IFN-[gamma] production by PBMNL from all calves were lowest at 1 - 4 days of age. Susceptibility to diseases may be enhanced during this period. Our third study indicated that the ability <b>of</b> PBMNL from <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> to produce nitric oxide (NO) (a mechanism of non-specific defense) was modulated by dietary vitamins A and E. The calves that were fed National Research Council-recommended levels of retinyl acetate (vitamin A) (or 20 -fold higher levels) and d-[alpha]-tocopherol (vitamin E) but not those that were fed very low or high vitamin A or d-[alpha]-tocopheryl acetate, had PBMNL which produced NO at levels similar to adult animals.

40|$|The {{present study}} has established, that cows {{suitably}} immunized with either DNP-edestin (DNP-Ed), di-DNP-gramicidin-J [(DNP) 2 -Gram], respectively, or p-azobenzenearsonate-Ed (ABA-Ed) synthesized and secreted reaginic antibodies (IgE) into colostrum. Whereas ABA-Ed failed to elicit {{more than a}} low response, there was however a persistent and increased antibody synthesis between 10 and 56 days after priming with DNP-Ed. Bivalent and multivalent DNP haptens differing in molecular size, degree of substitution, and rigidity were compared for their effectiveness in eliciting Prausnitz-Küstner (P-K) reactions in either <b>newborn</b> colostrum-deprived <b>calves</b> or in those 4 wk of age. The sensitization with reaginic anti-DNP antibody has been accomplished either by feeding colostrum of the immunized dam or by intradermal injection of reaginic serum or colostral whey. It could be demonstrated that equimolar doses of the bivalent α,N-(ε,N-DNP-aminocaproyl-) -ε,N-DNP-L-lysine and the multivalent dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin were equally effective in eliciting reactions in skin sites provided that a high affinity antibody was used for sensitization. By contrast, the comparatively rigid, bivalent hapten, (DNP) 2 -Gram consistently failed to induce comparable reactions. Furthermore, it was clearly shown that optimal distances of determinant groups on the haptenic molecule are a prerequisite for positive P-K reactions, since α,ε,N-bis-DNP-lysine failed to induce comparable reactions. Concurrent sensitization of skin sites with reaginic anti-DNP and anti-ABA antibodies provides the final proof that cross-linking of two adjacent reaginic molecules on the mast cell surface by a bivalent hapten is required for effective elicitation of immediate-type reactions. This has been accomplished by utilizing the bivalent ε,N-DNP-α,N-[(4 -hydroxy- 3 -azobenzenearsonic acid) -phenacetyl]-L-lysine (DNP-ABA) carrying noncross-reactive haptenic groups, which was consistently effective in eliciting P-K reactions in doubly but never in singly sensitized skin sites. It is apparent from the results that equimolar doses of monovalent haptens could completely inhibit the response to DNP-ABA. The present studies finally establish that mast cells <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> colostrum-deprived <b>calves</b> lack IgE molecules on their surface. Thus, mast cells <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> may be unique, to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in immediate-type reactions more precisely...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance of {{antimicrobial}} drug resistance in bacteria can {{be influenced by}} factors unrelated to direct selection pressure such as close linkage to other selectively advantageous genes and secondary advantage conveyed by antimicrobial resistance genes {{in the absence of}} drug selection. Our previous trials at a dairy showed that the maintenance of the antimicrobial resistance genes is not influenced by specific antimicrobial selection and that the most prevalent antimicrobial resistance phenotype of Escherichia coli is specifically selected for in young calves. In this paper we examine the role of secondary advantages conveyed by antimicrobial resistance genes. We tested antimicrobial-susceptible null mutant strains for their ability to compete with their progenitor strains in vitro and in vivo. The null mutant strains were generated by selection for spontaneous loss of resistance genes in broth supplemented with fusaric acid or nickel chloride. On average, the null mutant strains were as competitive as the progenitor strains in vitro and in <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> (in vivo). Inoculation <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> at the dairy with antimicrobial-susceptible strains of E. coli did not impact the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli. Our results demonstrate that the antimicrobial resistance genes are not responsible for the greater fitness advantage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in calves, but the farm environment and the diet clearly exert critical selective pressures responsible for the maintenance of antimicrobial resistance genes. Our current hypothesis is that the antimicrobial resistance genes are linked to other genes responsible for differential fitness in dairy calves...|$|R

Results from the i-STAT and the reference methods were compared. The analytes BE, HCO 3, and TCO 2 showed a constant systematic error across the entire range with 2. 3, 1. 9, and 2. 0 mmol/L lower values, respectively, than the values measured by the reference method. Based on the combined inherent imprecision of the 2 analyzers and after correcting the influences of systematic errors, the PvO 2, HCO 3, and SvO 2 were within the acceptable limits in 76...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{immune system}} <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> is {{immature}} and must mature gradually. Understanding how this immunity is established may define different profiles. Twelve healthy calves were monitored during 8 time periods {{to assess the}} innate immune system during the first 90 d. Blood samples were collected, and the blood phagocytes, identified by the expression of CD 14 and CH 138 surface molecules, were evaluated for phagocytic functionality (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli stained with propidium iodide) and the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (2, 7 ′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate oxidation). Functional changes in the CD 14 + and CH 138 + cells occurred at 40 d of age, with sporadic increases in phagocytosis intensity and reactive oxygen species production, and decreased phagocytosis occurred at 60 d of age. Therefore, fewer phagocytes were active from 40 d of age, although those that were active performed their roles with greater efficacy. That change presumably occurred because the calf phagocytes began to support the immune response without the influence of passive immunity. The animals failed to reach the stability needed to complete the maturation of the innate immune response by 90 d of age. These data are applicable for healthy calves only...|$|R
40|$|The timely supply <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> with optimal {{quantities}} of colostrum has {{a key role}} in the process of immune protection in the early phase of their lives. Passively acquired antibodies can protect the digestive organs from infection caused by E. coli bacteria, and it seems also from the appearance of diseases of the respiratory tract. These examinations were performed on a cattle farm where bronchopneumonia was one of the most significant health problems, and a group of 39 calves were selected for the investigations. The calves were fed with their mothers’ colostrum after birth, and then with collective milk. Immunoglobulin concentration was determined in blood samples taken during the postcolostral period, with the method using zinc-sulphate. At the age of 40 days, the calves were administered a polyvalent inactivated vaccine, and revaccinated 20 days after that (Vibak, Veterinary Department Subotica). In 74. 34 % calves, the immunoglobulin G concentration ranged from 26 to 40 g/l. In 25. 66 % calves, the immunoglobulin concentration was lower, from 8 to 25 g/l. The calves found to have a lower concentration of immunoglobulin in blood contracted bronchopneumonia more frequently, and the outcome of the disease in some cases was mortality, even...|$|R
50|$|Finless {{porpoises}} {{can grow}} {{to as much}} as 2.27 m in length, and can weigh up to 72 kg, although most are rather smaller. The flippers are moderately large, reaching up to 20% of the total body length. Adults are typically a uniform, light grey colour, although some may have lighter patches of skin around the mouth, or darker patches in front <b>of</b> the flippers. <b>Newborn</b> <b>calves</b> <b>of</b> the central and eastern subspecies are mostly black with grey around the dorsal ridge area, becoming fully grey after four to six months. However, <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> <b>of</b> the western subspecies are a light creamy grey, and become darker as they age.|$|R
40|$|Isoxsuprine is a {{beta-agonist}} {{that can}} be used for growth promotion in cattle, but it is also used as registered veterinary medicine. To investigate if veterinary treatment of cows could lead to residues of isoxsuprine in the hair <b>of</b> their <b>newborn</b> <b>calves,</b> an animal experiment was performed. Four cows, treated on veterinary indication with isoxsuprine lactate (Duphaspasmin) before a caesarian section, were included in the experiment. Hair samples from cows and from their calves were analyzed. The animals were shaved every week for 16 weeks and levels of isoxsuprine were measured in hair. In the cows, the levels of isoxsuprine were highest (> 15 µg/kg) just after administration of the isoxsuprine lactate. After two weeks in two cows, a sort of plateau was reached and then the levels decreased. After approximately 10 - 15 weeks the levels were around the CCa level of the method used (0. 5 µg/kg). In calves, for the first two weeks after birth, no isoxsuprine was found above CCa level in three of the four animals. At about 20 - 30 days old, a maximum concentration of 4 µg/kg was found. Then the levels dropped again under the CCa level, after 60 days no levels above CCa level were found. In one animal, the levels never reached CCa level. We conclude that veterinary treatment of cows with isoxsuprine may temporarily lead to low levels of isoxsuprine in the hair <b>of</b> their <b>newborn</b> <b>calves</b> which can be measured for a maximum of 60 days after birth...|$|R
