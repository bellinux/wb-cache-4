5|$|Some {{surviving}} stories regarding Iðunn {{focus on}} her youth-maintaining apples. English scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> buckets of apples {{were found in the}} 9th-century Oseberg ship burial site in Norway and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe which may have had a symbolic meaning and also that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in Southwest England.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn is {{portrayed in the}} Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as {{providing}} apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E
5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
50|$|In an old interview, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{has split}} {{broadcast}} personalities - TobeDaDiva and Tobe Nneji, the ‘’serious-minded one who casts {{the news and}} handles current affairs and politics”.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so? Well, she did not, neither did I. Indeed, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{this was her}} trouble. Among the great of the earth she knew no such man, and, if she sought lower, then would come jealousies and war." ...|$|R
50|$|In a 2008 article, dog {{advocate}} Loretta Baughan {{claimed that}} underpopulation was the reality rather than overpopulation. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{the great majority}} of pet owners have spayed or neutered their pets, and some shelters were importing large numbers of dogs from other jurisdictions.|$|R
25|$|Charlie's {{attitude}} angers Nancy. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> life is short. She {{threatens to}} have adventures on her own. Charlie's attitude changes after Nancy's outburst, and she retreats from her plan a bit. She {{is content to}} enjoy the moment.|$|E
25|$|The actions moves {{ahead to}} 1989, where Selena y Los Dinos {{are playing a}} concert at a fair. Abraham is shocked when Selena peels off her jacket and {{performs}} in a beaded bra. He confronts Selena on the band's bus, but <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> her mother helped her make it, and that other fashionable female musicians such as Madonna and Janet Jackson are wearing bustiers too. Abraham relents, and Selena begins to design {{more and more of}} her band's attire.|$|E
25|$|Another anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes, has criticised both {{of these}} theories. On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that {{the quickest way to}} get more male warriors would have been to have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.|$|E
50|$|Kinan's lawyer {{argued that}} the defendants' actions {{violated}} the 1949 UN protocol on trafficking, which Argentina has signed. (See Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others.) <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> under the protocol, a victim's consent is immaterial.|$|R
50|$|Rosario Lopez, {{president}} of the Association of Housewives Committees regretted aloud that the Assembly members approved the article without including the some exceptions to protect women and doctors. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the article had been adopted without giving Dominicans time to consider the opinion {{of a team of}} professionals on the subject.|$|R
5000|$|Maguire {{declared}} in a December 2011 interview that [...] "Hamas is an elected party {{and should be}} recognized as such by all. It has the democratic vote and should be recognized." [...] <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> on her 2008 Gaza trip she {{had been invited to}} speak [...] "to the Hamas parliament." ...|$|R
500|$|Ideas {{of racism}} and {{segregation}} also permeate the episode. Sara Gwenllian-Jones in her book Cult Television argues that, throughout the entry, [...] "the blacks are equated with aliens," [...] turning them into {{a certain type of}} [...] "other" [...] that is [...] "never allowed to fit in or feel safe". Gwenllian-Jones highlights the scene in which Dales, late one night on the team bus, wakes to see Exley's sleeping body being reflected as an alien in a window {{as an example of the}} racial comparison. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that,</b> despite coming to Earth, Exley has moved from one segregated society—that of the aliens—into another. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Exley, after revealing his true form to Dales, says that [...] "my people guard their privacy zealously. They don't want our people to intermingle with your people". This quote expresses a similar sentiment to the segregated mentality of the 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Ondaatje {{writes in}} The Independent that the {{existence}} of a Hemingway industry tends to overshadow his posthumous work. He considers Hemingway's African stories to be among his best although the posthumous work about Africa has been disregarded or overlooked. In her piece for Nation, [...] Brenda Wineapple describes the book as [...] "poignant but not particularly good". However, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it [...] "reminds us of Hemingway's writing at its most touching, acute and beautiful best". The review in Publishers Weekly is much the same saying the [...] "old Hemingway magic flashes sporadically, like lightning, but not often enough".|$|E
500|$|Lu Caixia, a {{researcher}} at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, states in the newsletter of the International Institute for Asian Studies, Leiden, Netherlands, that “the excavation of the Belitung has been acknowledged as an admirable example of what can be achieved under difficult conditions in Southeast Asia.” <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> unlike some other commercial operators, Walterfang’s company ensured that “the ship structure itself was properly recorded, the cargo was kept together rather than dispersed, and the finds were well conserved, studied, catalogued, and published." [...] Lu ends by highlighting the efficacy of the public-private arrangement: “It is difficult to imagine how this particular project could have been financed or organized without commercial involvement.” ...|$|E
50|$|Jean McGuire {{struggled}} {{during the}} '60s with the education system. She fought for more well-trained and, preferably, black teachers {{for the black}} community. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the State College at Boston had a very low number of black students, {{despite the fact that}} it is located in Roxbury and had very reasonable tuition.|$|R
50|$|Fetterley helped {{formulate}} {{the concept}} of resistant reading in her 1978 book, The Resisting Reader: A Feminist Approach to American Fiction. In addition, she led a reappraisal of women's literature of the 19th century and the American canon. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> American literature had been defined as about men and by men, thus excluding half of the world: women's experience and perspective.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Nau Nihal's widow, Sahib Kaur, was {{pregnant}} and might {{give birth to a}} rightful successor. The arrival in Lahore of two powerful opponents of Sher Singh, Sardar Atar Singh Sandhanvalia and Sardar Ajit Singh Sandhanvalia, settled the matter. On 2 December 1840 Chand Kaur was proclaimed Maharani of the Punjab, with the title Malika Muqaddasa, Empress Immaculate.|$|R
500|$|Mercury informs Thespis {{that the}} {{substitute}} gods have received many complaints from mortals because {{some are not}} performing their functions, and others' ill-judged experiments have wreaked havoc in the world below. [...] For instance, Timidon, the replacement for Mars, is a pacifist and a coward; the substitute for Hymen refuses to marry anyone; and the ersatz Pluto is too tenderhearted to let anyone die. [...] Daphne, who plays the muse Calliope, comes to Thespis and claims, based on a bowdlerised edition of the Greek myths, that Calliope was married to Apollo. [...] <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Apollo, played by Sparkeion, is the brother of Diana (played by Sparkeion's wife, Nicemis). [...] Thespis decides that Sparkeion is married to Daphne while they are gods, but his marriage to Nicemis will resume when they are mortals once again.|$|E
500|$|Folklorist Maria Tatar sees “Thumbelina” as {{a runaway}} bride story and notes {{that it has}} been viewed as an allegory about {{arranged}} marriages, and a fable about being true to one’s heart that upholds the traditional notion that the love of a prince is to be valued above all else. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> in Hindu belief, a thumb-sized being known as the innermost self or soul dwells in the heart of all beings, human or animal, and that the concept may have migrated to European folklore and taken form as Tom Thumb and Thumbelina, both of whom seek transfiguration and redemption. She detects parallels between Andersen’s tale and the Greek myth of Demeter and her daughter, Persephone, and, notwithstanding the pagan associations and allusions in the tale, notes that [...] "Thumbelina" [...] repeatedly refers to Christ‘s suffering and resurrection, and the Christian concept of salvation.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{has been}} called anti-Semitic, most notably because of the {{characterization}} of Robert Cohn in the book. The other characters often refer to Cohn as a Jew, and once as a 'kike'. Shunned by {{the other members of}} the group, Cohn is characterized as [...] "different," [...] unable or unwilling to understand and participate in the fiesta. Cohn is never really part of the group—separated by his difference or his Jewish faith. Critic Susan Beegel goes so far as to claim, [...] "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew." [...] Hemingway critic Josephine Knopf speculates that Hemingway might have wanted to depict Cohn as a [...] "shlemiel" [...] (or fool), but <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Cohn lacks the characteristics of a traditional shlemiel.|$|E
50|$|She was {{co-founder of}} the Hidden Child Foundation as well. Kestenberg’s work led to greater {{recognition}} of child survivor syndromes and posttraumatic stress disorder. Kestenberg also became involved in working with the children of survivors, investigating the after effects of violent experiences on following generations. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> this phenomenon also occurs in the situation of children of the perpetrators.|$|R
60|$|But Nora {{was in the}} sneering {{mood that}} night, and pursued her sarcasms; <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Captain Quin was already known as a valiant soldier, famous {{as a man of}} fashion in London, and that it was mighty well of Redmond to talk and boast of beating ushers and farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman was a very {{different}} matter.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Dove, however, {{who that}} night was strangely {{depressed}} and uneasy, thought far otherwise. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> they were playing with vast and cruel forces, and that whatever these people exactly believed about Rachel, it was a dreadful thing for a girl {{to be put in}} a position in which the lives of hundreds might hang upon her nod.|$|R
500|$|Talking {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with Joel Little, Lorde said that Little's refining of her [...] "raw potential {{to end up}} with [...] " [...] {{was one of the best}} aspects of him. She also views Little as [...] "the only one who was working with electronic music in the way [...] was interested in at the time". Lorde details that her songs are shaped by her lyrics, which she felt as a [...] "more cohesive way of working." [...] She said, [...] "I tend to start with lyrics– sometimes the seed of a song will just be a word that I thought was rad, one that summed up a particular idea I'd been trying to pin down." [...] Nonetheless, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the songwriting process of [...] "Tennis Court" [...] was different to how she normally writes a song: the lyrics are built on the instant music and beat.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth David asks why [...] "this {{peerless}} writer" [...] was {{eclipsed by}} [...] "imitators so limited in experience, and in capacity of expression so inferior?" [...] She answers her own question {{with the suggestion}} that Acton, born in 1799, was [...] "in taste and in spirit, {{a child of the}} eighteenth century." [...] David notes that the year after Modern Cookery was first published, Bird's Custard Powder was launched: [...] "What we know as modern cookery, and it {{had little to do with}} Eliza Acton's version, was on its way." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> manuals like Mrs Beeton's, which in later editions were edited and re-written by other hands, existed to allow cooks to look up recipes, rather than to read cookery books. She concludes that [...] "A book such as Miss Acton's, written as a coherent whole, is essentially one to be read, as it is written, with intelligence and understanding and application." ...|$|E
500|$|Songbirds {{and their}} {{associated}} symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their family name Finch is also Lee's mother's maiden name. The titular mockingbird {{is a key}} motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack {{to teach them to}} shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can [...] "shoot all the bluejays they want", they must remember that [...] "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird". Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, [...] "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us." [...] Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, [...] "'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson." [...] Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.|$|E
25|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{polygamy}} {{was illegal}} in Malaysia for non-Muslims {{but not for}} Muslims, and that child custody arrangements for Muslims were biased towards fathers {{as opposed to the}} shared-custody arrangements of non-Muslim parents. Women's groups in Malaysia began campaigning in the 1990s to have female sharia judges appointed to the sharia legal system in the country, and in 2010 two female judges were appointed.|$|R
50|$|The Chair of the House Elections Committee, Representative Diane Rosenbaum, {{dismissed}} such concerns. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> is not {{the intention}} of Measure 54, {{and that there are}} no plans to restrict school bond elections to taxpayers. The measure went on to be passed by voters with an overwhelming 72.59% of the vote, the second largest margin of victory in the November 2008 general election ballot.|$|R

500|$|Mark Taylor (Robert Bathurst) is a {{television}} sitcom writer. Other than episode one, {{where he is}} shown working on a script and references to a show of his that had aired during a dinner with Robert and Tracy the night before, his work is hardly mentioned. Mark is quick-witted, and the stand-up sequences indicate that he thinks in one-liners. However, this proves to be the downfall of his marriage with Becky, who says that she didn't sign on to become his [...] "lawfully wedded straight man". In one episode, Mark jokes about worrying if his virginity will heal back; Becky articulates her frustration by responding [...] "What page is that on?" [...] Identifying his insecurities, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "thing about someone who uses humour as a weapon, is not the sense of humour, {{but the fact that}} they need a weapon". In interviews, Bathurst has compared Steven Moffat to his character: Mark is [...] "a man whose wife leaves him because he talks in one-liners. And Steven Moffat's wife had just left him, because he talks in one-liners." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. Critics and historians do not agree on the exact point that grunge ended. Catherine Strong states that [...] "...at the end of 1993...grunge had become unstable, and was {{entering}} the first stages of being killed off"; <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "...scene had become so successful" [...] and widely known that [...] "imitators had begun to enter the field". Paste magazine states by 1994, grunge [...] "...was fading fast", with [...] "...Pearl Jam retreating from the spotlight {{as fast as they}} could; Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots and hordes of others were battling horrid drug addictions and struggling for survival." [...] In Grunge: Seattle, Justin Henderson states that the [...] "downward spiral" [...] began in mid-1994, as the influx of major label money into the scene changed the culture and it had [...] "nowhere to go but down"; he states the death of Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff on June 16, 1994, from a heroin overdose, was [...] "another nail in grunge's coffin." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{features}} a family observing Shabbat. Spielberg said that [...] "to start the film with the candles being lit... {{would be a}} rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins." [...] When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to {{a world in which}} smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent [...] "just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope." [...] Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at York University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the crematoria. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to Aryan men, especially Göth and Schindler.|$|E
5000|$|Caroline Preece of Den of Geek gave a good {{review to}} the episode even though <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> after last week's high, it was {{probably}} inevitable that the latest episode {{would be a little}} bit of a disappointment. [...] "...the real talking point is Elijah's surprise return. He couldn't be more welcome, and his presence should make for a cracking episode when it returns." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s Presser {{studied the}} {{challenges}} of child care, its affordability and availability. In particular, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> as women entered the labor force at higher rates, child care posed problems both for families and for {{the organization of the}} workplace. This was the subject of her presidential address to the Population Association of America, [...] "Can We Make Time for Children?" ...|$|R
5000|$|South Asia {{director}} of Human Rights Watch, Meenakshi Ganguly, said that stone-pelting {{does not give}} the police a [...] "free pass" [...] to use force. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the main grievance of the protestors is exactly {{the failure of the}} authorities to ensure human rights. Writer Arundhati Roy asked for an honest conversation about what kind of azadi (freedom) the Kashmiris are demanding.|$|R
