40|$|Engineering topological quantum {{order has}} become a major field of physics. Many {{advances}} have been made by synthesizing gauge fields in cold atomic systems. Here we carry over these developments to other platforms which are extremely well suited for quantum engineering, namely, trapped ions and nano-trapped atoms. Since these systems are typically one-dimensional, the action of artificial magnetic fields has so far received little attention. However, exploiting the long-range nature of interactions, loops with nonvanishing magnetic fluxes become possible even in one-dimensional settings. This gives rise to intriguing phenomena, such as fractal energy spectra, flat bands with localized edge states, and topological many-body states. We elaborate on a simple scheme for generating the required artificial fluxes by periodically driving an XY <b>spin</b> chain. <b>Concrete</b> estimates demonstrating the experimental feasibility for trapped ions and atoms in wave guides are given.

The 2 m span cylindrical beams studied are models for lighting poles produced for the last 10 years and sold on the European market. Five thin-walled pole specimens were investigated (diameter: 100 mm; wall-thickness: 25 – 27 mm). All specimens were produced in a pretensioning and spinning technique and were prestressed by pultruded CFRP tendons. Initially, two reference pole specimens were tested in quasi-static four-point bending to determine the short-term failure moment and to model the short-term flexural behavior. Then, three pole specimens were loaded to different bending creep moments: while the lowest loaded specimen was initially uncracked, the second specimen was loaded with 50 % of the short-term bending failure moment and exhibited cracking immediately after load introduction. The highest loaded pole specimen sustained a bending moment of 72 % of the short-term bending failure moment for 16. 5 years before failing in July 2013, due to the bond failure of the tendons, which led to local crushing of the high-performance <b>spun</b> <b>concrete</b> (HPSC). Besides this, long-term monitoring of the creep tests has shown a limited time- and temperature-dependent increase of the deflections over the years, mainly due to the creep of the concrete. A concrete creep-based model allowed for the calculation of the long-term bending curvatures with reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, the pole specimens showed crack patterns that were stable over time and minimal slippage of the tendons with respect to the pole’s end-faces for the two lower load levels. The latter proves the successful and durable anchorage of these novel CFRP prestressing tendons in thin-walled, precast concrete members under realistic long-term service loads...|$|E

Thus, guidance is provided about how thin the concrete walls can be made without risking failure – which also means how low the weight of such a pole can be. The failure most likely to occur is a compressive failure in the concrete with a ductile behavior. The result shows that a geometry change, which implies a thinner concrete wall, is possible.
