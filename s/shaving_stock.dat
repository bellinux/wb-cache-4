In this study, the effects of water temperature, salinity and feeding frequency on A. fallax larval growth and mortality were eval-uated. For a period of ten days after the onset of exogenous feeding, A. fallax larvae exhibited higher survival rates when subjected to salini-ties of 2. 5 g·L− 1 and 5 g·L− 1, from trials conducted at 0 g·L− 1, 2. 5 g·L− 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In 2007 a LIFE+ project {{aiming at}} the {{reintroduction}} of the allis shad to the Rhine system started by Rheinische Fischereiverband 1880 e. V. and partners. Between 2008 and 2012 about eight million shad larvae were produced and transported to Germany {{where they have}} been released in the Hessian and North Rhine-Westphalian parts of the Rhine basin. In 2014, the first year after a 4 to 5 years period in the sea, hundreds of Allis Shad have been recorded returning to the Rhine system for spawning. In order to form the basis for a future allis <b>shad</b> <b>stock</b> in the Rhine, and to develop a natural stock in the long term, monitoring will be continued until at least 2015. After 2015 it seems that stocking is also needed to maintain a self-sustaining population. The presentation will focus on what methods were used, e. g. for the purpose of sustaining the wild stocks, breeding stocks have been established in which the conditions of successfully keeping shads in captivity are studied in order to enable the fish to reach maturity in captivity. Such ex situ stocks are to breed offspring for stocking purposes and to successively reduce the impact on the wild stocks. Discussion: -What lessons can we learn from this success story, e. g comparing the Allis Shad project with the Smolts project. -How many more years of stocking and monitoring will be needed? -How can WFD norms for migratory fish stocks (mainly high flow river upstream, R 1) be attained in the Rhine Delta (low-flow rivers downstream? What is realistically attainable...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{the current state of}} commercial catches of big-eyed <b>shad</b> <b>stocks</b> in the Caspian Sea, which is the backup target species, is carried out. The reasons for the variations in catch and biological parameters in long-term perspective are analyzed. The reduction of catches of herring in the Terek-Caspian region is conditioned by a complex of climatic phenomena (fluctuation of the Caspian Sea level), human factors and organizational and technical reasons. There is a clear downward trend in the rate of linear-weight growth in the same age groups. One of the factors that influences the growth rate and <b>stocks</b> of big-eye <b>shad</b> is its nutrition supply. After the disappearance of shellfish from the adult herring nutrition, the basis of food in the current conditions is fish forage (sardines, silversides, gobies). Almost year-round spawning of anchovy sprat provided with fodder juvenile and adult herring in the South Caspian. After the death of the two types of sprat the forage shortage has caused a gradual decline in the rate of linear-weight growth of herring, including big-eyed shad. By comparison of the previous data obtained during the rise of the sea level 1980 – 1995, with new materials in recent years, the negative trends occurring in the big-eyed shad population have been revealed, such as increase of the rate of natural mortality. The specifics of breeding and fish-growing period of big-eyed shad in the North Caspian for 5 months allowed gathering reliable data to estimate the number of both new generations and the total stock. The complete calculation of abundance, biomass and size of the fishing stock of 13 generations of big-eyed shad (from 2000 to 2012) is proposed. It is shown that <b>stocks</b> of big-eyed <b>shad</b> in the recent period are at a high level and in a stable condition, but since 2009 there has been a tendency to reduce them. The unusual situation of the recent years is that the decline in stock biomass occurred at high abundance of herring. The reason for such an inadequate reduction of biomass is a significant reduction in individual fish weight...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Food webs in {{northern}} temperate lakes frequently exhibit tightly linked interactions between adjacent trophic levels {{that lead to}} top-down effects from piscivores to phytoplankton. To determine if these interactions occur in reservoirs dominated by an omnivorous planktivore, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, we experimentally quantified crustacean zooplankton and phytoplankton responses to age- 0 gizzard shad (23 - 90 mm total length) at four gizzard shad densities across three reservoirs, each with a different level of crustacean zooplankton productivity. Age- 0 gizzard shad exerted strong top-down effects on crustacean zooplankton, eliminating it from most enclosures within 2 weeks. This decline in crustacean zooplankton {{did not lead to}} increases in phytoplankton unless Daphnia spp. were initially abundant. As detritivores, gizzard shad can remain abundant when planktonic food resources are depleted. This trophic decoupling probably allows gizzard shad to structure reservoir food webs by overconsumption of crustacean zooplank-ton, which in turn may compromise recruitment of sport fishes with zooplanktivorous larvae. In our view, the potential for increasing crustacean zooplankton density by controlling gizzard <b>shad</b> with <b>stocked</b> predators will be limited to reservoirs where age- 0 gizzard shad density can be reduced below 10 fish/m 3 and where daily zooplankton productivity exceeds 220 mg/nv...|$|R

40|$|Interactions between young American shad (Alosa sapidissima) {{and their}} food (crustacean {{zooplankton}} and aquatic insect drift), and seasonal cycles {{and distribution of}} crustacean zooplankton were studied in the Holyoke Pool of the Connecticut River, Massachusetts from June 1977 through 1979. ^ Aquatic insect drift was highest during darkness and in the mid-channel where flow was greatest. Erratic flow can increase drifting of some benthic invertebrates and enhance potential food available to fish. ^ Automatic zooplankton samplers sampled four times each day throughout the study and were effective in capturing most species and size classes of crustacean zooplankton equally {{as well as a}} commonly used towed-net plankton sampler. Thirty-six species of Cladocera and 20 species of Copepoda were encountered; Bosmina longirostris and Chydorus sphaericus were the most abundant zooplankton. Total density and size and species composition of zooplankton entering the Holypoke Pool were similar to that which was discharged from the Pool, except during early July through September when losses of up to 1, 000 kg dry weight of zooplankton occurred within the Pool. During summer, zooplankton was most abundant in the mid-channel where flow was greatest, and density decreased rapidly as zooplankton flowed downstream. The size distribution of zooplankton in {{the upper end of the}} Pool was similar in the near-shore and mid-channel, except during mid-July through September when the mid-channel contained higher frequencies of large organisms. The size distribution shifted toward the smallest size classes in a downstream manner during summer. The species and size composition of the zooplankton assemblage which entered the Holyoke Pool was typical of communities subjected to low levels of vertebrate predation, while that which was discharged from the Pool was typical of zooplankton communities subjected to intense predation by fish. Intrinsic factors of mortality, turbulence, sedimentation, filtration through vegetation, and predation by invertebrates and resident vertebrates seemed not to affect zooplankton abundance as strongly as predation by juvenile Alosa spp. ^ Shad in the Holyoke Pool were progressively smaller downstream, except during the larval period. Mean lengths of shad at emigration were the smallest ever reported for the Pool and among the smallest reported elsewhere. ^ Shad occasionally fed throughout the 24 -hour period, although peak feeding generally occurred at dusk. Stomachs emptied within 8 to 10 hours. Shad selected an optimal diet based on food items available in the water column. Fish in upstream areas were able to feed in a more energetically profitable manner than those downstream. The abundance, size distribution, and spatial distribution of zooplankton was rapidly altered by feeding shad. Fish in upstream areas fed heavily on zooplankton of all sizes, but generally selected larger individuals; insects were also eaten. In the middle of the Pool, fish ate primarily insects but also utilized rare large zooplankton and the more abundant small zooplankton. Fish in the lower section of the Holyoke Pool utilized the remaining small zooplankton and some insects. The number of food items in stomachs progressively decreased downstream. ^ Differential growth of shad within the Holyoke Pool was food based. The mean length of juveniles at emigration was inversely related to the number of adult shad lifted into the Pool. American shad may over-exploit their rearing grounds. It appears reproductively advantageous for Connecticut River shad to spawn as far upstream as possible. Wide variations in the size of American <b>shad</b> <b>stocks</b> may result partially from the relation between juvenile density and foods available in the nursery areas. ...|$|R
