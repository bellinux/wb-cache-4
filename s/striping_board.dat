5000|$|Generally, a {{passenger}} {{with an electronic}} ticket will only need a boarding pass. If {{a passenger}} has a paper airline ticket, that ticket (or flight coupon) {{may be required to}} be attached to the boarding pass for him or her to board the aircraft. The paper boarding pass (and ticket, if any), or portions, are sometimes collected and counted for cross-check of passenger counts by gate agents, but more frequently are scanned (via barcode or magnetic strip). The standards for bar codes and magnetic <b>stripes</b> on <b>boarding</b> passes are published by IATA. The bar code standard (BCBP) defines the 2D bar code printed on paper boarding passes or sent to mobile phones for electronic boarding passes. The magnetic stripe standard (ATB2) expired in 2010. For [...] "connecting flights" [...] there will be a boarding pass needed for each new flight (distinguished by a different flight number) regardless of whether a different aircraft is boarded.|$|R
5000|$|The academy offers {{six years}} (if you get relegated) of cadetship after which cadets are {{commissioned}} as Pilot Officers in the PAF. Each course has a six-month semester after which {{a new course}} enters the academy. Thus there are four courses in the academy at a time. The courses are termed as per the academy tradition: one tape (junior most), two tape, third term, and final term (senior most). A cadet's term can be identified by his shoulder <b>board</b> <b>stripes</b> (one stripe, two stripes, two and half stripes, three stripes, four stripes and a broad stripe for the final term cadets.) ...|$|R
40|$|Striping is a print defect that {{is common}} in flexo post-printing on {{corrugated}} <b>board.</b> <b>Striping</b> is print density and/or print gloss variations that appears as stripes on the printed liner parallel to the flutes of the corrugated medium. The periodic print variations are often thought to originate from a non-uniform printing pressure caused by the corrugated board structure. Experiments and numerical simulations have been performed to study how print density and print gloss variations {{can be related to}} local contact pressure during flexo post-printing on corrugated board. Print gloss and print density have been measured for prints with known printing pressure. The local printing pressure in an industrial flexo post-printing press has been simulated with a finite element model. The results showed that the print density variations are caused by the printing pressure variations, depending on the ink transfer characteristics of the liner board, while the print gloss variations are caused by surface distortion of the corrugated board, such as “washboarding”...|$|R
5000|$|Air Force uniforms {{authorized}} {{for wear}} by Civil Air Patrol members include Service Dress, Mess Dress (for Senior Members only), the woodland camouflage Battle Dress Uniform (BDU), the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU), the green Nomex flight suit, and the CWU-45P green Nomex flight jacket, {{the latter two}} items being restricted to aircrew only. CAP distinctive markings include gray [...] "soft rank" [...] shoulder loop insignia for CAP officers for use with the duty uniform, {{as opposed to the}} similar dark blue [...] "soft rank" [...] shoulder loops of Air Force officers. This insignia is also worn by CAP officers on the Service Dress coat, whereas Air Force officers wear pin-on metal rank insignia. The CAP Mess Dress uniform is also distinctive in that the parallel braid <b>stripes</b> on shoulder <b>boards</b> for CAP Senior Member officers in the ranks of major general and below worn on Mess Dress uniforms, and the sleeve braid for all CAP Senior Member officer ranks, are dark blue cloth versus the silver metallic cloth worn on Mess Dress uniforms by Air Force officers.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States Navy (and USN Reserve), line {{officers}} {{are divided into}} unrestricted line officers and restricted line officers. Unrestricted Line (URL) officers hold combat warfare specialties as Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers, Surface Warfare Officers, Submarine Warfare Officers, and Naval Special Warfare/Naval Special Operations (NSW/NSO) officers (consisting of SEALs, Special Warfare Combatant-Craft (SWCC) Warrant Officers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officers, and Navy diving officers), and are eligible for operational combatant command at sea, as well as command of major installations and commands ashore. Restricted Line officers command only within their particular specialty, and are normally in fields such as intelligence, cryptology, oceanography/meteorology, engineering duty, aeronautical engineering duty, aircraft maintenance, public affairs, etc. Navy Limited Duty Officers and Warrant Officers whose technical specialties fall within a staff corps are considered staff corps officers, while all others are classed of the Line. Line officers wear an inverted gold star above their rank stripes on their dress blue uniforms and, {{in the case of}} Captains (US pay grade O-6/NATO OF-5) and below, on their shoulder boards in whites. Line officer flag officers (admirals O-7 to O-10/NATO OF-6 to OF-9) will wear solid gold shoulder boards with a silver metallic thread anchor and one, two, three, or four silver metallic thread stars below the anchor. When wearing khakis or utility/working uniforms, they wear their rank insignia on both collar points. The Navy refers to non-line officers as Staff Corps officers. (Both line and staff corps officers may be assigned as [...] "staff officers" [...] serving on the command staff of a senior officer.) Staff corps officers wear their corps insignia, rather than the line officer star, placed over their sleeve/shoulder <b>board</b> <b>stripes</b> on their dress blue and dress white uniforms, and on their left collar point on khakis and utility/working uniforms in lieu of matching pin-on rank insignia on the right collar point.|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} striped bass, Morone saxatilis {{population in}} North Carolina, the Albemarle/Roanoke (A/R) stock has grown tremendously {{in size and}} age structure over {{the last twenty years}} necessitating an up-to-date maturity and fecundity schedule. The last study was conducted for the Albemarle <b>Striped</b> Bass Management <b>Board</b> in 1989 - 1990 by Olsen and Rulifson (1992) after the stock had crashed, and just before stock rebuilding took place. There have been many advances in the understanding of teleost reproduction since their study and in recent years, otolith microchemistry with concentrations of elements such as strontium (⁸⁸Sr) has been used to determine movement and migration of different species to delineate movement from freshwater to more saline environments. The objectives of this study were to complete a maturation and fecundity schedule, compare results to Olsen and Rulifson (1992), and test the use of ⁸⁸Sr to elucidate migration patterns. Samples were collected (n= 453) in 2009 and 2010 on the Roanoke River near the spawning grounds and in Albemarle Sound during the pre-spawn, spawning, and post-spawn periods (March through May) with total lengths (TL) ranging from 300 to 1, 080 mm corresponding to age- 3 to age- 16. Striped bass are total spawners with determinate fecundity maturing one clutch or group of oocytes each year and having primary growth oocytes (PG) at each stage of development. Female striped bass were 96. 8 % mature by age- 4 with fecundity ranging from 176, 873 eggs (age- 3) to 3, 163, 130 eggs (age- 16). These findings are different from Olsen and Rulifson (1992) who reported 92. 9 % mature by age- 4 with 43. 8 % overall greater fecundity estimates attributed to the sample size and methodologies. Otoliths were examined using Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to determine changes in concentrations of the element ⁸⁸Sr {{over the life of the}} fish that reflect high salinity or freshwater environments and fish were assigned residency (77. 4 %) or anadromy (22. 6 %). It is recommended that management agencies continue to consider age- 4 female striped bass the first year class to contribute to the spawning population in the A/R stock and to keep the minimum size limit of 18 in in place; however, adjusting the slot limit of 22 - 27 in would be beneficial to fishermen without decreasing the spawning stock. It is recommended to continually monitor the reproductive rates of the population to ensure the health of the stock.  M. S...|$|R
5000|$|The United States Maritime Service wore uniforms {{that resembled}} the uniforms of {{officers}} in the United States Navy. One of the differences is visible on the shoulder boards and the dress uniforms worn by the officers. Above the stripes of these shoulder boards lies a gold anchor and wreath instead of the gold star shown the shoulder boards of Naval officers. The symbol of the gold anchor and the wreath {{is not the same}} for all United States Maritime Service officers. Like the United States Armed Forces, there are different jobs that need to be done aboard ships. For the sake of identification, the wreath symbol that rests above the shoulder <b>board</b> <b>striping</b> indicates the occupation of the officer. The anchor within the wreath indicates a line officer in the service. Other symbols that can be put within the wreath include a caduceus, a three-pointed propeller, a single leaf, four lightning bolts, a cross, two slabs with the Star of David overhead and a crescent moon. Anyone with a caduceus in the wreath works in the medical field. Someone who has a three-pointed propeller works in the engineering department. Anyone with a single leaf within the wreath works in a ship’s supply department. Someone with the four lightning bolts in the wreath is designated to radio operations. Anyone with the crescent moon within the wreath works for the steward department and deals with cooking and cleaning in galley. The last two symbols are associated with chaplains which are people who act as religious ministers aboard ships. Anyone with the cross within the wreath is designated as a Christian chaplain. Someone who has a symbol of two slabs with the Star of David floating over it is designated as a Jewish chaplain. There is a similar difference with the striping of the sleeves for the dress uniform. Another difference is seen in the cap devices worn on the combination cover. For the Navy, the device depicts an eagle perched on top of a shield of stars and stripes with two crossed anchors behind it. For the Maritime Service, the device shows an eagle perched on a shield covered by a gold anchor. The shield is also circled by a wreath of gold leaves. The collar devices which denote rank are almost identical to the U.S. Navy ranks. The exception comes from the rank denoted by a silver star. In the Navy, a single silver star represents the rank of Rear Admiral (Lower Half), and progressive numbers of stars represent other admiral or [...] "flag" [...] ranks up to Fleet Admiral which contains five stars. In the U.S Maritime Service, one silver star denotes the rank of Commodore.|$|R
