40|$|UK doctors-in-training undergo {{assessments}} {{of their professional}} behaviours. From an analysis of multi-source feedback (MSF) data, we report how ratings of junior doctors (Foundation Programme [FP] doctors and senior house officers [SHOs]) differed by staff group. The MSF data were collected in 2003 and 2005 in hospitals in the West Midlands. Using a single-sided Team Assessment of Behaviour form, 1928 assessors evaluated 226 FP doctors and SHOs in four domains: professional relationship with patients; communication; team-working, and accessibility. The distribution of 'concerns' across the professional groups was explored using a random effects logistic regression model. On average, each trainee received nine assessment forms {{from a range of}} staff, most commonly nurses. Although concerns were identified for the minority, ratings varied by staff group. Peers (other FP doctors or SHOs) and administrators or managers were four and three times, respectively, less likely to indicate concern. By contrast, consultants and sisters (senior nurses) were more likely to give concern ratings. Guidance on the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> in any MSF process should take into account findings that rating behaviour varies by staff group...|$|E

In this paper, the principles of sensory analysis are used to define the protocol of new method for the evaluation of thermophysiological comfort wearing different garments. Sensory analysis was chosen because as a scientific discipline that applies experiment principles using human senses is used for the evaluation of consumer goods. Test protocol using assessors described in this paper consists of the following steps: defining the interview content, finding potential assessors and making an interview, creating a survey, conducting a survey, group discussion, test and group discussion scoring, <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors,</b> assessment preparation and subjective assessment. On average the most distinctive increase in the sensation of warmth was recorded for the polyester clothing ensemble, and the lowest one for the cotton clothing ensemble. Concerning the average grades of comfort given by assesors, the most comfortable clothing ensemble is the one made of viscose. It was also found out that the method is especially suitable if a representative group of assessors is formed...|$|E

40|$|This paper, {{the fourth}} and final in a series on the {{management}} of expert evidence during the Kilmore East bushfire proceeding, considers the use <b>of</b> <b>assessors.</b> During the proceeding, Justice J. Forrest appointed assessors to assist him {{with some of the}} most complex aspects of the expert evidence. The assessors played a significant role in the proceeding, helping to guide the expert conferences, sitting with Justice J. Forrest during the largest concurrent evidence session and participating in the examination of the experts. This paper is based on interviews conducted with some of the judges, barristers, solicitors and experts involved in the proceeding, and it records their reflections on whether the use <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> was valuable. It appears that the use <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> was a success, and all the participants interviewed regarded them as being beneficial to the trial. They were satisfied that the method <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> adopted by the Court was appropriate. The assistance the assessors provided Justice J. Forrest with understanding the expert evidence was essential, and having people capable of engaging in technical dialogue with the experts while they were giving evidence was useful. This paper suggests that the appointment assessors should be considered in future cases of similar complexity to help the trial judge deal with very difficult expert evidence...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Objective: Deformational plagiocephaly (includes plagiocephaly and brachycephaly) is {{a common}} {{pediatric}} condition. Infants who present with altered head shape often experience developmental delay. It is uncertain how common developmental delay is in infants with plagiocephaly and how sustained this is, when present. This review explores the association between plagiocephaly and developmental delay to guide clinical practice. Study Design: A systematic review was conducted. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro databases were searched. Data from relevant studies were extracted regarding study: sample, follow-up, design, and findings. Methodological quality of each study was rated using a critical appraisal tool. Results: The search recovered 1315 articles of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. In the included studies, the children's ages ranged from 3 months to 10 years. Study limitations included <b>selection</b> bias, nonblinding <b>of</b> <b>assessors,</b> and reuse <b>of</b> the same study population for multiple papers. Most papers (11 / 19) rated "moderate" on methodological quality. A positive association between plagiocephaly and developmental delay was reported in 13 of 19 studies, including 4 of 5 studies with "strong" methodological quality. Delay was more frequently in studies with children ≤ 24 months of age (9 / 12 studies) compared with > 24 months of age (3 / 7 studies). Motor delay was the most commonly affected domain reported in high-quality papers (5 / 5 studies). Conclusion: This review suggests plagiocephaly is a marker of elevated risk of developmental delays. Clinicians should closely monitor infants with plagiocephaly for this. Prompt referral to early intervention services such as physiotherapy may ameliorate motor delays and identify infants with longer term developmental needs...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} answer these questions, and to seek the perspectives <b>of</b> the <b>assessors</b> about the process. Academic staff of the Faculty of Health Sciences, staff members of the Discipline of Nursing and registered nurses working in affiliated hospitals nominated for roles as oral assessors. All assessors received training and no payment was made. Thirty-nine of 45 (86. 6 %) oral assessors completed questionnaires on their experiences <b>of</b> being an <b>assessor.</b> The majority <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> were female (69. 2 %) and from a clinical background (71. 8 % vs. 28. 2 % faculty-based). The most commonly cited motivations included a desire to contribute to the development of the nursing profession (94. 9 % of responding); because they knew what was involved in a nursing career (79. 5 %); wanting to influence who becomes a nurse (76. 9 %); and because they understood the qualities needed to be a registered nurse (76. 9 %). <b>Assessors</b> spoke highly <b>of</b> the experience and in general found it enjoyable.
