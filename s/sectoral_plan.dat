These units have obtained vegetable varieties and hybrids adapted to conditions in our country, which occupied the largest area planted in field research. Research units have obtained significant quantities of seeds with high biological and cultural value and realized production technologies, specifying aspects of soil management, plant protection, fertilization, mechanization and others. After 1990, reducing funds for {{research in}} vegetable led to the closing of three of the six research stations and the institute activity was significantly reduced. To increase the current level of production of vegetables in our country, top quality and competitive prices with those of vegetable farmers in developed countries, it requires higher levels of financing and reorganization of the research sector.

It compares the increase in budget allocations for key macroeconomic aggregates and <b>sectoral</b> <b>plan</b> outlays for the BJP and UPAII interim budget, and the change from the interim budget. Although overall tactics are aligned to the strategy articulated, the alignment is only marginal as yet, because the various strands are not well integrated to tell a coherent story of how they work together, and changes are not quantitatively significant. This is unfortunate because the macroeconomic changes are aimed at raising growth and jobs. There are also small beginnings in better systems, incentives, composition of public spending and public services. Apart from contributing to growth these help improve equality through capacity creation so the economy does not hit sectoral bottlenecks, as happened with the past excessive share of consumption-inducing government expenditures. A performance {{in relation to a}} promise based index ranking of post reform governments shows that although the UPAII was worst, the first congress government was the best, with the BJP led NDA coming in third. So the BJP has to do better this time if it wants to improve its ranking...|$|E
40|$|I am {{very pleased}} to publish this Outline <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Plan</b> in respect of the {{specific}} health and personal social services provided by the health services for people with disabilities. This is very much an interim Plan, primarily designed to encompass a programme of work {{which is to be}} undertaken over the next 12 to 18 months. The main aspects of this programme are related to the provisions contained in the Disability Bill 2004, together with a strategic review of the services as a whole. This review follows on a commitment given by the Government as part of "Sustaining Progress". It will examine the significant level of service provision which is already in place, focusing on specific issues which are of concern to people with disabilities and their families and will highlight both the strengths and weaknesses in the services. The review will provide people with disabilities and their carers, together with statutory and voluntary bodies in this area, with an opportunity to input into the planning and delivery of services over the coming years. While the Disability Bill 2004 has implications for the public service as a whole, it also has very particular implications for the health services. A key focus of this interim Plan is to undertake, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, the work necessary to assist me as Minister for Health and Children, and my Department in putting in place those regulations.

40|$|One of the {{instruments}} in strategic planning and management of protected areas (PAs) is zoning. Changes in protection regimes for PAs occurred in the legal grounds for nature conservation in Serbia during 2009 - 2015. As {{a result of these}} changes difficulties in overcoming the conflicting interests between protection and development of PAs in the process of strategic planning, namely spatial <b>planning</b> and <b>sectoral</b> <b>planning</b> for nature conservation, have occurred. This was especially evident in the preparation of spatial plans for special purpose areas in the case of PAs which are the primary tourism destinations. in this paper the brief overview of the changing role of zoning in strategic planning and management of PAs is presented. This is the starting point for the analysis of the zoning in legal grounds and strategic planning for PAs in Serbia. This analysis is conducted at the case of Sara National Park and primary tourism destination. Based on the results of this analysis, the recommendations for the review and improvement of legal grounds and strategic planning - spatial and <b>sectoral</b> <b>planning</b> for PAs in Serbia are given...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{hundred and}} fifty {{municipalities}} across five continents participated in the Urban Climate Change Governance Survey (UCGS). Conducted at MIT in partnership with ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the UCGS provides a {{first of its kind}} look at the governance networks that municipalities are creating to address climate change. Drawing from these results, this paper analyses the institutional governance structures that surround local government work on climate change adaptation. Results show an integration of adaptation and mitigation planning, and a mainstreaming of adaptation planning into other long-range and <b>sectoral</b> <b>plans.</b> Seventy-three percent of respondents stated that their local government’s are engaging with both adaptation and mitigation, and 75 % are integrating adaptation into long-range or <b>sectoral</b> <b>plans.</b> However, many critical municipal agencies – including those responsible for water, waste water, health, and building codes – remain on the margins of urban adaptation efforts. Internal institutional networks of governance are inextricably linked to efforts to address a problem like adaptation, which does not fit neatly into individual institutional silos. The results of the UCGS show where these networks have so far been made, how they have been created, and which local government actors have yet to be effectively engaged...|$|R

This paper introduces an analytical framework that focuses on the role of actors, innovative solutions and participatory planning tools in negotiating consent for the strategic choices in a delta plan and its implementation. Cases of Bangladesh, the Netherlands and Vietnam are discussed as a plausibility probe to explore the framework's potential. The probe reveals that the framework is promising to explain the process and outcomes of strategic delta planning in urbanizing deltas.
