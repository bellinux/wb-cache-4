Most methods developed for improving the back propagation algorithm of artificial neural networks are limited to small neural networks.

We demonstrate this technique by predicting <b>residue</b> <b>solvent</b> accessibility and real-value backbone torsion angles of proteins. In this application, the guiding factor is designed to satisfy the intuitive condition that for most residues, the contribution of a residue to the structural properties of another residue is smaller for greater separation in the protein-sequence distance between the two residues. We show that the guided-learning method makes a 2 - 4 % reduction in 10 -fold cross-validated mean absolute errors (MAE) for predicting <b>residue</b> <b>solvent</b> accessibility and backbone torsion angles, regardless of the size of database, the number of hidden layers and the size of input windows.
