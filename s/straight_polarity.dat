5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the research results on plasma-hardening of heat-resistant steel layers by plasma-welding deposition of congeneric materials under <b>straight</b> and reverse <b>polarity</b> current. The {{dependence of the}} deposited layer quality on the current polarity has been determined. A metallographic examination and measurement of micro-hardness of the deposited layer have been conducted. The dependence of the deposited layer characteristics on the welding parameters has been determined. The obtained results allow the use of plasma-welding deposition to obtain layers with the required strength characteristics using the material, congeneric to the parent material...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} {{reinforcement}} and penetration profile in high deposition welds produced by multiple-wire processes are presented. A practical approach for assessment of {{shape and size}} of weld bead is introduced wherein characteristic coefficients (αi) of parametric equations y = f(αi, x) are expressed as functions of process parameters such as welding current, speed, and voltage, and they are determined by calibration of model with experimental observations using a heuristic technique. The validity of new model is demonstrated through a case study presentation on twin-wire welding. Compared to a semi-elliptical reinforcement and a cosine/parabolic penetration profiles in single-wire welds, an elliptical segment and a composite trigonometric function, respectively, are found more appropriate to represent multiple-wire welds. The effects of process parameters on bead profile and weld bead dilution for <b>straight</b> and reverse <b>polarities</b> {{over a wide range}} of process parameters are evaluated. The developed models explain effect of welding parameters on weld bead shape and weld cooling time, thus, apt for determining dimensions of heat source in modeling of welding processes...|$|R
50|$|ANKA {{features}} a storage ring with a circumference of 110.4 m (120.7 yards) that stores electrons at {{the energy of}} 2.5 GeV. For this purpose, electrons (90 keV) are generated by a triode and preaccelerated to 500 MeV via a “Racetrack Microtron” (53 MeV) and a booster. The actual working energy is finally reached in the storage ring, where the electrons are now spinning at almost the speed of light. The storage ring contains an ultra-high vacuum of 10−9 mbar. The synchrotron light is thereby generated by the constant deflection of 16 magnets that keep the electrons focused {{in the center of}} the tube. In addition to that, wigglers and undulators - specialized magnet configurations with alternating <b>straight</b> and reverse <b>polarity</b> - are used to deflect the electrons into a sinus-curve-like course on which they emit synchrotron radiation. A special feature of the ANKA synchrotron configuration is the super conducting SCU15 undulator that was - as its predecessor SCU14 - co-developed at the ANKA facility. This new undulator does not only generate synchrotron light of enhanced brilliance, but also a much more variable spectrum of radiation easily adjustable to the respective research requirements.|$|R
40|$|This report {{described}} {{the characteristics of}} the cross electrode type plasma jet genrator, which has been consisted of the cross electrode to lay in the nozzle constrictor and of center electorode. Experiments were made at the arc current range from 20 to 60 A for <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> jet and 10 to 30 A for reverse polarity jet in Argon gas flow rate from 15 to 40 l/min. The results of this experimental investigation were as follws : The arc voltage versus arc current characteristics for <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> jet were drooping characteristics, untill the arc current was 40 A, but for over 40 A, it was positive characteristics. On the other hand, for reverse polarity jet, it was always drooping one. As the gas flow rate increased, the arc voltage of both jets was increased. The arc voltage of reverse polarity jet was higher than <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> jet. For <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> jet, the ratio of the sum of the cross electrode loss and the nozzle loss to the total loss was rang from 70 to 80 %, and the ratio of the cross electrode loss to the former was rang from 70 to 84 %. But for reverse polarity jet, the cross electrode loss was down fifth value of <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> jet. The thermal efficiency of this generator was rang from 65 to 85 % as the general plasma jet generator, and increasing the gas flow rate, it was increase. The mean temperature was below 3015 °K. The arc mode of <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> jet was indicated the quasisteady mode or steady mode, but for reverse polarity jet, it was always indicated the oscillation mode. At the same power input, the plasme flame length of reverse polarity jet was longer than that of <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> jet and so the form of reverse polarity jet was more sharp. Increasing the arc current and the gas flow rate, the core section and the outer flame of <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> jet was expanded, but the reverse polarity jet, the core section was only expanded...|$|E

40|$|A stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) investigation was conducted on HP 9 Ni- 4 Co- 0. 30 C steel plate welds (welded by using <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> plasma arc and HP 9 Ni- 4 Co- 0. 20 C weld wire) since this material is being considered {{for use in the}} Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) program. Prior to the welding, the material was double tempered at 538 C (1, 000 F). After welding, only part of the material was stress relieved at 510 C (950 F) for 3 h. Round tensile specimens obtained from nonstress-relieved material were tested in 100 -percent relative humidity at 38 C (100 F), in 3. 5 -percent NaCl alternate immersion, and in 5 -percent salt spray at 35 C (95 F). Specimens obtained from stress-relieved material were tested in alternate immersion. The stress levels were 50, 75, and 90 percent of the corresponding 0. 2 -percent yield strength (YS). All the nonstress-relieved specimens exposed to salt spray and alternate immersion failed. Stress-relieved specimens (exposed to alternate immersion) failed at 75 and 90 percent of YS. No failures occurred at 50 percent of YS in the stress-relieved specimens which indicates a beneficial effect of the stress relief on the SCC resistance of these welds. The stress relief also had a positive effect on the mechanical properties of the welds (the most important being an increase of 21 percent on the YS). Under the conditions of these tests, the <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> plasma are welded HP 9 Ni 4 Co- 0. 30 C steel plate was found highly susceptible to SCC in the nonstress-relieved condition. This susceptibility to SCC was reduced by stress relieving...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{conducted}} Electro-Contact Discharge (ECD) dressing experiment for # 600 diamond {{grinding wheel}} {{to understand how}} fine diamond grits protrude from metal-bonded wheel surface. The SEM observation, EDS analysis, image processing and 3 D grit modeling on wheel surface were carried out to investigate grit protrusion characteristics. Then ECD dressing and mechanical dressing experiments were carried out to identify the effect of grit protrusion feature on grinding performance. It is confirmed that the dressed wheel surface topography is sensitive to open circuit voltage Ei, discharge polarity and electrode composition. Meanwhile, ECD dressing with Ei= 15 V and <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> can produce superior protrusion topography without the damage of diamond crystal faces and the bond tail behind protrusive grit. It can obtain better ground surface of hard-brittle material than mechanical dressing with the bond tail...|$|E
40|$|Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) is {{welding process}} that is used for welding steel such as ASTM A 283 C Steel. Micro {{structure}} and mechanical properties of weld metal were influenced by many factors such as chemical composition, cooling rate and preheat. This research aims to study effect of preheat on weld metal micro structure and mechanical properties. Welding was carried out using GTAW process with DC <b>straight</b> <b>polarity.</b> Voltage and current were 30 volt and 100 A respectively were as preheat temperature were varied at 100 °C, 200 °C and 300 °C. Results of this research shows that an increase on preheat temperature leads to coarsening the microstructure. A maximum percentage of accicular ferrite and hence the highest impact toughness were achieved at weld metal with preheat 100 oC. This acciular ferrite is associated with inclusion in form of MnS, MnO and Al 2 O 3. Better impact properties were achieved at preheat 100 oC. Preheat 200 °C gave the best result for tensile test...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{properties of}} the Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) weld composite zone are intimately related to the physical processes associated with the keyhole. The effects of microsegregation and transient weld stress on macrosegregation in the weld tool are examined. In addition the electrical character of straight and reverse polarity portions of the arc cycle were characterized. The results of the former study indicate that alloy 2219 is weldable because large liquid volumes are available during latter stages of weld solidification. Strains in the pool region, acting in conjunction with weld microsegregation can produce macrosegregation great enough to produce radiographic contrast effects in welds. Mechanisms of surface copper enrichment were identified. The latter study has demonstrated that increased heat is delivered to workpieces if the reverse polarity proportion of the weld cycle is increased. Current in the <b>straight</b> <b>polarity</b> portion of the welding cycle increased as the reverse cycle proportion increased. Voltage during reverse polarity segments is large...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of weld quality control and weld process dependability {{continue to be}} relevant issues in modern metal welding technology. These become especially important for NASA missions which may require the assembly or repair of larger orbiting platforms using automatic welding techniques. To extend present welding technologies for such applications, NASA/MSFC's Materials and Processes Lab is developing physical models of the arc welding process {{with the goal of}} providing both a basis for improved design of weld control systems, and {{a better understanding of how}} arc welding variables influence final weld properties. The physics of the plasma arc discharge is reasonably well established in terms of transport processes occurring in the arc column itself, although recourse to sophisticated numerical treatments is normally required to obtain quantitative results. Unfortunately the rigor of these numerical computations often obscures the physics of the underlying model due to its inherent complexity. In contrast, this work has focused on a relatively simple physical model of the arc discharge to describe the gross features observed in welding arcs. Emphasis was placed of deriving analytic expressions for the voltage along the arc axis as a function of known or measurable arc parameters. The model retains the essential physics for a <b>straight</b> <b>polarity,</b> diffusion dominated free burning arc in argon, with major simplifications of collisionless sheaths and simple energy balances at the electrodes...|$|E
