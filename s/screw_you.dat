Harrison presents a worldview that variously reflects cynicism, sardonic humour and a degree of detachment with regard to personal relationships. According to music critic John Harris, the lines [...] "There's people standing round / Who'll <b>screw</b> <b>you</b> in the ground / They'll fill you in with all the sins you'll see" [...] serve {{as one of the first}} examples of the Beatles' ideology aligning with that of the emerging 1960s counterculture, by highlighting the division between traditional mores and an LSD-inspired perspective. Authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc recognise this and other statements in [...] "Love You To" [...] as part of the Beatles' espousal of anti-materialism from 1966 onwards, a message that, inspired by the LSD experience, suggested a [...] "psychedelic vision of society".|$|E

And yet, with my hideous capacity to understand it, I am strong enough, superior enough, to say anything, for conversation, later. It's {{in the light of}} unlimited conversation that I see the future years, and my honoured chair by the ingleside will require a succession of new cushions. I miss you shockingly--for, my dear fellow, there is no one--literally no one; and I don't in the least follow you--I can't go with you (I mean in conceptive faculty and the [...] "realising sense,") and you are for the time absolutely as if you were dead to me--I mean to my imagination of course--not to my affection or my prayers. And so I shall keep humble that you may pump into me--and make me stare and sigh and look simple and be quite out of it--for ever and ever. It's the best thing that can happen to one to see it written in your very hand that you have been so uplifted in health and cheer, and if another year will <b>screw</b> <b>you</b> up so tight that you won't [...] "come undone" [...] again, I will try and hold on through the barren months. I will go to Mrs. Sitwell, to hear what has made you blush--it must be something very radical. Your chieftains are dim to me--why shouldn't they be when you yourself are?

I myself do little but sit at home and write little tales--and even long ones--you shall see them when you come back. Nothing would induce me, by sending them to you, to expose myself to damaging Polynesian comparisons.

Sophocles' reply satirises the adulteries of Euripides:"It was the Sun, and not a boy, whose heat stripped me naked;as for you, Euripides, when you were kissing someone else's wifethe North Wind <b>screwed</b> <b>you.</b> You are unwise, you who sowin another's field, to accuse Eros of being a snatch-thief." ...|$|R

5000|$|Pickin & Fiddlin is {{the third}} album by American {{bluegrass}} group The Dillards, recorded with up and coming fiddle player Byron Berline. The album is entirely instrumental, with no vocals. The group had been unhappy with Elektra because they felt pressure from the company not to innovate, as they were beginning to do (and would eventually record on Wheatstraw Suite), and because they felt that Elektra was {{not doing enough to}} promote their records. The Dillards chose to record a strictly traditional album with Berline, a friend of the group, because they owed Elektra one more album. Rodney later stated, [...] "That wasnt a record made for anyone but the traditionals. We got completely hacked to pieces by them. So we said, Okay, <b>screw</b> <b>you</b> guys, well make an album, and well play it right up your ass!, so we did." ...|$|E

5000|$|Fuller {{said that}} the {{prospects}} of [...] "getting a big promotion" [...] in Heaven initially motivated Zachariah. In regards to his character's initial friendliness to Dean, he explained, [...] "You don't {{get what you want}} by being a complete jerk, so you use a little threat, enticement, and appeal to their best natures or the part of them that wants to do good. Just like in life, you can't dominate someone and get what you want. You will only get resentment and they will try to <b>screw</b> <b>you</b> any chance they can. That's what Zachariah was trying to avoid." [...] The character's later animosity towards Dean stems from him being in Zachariah's way, with Dean's determination and intelligence leading to contempt from Zachariah rather than respect. By Zachariah's final appearance, Fuller felt that the character [...] "has really cracked" [...] due to his rivalry with Dean; as the actor described it, [...] "He's fifty-two percent revenge, forty-eight percent still trying to make his plan work." [...] Fuller also believed that, despite these ignoble reasons playing a large part in his character's motivations, Zachariah also had genuinely good intentions.|$|E
