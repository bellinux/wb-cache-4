50|$|Apple {{moved to}} South Carolina in 1988 to become Professor of Ophthalmology and Pathology, Professor and Chairman at the <b>Storm</b> <b>Eye</b> Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston. He held the Pawek-Vallotton Chair of Biomedical Engineering and was Director of the Center or Research on Ocular Therapeutics and Biodevices until 2002. During his Chairmanship of the Department of Ophthalmology in Charleston from 1988 to 1996 he {{successfully}} led {{the effort to}} raise $8.8 million to complete a three-floor expansion and general renovation of the Eye Institute.

50|$|More than $200,000,000 of {{extramural}} grant awards {{were received}} by MUSC in the 2009-2010 fiscal year. Expansion in enrollments and programs {{has been made}} possible by ambitious programs of physical plant development that have seen the institution grow from one building in 1913 to a 76 acre medical complex, with more 89 buildings. Among the many buildings added to the campus was the historic old Charleston Arsenal, acquired in 1963. Since 1985, nine new buildings have been constructed: East Wing and Children's Hospital (1986), Institute of Psychiatry (1988), North Tower (1993), Harper Student Center (1993), Hollings Cancer Center (1993), The Strom Thurmond Biomedical Research Center and the Gazes Cardiac Institute (1997) {{in cooperation with the}} VA Hospital, Charles P. Darby Children’s Research Institute (2005), Ashley-Rutledge Parking Garage (2005), and Ashley River Tower (2008). In addition there have been major renovation/addition projects including <b>Storm</b> <b>Eye</b> Institute expansion (1998), Rutledge Tower Ambulatory Care Facility renovation (1998), College of Health Professions Complex (2005), Hollings Cancer Center Tower expansion (2005), and Colcock Hall (2005-2006). The growth of the campus has been made possible, at times, by the demolition of historic properties such as the c. 1820s Bennett Mill's overseer's house at 76 Barre Street, demolished in 1977 {{to make way for a}} parking lot.|$|E

40|$|Hurricane Katrina made land fall {{along the}} Louisiana-Mississippi border {{during the morning}} of August 29 th, 2005. At {{the time of the}} landfall, Katrina was a {{category}} 4 hurricane. The <b>storm</b> <b>eye</b> traveled a path 73. 4 km west of Biloxi, where winds reached sustained speeds of 164 km/hr in Biloxi, with gusts in excess of 200 km/hr. The damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in Biloxi was catastrophic in all single family dwellings within 400 to 600 mm of the waterfront and along the east end of the Biloxi peninsula (Fratta and Santamarina 2006). The wind load, rain-induced flooding, and the storm surge associated to large hurricanes cause slope failures, internal piping of earth dams, sediment transport along coastal regions and the failure of foundations for slender structures (Wieczorek 1996; Bucknam et al. 2001). Prepared with this information, we visited the Biloxi area twice (11 / 2005 and 7 / 2006) to assess the response of near-shore geotechnical systems (both onshore and offshore), including foundations, retaining walls, anchors and scouring next to bridge piers.

40|$|HIRAD (Hurricane Imaging Radiometer) flew on the WB- 57 during NASA s GRIP (Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes) {{campaign}} in August - September of 2010. HIRAD {{is a new}} C-band radiometer using a synthetic thinned array radiometer (STAR) technology to obtain cross-track resolution of approximately 3 degrees, out to approximately 60 degrees to each side of nadir. By obtaining measurements of emissions at 4, 5, 6, and 6. 6 GHz, observations of ocean surface wind speed and rain rate can be inferred. This technique {{has been used for}} many years by precursor instruments, including the Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR), which has been flying on the NOAA and USAF hurricane reconnaissance aircraft for several years. The advantage of HIRAD over SFMR is that HIRAD can observe a +/- 60 -degree swath, rather than a single footprint at nadir angle. Results from the flights during the GRIP campaign will be shown, including images of brightness temperatures, wind speed, and rain rate. To the extent possible, comparisons will be made with observations from other instruments on the GRIP campaign, for which HIRAD observations are either directly comparable or are complementary. Features such as <b>storm</b> <b>eye</b> and eyewall, location of vortex wind and rain maxima, and indications of dynamical features such as the merging of a weaker outer wind/rain maximum with the main vortex may be seen in the data. Potential impacts on operational ocean surface wind analyses and on numerical weather forecasts will also be discussed...|$|E
