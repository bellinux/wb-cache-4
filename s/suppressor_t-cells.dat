ConA is a plant mitogen, and is known for its ability to stimulate mouse T-cell subsets giving rise to four functionally distinct T cell populations, including precursors to suppressor T-cell; one subset of human <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> as well is sensitive to ConA. ConA was the first lectin to be available on a commercial basis, and is widely used in biology and biochemistry to characterize glycoproteins and other sugar-containing entities on the surface of various cells.

Homologous transfection of TcR alpha cDNA into a TcR alpha- beta+ clone reconstituted both CD 3 -TcR expression and suppressor function. Furthermore, suppressor activity from TcR beta- variants was specifically absorbed by antigen and anti-TcR alpha antibodies, but not by anti-CD 3 or anti-TcR beta affinity columns.

The nature of the T-cell antigen receptor has recently been the subject of intense study. Evidence for V-gene products being involved in the cell surface T-cell receptor has primarily involved production of various anti-idiotypic antisera and investigation of their biological effects (1 - 4). Recently, we have utilized a different approach based on the genetic analysis of functional fine-specificity markers to provide evidence of VH control of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) l-reactive T-cell specificity in common with serum antibody against the same antigenic moiety (5).

5000|$|In normal cells, TGF-β, acting {{through its}} {{signaling}} pathway, stops the cell cycle at the G1 stage to stop proliferation, induce differentiation, or promote apoptosis. In many cancer cells, {{parts of the}} TGF-β signaling pathway are mutated, and TGF-β no longer controls the cell. These cancer cells proliferate. The surrounding stromal cells (fibroblasts) also proliferate. Both cells increase their production of TGF-β. This TGF-β acts on the surrounding stromal cells, immune cells, endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. It causes immunosuppression and angiogenesis, which makes the cancer more invasive. TGF-β also converts effector T-cells, which normally attack cancer with an inflammatory (immune) reaction, into regulatory (<b>suppressor)</b> <b>T-cells,</b> which turn off the inflammatory reaction.Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between different cell types that express adhesion molecules and secrete cytokines. Disruption of these feedback mechanisms in cancer damages a tissue. When TGF-β signaling fails to control NF-κB activity in cancer cells, this has at least two potential effects: first, it enables the malignant tumor to persist {{in the presence of}} activated immune cells, and second, the cancer cell outlasts immune cells because it survives in the presence of apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory mediators.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{condition was}} established in vivo for selectively eliminating hapten-reactive <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity generated in mice primed with a para-azobenzoate (PAB) -mouse gamma globulin (MGG) -conjugate and treated with PAB-nonimmunogenic copolymer of D-amino acids (D- glutamic acid and D-lysine; D-GL). The elimination of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity with PAB-D-GL treatment from the mixed populations of hapten- reactive suppressor and helper T cells substantially increased apparent helper T-cell activity. Moreover, the inhibition of PAB-reactive <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> generation by the pretreatment with PAB-D-GL before the PAB-MGG-priming increased the development of PAB-reactive helper T-cell activity. The analysis of hapten-specificity of helper T cells revealed that the reactivity of helper cells developed {{in the absence of}} suppressor T cells was more specific for primed PAB-determinants and their cross-reactivities to structurally related determinants such as meta-azobenzoate (MAB) significantly decreased, as compared with the helper T-cell population developed in the presence of suppressor T lymphocytes. In addition, those helper T cells generated in the absence of suppressor T cells were highly susceptible to tolerogenesis by PAB-D- GL. Similarly, the elimination of suppressor T lymphocytes also enhanced helper T-cell activity in a polyclonal fashion in the T-T cell interactions between benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) -reactive T cells and PAB- reactive T cells after immunization of mice with BPO-MGG-PAB. Thus inhibition of BPO-reactive <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> development by the BPO-v-GL- pretreatment resulted in augmented generation of PAB-reactive helper T cells with higher susceptibility of tolerogenesis to PAB-D-GL. Thus, these results support the notion that suppressor T cells eventually suppress helper T-cell activity and indicate that the function of suppressor T cells related to helper T-cell development is to inhibit the increase in the specificity and apparent affinity of helper T cells in the primary immune response. The hapten-reactive suppressor and helper T lymphocytes are considered as a model system of T cells that regulate the immune response, and the potential applicability of this system to manipulating various T cell-mediated immune responses is discussed in this context...|$|R

Mixing experiments with T-cell-enriched suspensions from day- 90 M. habana-infected donors adoptively suppressed lymphocyte transformation by normal and day- 14 spleen cells.

To explore whether suppressor T cells regulate the heterogeneity of the anti-hapten response to Dnp conjugates of these polypeptides, various procedures aimed at reducing <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity were tested for their ability to alter the restricted isoelectric focusing spectrotypes. These procedures, such as adult thymectomy, administration of low doses of cyclophosphamide, and in vivo treatment with anti-I-J antisera, significantly increased the magnitude and heterogeneity of the anti-Dnp antibody response to Dnp-GLphi and Dnp-GLA in strains of mice that possessed responder Ir genes.

THE autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) is a proliferative T-cell response following in vitro stimulation with autologous non-T-cells bearing class II major histocompatibility antigens (MHC). During the course of the AMLR a variety of immunoreg-ulatory cells are generated including <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> [1 - 3] and macrophages [2, 4] which are capable of inhibiting spontaneous and pokeweed mitogen-driven immunoglobulin production. The AMLR is depressed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [5 — 9] an...|$|E
40|$|Pretreatment of BALB/c mice with Corynebacterium parvum {{inhibited}} {{the induction}} of tolerance to the contact sensitizing agent 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene induced by intravenous injection of DNBSO 3. The suppressive effect on tolerance induction has further been analyzed by adoptive transfer experiments. Injection of C. parvum intraperitoneally (0. 7 – 2. 8 mg/mouse) before injection of the tolergen inhibited {{the generation of}} T-suppressor cells as shown by transfer of spleen cells from the tolerized donor to naive recipients. Pretreatment of the recipients of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> from tolerized animals with C. parvum also inhibited the function of these cells in the recipient animals. Time-kinetic experiments suggested {{that more than one}} mechanism appeared to be responsible for the tolerance induced by DNBSO 3; C. parvum (probably via activated macrophages) suppressed tolerance which is mediated by T-suppressor lymphocytes. These results suggest that T-suppressor lymphocytes may—similarly as T-helper cells—be modulated by an activated monocytic-phagocytic system...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{effect of}} {{prostaglandin}} E 2 (PGE 2) on character-istics of splenic T-cells in tumor-bearing mice (TBM) was studied {{from the viewpoint}} of PGE 2 -mediated cell-recruitment system from the thymus to the spleen. The splenic T-cells of TBM enhanced tumor growth. In the TBM, the total number of thymocytes decreased, and the number of splenic T-cells concurrently in-creased. In adult thymectomized tumor bearers, these tumor growth-enhancing T-cells were absent in the spleen, and the number of splenic T-cells remained unchanged. Such <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cells</b> in the spleens of TBM may relate to recruitment of imma-ture T-cells from the thymus. The levels of PGE 2 in the plasma were depressed in the TBM. Replenishment by exogenous PGE 2 prevented both an increase in splenic T-cell population and an augmented generation of T-cells that had an enhancing effect on tumor growth. Our findings show that a low level of PGE 2 induce...|$|E
40|$|Procainamide (PA) induces the {{production}} of a number of autoantibodies in a high proportion of treated individuals and in some a syndrome closely resembling systemic lupus erythematosus. The mechanism underlying this action of PA is unclear. To examine the possibility that PA might induce autoantibody formation by altering normal immunoregulatory mechanisms, the action of this drug on an in vitro model of antibody formation in man was examined. PA was found to augment the generation of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISC) from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) in response to pokeweed mitogen but had no effect on pokeweed mitogen-induced tritiated thymidine incorporation. When purified populations of B and T cells were used, PA enhanced the generation of ISC in B-cell cultures supported by untreated T cells but not by T cells treated with mitomycin C. These results indicate that PA augmented B-cell responses by inhibiting <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity and not by augmenting helper T-cell or B-cell function. N-Acetyl-procainamide had no effect on the generation of ISC in this system. The effect of PA on concanavalin A (Con A) -induced suppressor cell activity was also examined to determine whether PA altered the generation or expression of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> function. PBM were cultured with 30 microgram/ml of Con A for 48 h to generate suppressor cells. When these were co-cultured with fresh PBM, the number of ISC generated was decreased by 58. 1 +/- 3. 4 % (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). Cells that had been similarly incubated without Con A were not inhibitory. The addition of PA to the Con A-stimulated cultures inhibited the generation of suppressor cells as indicated {{by the fact that the}} response of fresh cells co-cultured with the Con A-stimulated cells was diminished by only 27. 2 +/- 4. 3 %. In this system too, N-acetyl-procaimamide had no effect. By contrast, adding PA only to the co-culture of Con A-stimulated cells with fresh PBM had a less marked effect on suppressor cell function. These results indicate that the major action of PA is to inhibit the generation of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> activity. Such an effect may explain the capacity of this agent to induce autoantibody formation in treated individuals...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocyte subpopulations were {{measured}} in the peripheral blood of fifteen patients with extrinsic bronchial asthma and twenty-seven normal control subjects. No {{significant differences in the}} absolute numbers of relative proportions of T, B or K lymphocytes were found. Antibody-dependent lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (K-cell activity) was also found to be normal. The proportion and absolute number of 'null' cells were significantly increased in the asthmatic group: this population did not correlate with serum IgE levels, the eosinophil count or the duration of disease. The significance of these results in relation to <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> control of IgE formation is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral blood {{mononuclear}} {{cells from}} two well-defined groups {{of patients with}} the Sézary syndrome have been studied employing indirect immunofluorescent and indirect immunogold techniques in light and electron microscopy, using monoclonal antibodies against T-cell subpopulations. Four patients had chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) of the actinic reticuloid variant, with erythroderma. Eight patients had cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. All patients showed the clinical features of the Sézary syndrome, including erythroderma, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and peripheral lymphadenopathy, and in all patients significant numbers (0. 5 – 30. 5 × 109 cells/liter) of circulating mononuclear cells were observed with Sézary cell morphology on light-microscopic examination of blood films. Major differences were observed in the circulating T-cell subpopulations in the two groups. In the erythrodermic CAD patients, there was a moderately elevated T-cell count (1. 6 ± 0. 6 × 109 cells/liter; normal, 1. 0 ± 0. 3 × 109 cells/liter) of which {{the majority of the}} cells was suppressor T cells (OKT 8 +) giving a very low helper: <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> ratio of 0. 1 : 1 – 0. 36 : 1 (normal, 1. 7 : 1 – 3. 5 : 1). In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, there was also an elevation of the T-cell count (9. 5 ± 12. 9 × 109 cells/liter), but in these patients the predominant cell was the helper T cell (OKT 4 +) with a high helper: <b>suppressor</b> <b>T-cell</b> ratio of 3. 7 : 1 – 98 : 1...|$|R
