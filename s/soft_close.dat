It is a flight of pink roses floating in a mass from left to right, and this cloud or mass of roses is presently effaced by a flight of 'sparks' or gold speckles across them. The sparks totter or vibrate from left to right, but they fly distinctly upwards; they are like tiny blocks, half gold, half black, rather symmetrically placed behind each other, and they are always {{in a hurry to}} efface the roses; sometimes they have come at my call, sometimes by surprise, but they are always equally pleasing. What interests me most is that, when a child under nine, the flight of roses was light, slow, <b>soft,</b> <b>close</b> to my eyes, roses so large and brilliant and palpable that I tried to touch them; the scent was overpowering, the petals perfect, with leaves peeping here and there, texture and motion all natural. They would stay a long time before the sparks came, and they occupied a large area in black space. Then the sparks came slowly flying, and generally, not always, effaced the roses at once, and every effort to retain the roses failed. Since an early age the flight of roses has annually grown smaller, swifter, and farther off, till by the time I was grown up my vision had become a speck, so instantaneous that I had hardly time to realise that it was there before the fading sparks showed that it was past. This is how they still come. The pleasure of them is past, and it always depresses me to speak of them, though I do not now, as I did when a child, connect the vision with any elevated spiritual state. But when I read Tennyson's Holy Grail, I wondered whether anybody else had had my vision, 'Rose-red, with beatings in it.' I may add, I was a London child who never was in the country but once, and I connect no particular flowers with that visit. I may almost say that I had never seen a rose, certainly not a quantity of them together." ...|$|E

60|$|Without {{a word of}} inquiry, therefore, the Two Idle Apprentices drifted out resignedly into a fine, <b>soft,</b> <b>close,</b> drowsy, {{penetrating}} rain; {{got into}} the landlord's light dog-cart, and rattled off through the village for the foot of Carrock. The journey at the outset was not remarkable. The Cumberland road {{went up and down}} like all other roads; the Cumberland curs burst out from backs of cottages and barked like other curs, and the Cumberland peasantry stared after the dog-cart amazedly, {{as long as it was}} in sight, like the rest of their race. The approach to the foot of the mountain resembled the approaches to the feet of most other mountains all over the world. The cultivation gradually ceased, the trees grew gradually rare, the road became gradually rougher, and the sides of the mountain looked gradually more and more lofty, and more and more difficult to get up. The dog-cart was left at a lonely farm-house. The landlord borrowed a large umbrella, and, assuming in an instant the character of the most cheerful and adventurous of guides, led the way to the ascent. Mr. Goodchild looked eagerly at the top of the mountain, and, feeling apparently that he was now going to be very lazy indeed, shone all over wonderfully to the eye, under the influence of the contentment within and the moisture without. Only in the bosom of Mr. Thomas Idle did Despondency now hold her gloomy state. He kept it a secret; but he would have given a very handsome sum, when the ascent began, to have been back again at the inn. The sides of Carrock looked fearfully steep, and the top of Carrock was hidden in mist. The rain was falling faster and faster. The knees of Mr. Idle--always weak on walking excursions--shivered and shook with fear and damp. The wet was already penetrating through the young man's outer coat to a brand-new shooting-jacket, for which he had reluctantly paid the large sum of two guineas on leaving town; he had no stimulating refreshment about him but a small packet of clammy gingerbread nuts; he had nobody to give him an arm, nobody to push him gently behind, nobody to pull him up tenderly in front, nobody to speak to who really felt the difficulties of the ascent, the dampness of the rain, the denseness of the mist, and the unutterable folly of climbing, undriven, up any steep place in the world, when there is level ground within reach to walk on instead. Was it for this that Thomas had left London? London, where there are nice short walks in level public gardens, with benches of repose set up at convenient distances for weary travellers--London, where rugged stone is humanely pounded into little lumps for the road, and intelligently shaped into smooth slabs for the pavement! No! it was not for the laborious ascent of the crags of Carrock that Idle had left his native city, and travelled to Cumberland. Never did he feel more disastrously convinced that he had committed a very grave error in judgment than when he found himself standing in the rain at the bottom of a steep mountain, and knew that the responsibility rested on his weak shoulders of actually getting to the top of it.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBetween 2 and 6 % of the {{population}} harbour at least one intracranial aneurysm and around 0. 5 % ofthem are expected to rupture. Given the human and economic cost associated with cerebral vasculardiseases, a systematic medical screening of intracranial aneurysms would be worth organizing. However,the per-procedural risk being about 1 %, no such screening is organized because a reliable assessment ofthe aneurysms vulnerability is still lacking. Nevertheless, with brain imaging being more frequently andwidely used, {{a growing number of}} intracranial aneurysms are being diagnosed, raising the problem ofwhich aneurysms harbour a sufficiently high risk of rupture to merit a prophylactic repair. This questionis still unsolved at the moment and therapeutic decision for unruptured aneurysms still a challenge. We develop, in this study, a way assessing the risk of rupture of an aneurysm. The method stems fromtwo recent results obtained within the IRRAs consortium ([URL] and supported by existingdata in the literature. First, by characterizing the mechanical properties of human aneurysms tissues andclassifying them with respect to the available epidemiological/histologic/medical data, Costalat et al. 2011 demonstrated that the medical status of an aneurysm (undegraded, degraded, close to rupture orruptured) is strongly correlated with the aneurysmal tissue property (stiff, intermediate, soft). Second,as a follow up of the experimental study of Costalat et al. 2011, Sanchez et al. 2013 performed anumerical study of the blood flow in cerebral aneurysms under realistic in vivo conditions. The Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) computations showed {{a significant difference between the}} systo-diastolicaneurysmal volume variations corresponding to the <b>soft</b> (<b>close</b> to rupture or ruptured) and the stiff(undegraded) tissue. These results are not only robust with respect to the many uncertainties related toany biomechanical simulation performed under in vivo conditions, but they are also consistent with aclinical study by Hayakawa et al. 2005 who came to the conclusion that the detection of pulsation in anunruptured aneurysm is a clue of an important risk of rupture of the aneurysm. However, the differenceobserved in the simulations between stiff and soft tissues are large enough to be detected by advancedMagnetic Resonance Imaging protocols able to measure displacements as small as 0. 04 mm (Karmoniket al., 2010). The presented method couples soft tissues measurements, advanced medical imaging and FSIcomputations in order to build a quantitative index of risk of rupture of cerebral aneurysms...|$|E

"July 2011 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay adopts the survival analysis to empirically analyze a new auction format, pay-per-bid auction, in which a fee occurs to the bidder when a new bid is submitted. This auction mechanism attracted many theoretical studies and empirical testing in recent years. However, analyzing the pay-per-bid auction under the survival framework provides a novel path to reflect this new auction format as well as involved bidder and seller behaviors. By considering the arrival of bids as a necessary condition for a pay-per-bid auction to survive, survival analysis tools such as Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate and Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models are applied to the data set collected from a leading pay-per-bid auction site Swoopo. Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) model is also discussed. Some equilibrium behaviors are confirmed but also some equilibrium deviated behaviors are detected. The second essay models the last-minute bidding behaviors in eBay's hard close auction design using non-parametric analysis. For comparison purpose, the auctions in Amazon with <b>soft</b> <b>close</b> auction design are combined to carry out analysis. The data is selected from eBay and Amazon and a large difference in bid timing is found between auction sites. Density estimation of bid timing confirms the existence of such difference. Mixed additive model is applied to explore the nonparametric relationship between bid timing and parameters of bidding environment. And generalized response model with logistic link function is used to model the probability of a late bidding occurs conditioned on interested covariates. The third essay proposes, from a non-parametric Bayesian aspect, using Dirichlet Processes (DP) with normal mixtures to estimate underlying valuations in second-price ascending auctions under the independent-private-values paradigm. I illustrate how a second-price ascending auction is similar in mechanism to its sealed counterpart and consequently bidders' valuations can be extracted if bidders are identifiable. Compared to classical methods, to provide more flexible and reliable inferences, DP density estimation is strongly motivated and represents an advance. As a non-parametric Bayesian method, DP can accommodate non-nomality through normal mixtures and develop Bayesian inference on model parameters. Due to the complex nature of posteriors, MCMC simulation is used to approximate posteriors as well as density predictions. To test the validity of this method, a Monte Carlo experiment is conducted with similar sample size to our eBay data. In the last section, I reanalyze a data set from eBay auctions and apply our method to estimate the valuations...|$|E
