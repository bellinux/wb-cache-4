40|$|Abstract-In {{the past}} decade, {{parallel}} disk {{systems have been}} developed {{to address the problem of}} I/O performance. A critical challenge with modern parallel I/O systems is that parallel disks consume a significant amount of energy in servers and highperformance computers. To conserve energy consumption in parallel I/O systems, one can immediately spin down disks when disk are idle; however, spinning down disks might not be able to produce energy savings due to penalties of <b>spinning</b> <b>operations.</b> Unlike powering up CPUs, spinning down and up disks need physical movements. Therefore, energy savings provided by <b>spinning</b> down <b>operations</b> must offset energy penalties of the disk <b>spinning</b> <b>operations.</b> To substantially reduce the penalties incurred by disk <b>spinning</b> <b>operations,</b> we developed a novel approach to conserving energy of parallel I/O systems with write buffer disks, which are used to accumulate small writes using a log file system. Data sets buffered in the log file system can be transferred to target data disks in a batch way. Thus, buffer disks aim to serve a majority of incoming write requests, attempting to reduce the large number of disk <b>spinning</b> <b>operations</b> by keeping data disks in standby for long period times. Interestingly, the write buffer disks not only can achieve high energy efficiency in parallel I/O systems, but also can shorten response times of write requests. To evaluate the performance and energy efficiency of our parallel I/O systems with buffer disks, we implemented a prototype using a cluster storage system as a testbed. Experimental results show that under light and moderate I/O load, buffer disks can be employed to significantly reduce energy dissipation in parallel I/O systems without adverse impacts on I/O performance.

40|$|Abstract: Yarn {{hairiness}} is one {{of important}} yarn parameters, which is used for yarn production quality control. It is usually characterized {{by the amount of}} free fibers (fibre loops, fibre ends) protruding from the compact yarn body towards the outer yarn surface. The first question can be if hairiness is really important and why? The reason is obtaining deeper information about yarn structure and its changes during processing. Thanks to detailed knowledge it is possible predict to yarn behaviour and design fabric and textile products precisely in the way the customers demand. Yarn hairiness and its determining is important because it influences the post <b>spinning</b> <b>operation</b> and parameters of textile product (porosity, permeability, transport of moisture, comfort, aesthetic properties and hand). The main factors influencing hairiness are: type of fibres, yarn twist, yarn count, blending ratio, yarn technology production, approach to yarn hairiness observation and measurement condition. This paper concentrates on the influence of yarn construction parameter (yarn count, yarn twist) and technology of production (ring comb and carded, experimental and open end).

30|$|The {{internal}} coagulant {{flow rate}} (ICFR) in lumen {{side of the}} hollow fiber through the <b>spinning</b> <b>operation</b> {{is one of the}} most influential factors determining fiber properties. Therefore, the influences of various ICFR (e.g., 2.6, 3.6, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13  ml/min) on the structural morphology and ultrafiltration properties have been deduced. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that excessively high ICFR within a constantly flowing PVC dope solution leads to an inner membrane surface with a high pore density, small pore diameter, and small skin layer. Whereas, an overly low ICFR flow can result in the formation of an inner membrane surface with open cellular structure. This is due to the change of the demixing process at different ICFR, as well as the delay in the instantaneous liquid–liquid demixing process of both the solvent in the dope solution and the water in the internal coagulant. Our findings further indicate that the membrane thickness was reduced by 314 % when the ICFR was increased from 2.6 to 13  ml/min. In addition, the pure water permeation flux was improved by 17 times with an increase in the ICFR up to 13  ml/min, while the BSA rejection was changed from 93.4 to 90.4 as the ICFR increased from 2.6 and 9  ml/min as a result of high pore density, reduced membrane thickness, and small pore size.|$|E

The two-dimensional tire-wheel model, ignoring the variation in the in-depth direction, consists of a tire surface structure and an internal air cavity, which are coupled by two boundary conditions.

Such a composition of the model gives a fully coupled model including structure, air cavity and their interactions. The spinning effect of the tire induces the rotating of the tire structure and {{the flow of the}} internal air, which inevitably affects the acoustical resonances in the tire cavity. Equations describing the rotating structures, flowing air cavity and their interactions are given.

In this research project, the equivalent plastic strain, invoked throughout bcc (1020 steel) and fcc (5052 and 6061 aluminum alloys, pure copper, and 70 / 30 brass) samples, that were made by SMFF, was measured. The objective of the research were to measure the to obtain data {{on the effect of}} microstructure and mechanical parameters on the flow formability of ductile bcc and fcc metal work pieces. To address this objective the equivalent plastic strain in the high strain regions of the flow formed metal parts were measured with the use of Micro/nano-indentation hardness measurements. Also, micro/nano-indentation tests were performed, on the same alloys the metal alloys which were used in the SMFF experiments, to assess the effect of pre-exist plastic strain, strain rate, and deformation volume on the operative deformation mechanisms. These parameters were found to depend upon the microstructure and the associated deformation mechanisms. Data from indentations tests at constant loading rate and constant strain rates on a variety of ductile metals/alloys were used to determine the effect of dislocation type (i. e. “statistically stored”, and “geometrically necessary”), stacking fault energy, and activation volume. This accounts for the observed strain rate sensitivity and the depth dependence of the indentation stress. It also affects the local strain magnitude and gradient during the SMFF process. This micro/nano-indentation based test technique allows one to then obtain data from which to validate calculated equivalent plastic strain distributions derived from numerical simulations and, for end users of a metal forming technique, allows one to understand and quantify the mechanical properties of the formed work piece...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = the density of yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. 　In the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the nip point of delivery roller. 　(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting rayon yarn with the flyer frame showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of untwisted yarn is occasionally important in <b>spinning</b> <b>operation,</b> especially in false twisting of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) The permanent deformations of twisted yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|E

40|$|Precise {{control of}} quantum systems is of {{fundamental}} importance for quantum device engineering, such as {{is needed in}} the fields of quantum information processing, high-resolution spectroscopy and quantum metrology. When scaling up the quantum registers in such devices, several challenges arise: individual addressing of qubits in a dense spectrum while suppressing crosstalk, creation of entanglement between distant nodes, and decoupling from unwanted interactions. The experimental implementation of optimal control is a prerequisite to meeting these challenges. Using engineered microwave pulses, we experimentally demonstrate optimal control of a prototype solid state spin qubit system comprising thirty six energy levels. The spin qubits are associated with proximal nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond.
