5000|$|A <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> is a spar used in sailboats (both dinghys and yachts) to {{help support}} and control a variety of headsails, {{particularly}} the spinnaker. However, it is also used with other sails, such as genoas and jibs, when sailing downwind with no spinnaker hoisted. (Since the load on a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> is very light on this point of sailing, sometimes a special light <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> called a whisker pole is used in these circumstances.) ...|$|R
50|$|Symmetric spinnakers {{have the}} {{windward}} clew secured to a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> The pole {{is attached to}} the mast and holds the windward edge of the sail in position. Lines that control the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> are called guys or braces. The <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> may be allowed to raise and lower with the force of the wind, or it may have lines attached to it to raise (the topping lift) and lower (the foreguy or downhaul) the angle of the pole. If these lines are used, they are generally set up before setting sail, and left in place even when the spinnaker is stowed.|$|R

50|$|A special line, the topping lift, {{runs from}} the middle of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> up to a block on the mast, and is used to support the weight of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> Another line {{referred}} to as the downhaul or foreguy runs down so that the height of the pole is under positive control at all times.|$|R
50|$|Rig - Hollow spars, {{including}} <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> {{stainless steel}} rigging, galvanized tangs, bronze fittings and winches.|$|R
60|$|Baby jib top-sails {{had been}} sent down before the rounding, and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> were now ready for the balloon sail.|$|R
50|$|The <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> is rigged to {{run from}} the base of the mast, where there is a special fitting for {{attaching}} one end of the pole, out to windward over the side of the boat. There, one of the control lines of whichever sail it is to be used with is run through a fitting on the other end of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> This allows for more precise control of the corner of the sail to which the line is attached.|$|R
50|$|Limitations to the {{equipment}} series for an FJ are; 1 mainsail, 2 jibs, 1 spinnaker (optional), 1 mast, 1 boom, 2 <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles,</b> 1 centerboard and 1 rudder.|$|R
50|$|In a keel boat, a {{death roll}} is {{the act of}} {{broaching}} to windward, putting the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> {{into the water and}} causing a crash-jibe of the boom and mainsail, which sweep across the deck and plunge down into the water. The Death Roll often results in destruction of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and sometimes even dismasting of the boat. Serious injury to crew is possible due to the swift and uncontrolled action of the boom and associated gear sweeping across the boat and crashing to the (now) leeward side.|$|R
50|$|Race 4 was sailed {{in strong}} winds and rough seas and NZL 82s mast snapped {{on the third}} leg causing retirement. On the third leg in race 5, NZL 82 broke a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{topping lift}} may also {{refer to a}} line {{on the front of}} the mast used to rig the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> It is used to trim the pole to the proper height when {{hoisting}} the spinnaker.|$|R
50|$|The {{symmetric}} one is {{the most}} classic type, running symmetrical alongside the boat controlled by lines known as a sheet and a guy running from the lower two corners of the sail. The windward line, or guy, {{is attached to the}} corner called the tack of the sail, and is stabilized by a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> The leeward (downwind) line is called the sheet. It attaches to the clew of the spinnaker and is used to control the shape of the sail. The <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> must be moved in each gybe, and is quite difficult for beginners to use. However, it can be sailed in all downwind wind directions.|$|R
50|$|Asymmetrical {{spinnaker}} resembling large jibs and flown from <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> {{are not a}} {{new idea}} and date back to at least the 19th Century. However in the 1980s a new concept appeared, starting with the Sydney Harbour 18ft Skiff fleet.|$|R
5000|$|The Elliott 6m is an Olympic-class keelboat, {{designed}} by New Zealander, Greg Elliott. It {{was selected for}} the women's match racing event for the 2012 Olympics. [...] The Elliott 6m carries a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and symmetric <b>spinnaker</b> which is considered more suitable for match racing.|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are widely employed in sailing sports, a possible application {{is for the}} mast pole or other sail poles. In the paper the {{attention is focused on}} the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> mechanical performances; in particular the focus is on axial and ring compressive properties of three different carbon fibre/epoxy resin <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles,</b> to investigate both the diameter and stacking sequence effect on the mechanical performance of the structure. Starting from the stacking sequence used in the production of a particular <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> the effect of a lamina at 0 - in the middle of wall thickness is investigated with the purpose to obtain a more stiff structure. Moreover to test the proposed stacking sequence on different size products, a prototype with lower diameter is realized. To properly evaluate axial and ring stiffness, axial compression test and ring stiffness one are performed. Then a numerical model is developed to support the design of the finished product: A simple and versatile numerical analysis (FEA with software ANSYS), by simulating ring stiffness and pull-direction compression tests, is carried out in elastic regime. Such model should be suitable for designing and/or verifying the mechanical performance of pole structures, even though differing from those above described, for materials, geometry and stacking sequence...|$|R
50|$|The hull, {{interior}} structure, and deck of Tiamat {{is built}} in foam cored Epoxy/E-glass, while the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and mast are carbon fibre. Mills has {{opted for a}} twin carbon wheel design rather than the standard single wheel as seen on most yachts of this size.|$|R
5000|$|A guy (probably from Dutch gei, [...] "brail") {{is a line}} (rope) {{attached}} to and intended to control {{the end of a}} spar on a sailboat. On a modern sloop-rigged sailboat with a symmetric <b>spinnaker,</b> the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> is the spar most commonly controlled by one or more guys.|$|R
50|$|Parrot beak-a {{stainless}} steel fitting {{on the end}} of a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> consisting of a mounting with a retractable spring-loaded pin that is controlled remotely by way of a cord. When the cord is pulled it releases the spinnaker sheet so the spinnaker can be recovered by crew on deck.|$|R
50|$|The {{class has}} since progressed with the times, {{including}} a new deck and cockpit layout and changing the construction from GRP to a foam sandwich. In {{the last few years}} the rules have allowed a bigger <b>spinnaker,</b> longer <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and the use of epoxy resin {{in the construction of the}} hull.|$|R
5000|$|Ketch or Sloop rig with {{aluminum}} spars {{and stainless steel}} standing and running rigging. Main (24m) mast has double aluminum in line spreaders and mizzen mast is with single spreaders. Standing rig with stainless steel wire rope with Norseman swageless terminals and consists of headstay, main backstay, the mizzen forward support is done using intermediate shrouds or a triatic stay, mizzen backstay, single upper shrouds and double lowers on main, single uppers and lowers on mizzen. Main, mizzen and spinnaker booms are aluminum. The original winches were manufactured by Lewmar and Barlow. Swan 65 has two <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> because gybeing large spinnakers by dipping the pole is considered too dangerous. With only one <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> operational ADC Accutrac performed gybes by lowering the spinnaker, repacking it and hoisting it up again on the other side. (Clare Francis 1978) ...|$|R
50|$|A spar is a pole of wood, {{metal or}} {{lightweight}} {{materials such as}} carbon fibre used in the rigging of a sailing vessel to carry or support its sail. These include booms and masts, which serve both to deploy sail and resist compressive and bending forces, {{as well as the}} bowsprit and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|R
50|$|The modern 12s {{also have}} fixed bowsprits {{to carry the}} spinnakers from. This is a {{relatively}} recent innovation, with the older style of skiff having an 'end to end' <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> which {{would need to be}} positioned by the crew, and would be stored against the skiff's boom when it was not being used.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary boats weigh {{as little}} as 165 lb, and have as typical {{equipment}} a retractable <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> unlimited asymmetric <b>spinnaker</b> size, 200sq ft mainsail and jib area, a fully battened mainsail, an adjustable carbon rig, and a hydrofoil rudder that allows the boat to be trimmed fore and aft for different conditions, and as a drag reduction device.|$|R
5000|$|The Parasail was {{developed}} as {{a variant of the}} Parasailor, and is a great light wind performer. With very little tendency to roll, it is ideal for small crews. It can be used with a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> but it is not necessary. The Parasail has a single-skinned wing as opposed to the double-layer wing of the Parasailor ...|$|R
5000|$|Current Cherubs use an {{asymmetric}} spinnaker system but earlier boats used relatively large double luff spinnakers {{and used a}} notably long (9 foot) <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> Cherubs have a high power-to-weight ratio and are very quick downwind in stronger breezes but can be slow upwind in lighter airs compared to longer boats. The Cherub has a RYA Portsmouth number of 930.|$|R
5000|$|The {{downhaul}} {{is a line}} {{which is}} part of the rigging on a sailboat; it applies downward force on a spar or sail. The most common downhaul on a modern sailboat is attached to the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> though this may be referred to as the foreguy in some rigging nomenclature. The term is also commonly applied to the cunningham on the mainsail.|$|R
50|$|A {{few were}} {{imported}} into the US in the mid-80's, and several now {{reside in the}} Pacific Northwest region. The boat is fractionally rigged, with a conventional <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and symmetric <b>spinnaker.</b> An unusual feature of the rig, required for class racing, is that the jib is sheeted to a self-tacking traveler car. The Ross 930 has a PHRF rating between 96 and 120, depending on region.|$|R
50|$|From {{the tip of}} her {{bowsprit}} to the end of her 108 ft boom, Reliance measured 201 ft, and {{the tip of her}} mast was 199 ft {{above the}} water (the height of a 20-story building). Everything else was to an equally gargantuan scale; her <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> was 84 ft long, and her total sail area of 1501 m2 was the equivalent of eight 12 meter class yachts.|$|R
50|$|There is room in {{the cockpit}} for four to daysail, but a crew of three is {{employed}} when racing. On most racing teams, the skipper helms the boat and handles the mainsail. The front crew on a racing team handles the jib upwind and is responsible for <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> handling downwind. When racing, a middle crew is relied upon for trimming the spinnaker downwind and has boat balance as a primary responsibility upwind.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of a {{symmetrical}} spinnaker, each of the lower corners of the sail is a clew. However, under sail on a given tack, the corner to which the spinnaker sheet is attached is called the clew, and the corner attached to the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> {{is referred to as the}} tack. [...] On a square sail underway, the tack is the windward clew and also the line holding down that corner.|$|R
50|$|The hullform is {{designed}} for bent wood, laid with overlapping ends (clinker-built), easy for amateur builders with low budgets. However, the association has been reasonably flexible. In 1949, they approved carvel-built boats (ends of the hull planking butt, rather than overlap). In 1976, an inexpensive (gun-shot flock) fiberglass hull was approved. In 1999, after persistent reasonable argument by a certain Swedish aerospace engineer, the association accepted a design for an aluminum mast, whisker and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|R
50|$|When running, the {{mainsail}} is eased out {{as far as}} it will go. The jib will collapse {{because the}} mainsail blocks its wind, and must either be lowered and replaced by a spinnaker, or set instead on the windward side of the sailing craft. Running with the jib to windward is known as 'gull wing', 'goose wing', 'butterflying' or 'wing and wing'. A genoa gull-wings well, especially if stabilized by a whisker pole, which is similar to but lighter than a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jibing {{with the}} {{asymmetric}} {{is much less}} complex than the symmetric, {{due to the lack}} of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> Much like a jib, all that is required is to change sheets. However, since the asymmetric still flies in front of the forestay, the operation is reversed. The loaded sheet is slackened, and the opposite (lazy) sheet is pulled in, which allows the sail to pass around in front of the forestay, and then be sheeted in on the new lee side of the boat.|$|R
50|$|In Sydney and Brisbane Australia {{there has}} been a revival of the early days of 18’ skiff sailing. Replicas of famous 18’ skiffs from the period of 1930 through to 1950 have been built using {{original}} techniques, including wooden hulls and spars, gaff rigs, several-piece <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> and unrestricted sail area. These boats race under the rules of the Australian Historical Skiff Association, which bans wings, trapezes, cleats for controlling ropes for the mainsail, jib and spinnaker, and most of the other modern equipment which makes sailing easier.|$|R
5000|$|When running (sailing nearly {{directly}} downwind) in a sloop, one may 'jibe' {{only the}} mainsail {{to the opposite}} side of the boat. This keeps both the main and jib exposed to the wind resulting in a more efficient use of wind. Setting the mainsail and the jib on opposite sides of the boat is often referred to as running [...] "goose-winged", [...] "gull-winged", or [...] "wing-and-wing". When running wing-and-wing, a light <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> or whisker pole is often used to hold the clew of the foresail out to the windward side of the boat.|$|R
40|$|Bamboo {{laminates}} {{are made}} from bamboo strips milled out from bamboo wall core. In the present study, the overall mechanical characteristics of bamboo fibres reinforced composites and sandwich for general marine applications were analysed. An accurate analysis of processing possibilities and chemical-physical characterisation has been conducted, evaluating the relationship between composites performances, processing characteristics and environmental ageing. As applications, an hull panel and a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> have been realised and respectively tested for impact and for axial compression load: successively a complete 6 meters boat hull has been realised in order to analyse critical lamination points {{and the effectiveness of}} vacuum bagging...|$|R
