5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|Alongside her singing, Malouma {{has also}} fought to {{safeguard}} her country's music, urging {{the government to}} create a music school, forming her own foundation in support of musical heritage, and in 2014 creating her own music festival. She has also been active in politics since the 1990s, {{when she began to}} campaign for more democracy. She was elected a senator in 2007, the first politician in her caste, but was arrested the following year after a coup d'état. When elections were again held in 2009, she became a senator for the opposition Ech-Choura party where she was given special responsibilities for the environment. This led in 2011 to her appointment as the IUCN's Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. In December 2014, she announced <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> from the opposition to join the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, where she felt she could be more effective in contributing to the country's progress. Her work has been recognized by the French, who decorated her as a Knight of the Legion of Honor, and the Americans, whose ambassador to Mauritania named her a Mauritanian Woman of Courage.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> her cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E

25|$|Because of Genie's {{previous}} treatment Miner and David Rigler {{arranged for}} her to stay at Children's Hospital for two weeks, where her condition moderately improved. Authorities then placed Genie in another foster home, where she did fairly well, but in mid-December 1977 the arrangement very suddenly ended. Through {{the end of that}} month into early January Genie lived in a temporary setting, after which authorities put her in another foster home. During this time Curtiss wrote to Miner that Genie did not understand the reasons <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> and believed it was her fault for not being a good enough person, and said the frequency with which her living arrangements changed further traumatized her and caused continued developmental regression.|$|E

500|$|Plant {{also noted}} that Madonna, in the video, {{restored}} the energy and eroticism of Venice, which had its name taken from Venus in familiar elision. As she exchanged her blue top for a black one during the video, Madonna demonstrated her mastery and bravery of the city, which had a reputation of turning out its visitors as victims. Carol Clerk (2002) commented that with the video, [...] "Madonna's days as a cheap and cheerful video star were over. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> into serious spectacle." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{writer from}} Rolling Stone gave a mixed review for the video saying that [...] "It's a goofy and fun clip, though the faceless cheerleaders in the {{background}} are more creepy than amusing." [...] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from Attitude believed that the last scene showing Madonna throwing off a baby doll implied that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> away from domestic life and embracing a party attitude. Amanda Dobbins from New York found some [...] "attempted weirdness" [...] in the video with the scenes of the triple Marilyns and the baby on Madonna's lap, but added that [...] "Madonna still looks crazy bonkers good".|$|E

After a preliminary assessment, it was decided that the vessel could not be repaired in Pearl Harbor.

Protecteur was delivered to Esquimalt on 31 May 2014.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Cynthia {{made her}} {{recording}} début with a rendition of [...] "Those Were the Days", which as produced by McCartney {{had been a}} number one hit for Mary Hopkin in 1968. [...] It failed to chart. Whilst living in Normandy, an exhibition of her drawings and paintings were displayed at Portobello Road's KDK Gallery in 1999. [...] By the 1990s she was appearing at some Beatles conventions, but appeared ambivalent about the practice. [...] At times she maintained <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> {{on with her life}} and putting her Beatles past behind her and at other times seemed to embrace continued interest in that past as inevitable. The Daily Telegraph said in a 1999 profile, [...] "In essence, she is a suburban woman who – almost in spite of herself – got caught up {{with one of the most}} extraordinary men of modern times. More than 30 years since her marriage to John Lennon ended, she is as entangled as ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Her thirteenth album, Reba, {{was issued}} in 1988 {{and was not}} well {{received}} by critics, who claimed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> farther away from her [...] "traditional country" [...] sound. Stereo Review disliked the album's contemporary style, stating, [...] "After years of insisting that she'd stick to hard-core country 'because I have tried the contemporary-type songs, and it's not Reba McEntire—it's just not honest,' McEntirehas gone whole-hog pop. The album peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart and remained there for six consecutive weeks. Okay, so maybe that's not so terrible." [...] Although it was reviewed poorly, the album itself was certified platinum in sales and produced two number-one singles: [...] "I Know How He Feels" [...] and [...] "New Fool at an Old Game". In addition, the release's cover version of Jo Stafford's [...] "A Sunday Kind of Love" [...] became a Top 5 hit on the Billboard country music chart. Also in 1988, McEntire founded Starstruck Entertainment, which controlled her management, booking, publishing, promotion, publicity, accounting, ticket sales, and fan club administration. The company would eventually expand into managing a horse farm, jet charter service, trucking, construction, and book publishing.|$|E
500|$|In May 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, {{the fleet}} commander, planned to lure {{a portion of}} the British fleet away from its bases and destroy it with the entire High Seas Fleet. For the planned operation, Regensburg, {{commanded}} by Commodore Paul Heinrich, was assigned to serve {{as the leader of the}} torpedo boat flotillas that screened for the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group. The squadron left the Jade roadstead at 02:00 on 31 May, bound for the waters of the Skagerrak. The main body of the fleet followed an hour and a half later. At around 15:30, the cruiser screens of the I Scouting Group and the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron engaged; Regensburg was on the disengaged side of the German formation, but steamed to reach the head of the line of battle. As <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>moving</b> into position, the opposing battlecruisers opened fire; Regensburg was some [...] from the German battlecruisers, still on the disengaged side. Her crew noted that the British shells were falling well over their targets, which placed Regensburg in greater danger than the battlecruisers at which the British were aiming. By 17:10, Regensburg had reached the head of the line, and the battlecruiser [...] fired several salvos at her, mistaking her for a battlecruiser.|$|E
