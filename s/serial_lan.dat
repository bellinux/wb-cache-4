5000|$|Complete IPMI 2.0 implementation, {{providing}} sensor {{and health}} monitoring, alerting, event logging <b>Serial</b> over <b>LAN,</b> et cetera. This firmware utilizes Linux 2.6.|$|R
5000|$|... v2.0, {{published}} on February 14, 2004: added features including <b>Serial</b> over <b>LAN,</b> Group Managed Systems, Enhanced Authentication, Firmware Firewall, and VLAN Support ...|$|R
50|$|In June 2017, PLATINUM became {{notable for}} {{exploiting}} the <b>serial</b> over <b>LAN</b> (SOL) capabilities of Intel's Active Management Technology to perform data exfiltration.|$|R
5000|$|Remotely {{redirect}} the system's I/O via console redirection through <b>serial</b> over <b>LAN</b> (SOL). This feature supports remote troubleshooting, remote repair, software upgrades, {{and similar}} processes.|$|R
50|$|In June 2017, the PLATINUM {{cybercrime}} group became {{notable for}} exploiting the <b>serial</b> over <b>LAN</b> (SOL) capabilities of AMT to perform data exfiltration of stolen documents.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Serial</b> Over <b>LAN</b> (SOL) is a {{mechanism}} {{that enables the}} input and output of the serial port of a managed system to be redirected over IP.|$|R
50|$|HICOM 300 uses Siemens {{developed}} software (rebranding involved) COMTES or COMWIN to give {{full access}} to configure the system.The interface between COMWIN and HICOM can be <b>LAN,</b> <b>serial,</b> or modem.The <b>LAN</b> access uses IP protocol with a built in setting (IP:192.0.2.3 mask:255.255.255.0 and Gateway:192.0.2.4) which must be supported either by the standalone terminal, attached network or by Brad Murphy's layer 8 personnel.|$|R
50|$|Most AMT {{features}} are available OOB, regardless of PC power state. Other features require the PC {{to be powered}} up (such as console redirection via <b>serial</b> over <b>LAN</b> (SOL), agent presence checking, and network traffic filtering). Intel AMT has remote power-up capability.|$|R
50|$|Systems {{compliant}} with IPMI version 2.0 can also communicate via <b>serial</b> over <b>LAN,</b> whereby <b>serial</b> console output can be remotely viewed over the LAN. Systems implementing IPMI 2.0 typically also include KVM over IP, remote virtual media and out-of-band embedded web-server interface functionality, although strictly speaking, these lie {{outside of the}} scope of the IPMI interface standard.|$|R
50|$|Intel AMT {{is part of}} the Intel Management Engine that {{is built}} into PCs with the Intel vPro brand. Intel AMT is a set of remote {{management}} and security hardware features that let a sys-admin with AMT security privileges access system information and perform specific remote operations on the PC. These operations include remote power up/down (via wake on LAN), remote / redirected boot (via integrated device electronics redirect, or IDE-R), console redirection (via <b>serial</b> over <b>LAN),</b> and other remote management and security features.|$|R
50|$|The Genie Engine {{has several}} {{features}} that are common across all its games, including a scenario editor, campaigns, <b>LAN,</b> <b>serial</b> and TCP/IP multiplayer, background music amongst others. The engine uses an isometric tile set, unlike other real-time strategy engines {{such as the one}} used for Warcraft.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{security}} {{evaluation by}} Vassilios Ververis showed serious {{weaknesses in the}} GM45 chipset implementation. In particular, it criticized AMT for transmitting unencrypted passwords in the SMB provisioning mode when the IDE redirection and <b>Serial</b> over <b>LAN</b> features are used. It {{also found that the}} [...] "zero touch" [...] provisioning mode (ZTC) is still enabled even when the AMT appears to be disabled in BIOS. For about 60 euros, Ververis purchased from Go Daddy a certificate that is accepted by the ME firmware and allows remote [...] "zero touch" [...] provisioning of (possibly unsuspecting) machines, which broadcast their HELLO packets to would-be configuration servers.|$|R
5000|$|The conserver {{was written}} {{to be used}} with RS-232 serial wired {{multi-port}} cards. Modern day setups (generally) use separate management Ethernet networks and console servers. In some cases some form of reverse telnet or SSH connection is used; alternatively, an additional level of indirection can be interposed: the server provides a <b>Serial</b> over <b>LAN</b> service via IPMI, and a command-line utility connects to the server. This socket can then be used as a [...] "virtual reverse telnet" [...] connection. conserver is not limited to any one form of network protocol, and can handle these setups, as well as log the console output of virtual machines.|$|R
40|$|Regarding the {{embedded}} processor as the core, this study utilizes various cutting-edge {{technologies such as}} wireless LAN, USB interface, Bluetooth, multimedia, etc., to propose the design program of QT-based security monitoring system. Taking the lab environment in school as an example, this system has achieved the security monitoring, information transmission and control of certain equipment. Besides, it has cut the Linux kernel module reasonably and explored the touch screen, <b>serial</b> port, wireless <b>LAN,</b> Bluetooth, USB and other resources, thus realizing various functions, such as collection and processing of audio, video and security information and wireless communication. Thereby, users can carry out real-time monitoring for multiple locations through the wireless LAN...|$|R
40|$|Intelligent Power Management Interface (IPMI) defines common {{interfaces}} to "intelligent " hardware used {{to monitor}} a server's physical health characteristics, such as temperature, voltage, fans, power supplies and chassis. These capabilities provide information that enables system management, recovery, and asset tracking which help drive down {{the total cost of}} ownership (TCO) and increase reliability in today's HPC market. The new interfaces in IPMI v 1. 5 facilitate the management of rack-mounted HPC servers and systems in remote environment over <b>serial,</b> modem and <b>LAN</b> connections. New capabilities combined with the remote management functionality allow HPC IT managers to manage their servers and systems, regardless of system health, power state or supported communication media. IPMI compliant servers essentially eliminate the need for external hardware to perform the same function, thus saving costs. This paper will introduce the specification, the benefits of IPMI with respect to HPC and other clusters and how it could be used to generate alarms to a monitoring system before hardware failures become severe enough to cause cluster failure. ...|$|R
