5|$|Following its {{exit from}} {{bankruptcy}} protection, JAL began several new partnerships within the oneworld alliance. The transpacific {{joint venture between}} JAL and American commenced in April 2011. JAL formed Jetstar Japan, a low-cost carrier joint venture with Qantas subsidiary Jetstar Airways, in July. In 2012, JAL and British Airways parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) <b>submitted</b> <b>applications</b> to the Japanese government and European Union respectively in seeking a joint venture business operation for flights between Japan and Europe. Finnair applied to join the JV with IAG in July 2013, in conjunction with JAL starting new nonstop service to Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|When the United States entered World War II, the {{military}} {{was in need of}} nurses. Hispanic female nurses wanted to volunteer for service, however they were not accepted into the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many women went to work in the factories which produced military equipment. As more Hispanic men joined the armed forces, a need for bilingual nurses became apparent and the Army started to recruit Hispanic nurses. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses. Thirteen women <b>submitted</b> <b>applications,</b> were interviewed, underwent physical examinations, and were accepted into the ANC. Eight of these nurses were assigned to the Army Post at San Juan, Puerto Rico where they were valued for their bilingual abilities. Five nurses were assigned to work at the hospital at Camp Tortuguero in Puerto Rico. One of these nurses was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler.|$|E

25|$|In November 2004, former {{president}} Ange-Félix Patassé, {{who was living}} in exile in Togo following his 2003 ousting by Bozizé, was nominated as the presidential candidate of his party, the Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People (Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain, MLPC).

25|$|That {{same year}} the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) decided to accept Puerto Rican nurses so that Army {{hospitals}} {{would not have}} to deal with the language barriers.

Eight of these nurses were assigned to the Army Post at San Juan, where they were valued for their bilingual abilities. Five nurses were assigned to work at the hospital at Camp Tortuguero, Puerto Rico.

Fifteen states expressed interest in having the pilot program and, ultimately, five states <b>submitted</b> <b>applications</b> to be considered for HIP. Hampden County, Massachusetts was selected as the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) site. HIP is designed to take place from August 2010 to April 2013 with the actual operation phase of the pilot program scheduled to last 15 months, from November 2011 to January 2013.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{candidates}} <b>submitted</b> <b>applications</b> to CENI by {{the deadline}} of 15 January: Gnassingbé as the RPT candidate, Jean-Pierre Fabre as the UFC candidate, Agboyibo as the CAR candidate, Kodjo as the OBUTS candidate, Adjamagbo-Johnson as the CDPA candidate, Nicolas Lawson as the PRR candidate, Yamgnane as the Sursaut candidate, and Kagbara as the PDP candidate. The candidates were predictable except for Fabre, whose designation as the UFC candidate was considered very surprising. UFC President Olympio, whose candidacy {{had long been}} announced and expected, was in the United States at the time, suffering from backache, {{and was unable to}} travel to Togo to undergo the necessary medical review for his candidacy. Consequently, the UFC submitted the candidacy of its Secretary-General, Jean-Pierre Fabre.|$|E
25|$|In early 2015 it was {{announced}} that the bj league and NBL would merge to form a new league to commence in the new 2016–17 season. In April 2015 both the Lightning and Dragonflies <b>submitted</b> <b>applications</b> to enter the new league (later named the B.League). However, only the NBL's Dragonflies received support from the Hiroshima Prefectural Basketball Association. Supporting documentation from the local association was a requirement for acceptance into the new league. The Lightning lodged an appeal with the Japan Sports Arbitration Agency in June, which was withdrawn soon after following the new league's administration agreeing to reconsider the Lightning's application. Ultimately, it {{was announced}} on 16 July that the Lightning was refused entry into the league, the only team out of the 46 active teams across the two leagues to be denied entry. The Dragonflies were assigned to the league's second division.|$|E

25|$|In November 2016 the European Commission {{proposed}} {{a system for}} an electronic authorisation of visa-exempt third country nationals called ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System). Under the proposal the ETIAS will be managed by the European Border and Coast Guard in cooperation with national authorities. Foreign visitors {{will be required to}} submit personal data in advance and pay a processing fee (fee is waived for children). <b>Submitted</b> <b>applications</b> will be processed automatically by checking against databases and watch lists and in case no issues appear the authorisation should be issued immediately. The authorisation request may be processed for up 72 hours in which case the applicant must be notified if the authorisation request was issued or refused or if additional information is required. In case the authorisation is refused the applicant will have the right of appeal in accordance with national law of the member state. The authorisation will be valid for five years. A travel authorisation with limited territorial validity may be issued only exceptionally. It is imagined as a system similar to the ESTA system of the United States and the ETA system of Canada. It is expected to enter into operation on 1 January 2020. The cost for developing ETIAS is estimated at EUR 212,1 million.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, National Grid began public {{consultations}} over {{plans to}} build a line of electricity pylons, by one of two routes between Hinkley Point and Avonmouth. The plans attracted local opposition. The first consultation process ended in January 2010. They had proposed that each pylon would be [...] high: the consultation was only in respect of preferences between two alternate routes, not the size nor the use of large pylons. The proposed line, which is due to open by September 2017, will transmit electricity at 400 kilovolts from the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Électricité de France has begun public consultations in respect of the local infrastructure needed for the construction programme to build Hinkley Point C; but, as of January 2011, has not <b>submitted</b> <b>applications</b> for consents for the proposed power stations. It has, however, submitted a planning application for preliminary site preparation works, which it states that it will undo should consents for the power stations be refused.|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, Petitioner Palazzolo and {{business}} associates, {{operating under the}} name Shore Gardens, Inc. (SGI) purchased three undeveloped parcels on the Rhode Island coast. [...] Petitioner Palazzolo eventually became sole shareholder of SGI, and began efforts to develop the land by submitting parcelling plans to the town. [...] As the land required significant filling, Petitioner Palazzolo <b>submitted</b> <b>applications</b> for permits from the Division of Harbors and Rivers, which were denied. [...] In 1978, Palazzolo acquired all of SGI's properties. [...] In 1983, Petitioner Palazzolo again attempted to develop the land, submitting several permits, {{all of which were}} rejected.

2500|$|After {{an initial}} [...] of <b>submitted</b> <b>applications,</b> short-listed {{candidates}} at Oxford and Cambridge {{are invited to}} a series of tests and interviews with the academics who may eventually be teaching them. Oxbridge interviews have acquired something of a mythical status in the British media, becoming a source of various humorous anecdotes and urban legends due to the perception that the interviews themselves are bizarre, intimidating and/or frequently involve unusual questions and requests. Interview prompts reportedly used in the past include [...] "Do you think you're clever?" [...] (from a Law interview at Cambridge) and [...] "Talk about a light bulb" [...] (from an Engineering interview at Oxford). Admissions staff have said that there are no correct answers to such questions, but that applicants are assessed on their ability to approach unfamiliar, open-ended problems and discuss them articulately, incorporating new ideas and evidence as the discussion progresses. Candidates are also expected to show a willingness to challenge their own preconceptions about the topics under discussion, as well as the preconceptions adopted by their interviewers. This is essentially a test of whether the student would do well under the tutorial/supervision system at Oxford and Cambridge, and a poor performance at interview may negate an otherwise strong application.|$|E
