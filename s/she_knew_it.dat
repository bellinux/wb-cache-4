5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E

500|$|Traveling {{through the}} Weird Woods, Luna sings a magic song {{to clear a}} patch of thick fog in their path, yet is not sure how <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would work. The group is {{surrounded}} by a horde of monsters, and are defended by a traveling warrior named Laike. Finding Alex's quest to become Dragonmaster humorous, Laike nonetheless wishes him and his friends luck as they leave the forest. Arriving at Saith, the group meets Nash, a magician-in-training from a prestigious magic school who needs transport back to his home, and joins the group on a boat to the eastern continent. Unlike the original Sega CD version, Luna continues with Alex rather than stay behind to give her a bigger role in the plot. After arriving in the port town of Meribia, Ramus leaves the group to become a salesman at his own shop, {{while the rest of the}} team travels to the floating city of Vane to meet Ghaleon, a former adventurer who traveled with Dyne before his death. Ghaleon sends Alex and Luna on a quest to stop a false Dragonmaster from harassing a village where he meets Jessica, a priestess and daughter of the legendary hero [...] "Hell" [...] Mel. Returning to Vane, Ghaleon tells Alex he wants to see Quark to discuss his future as Dragonmaster, with Luna joining them on a return trip to Burg. After arriving at the dragon cave, Ghaleon and Quark reminisce before Ghaleon cryptically asks whether Luna is [...] "the one from back then". Upon hearing an affirmation, Ghaleon's mood changes, and suddenly transforms into a more sinister form, The Magic Emperor, who turns Quark to energy and kidnaps Luna, remarking that he will now use her in his quest to rule the world.|$|E
500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from her desk and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} groups {{set off the}} weather deteriorated, as had been forecast, but the first party {{successfully}} navigated to the Curran shelter where they dug snow from the door and spent the night. The leader of the second party, worried {{that they would not}} be able to find the shelter in white-out conditions – <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> could become completely covered in snow – decided on a forced bivouac out on the plateau. The site she chose was at a slight dip at the head of the Feith Buidhe burn about [...] east of Lochan Buidhe and the Curran shelter. Beattie was not worried about the missing people because he assumed they had gone to some other shelter.|$|E

Cristina said she [...] "thought this was what she wanted." [...] He wanted her to say <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was what she wanted, so he left her in the chapel. Cristina then returned to their apartment and discovered Burke had left, taking with him the things that meant something to only him (his trumpet, his Eugene Foote collection, his grandmother's picture, and his lucky scrub cap), leaving Cristina devastated.|$|E
2500|$|... "Insatiable", the album's title track, {{served as}} the lead single upon its release on 1 November. Upon release, the track {{garnered}} heavy critical praise. Co-written with Guy Chambers and produced by newcomer Ricci Riccardi, BBC said the song [...] "showcases a harder, guitar-led sound for the pop singer." [...] It {{is said to be}} [...] "ballsy and Eighties-influenced", receiving comparisons to The Bangles. Nadine said <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> {{was going to be a}} hit as soon as they finished it, because it was so catchy. She said, [...] "I just knew we had something special when we wrote that song." [...] A clip of the single appeared on Nadine's website on 6 September. The song received its official world premiere on [...] on 10 September. The music video, directed by Wayne Isham, was filmed in Los Angeles. The video premiered on 3 October. The single entered the UK singles chart at number 26 selling 11,392 copies. [...] "Insatiable" [...] entered the Irish top 50 at number 20.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Ryan {{requested}} early release, {{partly on}} the grounds that his wife had terminal cancer and was given only six months to live, and partly based on a request that some of the charges of which he had been found guilty and sentenced should be vacated in light of a Supreme Court ruling that was alleged to have affected the legitimacy of those convictions by the prosecution. On December 21, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer denied Governor Ryan's request. Judge Pallmeyer was sympathetic to Governor Ryan's plight, saying <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be very unpleasant for Governor Ryan to be separated from his wife, and not released until long after his wife's death. However, the judge noted that the decision to convict and to sentence, depriving an individual of liberty or life, is never taken lightly, and that there were many more cases where the defendant or incarcerated convict is facing an equally serious or more serious position.|$|E
2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had [...] "something to show her". She said that he led her to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them about this because I was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E
2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, {{she felt as if she}} was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua played an important role in her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E
