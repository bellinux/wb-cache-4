25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of check valve) opens and allows water from a reservoir tank to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped inverted <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> starts the toilet's siphonic action. The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the <b>siphon</b> <b>tube.</b> The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphonic action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E
50|$|To {{the left}} of the four {{spillway}} gates are three <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes.</b> These were designed for the management of the lake level under normal river flow and the spillway gates were to be used in only extreme conditions. The design of the <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> was faulty: The flow of water was supposed to be stopped by a blast of air, but this never worked properly - resulting in the spillway gates to be used for lake level control.|$|R
50|$|<b>Siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> are a basic {{implement}} used in irrigation {{to transfer}} water over a barrier (such as {{the bank of}} a raised irrigation canal), using the siphon principle.|$|R
50|$|The main {{benefit of}} <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> {{is that they}} are {{relatively}} inexpensive, and do not require any engineering to put into place (unlike say a sluice gate embedded in the bank of the canal). They are easily relocated from one bay or field to another as the required water level is reached.|$|R

5000|$|The siphon {{recorder}} {{works on the}} principle of a d'Arsonval galvanometer. A light coil of wire is suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet so it can turn freely. [...] The coil is attached via two wire linkages to the metal plate siphon support, which pivots on a horizontal suspension thread. From this plate a narrow glass <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> hangs down vertically with its end almost touching a paper tape. The paper tape is pulled by motorized rollers at a constant speed under the siphon pen. Ink is drawn up from a reservoir into the tube by siphon action and comes out a tiny orifice in the end of the <b>siphon</b> <b>tube,</b> drawing a line down the moving paper tape. In order not to affect the motion of the coil, the <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> itself never touches the paper, only the ink.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{operated by}} simply filling the tube with water (by immersion in the canal, or other means), keeping one {{end in the}} canal {{and with the other}} end sealed, placing it in the area to be irrigated. The seal can then be removed and the water will siphon transferring the water from the submerged higher end to the lower end.|$|R
50|$|For {{tubes of}} up to 150mm {{diameter}} and several meters long, this is all easily undertaken by one person without any other tools. An effective seal is produced using a hand - with a rapid enough action there will be sufficient water in the tube to start the siphon effect. Larger capacity <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> may have mechanical means of sealing the ends, and allow for a pump {{to be used to}} prime the tube.|$|R
5000|$|In 1925 and 1926, the SAR placed twelve Class 15C {{locomotives}} in service, {{built by}} Baldwin Locomotive Works and conforming to SAR requirements {{as far as}} practicable, but also incorporating the latest American railway engineering practices. They introduced several new features to the SAR, such as top feeds to the boiler, self-cleaning smokeboxes, Sellar’s drifting valves and grease lubrication. Their fireboxes were equipped with <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> to support the brick arch and to improve water circulation. The locomotive’s size quickly earned it the nickname Big Bill.|$|R

50|$|Mosquitoes of {{the genus}} Mansonia {{complete}} their life cycle only {{in the presence of}} aquatic plants such as Pistia, laying their eggs under the leaves. The emerging larvae fall into the water within 24 hours and stay attached to the Pistia root (which is rich with air sacs) {{with the help of a}} serrated <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> for respiration and develop into pupa. The pupa is also attached to the pistia root with the serrated piercing <b>siphon</b> <b>tube.</b> The egg to adult mosquito development is completed within 7 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{plumbing}} is key. The {{water in}} the toilet bowl is connected to a pipe shaped like an upside-down U.

50|$|Mansonia {{mosquitoes}} are big, {{black or}} brown mosquitoes with sparkling on their wings and legs. They breed in ponds and lakes containing certain aquatic plants, especially the floating type like Pistia stratiotes and water hyacinth. The eggs are laid in star-shaped clusters on the undersurface of leaves of these plants. The larvae and pupae are found {{attached to the}} rootlets of these plants by their <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes.</b> They obtain their air supply from these rootlets. When about to become adult, these pupae come {{to the surface of}} water and the fully formed adults emerge and escape. The control of Mansonoia mosquitoes is easy by removal or destruction of the aquatic host plants by herbicides.|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the spray}} polymerization of sodium acrylate were investigated. The technique {{in which the}} heat of polymerization was used for solvent removal showed better energy efficiency than the solution or emulsion polymerization methods for preparing sodium polyacrylate. The monomer solution was injected into the nozzle of the spray machine via a venturi effect to siphon up the solution. Two <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> feeding through two control valves into a mixing chamber before the spray operation resulted in separate feeds of a sodium hydroxide solution and a mixture of acrylic acid, water, and a catalyst. These two feeds generated the heat of neutralization of sodium acrylate. This heat raised {{the temperature of the}} monomer solution to the reaction temperature, thereby initiating the exothermic polymerization reaction. Theoretical calculations of these energy sources were compared with the energy required to give a dry product. The results revealed that the energy cost for spray polymerization was 4783. 5 kJ kg- 1, whereas the energy cost was 7830. 4 kJ kg- 1 for the conventional system. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1940s, Gordon and Billie Bettles {{acquired}} an option to buy the T&T Ranch from the Pacific Coast Borax Company. When they moved in, they were the only inhabitants in the area and most of the trees and grapevines had died. Gordon and Billie Bettles moved a structure, that used to house railway workers, from Death Valley Junction to the farm to use as their home. Billie erected a garden around the house. Crops that were cultivated included alfalfa and corn and an irrigation system using <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> and diesel engines was used to hydrate them. Those crops were sold in the area and in Las Vegas. A few years after Gordon and Billie Bettles had acquired the farm, their daughter and son-in-law, M. P. Glessner, bought five acres of land near the T&T Ranch. Their plot of land was situated at the crossing of the current SR 373 and Mecca Road. The Glessners built their house on the land in the middle of the 1950s, but Gordon and Billie Bettles obtained the land and the house thereafter. They moved to the house and started the construction of another building nearby.|$|R

50|$|This is a {{technique}} conceived and developed in France, which works like the system of isolated drainage wells but overcoming the inconvenience of installing a pump for each well. Once motion is triggered in the <b>siphon</b> <b>tube,</b> without the entry of air into the loop, {{the flow of water}} is uninterrupted. For this reason, the two ends of the <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> are submerged in the water of two permanent storage tanks. This drain is created vertically starting from the campaign level but can also be sub-vertical or inclined. The diameter of the well can vary from 100 to 300 mm;. Inside a PVC pipe is placed or a perforated or microperforated steel pipe, filled with draining material. The siphon drain in this way carries off drainage water by gravity without the need for drainage pumps or pipes linking the bottom of each well. This system proves to be economically advantageous and relatively simple to set up, but requires a programme of controls and maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the rubber}} bulb {{dispenser}} which primarily moved {{air with a}} small amount of fluid, modern spray bottles use a positive displacement pump that acts directly on the fluid. The pump draws liquid up a <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> from the bottom of the bottle and forces it through a nozzle. Depending on the sprayer, the nozzle may or may not be adjustable, so as to select between squirting a stream, aerosolizing a mist, or dispensing a spray.|$|E

50|$|A Flit gun {{consists}} of a pneumatic pump cylinder with a hand-operated piston to force air through an air nozzle in the front. Below {{the front of the}} pneumatic tube hangs a cylindrical container designed to act as a reservoir for liquid insecticide, this reservoir being set at 90 degrees to the pneumatic tube. In early versions, the reservoir is permanently secured to the pump and equipped with a removable, gasketed screw cap for filling. In later, improved versions, the insecticide reservoir is secured to the pump with a coarse screw fitting and a seal of cork composite or gasket paper, so that it can readily be unscrewed for filling. A <b>siphon</b> <b>tube</b> extends from the pump cylinder downward into the reservoir and {{the upper end of the}} siphon is positioned in front of a nozzle on the air pump. When a jet of high-velocity air exits the pump and streams across end of the <b>siphon</b> <b>tube,</b> it lowers the pressure in the siphon, drawing insecticide upward from the reservoir, which then atomizes the liquid as it is entrained in the air jet. With each vigorous forward stroke of the pump handle a burst of spray is produced, similar to that of a modern aerosol spray can.|$|E
5000|$|The {{father and}} son researchers, Ramette and Ramette, {{successfully}} siphoned carbon dioxide under air pressure in 2011 and concluded that molecular cohesion is not required for the operation of a siphon but that: [...] "The basic explanation of siphon action is that, once the tube is filled, the flow is initiated by the greater pull of gravity on the fluid on the longer side compared with that on the short side. This creates a pressure drop throughout the <b>siphon</b> <b>tube,</b> {{in the same sense}} that 'sucking' on a straw reduces the pressure along its length {{all the way to the}} intake point. The ambient atmospheric pressure at the intake point responds to the reduced pressure by forcing the fluid upwards, sustaining the flow, just as in a steadily sucked straw in a milkshake." ...|$|E
50|$|The Cochituate Aqueduct {{begins at}} a {{gatehouse}} {{on the east}} side of Lake Cochituate, north of Massachusetts Route 30. It passes roughly eastward, eventually running along the town line between Wayland and Natick. It eventually turns southeasterly, skirting around the east side of Morse Pond in Wellesley shortly after passing under Massachusetts Route 9. It again turns east, passing north of Wellesley Town Hall before turning northeasterly through the Hunnewell Field athletic complex and toward Indian Spring Park, where it again turns east. It passes under Walnut and Cedar Streets in eastern Wellesley before descending to cross the Charles River into Newton on a stone bridge. There is a commemorative plaque in a small open park facing Cedar Street. The aqueduct crossing of the river is via an iron <b>siphon</b> <b>tube,</b> whose original control houses on both sides have been demolished.|$|E
500|$|Between 1735 and 1758, the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first {{classified}} insects, {{doing so}} {{on the basis of}} their wing structure. One of the seven orders into which he divided them was [...] "Aptera", meaning wingless, a group in which as well as fleas, he included spiders, woodlice and myriapods. It wasn't until 1810 that the French zoologist Pierre André Latreille reclassified the insects {{on the basis of their}} mouthparts as well as their wings, splitting Aptera into Thysanura (silverfish), Anoplura (sucking lice) and Siphonaptera (fleas), at the same time separating off the arachnids and crustaceans into their own subphyla. The group's name, Siphonaptera, is zoological Latin from the Greek <b>siphon</b> (a <b>tube)</b> and aptera (wingless).|$|R

50|$|Francesco de' Medici's heir, {{his brother}} Ferdinando, was persuaded {{to part with}} the Francini {{brothers}} in 1597 by his niece Maria, married to Henri IV of France. Their first project, begun in 1598, was to provide fountains, grottoes, waterworks and, above all, water-driven automata for the series of garden terraces at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The main feature {{there was a great}} fountain, from which water was channeled and conducted in <b>siphon</b> <b>tubes</b> to the reservoir in the vaulted area that supported the terrace. From there, through a series of secondary tubes, the water had sufficient head to operate grotto fountains and animate the elaborate automata that were a prized feature of Francini jeux d'eau. The upper grottoes on the third terrace opened from a Doric gallery and featured a dragon, a water organ and Neptune; on the next level, the Grotto of Hercules was flanked by two further grottoes; that on one side was devoted to Perseus and Andromeda, in which the delicately counterbalanced hero was made to descend from the ceiling by the hidden weight of water and slay a dragon that arose from the basin, and on the other a Grotto of Orpheus. The only trace of these features, whose high maintenance requirements cut their careers short when the court moved permanently to Fontainebleau, are in some engravings by Abraham Bosse, apparently derived from Francini drawings. The waterworks and automata at Saint-Germain-en-Laye were the most elaborate such things that had been seen in France up to that time, and Alexandre Francini's engravings of the brothers' works served to mark a distinct stage in the importation and transformation of Italian features {{in the creation of the}} French formal garden (Adams 1979:46) and far beyond: cast-iron versions of Francini's two-basin Fontaine rustique, dripping with stony icicles, were familiar features again in Victorian gardens.|$|R
