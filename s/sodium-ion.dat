25|$|At high {{concentration}} (0.3–3 µM), the <b>sodium-ion</b> channels are constantly activated, transmission of action potentials is suppressed, leading to non-excitable target cells or paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Aconitine binds to the {{receptor}} at the neurotoxin {{binding site}} 2 on the alpha-subunit {{of the channel}} protein. This binding results in a <b>sodium-ion</b> channel that stays open longer. Aconitine suppresses the conformational change in the <b>sodium-ion</b> channel from the active state to the inactive state. The membrane stays depolarized due to the constant sodium influx (which is 10-1000 fold greater than the potassium efflux). As a result, the membrane cannot be repolarized. The binding of aconitine to the channel also leads to the channel to change conformation from the inactive state to the active state at a more negative voltage.|$|E

Normally, the sodium channels close very rapidly, but the depolarization of the membrane potential causes the opening (activation) of potassium channels and potassium efflux, which results in repolarization of the membrane potential.|$|E

It is possible to tune the Na-ion insertion potentials of MXenes by changing the transition metal and surface functional groups. V2CTx MXene has been successfully applied as a positive electrode material for <b>sodium-ion</b> storage. Porous MXene-based paper electrodes have also been reported, which exhibited high volumetric capacities and stable cycling performance, demonstrating that MXenes are promising for sodium-based energy storage devices where size matters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{literature}} {{has noted that}} [...] "inositol" [...] is sometimes perceived as sweet and/or salty. In general, the inositols will be perceived as sweet due to their equat-trans-hydroxyl pairs. The muco-inositol isomer is perceived as both sweet and salty. It is perceived as salty due to its pair of diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pairs. This pair of hydroxyl groups can form a dimer with the diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pair of the hydrated <b>sodium-ion</b> receptor.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{electrolytes}} generally contain halogens, {{which are}} toxic.

Not only the permeability for potassium ions but also the permeability for calcium ions increases {{as a result of}} the depolarization of the membrane. A calcium influx takes place. The increase of the calcium concentration in the cell stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic membrane to open the sodium-channels there, generating a new action potential.|$|E

Lithium-sulphur batteries offer 250 Wh/kg. <b>Sodium-ion</b> batteries promise 400 Wh/kg with only minimal expansion/contraction during charge/discharge and a very high surface area.

The key advantage is the abudance and low cost of potassium in comparison with lithium, which makes potassium batteries a promising candidate for large scale batteries such as household energy storage and electric vehicles. Another advantage of potassium-ion battery over lithium-ion battery is the possibility for charging faster.
