5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in what is today South Dakota for several {{thousand}} years. The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC. Between 500AD and 800AD, a <b>semi-nomadic</b> people known as the Mound Builders lived {{in central and eastern}} South Dakota. In the 14th century, the Crow Creek Massacre occurred, in which several hundred men, women, and children were killed near the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|Hananu and Rashid al-Tali'a {{cooperated with}} Barakat {{in an attempt}} to unify {{northern}} Syria's rebel groups into a single resistance movement against the French, in allegiance with Faisal's government in Damascus. Hananu also formed an alliance with the <b>semi-nomadic</b> Mawali tribesmen of the Aleppo region. Following the battle at Harim, Hananu, with the assistance of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, had collected up to 2,000 gold pounds in funds, and 1,700 rifles for the 680 men in his iṣābā, who he and his aides trained.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the {{vicinity}} of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were <b>semi-nomadic,</b> most likely living off edible bulbs and large mammals such as mastodons and giant bison. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the Latgawa Native American tribe, who called the peak Al-wiya. They probably used the mountain for gathering acorns and hunting black-tailed deer and small birds, animals which are still abundant there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, they encountered the Hän people, <b>semi-nomadic</b> hunters and fishermen who lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} known {{to live in}} the Catlins, Māori of the Kāti Mamoe, Waitaha, and Kāi Tahu iwi (tribes), merged via {{marriage}} and conquest into the iwi now known as Kāi Tahu. Archaeological evidence of human presence dates back to approximately 1350 AD. The area's inhabitants were <b>semi-nomadic,</b> travelling from Stewart Island/Rakiura in the south and inland to Central Otago. They generally dwelt near river mouths for easy access to the best food resources. In legend, the Catlins forests further inland were inhabited by Maeroero (wild giants).|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} high desert region are the Northern Paiute people. These Native Americans were once <b>semi-nomadic</b> hunter-gatherers who relied on nuts, roots, seeds, berries, and eggs, and animals such as deer, pronghorn, geese, quail, rabbits, and bear, following their food to high and low elevations depending {{on the time of}} year. They make sandals, traps, and fishing nets, and weave baskets. Made out of sagebrush, willow, tule plant, Indian hemp, and sumac fibers, the baskets are tight enough to carry water. Archaeological evidence from near Fort Rock has shown that people wove baskets in the area at least 9,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{was largely}} forested in this period; {{widespread}} forest clearance {{did not occur}} in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from {{the vicinity of the}} White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the river, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or <b>semi-nomadic</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Geologically the Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{was once}} {{part of a large}} and shallow sea that covered most of southern California. As the San Joaquin Hills rose and river sediments were deposited, land gradually emerged to form the present-day Orange County coast. Sulphur Creek is located in a crumpled, hilly area {{in the southern part of}} this range, formed differently from the continuous mountain chain to the north. Historically, being south of Aliso Creek, the Sulphur Creek watershed was part of the territory of the <b>semi-nomadic</b> Acjachemen Indian group, conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the 17th and 18th centuries and renamed the Juaneño by them.|$|E
5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America among Native Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. The Iroquois were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes were significantly less advanced than the Mississippian culture that had preceded them. The tribes were <b>semi-nomadic,</b> used stone tools rather than copper, and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting {{for at least a}} century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans. They achieved this goal for several decades. During the war, the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley to the south and west. They kept control of the area for hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or <b>semi-nomadic</b> way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E
5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} <b>semi-nomadic,</b> then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Gaza enjoyed {{demographic}} {{and economic growth}} again when the local Canaanite population began to resettle Tell as-Sakan around 2500, but in 2250, the area experienced a total collapse of civilization {{and all of the}} cities in the Gaza region were abandoned by the 23rd century BCE. In its place emerged <b>semi-nomadic</b> cultures with pastoral camps made up of rustic family dwellings which continued to exist throughout the Early Bronze Age IV. An urban center known as Tell al-Ajjul began to arise inland along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, Tell as-Sakan was the southernmost locality in Canaanite territory, serving as a fort, and by 1650 BCE, while Egypt was occupied by the Canaanite Hyksos, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. This city was destroyed about a century later, when the Hyksos were routed from Egypt. Egypt settled Gaza once again and Tell al-Ajjul rose {{for the third time in}} the 15th century BCE. The city finally ceased to exist in the 14th century, at the end of the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|Human {{habitation}} on the Santa Ana River {{dates back}} 9,000 to 12,000 years ago, {{close to the}} early stages of the Holocene period. The first Native Americans to live in the area were nomadic tribes that traveled from place to place, grazing animals on fertile grasslands and gathering fruits and seeds for food. The ancestors of these early people originated from the Shoshone and Uto-Aztecan people of the northwestern United States. Eventually, the human population of the watershed reached a peak of about 15,000. About 8,000 years ago, the climate experienced a change becoming more arid and the originally nomadic tribes began to stay in individual places longer, becoming <b>semi-nomadic.</b> However, they did not establish agriculture, nor did they raise animals or live in villages. Like many Native American tribes in California, acorns were a staple food of many of the inland valley people. People closer to the ocean often fished and hunted small animals, often from tide pools and coastal stream areas, for food.|$|E
5|$|The Globular Amphora {{culture was}} the next major Neolithic culture. It {{originated}} in the Polish lowlands {{during the first half}} of 4th millennium BC, lasted to about 2400 BCE in parallel with the Funnelbeaker culture, and is named after the bulging shape of its representative pottery. They specialized in breeding domestic animals and lived in a semi-settled state, seeking optimal pastures and moving as needed. This <b>semi-nomadic</b> lifestyle was probably necessitated by the poor condition of the soils, by that time depleted and rendered infertile because of the preceding centuries of forest burning and extensive exploitation. Globular Amphora were the first culture in Poland known for utilizing the domesticated horse, and swine became important as the source of food. Ritual animal, especially cattle burial sites, often with two or more individuals buried together and supplied with objects as strange as drums have been discovered, but their role is not well understood. Globular Amphora people were involved in the north-south amber trade. Their megalithic burials included ceramics, stone tools and ornamental gifts.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} in the San Juan Basin were hunter-gatherers: the Archaic–Early Basketmaker people. These small bands descended from nomadic Clovis big-game hunters who arrived in the Southwest around 10,000 BC. More than 70 campsites from this period, carbon-dated to the period 7000–1500 BC and mostly {{consisting}} of stone chips and other leavings, were found in Atlatl Cave and elsewhere within Chaco Canyon, {{with at least one}} of the sites located on the canyon floor near an exposed arroyo. The Archaic–Early Basketmaker people were nomadic or <b>semi-nomadic</b> hunter-gatherers who over time began making baskets to store gathered plants. By the end of the period, some people cultivated food. Excavation of their campsites and rock shelters has revealed that they made tools, gathered wild plants, and killed and processed game. Slab-lined storage cists indicate a change from a wholly nomadic lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Nullarbor, {{considered}} by Europeans {{to be almost}} uninhabitable, {{was used by the}} <b>semi-nomadic</b> Aborigines, the Spinifex and Wangai peoples.|$|E
25|$|Groups of nomadic and <b>semi-nomadic</b> itinerants found {{mainly in}} central and western Anatolia. They speak an argot {{of their own and}} follow the Alevi faith.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the National Commission for Denotified, Nomadic and <b>Semi-Nomadic</b> Tribes (NCDNSNT) of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment {{recommended}} that same reservations as available to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes {{be extended to}} around 110million people of denotified, nomadic or <b>semi-nomadic</b> tribes in India; the commission further {{recommended that}} {{the provisions of the}} Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 be applicable to these tribes also. Today, many governmental and non-governmental bodies are involved in the betterment of these denotified tribes through various schemes and educational programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture in}} Jämtland {{has been marked}} by the stages in human development; the hunting-gathering stage, the <b>semi-nomadic</b> herding stage, the fully {{agricultural}} stage and the modern technological stage.|$|E
25|$|The Numidians and Moors {{belonged to}} the race from which the Berbers are descended. The {{translated}} meaning of Numidian is Nomad and indeed the people were <b>semi-nomadic</b> until the reign of Masinissa of the Massyli tribe.|$|E
25|$|From the canyon, a {{hiking trail}} {{along the ridge}} of the Rakitnica canyon drops 800m below, to the famous village of Lukomir. The village is the only {{remaining}} traditional <b>semi-nomadic</b> Bosniak mountain village in Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} {{explanations for the}} origins of the present conflict. One explanation involves the land disputes between <b>semi-nomadic</b> livestock herders and those who practice sedentary agriculture. Water access has also been identified as a major source of the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Negev Bedouin {{used to be}} nomadic {{and later}} also <b>semi-nomadic</b> Arabs who live by rearing {{livestock}} in the deserts of southern Israel. The community is traditional and conservative, with a well-defined value system that directs and monitors behaviour and interpersonal relations.|$|E
25|$|Goguryeo {{used its}} {{military}} {{to protect and}} exploit <b>semi-nomadic</b> peoples, who served as vassals, foot soldiers, or slaves, such as the Okjeo people in the northeast end of the Korean peninsula, and the Mohe people in Manchuria, who would later become the Jurchens.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern part}} of present-day Paraguay was {{occupied}} by Guaraní peoples for at least 1,000 years before the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Evidence indicates that these indigenous Americans developed a fairly sophisticated <b>semi-nomadic</b> culture characterized by numerous tribes, divided by language, who each occupied several independent multi-village communities.|$|E
25|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of the area around Ommen were probably <b>semi-nomadic</b> hunter-gatherers. Flint from the Mesolithic period found in between Ommen and Mariënberg indicates the presence of humans around 9,000 BCE, {{but there seems to}} have been hardly any cultivation or permanent settlement during this period.|$|E
25|$|Counter to {{the image}} of the Bedouin as fierce {{stateless}} nomads roving the entire region, {{by the turn of the}} 20th century, much of the Bedouin population in Palestine was settled, <b>semi-nomadic,</b> and engaged in agriculture according to an intricate system of land ownership, grazing rights, and water access.|$|E
25|$|Although largely sedentary, some {{elements}} may {{have adopted a}} <b>semi-nomadic</b> lifestyle. It has not, so far, been possible to identify archaeological sites which can be conclusively attributed to the Bastarnae. The archaeological horizons most often associated by scholars with the Bastarnae are the Zarubintsy and Poienesti-Lukashevka cultures.|$|E
25|$|And {{the main}} trend of {{settling}} non-Bedouin {{population in the}} Palestine remained until {{the last days of}} the empire. By the 20th century much of the Bedouin population was settled, <b>semi-nomadic,</b> and engaged in agriculture according to an intricate system of land ownership, grazing rights, and water access.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{when the}} Mexica {{arrived in the}} Valley of Mexico as a <b>semi-nomadic</b> tribe, they found most of the area already occupied. In roughly 1248, they first settled on Chapultepec, a hill on the west shore of Lake Texcoco, the site of {{numerous}} springs.|$|E
25|$|Hungary is {{a country}} in Central Europe whose history under this name dates to the Early Middle Ages, when the Pannonian Basin was conquered by the Hungarians (Magyars), a <b>semi-nomadic</b> people who had {{migrated}} from Eastern Europe. For {{the history of the}} area before this period, see Pannonian basin before Hungary.|$|E
25|$|After 2000 BCE, {{successive}} {{waves of}} <b>semi-nomadic</b> people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; {{among them were}} many Indo-European-speaking Indo-Iranians. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the Caspian Sea. The region {{at the time was}} referred to as Ariana.|$|E
25|$|The Bulgars were <b>semi-nomadic</b> warrior tribes {{originating}} from Central Asia whose exact ethnic origin is controversial. They spoke {{a form of}} Turkic language and during their migration westwards they absorbed other ethnic groups and cultural influences, including Hunnic, Iranian and Indo-European people. The Bulgars included the tribes of Onogurs, Utigurs and Kutrigurs, among others.|$|E
25|$|Tanana Athabaskans were <b>semi-nomadic</b> hunter-gatherers {{who moved}} {{seasonally}} {{throughout the year}} within a reasonably well-defined territory to harvest fish, bird, mammal, berry and other renewable resources. The Tanana territories generally is a mosaic of open and closed spruce forests covering the low gradient outwash slope between the Alaska Range and the flats and ridges north of the Tanana River.|$|E
25|$|CCF {{initiatives}} included encouraging northern aboriginals {{to trade}} their <b>semi-nomadic</b> lifestyles for lives in urban settings. The establishment of Kinoosao on Reindeer Lake {{provides an example}} of how CCF planners established new villages; community development processes excluded local people. Yet, in spite of considerable resistance, various incentives and coercive measures resulted in the movement of nearly all northerners to permanent settlements.|$|E
25|$|In the 7th century, the {{territory}} of modern Ukraine was {{the core of the}} state of the Bulgars (often referred to as Old Great Bulgaria) with its capital city of Phanagoria. At the end of the 7th century, most Bulgar tribes migrated in several directions and the remains of their state were absorbed by the Khazars, a <b>semi-nomadic</b> people from Central Asia.|$|E
