To be practical, an optical transistor must be cascadable, provide <b>signal</b> gain with <b>logic</b> <b>level</b> restoration, have input/output isolation and be free from critical biasing. It {{also needs to be}} compact and compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. However, almost all previous proposals or demonstrations of optical transistors fail to meet these criteria. ^ In this work, we demonstrate an all-silicon optical transistor using enhanced optical nonlinearity in two 5 -micrometer-radius silicon rings which allows a small optical signal to control a large signal. While a single device can simultaneously achieve 3 ̆e 3 dB signal gain and 3 ̆e 20 dB ON/OFF ratio, a cascaded device, can yield a signal gain of 3 ̆e 7 dB. An output ON/OFF ratio over 18 dB can be achieved with an input ON/OFF ratio of merely 2 dB. It also accomplishes fundamental logic operations like NAND or NOR on a single device, which normally require multiple electronic transistors. The optical transistor demonstrated here has many characteristics of its electronic analogue and promises to be a stepping stone for future optical computing. ^ This work will also touch base on some of the early work on realizing inverse opal photonic crystals as an efficient thin film solar cell back-reflector and on fabricating photonic crystals through a scaffold of hydrogen silsesquioxane resist. ...|$|R

50|$|To {{understand}} how the inverter operates, {{it is necessary to}} understand the current flow. If the bias current is shunted to ground (low <b>logic</b> <b>level),</b> the transistor turns off and the collector floats (high <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b> If the bias current is not shunted to ground because the input is high-z (high <b>logic</b> <b>level),</b> the bias current flows through the transistor to the emitter, switching on the transistor, and allowing the collector to sink current (low <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b> Because the output of the inverter can sink current but cannot source current, it is safe to connect the outputs of multiple inverters together to form a wired AND gate. When the outputs of two inverters are wired together, the result is a two-input NOR gate because the configuration (NOT A) AND (NOT B) is equivalent to NOT (A OR B) (per De Morgan's Theorem).|$|R
