5|$|The When Harry Met Sally... soundtrack album {{features}} American {{singer and}} pianist Harry Connick Jr. Bobby Colomby, the drummer for Blood, Sweat & Tears, {{was a friend}} of Reiner's and recommended Harry Connick Jr., giving the director a tape of the musician's music. Reiner was struck by Connick's voice and how he <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> young Frank Sinatra. The movie's soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records in July 1989. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr. with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. Connick won his first Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised Undead Nightmare as a {{model for}} {{downloadable}} content especially in its balance of content and price. Neil Davey (The Guardian) said that it was the best purchase of 2010 at its price range, but staff of the Official Xbox Magazine found the price slightly too high. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar thought that the game's concept <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ploy to make easy money without much work, but admitted how wrong and surprised he was at the game's depth. At the time of its 2010 release, the Official Xbox Magazine counted Undead Nightmare among the best downloadable content in existence. The standalone retail disc had sold two million units as of August 2011. No sales figures were released regarding the download pack itself.|$|E

25|$|Tebbetts {{was born}} in Burlington, Vermont, but {{his family moved to}} Nashua, New Hampshire a few months after he was born. Shortly thereafter, his father died, leaving his mother to raise the family.

25|$|The play {{proceeded}} {{without incident}} until the intermission between {{the fourth and}} fifth act, which occurred shortly after 11pm. During this time, the drop curtain was down, hiding the stage, and the orchestra was playing for the intermission. Some attendees in the parquet circle heard what <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> brawl behind the curtain, shouting by men, and the working of machinery; they could easily hear it above the playing of the orchestra.|$|E

25|$|The shutdown, however, {{was not for}} long. Tourism to Alaska {{began to}} increase, with many cruise ships {{stopping}} at Skagway. The scenery of the White Pass route <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great tourist draw; and the rails of the White Pass & Yukon Route were laid {{right down to the}} docks, even along them, for the former freight and cruise ship traffic. Cruise operators, remembering the attraction of the little mountain climbing trains to their passengers, pushed for a re-opening of the line as a heritage railway. The White Pass was and is perfectly positioned to sell a railroad ride through the mountains to cruise ship tourists; they do not even have to walk far.|$|E
25|$|Hines {{brought more}} {{computers}} to campus and established new programs in psychology and forestry. In 1995, despite {{a lack of}} support for a name change, the institution, considering that its regional educational mission was not reflected in its name (some thought that it <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> private school), adopted the name The University of West Alabama. Ed Roach (1998–2002) assumed the presidency in 1998 and set about integrating technology into every aspect of UWA life. He established the Technology 2000 campaign and helped establish UWA {{as one of the first}} wireless institutions in the region. Women's sports received a boost under his leadership. During this period, the UWA Softball Complex was completed. In February 2002, he stepped down from his position as president. The Board of Trustees met to choose a replacement on an interim basis from University employees David Taylor, Richard Holland, Roy Underwood, and Clemit Spruiell.|$|E
25|$|It {{is alleged}} {{sometime}} around or after 4pm, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator {{of the nearby}} Drexel Building, at 319 South Main Street, to use the top-floor restroom, which was restricted to blacks. He encountered Sarah Page, the 17-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty. The two likely knew each other at least by sight, as this building {{was the only one}} nearby with a restroom which Rowland had express permission to use, and the elevator operated by Page {{was the only one in}} the building. A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store located on the first floor of the Drexel, heard what <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> woman's scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building. The clerk went to the elevator and found Page in what he said was a distraught state. Thinking she had been assaulted, he summoned the authorities.|$|E

500|$|Cyberpunk {{was mostly}} slammed by critics, with some {{stating that the}} album was pretentious and meandering.

500|$|For the album, the Edge often [...] his {{normally}} minimalistic {{approach to}} guitar playing and his trademark chiming, delay-heavy sound, {{in favour of}} a style that incorporated more solos, dissonance, and feedback. Industrial influences and guitar effects, particularly distortion, contributed to a [...] "metallic" [...] style and [...] "harder textures". Music journalist Bill Wyman said the Edge's guitar playing on the closing track [...] "Love Is Blindness" [...] <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "dentist's drill". The Edge achieved breakthroughs {{in the writing of}} songs such as [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing" [...] and [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] by toying with various effects pedals.|$|E
500|$|Here Come the Warm Jets was {{recorded}} in twelve days at Majestic Studios in London during September 1973 by recording engineer Derek Chandler.
