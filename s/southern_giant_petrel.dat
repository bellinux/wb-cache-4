25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, chinstrap penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern fulmar {{is by far the most}} common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape petrel, Antarctic prion, Wilson's storm petrel, black-bellied storm petrel, subantarctic skua, <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel,</b> snow petrel, slender-billed prion and Antarctic tern. Kelp gull is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the king penguin, wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, Campbell albatross, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross, light-mantled albatross, northern giant petrel, Antarctic petrel, blue petrel, soft-plumaged petrel, Kerguelen petrel, white-headed petrel, fairy prion, white-chinned petrel, great shearwater, common diving petrel, south polar skua and parasitic jaeger.|$|E

50|$|The island forms {{part of the}} Frazier Islands Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.160 {{because it}} {{supports}} one of only four known breeding colonies of <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> on continental Antarctica.|$|R
50|$|Birds start {{breeding}} at {{an average}} age of ten years, and breed on islands in colonies, which they share with the <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel.</b> They breed six weeks earlier than their counterparts.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{giant petrel}} (Macronectes halli), {{also known as}} Hall's giant petrel, is a large predatory seabird of the southern oceans. Its distribution overlaps broadly, but is slightly north of, the similar <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel</b> (Macronectes giganteus).|$|E
50|$|Seabirds of {{the coast}} include {{southern}} fulmar (Fulmarus glacialoides), the scavenging <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel</b> (Macronectes giganteus), Cape petrel (Daption capense), snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea), the small Wilson's storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), the large south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki), and Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica).|$|E

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{concentrations of}} cadmium, lead, mercury and selenium in blood from {{males and females}} of the 2 sibling species of <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> the northern Macronectes halli and the southern M. giganteus, breeding sympatrically at Bird Island (South Georgia, Antarctica). Blood samples were collected in 1998 during the incubation period, from 5 November to 10 December. Between species, cadmium and lead concentrations were significantly higher for northern than for <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> which probably resulted from northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> wintering in more polluted areas (mainly on the Patagonian Shelf and Falkland Islands) compared to <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> (wintering mainly around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands). Between sexes, cadmium concentrations were significantly higher for females than for males in both species, corresponding to the more pelagic habits of females compared to the more scavenging habits of males. Lead and cadmium concentrations in circulating blood decreased significantly over the incubation period, suggesting that when breeding at Bird Island, exposure {{to the source of}} pollution had ended, and these metals had been cleared from the blood and excreted, or rapidly transferred to other tissues. Association of lead and cadmium with a common source of pollution was further corroborated by a significant positive correlation between the levels of the 2 elements found. Mercury levels were similar between the species, but showed an opposite trend between sexes, with males showing higher levels than females in northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> and the opposite was true in <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> with no changes throughout incubation. Selenium levels were similar between sexes, but significantly greater for northern than for <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels.</b> Moreover, there was {{a significant increase in the}} selenium levels over the incubation period in northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels.</b> Age of adult birds did not affect metal concentrations. Coefficients of variation of metal levels were consistently lower for northern than for <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> particularly for mercury, suggesting that the former species is more dietary specialised than the latter. Contaminant analyses, when combined with accurate information on seabird movements, obtained through geolocation or satellite tracking, help us to understand geographic variation of pollution in the marine environment...|$|R

50|$|The {{coastal areas}} of the island are home to a {{comparatively}} diverse selection of vegetation and animal life, including elephant, Weddell, and leopard seals, and Adelie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins. There are several other seabirds, including skuas and <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel,</b> that nest on this island during the summer months.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel</b> {{is one of}} {{two members}} of the genus Macronectes, which in turn, along with 14 other genera, {{comprise}} the Procellariidae family. Macronectes, also referred to as the giant petrels, along with the genus Fulmarus, Cape petrel, Antarctic petrel, and the snow petrel form a sub-family within the larger family.|$|E
40|$|In avian {{species that}} have evolved life-history {{strategies}} wherein molt and breeding overlap, there are potential {{conflicts between the}} regulatory roles of baseline prolactin and corticosterone in parental care (positive) and moult (negative). We describe seasonal patterns of hormonal secretion, moult, and parental behaviour in sibling species of <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> (Macronectes spp.) which begin moult during the incubation/ early chick-rearing stage of reproduction. With the exception of male <b>Southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> (Macronectes giganteus), prolactin secretion and moult in Northern (Macronectes halli) and female <b>Southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> conformed to those observed in all other avian species, with the initiation of moult coincident with decreases from peak prolactin levels. However, male <b>Southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> began moulting early in incubation when prolactin was increasing and had not yet peaked, which suggests a requirement of prolactin for incubation behaviour and a dissociation of prolactin from moult. Corticosterone showed little seasonal variation and no relationship with moult. When comparing prolactin, corticosterone, and moult in failed vs. active breeders, we found that failed breeding enabled a more rapid down-regulation of prolactin, thus facilitating a more rapid moult. We present specific examples of the behavioural ecology of <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> which we conclude help mediate any potential hormonal conflicts between parental care and moult...|$|R
50|$|Among {{the bird}} species {{found on the}} islands are {{chinstrap}} and gentoo penguins, <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> and skuas. <b>Southern</b> elephant seals are among the larger life forms. There are also {{a wide variety of}} lichens and mosses reported.|$|R
50|$|Other island breeders {{in smaller}} numbers are <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> grey-headed {{albatrosses}} and Kerguelen terns. Crozet blue-eyed shags, black-faced sheathbills and Eaton's pintails are resident. The smaller birds nest only at higher altitudes {{because of their}} vulnerability to rat predation at lower levels.|$|R
50|$|The <b>{{southern}}</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel</b> (Macronectes giganteus), {{also known}} as the Antarctic giant petrel, giant fulmar, stinker, and stinkpot, is a large seabird of the southern oceans. Its distribution overlaps broadly with the similar northern giant petrel, though it overall is centered slightly further south. Adults of the two species can be distinguished by the colour of their bill-tip: greenish in the southern and reddish in the northern.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel</b> is {{more likely}} to form loose colonies than the northern, both species laying a single egg in a rough nest built about 50 cm off the ground. The egg is {{incubated}} for about 60 days, once hatched the chick is brooded for 3 weeks. Chicks fledge after about 4 months, but do not achieve sexual maturity for another 6-7 years after fledging.|$|E
50|$|Seabirds include four {{species of}} {{albatross}}: black-browed albatross (Diomedea melanophris), grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma), light-mantled albatross (Phoebetria palpebrata), and wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans). There are only five species of bird that remain on {{land on the}} islands, and these include two endemic species: a race of the yellow-billed pintail duck (Anas georgica) and South Georgia pipit (Anthus antarcticus). Other birds include the <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel,</b> with sizeable colonies on Bird Island.|$|E
50|$|The {{headland}} {{has been}} identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a large breeding colony of about 23,000 pairs of chinstrap penguins. <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> also nest at the site, with 248 pairs recorded in 1966.|$|R
50|$|The island {{supports}} a breeding colony of <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> - the southernmost such colony on continental Antarctica - {{as well as}} Adélie penguins and Cape petrels.

50|$|The {{peninsula}} {{has been}} identified an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a large breeding colony of about 13,000 pairs of chinstrap penguins. Other birds nesting at the site include Adélie and gentoo penguins as well as <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel</b> {{achieves}} {{sexual maturity}} at {{six or seven}} years of age; however the average age of first breeding is ten years. Its breeding season begins in October. Its nest is a mound of moss, grass, and stones with a depression in the centre and is located on bare or grassy ground. They form loose colonies except in the Falkland Islands where the colonies are much larger.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} flora, fauna {{in the park}} is scarce {{and many of the}} species are endangered. The fauna is {{dominated}} by birds and maritime mammals. Bird species found on the islands include: Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), or red peek penguin, the <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel</b> (Macronectes giganteus), kelp gull or Dominican gull (Larus dominicanus), red-legged cormorant (Phalacrocorax gaimardi, also known as the red-legged shag, red-footed cormorant, red-footed shag, Gaimard’s cormorant or grey cormorant), and southern royal albatross (Diomedea epomophora).|$|E
50|$|The giant petrels are {{two large}} seabirds from the genus Macronectes. Long {{considered}} to be conspecific (they were not established as separate species until 1966), the two species, the <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrel,</b> Macronectes giganteus, and northern giant petrel, Macronectes halli, are considered with the two fulmars, Fulmarus, to form a distinct subgroup within Procellariidae, and including the Antarctic petrel, Cape petrel, and the snow petrel, they form a separate group {{from the rest of}} the family.|$|E
50|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support a breeding colony of about 250 pairs of imperial shags. Other birds nesting on the islands include Adélie, gentoo and chinstrap penguins as well as <b>southern</b> <b>giant</b> <b>petrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Birds {{for which}} the site is of {{conservation}} significance include Magellanic penguins and striated caracaras.
