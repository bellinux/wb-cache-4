5|$|The town, the {{district}} and the valley where the town is located, share the name of Chamba. The town of Chamba {{is located at the}} junction of Ravi River and its tributary, the Sal River, with the Shah Madar hill forming the backdrop on its eastern side. The Ravi flows in east-west direction forming deep canyons. During the spring and summer months, the levels of the river rise significantly from <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> and pose a flooding risk. Record levels were experienced in early July 2005, when the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation was forced to shut down the power generation on its 300-MW Chamera Power Station.|$|E
5|$|The {{life history}} of the long-toed {{salamander}} varies greatly with elevation and climate. Seasonal dates of migration {{to and from the}} breeding ponds can be correlated with bouts of sustained rainfall, ice thaw, or <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> sufficient to replenish the (often) seasonal ponds. Eggs may be spawned at low elevations as early as mid-February in southern Oregon, from early January to July in northwestern Washington, from January to March in southeastern Washington, and from mid-April to early May in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta. The timing of breeding can be highly variable; of notable mention, several egg masses in early stages of development were found on July 8, 1999 along the British Columbia provincial border outside Jasper, Alberta. Adults migrate seasonally to return to their natal breeding ponds, with males arriving earlier and staying longer than females, and some individuals have been seen migrating along snow banks on warm spring days. Gender differences (or sexual dimorphism) in this species are only apparent during the breeding season, when mature males display an enlarged or bulbous vent area.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{hydronic}} heating systems for bridge <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> requires assessment of long-term performance under expected future weather conditions, especially when geothermal energy {{is used as}} the heat source. This {{is important to be}} able to predict the <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> performance, analyze the economics, and investigate the effects of controls and design parameters on the system performance. A simulation tool for modeling hydronic bridge <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> systems using ground source heat pumps (GSHP) or other heat sources has been developed to facilitate the design. In this paper, a numerical model of the hydronically-heated bridge deck and the experimental validation results of the model predictions are described. In addition, the structure and features of the simulation tool are presented. As an application of the simulation tool, the ASHRAE guidance for required surface heat fluxes for <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> is evaluated with a simulation-based parametric study...|$|R

25|$|Where {{sandstone}} layers overlay shale, <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> could accumulate {{and create}} seeps and springs, which the Ancestral Puebloans used as water sources. Snow also fed the smaller, more predictable tributaries, {{such as the}} Chinle, Animas, Jemez, and Taos Rivers. The larger rivers were less directly important to the ancient culture, as smaller streams were more easily diverted or controlled for irrigation.|$|E
25|$|All {{areas of}} the Ancestral Puebloan {{homeland}} suffered from periods of drought, and wind and water erosion. Summer rains could be unreliable and often arrived as destructive thunderstorms. While the amount of winter snowfall varied greatly, the Ancestral Puebloans depended on the snow {{for most of their}} water. <b>Snow</b> <b>melt</b> allowed the germination of seeds, both wild and cultivated, in the spring.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental validation exercise for a newly developed numerical {{model of the}} <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> process on heated pavement surfaces. The model is able to predict {{the conditions of the}} snow, ice and water during the <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> process on hydronically-heated pavements given time-varying weather and heating system boundary conditions. Validation results show that the model satisfactorily predicts the surface temperature and conditions, the degree of snow cover over the heated surface, and outlet fluid temperature given the weather data, inlet fluid temperature, and the fluid mass flow rate. It can therefore be used to analyze the performance of hydronic <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> systems and can be used in the system design process.

25|$|Slow-rising floods most {{commonly}} occur in large rivers with large catchment areas. The increase in flow {{may be the}} result of sustained rainfall, rapid <b>snow</b> <b>melt,</b> monsoons, or tropical cyclones. However, large rivers may have rapid flooding events in areas with dry climate, since they may have large basins but small river channels and rainfall can be very intense in smaller areas of those basins.|$|E

25|$|Hydrologists {{from the}} University of Colorado have {{investigated}} the impacts of beetle-infested forests on the water cycle, in particular, snow accumulation and melt. They concluded that dead forests will accumulate more snowpack {{as a result of}} thinner tree canopies and decreased snow sublimation. These thinned canopies also cause faster <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> by allowing more sunlight through to the forest floor and lowering the snowpack albedo, as a result of needle litter on the snow surface. Augmented snowpack coupled with dead trees that no longer transpire will likely lead to more available water.|$|E

40|$|A {{half of the}} Japanese {{land has}} been legislated as the heavy {{snowfall}} area {{by the government and}} more than twenty million people live there. Snow precipitation in a day sometimes reaches over 600 mm high and people expend a considerable amount of work and time remove accumulated snow and to maintain the daily activities. The top of citizen’s demands to solve municipal issues is always related snow in this area. In order to enhance urban appeal as well as the safety and comfort daily life, the <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> system of the pavement has been getting more recognition in the central are of the city. Popular <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> systems use electrically heating wire buried in the pavement. On the other hand, hot water piping systems heated by kerosene or gas boilers are also commonly used for not only residential front yards but also for big parking spaces and precipitous roads. However, <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> systems consume much bigger amount of thermal energy than most people think due to a large amount of heat loss to the ambient in addition to needed heat for <b>melting</b> <b>snow.</b> For example, 400 litters of oil are burned in winter season for 20 m 2 wide residential <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> system in average in Hokkaido area. This amount of oil consumption is almost equivalent to the annual oil consumption for domestic hot water supply of a single family house.

25|$|Droughts are {{becoming}} more frequent and intense in arid and semiarid western North America as temperatures have been rising, advancing the timing and magnitude of spring <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> ﬂoods and reducing river flow volume in summer. Direct {{effects of climate change}} include increased heat and water stress, altered crop phenology, and disrupted symbiotic interactions. These effects may be exacerbated by climate changes in river ﬂow, and the combined effects are likely to reduce the abundance of native trees in favor of non-native herbaceous and drought-tolerant competitors, reduce the habitat quality for many native animals, and slow litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Climate change effects on human water demand and irrigation may intensify these effects.|$|E
