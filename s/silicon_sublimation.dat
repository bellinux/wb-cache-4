40|$|Epitaxial {{graphene}} {{growth was}} performed on the Si-terminated face of 4 H-, 6 H-, and 3 C-SiC substrates by <b>silicon</b> <b>sublimation</b> from SiC in argon atmosphere at a temperature of 2000 degrees C. Graphene surface morphology, thickness and band structure have been assessed by using atomic force microscopy, low-energy electron microscopy, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, respectively. Differences in the morphology of the graphene layers on different SiC polytypes is related mainly to the minimization of the terrace surface energy during the step bunching process. The uniformity of <b>silicon</b> <b>sublimation</b> is a decisive factor for obtaining large area homogenous graphene. It is also shown that a lower substrate surface roughness results in more uniform step bunching with a lower distribution of step heights and consequently better quality of the grown graphene. Large homogeneous areas of graphene monolayers (over 50 x 50 mu m(2)) have been grown on 3 C-SiC (1 1 1) substrates. The comparison with the other polytypes suggests a similarity in the surface behaviour of 3 C- and 6 H-SiC. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Epitaxial {{graphene}} {{films were}} grown in vacuo by <b>silicon</b> <b>sublimation</b> from the (0001) and (000 - 1) faces of 4 H- and 6 H-SiC. Hall effect mobilities and sheet carrier densities {{of the films}} were measured at 300 K and 77 K and the data depended on the growth face. About 40 % of the samples exhibited holes as the dominant carrier, independent of face. Generally, mobilities increased with decreasing carrier density, independent of carrier type and substrate polytype. The contributions of scattering mechanisms to the conductivities of the films are discussed. The results suggest that for near-intrinsic carrier densities at 300 K epitaxial graphene mobilities will be ~ 150, 000 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 on the (000 - 1) face and ~ 5, 800 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 on the (0001) face.

40|$|International audienceCoSi is an {{inexpensive}} thermoelectric material for medium temperature (200 – 500 °C). Its power factor is {{as large as}} {{the state of the art}} materials; however, its thermal conductivity is too large. Then, improving its thermoelectric performances implies increasing the scattering of phonons, which can be performed by nanostructuring the material. In this paper we investigate the effect of nanostructuration on the structure, microstructure, lattice dynamics and stability of CoSi. We obtained powders of about 13 nm by mechanical milling bulk CoSi for only four hours or by mechanical alloying pure elements for twelve hours. Nanostructuration induces a 0. 1 % expansion of the lattice parameter. Raman spectroscopy, associated to ab initio calculations, highlights the effectiveness of nanostructuration on phonon scattering, showing a reduction of the phonon relaxation time by as much as 80 %. Powders are stable up to 450 °C; then grains coarsen and a partial degradation of the material occurs, probably due to <b>silicon</b> <b>sublimation.</b> Our results indicate that nanostructuration should be considered when interested to reduce CoSi thermal conductivity...|$|E
40|$|The outer {{planetary}} exploration missions {{studied by}} the Jet Propulsion Laboratory require silicon-germanium radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) {{in which the}} factors of safety are as low as {{is compatible with the}} reliable satisfaction of the power needs. Work on <b>silicon</b> germanium <b>sublimation</b> performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is presented. Analytical modeling work on the solid-diffusion process involved in the steady-state (free) <b>sublimation</b> of <b>silicon</b> germanium is described. Analytical predictions are made of the sublimation suppression which can be achieved by using a cover gas. A series of accelerated (high-temperature) tests which were performed on simulated hardware (using four SiGe couples) to study long-term sublimation and reaction mechanisms are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we present an {{investigation}} on the defect generation and annihilation during the homoepitaxial growth step of cubic <b>silicon</b> carbide by <b>sublimation</b> epitaxy on templates grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} on silicon substrates. Several structural defects like stacking faults, twins and star-defects show opposite evolution from the template layer into the sublimation grown material. While single planar defects tend to annihilate with increasing layer thickness, the defect clusters assigned to the star-defects are enlarging. These issues contribute to a balance of how to achieve the best possible quality on thick layers...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{epitaxial}} growth of cubic <b>silicon</b> carbide by <b>sublimation</b> epitaxy on different substrates, four different 6 H-SiC substrate preparations were used: (i) as-received, (ii) re-polished, (iii) annealed and covered by silicon layer and (iv) with (1 1 1) 3 C-SiC buffer layer. Almost 100 % coverage and low twin density was achieved when grown on the buffer layer. The XRD and TEM characterizations show better material quality when the layer is grown directly on 6 H-SiC substrates. Background doping evaluated by LTPL is {{in the range of}} 10 (16) cm(- 3) for N and 10 (16) cm(- 3) for Al in all grown layers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Per {{request of}} the author and the advisor, and with the {{approval}} of the graduate office, the Acknowledgements page was replaced with an errata. The two-dimensional phase of carbon known as graphene is actively being pursued as a primary material in future electronic devices. The goals of this thesis are to investigate the growth and electronic properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC, with a particular focus on nanostructured graphene. The first part of this thesis examines the kinetics of graphene growth on SiC(0001) and SiC(0001 ̅) by high-temperature sublimation of the substrate using a custom-built, ultra-high vacuum induction furnace. A first-principles kinetic theory of <b>silicon</b> <b>sublimation</b> and mass-transfer is developed to describe the functional dependence of the graphene growth rate on the furnace temperature and pressure. This theory can be used to calibrate other graphene growth furnaces which employ confinement controlled sublimation. The final chapter in this thesis involves a careful study of self-organized epitaxial graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) on SiC(0001). Scanning tunneling microscopy of the sidewall GNRs confirms that these self-organized nanostructures are susceptible to overgrowth onto nearby SiC terraces. Atomic-scale imaging of the overgrown sidewall GNRs detected local strained regions in the nanoribbon crystal lattice, with strain coefficients as high as 15 %. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of these strained regions demonstrate that the graphene electronic local density of states is strongly affected by distortions in the crystal lattice. Room temperature STS in regions with a large strain gradient found local energy gaps as high as 400 meV. Controllable, strain-induced quantum states in epitaxial graphene on SiC could be utilized in new electronic devices. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{demonstrate}} the in situ electrical characterization of planar, high concentration phosphorus layers in silicon {{close to the}} silicon-vacuum interface. To achieve this we have used an ultra-high vacuum four-probe scanning tunneling microscope(STM) in combination with a gaseous molecular dopant precursor (PH 3) and a <b>silicon</b> <b>sublimation</b> source for epitaxial encapsulation. Initially we investigate and improve ex situ Ohmic contact formation to highly phosphorus doped silicon using nickel silicide rather than aluminium. We demonstrate improved reliability, depth control {{and the elimination of}} superconducting artifacts. We develop a comprehensive understanding of how an in situ four-probe scanning tunneling microscope system can be applied for the measurement of electrical resistivity, both for bulk doped substrates and near-surface &# 948;-doping profiles. Through extensive measurements we show that the sheet resistance of &# 948;-doping layers can be reliably and unambiguously characterized, even at room temperature using conductive substrates. Building on this, we then investigate the technologically relevant topic of how the resistivity of these degenerate 2 D doping layers evolves as a function of their depth from the silicon-vacuum interface. We observe Ohmic conduction at depths as low as 0. 5 nm, with a resistivity which sharply decreases from &# 8776; 24 k&# 937;/square until saturating at &# 8776; 550 &# 937;/square for depths beyond approximately 20 nm. Importantly, the sheet resistances we obtain at the depths we obtain them surpass all currently projected requirements from the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for ultra-shallow junctions. We are able to explain the depth dependence with a conductivity model incorporating a finite segregation length of the grown layer combined with surface scattering. Finally we extend this four-probe work towards the measurement of STM patterned dopant regions close to the interface. We obtain preliminary one-, two- and four-terminal resistance measurements on micrometer scale lithographically defined dopant patches. We highlight the challenges in such an endeavour, and show that probe-to-sample conductance measurements provide an unambiguous test of positioning accuracy. Combined, using a four-probe STM we have built a solid experimental grounding for the understanding and further exploration of near-surface dopant structures in silicon...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{to account}} high {{specific}} {{surface area of}} the powder, its surface state becomes {{one of the most}} important aspects of usability of the powder in PM process and particularly in additive manufacturing. Powder surface characterization of the two HX Ni-based superalloy powders sampled during selective laser melting – namely virgin and re-cycled powders was performed by means of XPS and high-resolution SEM combined with EDX. Results showed slight difference in surface chemical composition between the powders. The most sensitive to oxidation alloying elements in the powder – Al and Cr – segregate to the surface to form more stable oxides in case of re-cycled powder. Loss of <b>silicon</b> due to <b>sublimation</b> was also detected on the surface of re-cycled powder.

40|$|<b>Silicon</b> carbide (SiC) <b>sublimation</b> is {{the most}} {{promising}} option to achieve transfer-free graphene at the wafer-scale. We investigated the initial growth stages from the buffer layer to monolayer graphene on SiC(0001) {{as a function of}} annealing temperature at low argon pressure (10 mbar). A buffer layer, fully covering the SiC substrate, forms when the substrate is annealed at 1600 °C. Graphene formation starts from the step edges of the SiC substrate at higher temperature (1700 °C). The spatial homogeneity of the monolayer graphene was observed at 1750 °C, as characterized by Raman spectroscopy and magneto-transport. Raman spectroscopy mapping indicated an AG-graphene/AG-HOPG ratio of around 3. 3 %, which is very close to the experimental value reported for a graphene monolayer. Transport measurements fromroom temperature down to 1. 7 K indicated slightly p-doped samples (p~ 10 ^ 10 cm- 2) and confirmed both continuity and thickness of the monolayer graphene film. Successive growth processes have confirmed the reproducibility and homogeneity of these monolayer films...|$|R
