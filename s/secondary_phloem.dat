5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (<b>secondary</b> <b>phloem</b> and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and <b>secondary</b> <b>phloem</b> to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and <b>secondary</b> <b>phloem,</b> the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally.

40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} {{and development of}} successive cambia and its products were studied in the stems of the halophyte Sesuvium verrucosum Raf. The young stem has several collateral vascular bundles arranged {{in a circle and}} separated by interfascicular zones. The secondary thickening begins with the differentiation of fascicular and interfascicular cambia which give rise to <b>secondary</b> xylem, <b>phloem</b> and lignified cells. This normal cambium ceases to divide after a limited period of activity. A new segment of anomalous cambium was developed from the phloem parenchyma cells outside the normal previous cambium. These cells are served as a site for the origin of the anomalous cambium and subjected to repeated periclinal divisions. This cambium has fusiform cells with semi-storied appearance. The activity of this anomalous cambium produces <b>secondary</b> xylem, <b>phloem,</b> fibers and soft parenchyma as conjunctive tissues. The formation of subsequent cambia followed a similar pattern of development and causes vascular increments in the old stem. So, the old stem of S. verrucosum is constructed of concentric fibrovascular bands separated from each other by cylinders of conjunctive parenchyma tissue. This internal structure has a great adaptive potential to the halophyte S. verrucosum. This can be detected by the following points: (1) Production of large number of vessels and sieve tubes elements increases the conductive activity; (2) Occurrence of fibers alongside the vessels increases the mechanical strength that helps and protects water columns from embolism and ensures this water to store and transport in the succulent leaves; and (3) Thin walled parenchyma conjunctive tissue offers flexibility to the plant stem which forms a mat like and able to bend toward the ground without harm. Perhaps these features matched well with the S. verrucosum plant habitat...|$|R

Two hypotheses were tested here: that SIR against a pathogen induced by either a pathogen or an insect involves coordinated shifts in <b>phloem</b> <b>secondary</b> metabolism; and that fertility affects {{the production of}} these compounds. • To test these hypotheses, a tripartite system was used comprising Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) grown under three different fertility regimes, the fungal pathogen Diplodia pinea, and the defoliator Neodiprion sertifer. • Fungal induction led to systemic accumulation of lignin, phenolic glycosides and stilbenes, whereas insect defoliation led {{to an increase in}} germacrene D concentration in branch phloem. Fertility affected the concentrations of only the phenolic glycosides. Multivariate analyses showed coregulation of compounds within at least three consistent groupings: phenolic glycosides, stilbenes and monoterpenes.

Foliar K concentration had only a slight effect on needle morphology. The sclerenchyma cell walls were thinner, the xylem area was larger, and the resin ducts were smaller in needles with a low K concentration than in needles with a high or intermediate K concentration. In addition, the bundle sheath cells were collapsed in needles having a low K concentration. The <b>secondary</b> growth of <b>phloem</b> tissue and the mesophyll area were greater in needles with a high or intermediate K concentration than in needles with a low K concentration, possibly indicating greater production of photoassimilates in these trees. At the ultrastructural level, mesophyll cells with enlarged central vacuoles and small vacu-oles containing electron-dense material were common in need-les having a low K concentration.

In search for withingene sequence differences between both genes as a potential reason for the differential expression patterns, the structural organization of the two genes was compared.

In this study we used a microscale mass-spectrometry technique coupled with cryosectioning to visualize the radial concentration gradient of endogenous indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) across the cambial meristem and the differentiating derivatives in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees that had different rates of cambial growth. This approach allowed us to investigate the relationship between growth rate and the concentration of endogenous IAA in the dividing cells.

PoGT 47 C from the hybrid poplar Populus alba tremula exhibits 84 % sequence similarity to Fragile fiber 8 (FRA 8), which {{is involved in the}} biosynthesis of glucuronoxylan in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis of glycosyltransferase family GT 47 in the Populus trichocarpa genome revealed that GT 47 C is the only close homolog of FRA 8. In situ hybridization showed that the PoGT 47 C gene was expressed in developing primary xylem, <b>secondary</b> xylem and <b>phloem</b> fibers of stems, and in developing secondary xylem of roots. Sequence analysis suggests that PoGT 47 C is a type II membrane protein, and study of the subcellular localization demonstrated that fluorescent protein-tagged PoGT 47 C was located in the Golgi. Immunolocalization with a xylan monoclonal antibody LM 10 revealed a nearly complete loss of xylan signals in the secondary walls of fibers and vessels in the Arabidopsis fra 8 mutant. Expression of PoGT 47 C in the fra 8 mutant restored the secondary wall thickness and xylan content to the wild-type level.
