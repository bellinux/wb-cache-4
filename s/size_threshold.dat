25|$|The simple {{observation}} that cells {{of a given}} type are similar in size, {{and the question of}} how this similarity is maintained, has long fascinated cell biologists. The study of cell size control in budding yeast began in earnest in the mid 1970s, when the regulation of the budding yeast cell cycle was first being elucidated by Lee Hartwell and colleagues. Seminal work in 1977 found that yeast cells maintain a constant size by delaying their entry into the cell cycle (as assayed by budding) until they have grown to a threshold size. Later worked refined this result to show that Start specifically, rather than some other aspect of the G1-S transition, is controlled by the <b>size</b> <b>threshold.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Army ants will {{split into}} groups when {{the size of}} the colony has reached a <b>size</b> <b>threshold</b> which happens {{approximately}} every three years. Wingless virgin queens will hatch among a male sexual brood that will hatch at a later date. When the colony fissions, there are two ways new queens are decided. A possible outcome is a new queen will stay at the original nest with a portion of the workers and the male brood while the old queen will leave with the other portion of workers and find a new nest. Another possibility is that the workers will reject the old queen and new queens will head the two new colonies. The workers will affiliate with individual queens based on the pheromone cues that are unique to each queen. [...] When new bivouacs are formed, communication between the original colony and the new bivouacs will cease to exist.|$|E
2500|$|The social {{caterpillars}} of Malacosoma disstria are nomadic and forage as a group. The fifty to {{two hundred}} larvae {{that result from}} a single egg-mass live together {{for most of their}} larval stages. Trails of silk heavily loaded with pheromones secreted by other colony members induce larvae to move, while the close presence of other colony members brings them to [...] This indicates that there are social cues that are used to increase the locomotive efficiency of each individual larva. [...] Pupation occurs after caterpillars reach a <b>size</b> <b>threshold</b> that is attained more quickly when caterpillars forage in groups. This is particularly important since delayed development to threshold increases the risks of predation and food depletion. [...] However, as larvae proceed into the later instars, they become increasingly independent and by the fifth instar rarely form aggregations. This ontogenetic change in gregariousness results from an increase in the costs of maintaining grouping due to changes related to predation, thermoregulation, silk production, and foraging.|$|E

Using hazard rate models the preferred results indicate that the hazard of a firm reporting its R&D in its annual accounts shows positive time dependence and that large firms, by sales, are more likely to announce than small firms. It is also found that the introduction of SSAP 13 impacted considerably upon the extent of reporting by all firms (whatever their size) with an anticipation effect in 1988, and large positive impacts in 1989 and 1990.

2500|$|Nanotechnology ("nanotech") is [...] {{manipulation}} of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology [...] {{referred to the}} particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the {{manipulation of}} matter {{with at least one}} dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given <b>size</b> <b>threshold.</b> It is therefore common to see the plural form [...] "nanotechnologies" [...] as well as [...] "nanoscale technologies" [...] to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested $3.7 billion, the European Union has invested $1.2 billion and Japan has $750 million.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the deaths}} of Wagner and Abbott, Barbara Haviland {{continued}} to compile data for world records. In 1997 Kim Hutsell acquired the rights from Cynthia Abbott to World Size Records to continue the project as a stand-alone book, those rights were subsequently sold to Don Pisor. The first edition therefore incorporated many of the earlier entries, as well as additional data compiled for World Size Records by Barbara Haviland. The format of the new publication differed from World Size Records in several important ways. Significantly, the minimum <b>size</b> <b>threshold</b> was lowered from [...] to [...] In another change, the registry listed taxa alphabetically by species name within families, instead of within genera {{as they had been}} previously. This system allows for easy comparison between closely related genera, is more resilient to the frequent taxonomic changes that occur at the genus level, and gets around the issue that many shell dealers prefer to lump numerous genera for the sake of simplicity. R. Tucker Abbott had himself intended to use this arrangement in the fifth edition of his World Size Records, but died before he could see his plans through. Another difference was the presentation of sizes in millimetres to the nearest tenth instead of centimetres to the nearest hundredth, moving the publication in line with standard usage in conchology. Finally, references were added for each specimen to aid in identification. The opening paragraph of the first edition set out the project's goals and invited submissions: ...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that many facultative biennials show variation in <b>threshold</b> <b>size</b> for flowering. In order to quantify the genetic variation for this character, we performed a two-way artificial selection experiment on <b>threshold</b> <b>size</b> in Cynoglossum officinale. The parental generation, established from seed from a natural population, showed large variation in <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> (2. 6 - 13. 4 g). After one generation of selection for low <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> all plants in the F 1 flowered at sizes below 3. 2 g. In the high selection line none of the F 1 plants under 3. 6 g flowered, and there were very large nonflowering plants (up to 17. 2 g). By interpreting the logistic regression of flowering probability on plant size as a cumulative frequency distribution of <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes,</b> we could derive the frequency distributions of <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> in each generation. These were used to estimate the narrow-sense heritabilities by the standard procedure for artificial selection on a quantitative character. This gave 'heritabilities' of 0. 35 and 0. 32 for the high and low selection lines, respectively. A previously constructed optimization model, applied to the population in our study area, predicted strong selection against low <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes,</b> but a fairly equal fitness for <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> around and above the optimum.

In semelparous perennial plants {{the onset of}} reproduction is regulated by a <b>threshold</b> <b>size</b> for flowering. We tested this prediction by comparing sand dune populations of the facultative biennial herb Cynoglossum officinale. We collected data on flowering probability, survival, and growth rate in relation to plant size in two habitat types, open areas and poplar thickets, in Meijendel, The Netherlands, and in Holkham, England. Survival of established rosettes was highest in Holkham and lowest in open areas in Meijendel. Relative growth rates in Holkham were about three times as high as those in Meijendel. These findings agreed with the differences in <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> found among the sites: the Holkham field population harbored higher <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> than the Meijendel sites. We used the field data to compare optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> for flowering predicted by three existing models. All three models gave the same rank order for <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> as found in the field: Meijendel open < Meijendel poplar thicket < Holkham. One model, which maximized population growth rate λ, predicted optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> that agreed very well with <b>threshold</b> <b>sizes</b> found in the field.

40|$|The way {{in which}} little GAAP has emerged in the UK {{suggests}} that policy makers have taken an arbitrary and piecemeal approach to reform, and this {{is reflected in the}} number of changes to disclosure requirements and the frequency with which qualifying <b>size</b> <b>thresholds</b> are revised.
