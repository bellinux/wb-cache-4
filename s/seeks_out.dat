40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} has demonstrated that exposure to nature benefits people in a multitude of ways. After reviewing the research on this topic, we found little information about what motivates people to <b>seek</b> <b>out</b> natural environments. In order to obtain information on why people <b>seek</b> <b>out</b> natural environments, we asked participants to respond to an open-ended question, “People <b>seek</b> <b>out</b> natural environments for many reasons. Please describe why you <b>seek</b> <b>out</b> natural environments”. We then developed a coding system that allowed us to code the reasons participants gave for <b>seeking</b> <b>out</b> natural environments. We then used a pilot study to test and refine our coding system. This process resulted in twelve codes that were used to code participants’ reasons for seeking natural environments in our study. We then compared the reasons people <b>seek</b> <b>out</b> natural environments with several published scales measuring different aspects of human-nature connections...|$|R
