This population had difficulty securing housing because it was rumored that they rubbed their skin with olive oil, which ruined the bedding. If the minority students were told an apartment complex was full, white students would go ask for a room there to test the fairness of the renters. The students would then talk to the renters, who were often embarrassed and would agree to rent to the minority students.|$|E

For one, binge drinking is still a major issue on many U.

The seduction of social compliance coupled with postadolescent insecurity is temporarily suspended through the ritualistic debauch of a college fraternity party, especially in small-town colleges.

According to Robin DiAngelo (2011), white fragility is, “The insulated environment of racial protection [that] builds white expectations for racial comfort while at the same time lowering the ability to tolerate racial stress. ” This can be manifested in various ways in the classroom, e. g. silence, dismissal of feelings, triggering, and unfortunately, even tears. There is little published literature around white fragility and the way it pervades classroom dynamics.
