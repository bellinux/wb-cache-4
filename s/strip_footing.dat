50|$|Stuart was {{the first}} pioneer to study the {{interference}} phenomenon of closely spaced surface <b>strip</b> <b>footing.</b> He examined the effect of footing interference on ultimate bearing capacity of strip footings by theoretical analysis using limit equilibrium method, assuming a non-linear failure surface wherein the cross section composed of logarithmic spiral and straight line portion tangent to the curvilinear portion. Further Stuart (1962) carried out few small-scale laboratory experiments and compared the results of theoretical analysis {{with that of the}} experimental results and concluded that the ultimate bearing capacity of two interfering footings increase with decrease in spacing between the footings and attains a peak magnitude at some spacing termed as critical spacing. The study of Stuart (1962) was further extended by West and Stuart (1965) by performing a series of small-scale laboratory tests to examine the effect of interference on bearing capacity of strip footings resting on the surface of cohesion-less soil bed. Moreover, West and Stuart (1965) carried out few theoretical analyses using method of stress characteristics to observe the eccentricity of load and reactions at the base of footing resulting from interference effect for footings resting on the surface of sand. The results obtained from this theory were smaller than those observed by Stuart (1962) using limit equilibrium method; however the trend was similar to the variation as observed by Stuart (1962) and the results obtained by experiments reasonably matched with those of the theoretical analysis. The researchers carried out the study by theoretical or numerical techniques for interfering footings by making use of the following methods : Method of stress characteristics, Analytical method, Probabilistic approach, Upper bound limits analysis, Lower bound limits analysis, Finite element method, Finite difference method.|$|E

30|$|For {{untreated}} <b>strip</b> <b>footing,</b> {{the best}} match between measured and predicted vertical displacements is obtained at {{the value of}} the depth of influence equal to 1.65 times width of the <b>strip</b> <b>footing</b> as shown in Fig.  3. The difference between the present results and the measured values at the left part of the <b>strip</b> <b>footing</b> {{is due to the fact}} that in the present analysis a constant soil layer is considered, whereas in the field the soil thickness is varied along the beam length. However, for treated <b>strip</b> <b>footing,</b> the predicted values by the present analysis are compared well with the measured vertical displacements at the edges and slightly smaller than the measured values at the middle part of the <b>strip</b> <b>footing</b> as shown in Fig.  3. One of the drawbacks of Winkler model is that a <b>strip</b> <b>footing</b> subjected to a uniformly distributed load will undergo rigid body displacements without any shear forces or bending moments in the <b>strip</b> <b>footing.</b> The results obtained by the present analysis for case of untreated <b>strip</b> <b>footing</b> reveals that the importance of using two-parameter model to represent the soil instead of using one-parameter model (i.e., Winkler model).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims to {{investigate}} the reliability of <b>strip</b> <b>footing</b> {{in the presence of}} spatially variable undrained shear strength that linearly increases with depth. A non-stationary random field is used to model the spatially varying undrained shear strength. A <b>strip</b> <b>footing</b> example is presented {{to investigate}} the effect of spatially variable undrained shear strength on the performance of <b>strip</b> <b>footing.</b> The results indicate that the mean bearing capacity for spatially variable undrained shear strength is smaller than that obtained from a deterministic analysis. Both the mean and standard deviation of bearing capacity increase with increasing autocorrelation length. Ignoring the trend of undrained shear strength linearly increasing with depth will significantly overestimate the probability of failure of the <b>strip</b> <b>footing.</b> A factor of safety significantly below 3. 0 may be used for designing strip footings if the trend of undrained shear strength linearly increasing with depth is considered properly...|$|E

The granular pile arrangement, GPA 5, has the smallest value of positive bending moment and the highest value of negative bending moment as shown in Fig.  28.
