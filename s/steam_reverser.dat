5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid <b>steam</b> <b>reverser,</b> could cause irregular valve movements.

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear.

5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex <b>steam</b> <b>reverser</b> configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 1907, these {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, also designed by Hendrie. All Hendrie’s locomotives also came equipped with piston tail rods, {{but since they}} were difficult and costly to maintain, they were removed in 1925.|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{fitted with}} Pyle National {{turbo-generators}} and headlamps, with the generator {{attached to the}} top of the smokebox, ahead of the chimney. It had the Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, steam brakes and combination vacuum ejectors.|$|R

50|$|Another locomotive, no. 280, was {{equipped}} with steam reversing gear in 1907, also to Hendrie’s design. The <b>steam</b> <b>reverser</b> {{proved to be an}} unqualified success and was soon adopted as standard equipment {{on the rest of the}} Class.

50|$|The Hendrie C, {{as it was}} popularly known, {{was similar}} to the Class A Hendrie A in general proportions, but with Walschaerts valve gear, 1+1/2 in larger {{diameter}} coupled wheels, a larger boiler with a higher boiler pressure and a more enclosed cab which offered better protection to the crew. They were equipped with Hendrie's <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear and had wide Belpaire fireboxes, carried down between the rear frames which had been widened by using a bridle casting.|$|R
5000|$|Like his brother, James Stirling favoured the domeless boiler, {{known as}} the [...] "straightback" [...] and cabs for the enginemen. Although not the first British {{locomotive}} engineer to use the 4-4-0 type, {{he was the first}} to produce a 4-4-0 which could be regarded as successful, with his G&SWR 6 Class of 1873. Stirling also invented a <b>steam</b> <b>reverser,</b> using it on most of his designs from 1874.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear, {{controlled by}} <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear. The cylinders and steam chests were formed in three separate castings. The high-pressure cylinders were arranged with piston valves, while the low-pressure cylinders were arranged with Richardson balanced type slide valves, arranged above the cylinders. The steam chest covers of the low-pressure cylinders were designed with inclined joint faces {{to facilitate the}} handling of the valve and refacing of the ports during servicing.|$|R
50|$|They {{were built}} with Hendrie’s steam reversers. The Hendrie <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear {{consisted}} of a 5+1/2 in diameter steam cylinder and a 5 in diameter oil cylinder, arranged in line on a bracket which was fixed to the main engine frame on the driver's side. The cylinders had a common piston rod which had a slot in the centre, between the cylinders. This slot accommodated a sliding crosshead which engaged with an arm fixed to the reversing shaft.|$|R
50|$|The Walschaerts {{valve gear}} was {{controlled}} by a vertical type of <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> engine which {{was attached to the}} right-hand side of the boiler, just below the dome. It consisted of a 5+1/2 in diameter steam cylinder and a 4 in diameter oil cylinder, fitted with a common piston rod with a crosshead which was machined integral with the piston rod. This crosshead was connected to a lever fitted to the reversing shaft. After 1912, these reversing engines were replaced with Hendrie steam reversers.|$|R
50|$|A further {{complication}} was {{the unpredictable}} behaviour of the Eastleigh type of <b>steam</b> <b>reverser</b> employed. If this reverser misbehaved under the fluctuating pressures {{present in the}} steam chest, the locomotive {{seemed to have a}} will of its own. For example, if the reverser dropped into full gear, the slackness in the motion would make the valves overrun their designed full travel. This would result in the locomotive taking off like an unleashed race horse, high coal consumption, throwing the fire out of the chimney and running the risk of a violent high-speed slipping.|$|E

50|$|The 3600 {{class were}} fitted with <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> brakes, and two steam-operated water pick-ups for forward and reverse working. This {{reflects}} their intended work as fast suburban engines. About half were employed on such duties in the Birmingham area. The rest {{worked in the}} London area, though later a few worked Chester-Birkenhead trains, and some were allocated to South Wales sheds. They were essentially passenger train locomotives, and were eventually superseded by Collett's 2-6-2Ts. All were withdrawn and scrapped between 1930 and 1934.|$|R
60|$|As {{the crabs}} approached, the stern-jacket of the Adamant was let down, and the engines were slowed. This stern-jacket, when {{protecting}} the rudder and propellers, {{looked very much}} like the cowcatcher of a locomotive, and was capable of being put to a somewhat similar use. It was the intention of the captain of the Adamant, should the crabs attempt to attach themselves to his stern, to suddenly put on all <b>steam,</b> <b>reverse</b> his engines, and back upon them, the stern-jacket answering as a ram.|$|R
50|$|In most {{reciprocating}} piston engines, the <b>steam</b> <b>reverses</b> its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the cylinder {{by the same}} port. The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four events - admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, {{of which there are}} many types.|$|R
500|$|After 1903, a [...] {{frame with}} a longer {{overhang}} {{at the front}} end was introduced and <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear fitted. Some sources record these locomotives as X14 class, and this designation was sometimes {{used to refer to}} the longer-framed versions, but for most purposes the two sub-classes were grouped together and known as M7. The 1904/05 construction batch moved the sandboxes back to the front splasher and new items were feed water heating, single ram pumps and balanced crank axles. For the remainder of construction from the outshopping of the 105th locomotive in 1911, duplex pumps were fitted.|$|R
50|$|The piston valves were {{actuated}} by Walschaerts {{valve gear}} {{and the standard}} SAR type <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear was arranged on the right-hand side. The engine and tender were both equipped with vacuum brakes and the engine's two 21 in diameter vacuum cylinders were arranged outside the engine's frame and under the running boards, one on either side. The valve gear, brake gear and coupled wheel hubs were soft grease lubricated, while the bronze axle boxes had hard grease lubrication. The leading and trailing bogies were fitted with roller bearing axle boxes while the tender's bogies used plain bearings.|$|R
50|$|The {{superheated}} Class GA had a commodious cab and had plate frames, with {{a copper}} Belpaire firebox and combustion chamber. The piston valves were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, driven from the coupled wheels furthest from the respective cylinders {{and controlled by}} <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear which was fitted under the boiler barrel between the cradle frame plates. The bissel trucks at the extremities of the locomotive were fitted with Cartazzi axle box control to allow the axles sideways play since the truck itself did not pivot, but was compensated with the adjacent pair of coupled wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The boilers {{which were}} used on these {{locomotives}} were, at the time, {{the largest in}} South Africa. Like the altered NGR Class B of 1906 on which it was based, these loco&shy;motives used saturated steam and had plate frames. They used Walschaerts valve gear with flat [...] "D" [...] gunmetal type valves, which were arranged above the cylinders and controlled by the Hendrie-designed <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear. Since they were built without superheaters, the bore of their slide valves were 1/2 in larger than those on the altered Class B of 1906 {{to compensate for the}} additional weight of the locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|They had plate frames, steel Belpaire fireboxes {{and were}} superheated, with four safety valves set at [...] Their piston valves were {{actuated}} by Walschaerts valve gear, controlled by <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear. As delivered, they had 45+1/2 in diameter coupled wheels which were later retyred to 46 in diameter. The two water tanks had a combined capacity of 4600 imp gal. They had a water-filling tube {{hole on the}} front tank only since {{the front and rear}} tanks were connected by leveling pipes in accordance with the usual Garratt practice. The locomotives were delivered with mechanical lubricators, but these were later removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were erected at the East London workshops. Apart {{from their}} boilers and cylinders, {{the frame and}} other important components were standard {{with those of the}} Class 14, such as the coupled wheels, bogie, Pyle National turbo-generators and headlamps, Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear, <b>steam</b> operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, steam brakes and combination vacuum ejectors. It was also delivered with Type MP1 tenders which had a coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. One noticeable visible difference from the Class 14 was the absence of the two large sandboxes on each running board.|$|R
50|$|Superheating of {{the boiler}} was first applied to no. 3702, Halifax in June 1910. All {{of the class}} had been fitted with superheaters by 1912. Boiler feed was {{originally}} by clack valves fitted to {{the underside of the}} barrel. Top feed was introduced in 1912 and new cast iron chimneys in 1921. The slide valves were replaced by 8 in semi-plug piston valves from 1914. All the engines were fitted with <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> gear but only a few, including no. 3716 City of London, had the gear replaced by the screw reverse. The Dean suspension bogie was replaced by a bogie developed from the type used on the de Glehn Atlantics.|$|R
5000|$|The tug {{is powered}} by a {{compound}} double-acting, vertical-inverted steam reciprocating engine, a common type for tugboats. A 12 in high-pressure cylinder operates at [...] (now [...] ), while a 25 in low-pressure cylinder takes the high-pressure cylinder's exhaust at 17psi. Both cylinders have a stroke of 22 in, offset by 90 degrees to keep the engine from being stuck on center. A manual jacking gear acts as a further measure to prevent sticking on center. Stephenson valve gear permits reversing, aided by a <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> engine or ram to adjust eccentric rods. The propeller has a diameter of 6.75 ft with a pitch of 8.66 ft.|$|R
5000|$|Although Jones was {{a fervent}} disciple of Alexander Allan, Jones' new designs tended {{to break away}} from the Allan tradition, which had lasted so long in Scotland. One Allan feature that Jones did not {{perpetuate}} in his 4-6-0s was double framing around the outside cylinders. Allan's straight-link valve gear was, however, retained; this was basically similar to the corresponding Stephenson gear, but the link was easier and therefore cheaper to make and imparted a constant lead irrespective of cut-off. The [...] "Drummond" [...] Castle class was, mechanically, Jones’ personal design, although the Drummond stamp of chimney, cab and 'water-cart' bogie tender was unmistakable. A dubious asset, without which none of the younger Drummond's locomotives was complete, was the provision of <b>steam</b> <b>reverse,</b> a troublesome mechanism if it were not well maintained.|$|R
50|$|Atlanta Vultures {{were added}} as an {{expansion}} team {{to replace the}} departed Atlanta Sharks. Folded mid-season with a 2-1 record {{due to lack of}} usable turf in their home arena. The team's last win against the Savannah <b>Steam</b> was <b>reversed</b> by the league and all remaining scheduled league games were ruled as 0-2 losses in the league standings.|$|R
5000|$|Ten heavy Pacific {{passenger}} locomotives, {{designed by}} CSAR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) G.G. Elliot based on Hyde’s Class 10 design, were ordered from NBL and delivered in 1910. They had plate frames, Belpaire fireboxes and Walschaerts valve gear and were delivered in two variants, {{five of them}} using saturated steam while the rest were superheated. While similar to the Class 10, their boilers were arranged further forwards, their firebox throats and back plates were sloped instead of being vertical, they used inside admission piston valves and their valve gear was reversed {{by means of a}} vertical <b>steam</b> <b>reversing</b> engine mounted on the right-hand running board. They were all classified as Class 10-2 by the CSAR but, in 1912, the SAR designated the saturated steam locomotives Class 10A and the superheated ones Class 10B. A further five superheated Class 10B locomotives were delivered to the SAR from Beyer, Peacock in 1912.|$|R
50|$|On a <b>steam</b> locomotive, the <b>reversing</b> gear is used {{to control}} the {{direction}} of travel of the locomotive. It also adjusts the cutoff of the steam locomotive.|$|R
