5|$|The {{remaining}} ecological zones, {{with their}} progression from shoreline to climax forest, are a classic {{illustration of the}} concept of ecological succession. Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting shoreline and dunes. The shoreline, the second zone, is formed by wave action and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition, with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new shoreline. The newly formed <b>sandy</b> <b>plain</b> and the ponds formed in it are the third zone. The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind-blown sand or drifting dunes. The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals: for example, the state park is home to 89 species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and Lepidoptera, including 35 different butterflies, as well as 84 different sorts of spiders.|$|E
500|$|According to the DCNR, {{because it}} has so [...] "many unique habitats, Presque Isle {{contains}} {{a greater number of}} the state's endangered, threatened and rare species than any other area of comparable size in Pennsylvania." [...] The DCNR recognizes seven different ecological zones within Presque Isle State Park, each with a different plant and animal community. These zones are: Lake Erie; the beaches and shoreline; <b>sandy</b> <b>plain</b> and ponds; sand dunes and ridges; marshes and old ponds; heath and sub-climax forest; and the climax forest. Lake Erie, which surrounds the park, is the first zone and is home to 80 species of fish and at least six species of crustaceans.|$|E

50|$|Gordy Parkway {{was built}} from <b>Sandy</b> <b>Plains</b> Road (opposite Holly Springs Road) on the {{southwest}} side, clockwise to Shallowford Road on the west, back to <b>Sandy</b> <b>Plains</b> on the northeast side, {{and just a few}} more yards or meters back to Shallowford on the east across from Target (which moved from the former Richway a few miles southwest on <b>Sandy</b> <b>Plains</b> Road at Canton Highway after one was built near Town Center at Cobb). This near-circle allowed hundreds of homes to be built west of <b>Sandy</b> <b>Plains</b> Road, most of the existing forest being clear-cut. The family of Frank Gordy, proprietor of The Varsity, owned much of the land, and the part where the one-building Chattahoochee Tech campus now sits was donated to the county, which in turn provided the land for the state technical college.|$|R

2500|$|The {{coastal plain}} {{consists}} mainly of sand dunes and polders. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern <b>sandy</b> <b>plain</b> of the Campine (Kempen). The thickly forested hills and plateaux of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges.

2500|$|The airport, {{which is}} known officially as the Toulon-Hyères International Airport, is [...] to the {{southeast}} of the town centre, on a <b>sandy</b> <b>plain</b> close to the seashore. The area was first used by private aircraft {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. In 1920, after the marsh had been drained, French naval aircraft used the field, and, in 1925, it became an official base of the French Fleet Air Arm (Aéronavale). It has been a commercial airport since 1966, but the navy maintains a significant facility for helicopters and fixed wing aircraft within the perimeter.|$|E
2500|$|Concord lies fully {{within the}} Merrimack River watershed, and is {{centered}} on the river, which runs from northwest to southeast through the city. Downtown is located on a low terrace {{to the west of}} the river, with residential neighborhoods climbing hills to the west and extending southwards towards the town of Bow. To the east of the Merrimack, atop a [...] bluff, is a flat, <b>sandy</b> <b>plain</b> known as Concord Heights, which has seen most of the city's commercial development since 1960. The eastern boundary of Concord (with the town of Pembroke) is formed by the Soucook River, a tributary of the Merrimack. The Turkey River winds through the southwestern quarter of the city, passing through the campus of St. Paul's School before entering the Merrimack River in Bow. In the northern part of the city, the Contoocook River enters the Merrimack at the village of Penacook. Other village centers in the city include West Concord (actually north of downtown, on the west side of the Merrimack) and East Concord (also north of downtown, but on the east side of the Merrimack).|$|E

2500|$|The lake lies on a <b>sandy</b> <b>plain</b> in the Horowhenua, [...] {{southwest}} of central Levin and [...] from Hokio Beach on the Tasman Sea. It covers , but is shallow, less than [...] deep. The lake {{was once a}} sandy coastal lagoon {{at the mouth of}} the Ohau River, and the forested terraces on its landward side were once sea cliffs. Over time, sand dunes built up, the river changed its course, and the sea retreated, until about 9000 years ago the lagoon was dammed and became a dune lake. The bottom of the lake now consists of 15 m of accumulated silt and mud over the original sand, and preserves layers of volcanic ash from eruptions 8,000 and 5,900 years ago. Fossil pollen suggests it was surrounded by continuous forest even after human settlement of the plains. Lake Papaitonga is fed by groundwater and various small streams and springs, and drained by the Waiwiri Stream. Because it is bordered by forest, the lake is oligotrophic, with low levels of phosphorus and nitrogen. The lake was relatively deep and stable until the 1940s, but with the increase in horticulture nearby and the digging of irrigation bores it is becoming increasingly shallow.|$|E
