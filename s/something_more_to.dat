[...] {{and tries to}} communicate her thoughts to George but, [...] "...his sexual desire kindles her own, and she loses touch with the intellectual, spiritual, and creative potentials of her emotion. At last, however, George begins to perceive that there is <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> be communicated {{between men and women}} than physical encounter..." [...] Yet this lesson is not solidified for the young reporter when, after boasting in a bar in the story [...] "An Awakening", he has a surge of [...] "masculine power" [...] and tries to seduce Belle Carpenter, only to be repelled and humiliated by her beau, the large-fisted bartender, Ed Handby.|$|E
500|$|Following an {{appearance}} {{in an online}} video on feminism, entitled My Choice, {{under the direction of}} Homi Adajania, Padukone took on the role of a headstrong Bengali architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan), in Shoojit Sircar's comedy-drama Piku (2015). Reviews for the film were positive; Tanmaya Nanda of Business Standard praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves [...] "what she is capable of when given <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do than look pretty and be the crazy-dance girl at parties". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she [...] "holds Piku together with a restrained star turn". With a worldwide gross of over , the film emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen.|$|E
500|$|Technologically, the Covenant are {{described}} in [...] and [...] to be imitative rather than innovative—most of the Covenant's sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on Forerunner artifacts, rather than the Covenant's own research. Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize plasma. These weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target. Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted {{that there may be}} <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the Covenant's weaponry, saying [...] "the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but something far more dangerous, arcane, and destructive." [...] A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of [...] "homing in" [...] on organic foes and exploding. A weapons expert noted parallels between the Needler and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{like her}} {{character}} was wasting her college degree O'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha {{go to work}} for Lex during the second season. The producers agreed, but altered the concept so that Martha went to work for Lionel, and that she would use this new position to spy on Lionel and find out what he knows about Clark. Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season, O'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in [...] "Ryan" [...] was that Martha was going to run for Mayor. In O'Toole's opinion, Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence. To the chagrin of O'Toole, Martha's next storyline—the expectation of a new child—tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with. O'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake—something mentally created by Clark's ship—but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant. Ultimately, that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage. Before season four began, O'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha {{go to work for}} Lex. O'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel, because it gave her character <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do, and she wanted to do that again for season four. The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon, which was owned by Lex, and which O'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark's life.|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Don Trip {{grew up in}} the low-income East Memphis. Living in a fatherless household, Trip {{watched as}} his mother worked 3 jobs, and still {{struggled}} to support him along with his brother and sister. At the age of 12, he began working to provide for his siblings, saying that [...] "all we ever had was us." [...] Even at an early age, though, Don Trip was inspired by Jay-Z and Tupac, and even studied Jadakiss verses with an almost religious fervor. At 15, he noticed his family was falling apart, and felt the urge to do <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> help them. Inspired by the pre-teen duo of Kriss Kross, he began rapping and making music.|$|E
2500|$|... {{so much is}} made of the deep, deep exculpatory {{shame of}} illiteracy– {{despite the fact that}} burning 300 people to death doesn't require reading skills– that some worshipful {{accounts}} of the novel (by those who buy into its ludicrous premise, perhaps because it's been declared [...] "classic" [...] and [...] "profound") actually seem to affirm that illiteracy is <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> be ashamed of than participating in mass murder... Lack of reading skills is more disgraceful than listening in bovine silence to the screams of 300 people as they are burned to death behind the locked doors of a church you're guarding to prevent them from escaping the flames. Which is what Hanna did, although, of course, it's not shown in the film.|$|E

2500|$|With its {{pairing of}} an upper-class adventurer with a [...] "trendy" [...] {{woman of the}} 1960s, {{parallels}} have been drawn with competitor ITV's The Avengers. There was also a similarity with Granada's Mr. Rose (1967) in which William Mervyn as a retired police inspector was assisted by a youngish confidential secretary (Gillian Lewis) and a manservant (Donald Webster). However, because Adam Adamant was a last-minute replacement for another concept, {{the degree to which}} the BBC intended such similarities with The Avengers is unclear. One recent statement has directly addressed the issue: [...] However, a reviewer of the 2006 BBC Four retrospective The Cult of ...

Morgan said, [...] "from the minute she clapped eyes on Scott and Charlene's sexy son, it was clear {{they were going to}} get it on. It definitely didn't take them long either." [...] During a review of the year, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised Phillipps for being [...] "a strong actor" [...] and said he deserved [...] "a chance to shine" [...] as Daniel in the new year. Kilkelly bemoaned the lack of challenging storylines for him and hoped he would be given <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do that did not revolve around his relationship with Amber.

But as she spends more time in his company she finds him controlling and selfish and makes the relationship more about him. Oliver does not seem a good match for Zosia in theory. He is [...] "miserable" [...] and [...] "has a lot of baggage" [...] {{following the death of}} his wife Tara Lo (Jing Lusi). But they share a good working relationship and she [...] "gets a thrill out of their banter". The actress added [...] "they are so harmonious on the wards that eventually, they might start to realise there could be <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> it." [...] Arfwedsen was glad to receive the storyline because she wanted Zosia to find love and move on from her troubles with a [...] "positive figure within the hospital".
