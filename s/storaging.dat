5000|$|Conceptually and logistically, the {{simplest}} way of extending the conventional planting season is to extend lifting and planting of fresh stock through summer until the planting program has been competed. There is ample evidence that spruces may be planted successfully throughout the summer, not least the notable operational success of Marek (Personal communication, 1985, George T. Marek, R.P.F., Beardmore, Ontario, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources) in northwestern Ontario: [...] "the success of my plantations is primarily due to different strategies and cool <b>storaging</b> in Beardmore. I have planted all species from spring to late fall, throughout the summer on a large scale, without any difficulties". Summer planting has also been successful {{in a number of}} research studies with white spruce, e.g., Crossley 1956; Ackerman and Johnson 1962; Decie 1962 cited by Revel and Coates 1976; Burgar and Lyon 1968; Mullin 1971, 1974; Revel and Coates 1976. Success depends on minimizing stresses to planting stock at all stages from lifting through planting and on planting when site conditions are conducive to survival and growth.|$|E

The incremental <b>storage</b> is to store all the changed data in a file since the last <b>storage</b> was made. They do this whether the last <b>storage</b> was a full one or an incremental copy. For example, if a full <b>storage</b> was done by node 1, node 2 stores all the changed data of the file after node 1 by the incremental <b>storage.</b> Likewise, node 3 only copies those changed data in the file after node 2 ’s incremental <b>storage.</b> The differential <b>storage</b> copies those changed data in the file since the last full <b>storage</b> took place. For example, if a full <b>storage</b> was done by node 1, node 2 will copy all changed data of the file by the differential <b>storage</b> since node 1 ’s <b>storage</b> copied everything.

The combination of these transporters, which are independent thanks to mid-­‐process buffers, is what will define the total throughput of the system. Their independence, however, makes it too complex to extract easy analytical solution for the system.
