40|$|The {{pursuit of}} <b>Smart</b> <b>Living</b> Technology {{is a recent}} trend in which {{technology}} is applied to daily life to increase efficiency, affordability and sustainability. The principle behind <b>Smart</b> <b>Living</b> Technology is that technology {{should be used to}} advance the needs of human beings and to increase the quality of life by the power of human creativity {{while at the same time}} sustaining the environment for future generations. As such, intelligent networks should be adopted to provide humans with full information to control an individual's personal environment. Wireless technology can play a key role in enabling smart energy monitoring by allowing consumers to make more informed choices and to connect products and devices to a coordinated management system. The development of <b>Smart</b> <b>Living</b> Technology is based on the concept of user driven innovations. Various Living Labs have been established around the world as development centers for extension of this <b>Smart</b> <b>Living</b> Technology. In this paper, the background and current developments of <b>Smart</b> <b>Living</b> Technology are reviewed, followed by real examples taking place in Taiwan. Finally, the focus and future plan for Taiwan are discussed including a strategy for further development of <b>Smart</b> <b>Living</b> Technology in Taiwan...|$|E
40|$|Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) {{are widely}} used in many {{applications}} that require interactions between humans and their physical environment. These systems usually integrate a set of hardware-software components for optimal application execution in terms of performance and energy consumption. The AXIOM project (Agile, eXtensible, fast I/O Module), presented in this paper, proposes a hardware-software platform for CPS coupled with an easy parallel programming model and sufficient connectivity so that the performance can scale-up by adding multiple boards. AXIOM supports a task-based programming model based on OmpSs and leverages a high-speed, inexpensive communication interface called AXIOM-Link. The board also tightly couples the CPU with reconfigurable resources to accelerate portions of the applications.

40|$|We {{applied a}} method called Distinction-Sensitive Learning Vector Quantization (DSLVQ) to the {{classification}} of footsteps. The measurements were made by a pressure-sensitive floor, {{which is part of}} the <b>smart</b> sensing <b>living</b> room in our research laboratory. The aim is to identify walkers based on their single footsteps. DSLVQ is an extended version of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), and it can be used for automated feature scaling and selection during the training of an LVQ codebook. The method shows improvements in the classification accuracies compared to a standard LVQ. In addition, due to its capability of automated input pruning, discarding the non-informative features, it was able to detect automatically the most significant features from a large set of features. This is important in an adaptive identification system, where the informative features might change. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{demands of}} smart visual thing {{recognition}} in various devices have been increased rapidly for daily <b>smart</b> production, <b>living</b> and learning systems in recent years. This paper proposed a visual thing recognition system, which combines binary scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), {{bag of words}} model (BoW), and support vector machine (SVM) by using color information. Since the traditional SIFT features and SVM classifiers only use the gray information, color information is still an important feature for visual thing recognition. With color-based SIFT features and SVM, we can discard unreliable matching pairs and increase the robustness of matching tasks. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed object recognition system with color-assistant SIFT SVM classifier achieves higher recognition rate than that with the traditional gray SIFT and SVM classification in various situations...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{technological}} advances, {{smart home}} concepts are not receiving widespread adoption. Small businesses that install and maintain heating, security and energy-saving systems {{could play a}} major role in bringing advanced technologies to home owners. However, the role of such small installer businesses in the <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> industry is generally overlooked in practice as well as academic literature. This paper studies challenges small installer businesses face when offering smart home and <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> services. A survey, as well as in-depth interviews, are conducted. A main pattern across the findings is that small installers, despite their potential role, are reluctant to be involved in the <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> industry. Lack of knowledge and entrepreneurial skills, limited sharing of knowledge and lack of cooperation hinder small installer businesses to offer <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> services.

40|$|In recent years, forward-thinking {{governments are}} {{attaching}} {{great importance to}} <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> services to enhance {{quality of life for}} people and to create new business opportunities for economic growth. An emerging systematic approach Living Lab commonly explained as a human-centric research and development methodology is getting widely applied to service engineering and business innovations.

40|$|Today’s {{smart home}} {{concepts}} {{are no longer}} limited to home automation, but increasingly involve smart health, energy, security and entertainment services. Such <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> services are typically offered through sector-specific service platforms that are rarely interoperable and not fully standardized. As a result, an overwhelming variety of service platforms for <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> services is currently on the market. The vast majority of these service platforms suffer from disappointing adoption by both consumers and service providers. This paper aims to provide a structured overview of 42 contemporary <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> service platforms for healthcare, energy, security and entertainment services. We find strong differences between the platforms in terms of technology architecture and governance structure. Technologically, some platforms place the intelligence of the technology architecture within a person’s home, while others place it in the telecommunications network or remotely in the cloud. Regarding governance structure, we find that relatively few platforms are completely open for third parties to provide services on {{and most of them}} are partly or even completely closed. The main contribution of the paper is to apply concepts from platform theory to analyse the on-going developments in the <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> domain. We argue that the lack of openness and cross-sectorial interoperability of the service platforms, combined with large differences in the technological architecture, explains why <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> services still struggle to make their way to the market. Based on these findings, we argue that collective action for developing common service platforms that cross traditional industries is needed to break the deadlock of <b>smart</b> <b>living</b> service innovation.

40|$|Apart {{from the}} optimal {{real-time}} electricity price {{to buy the}} electricity, the optimal, time dependent, capacity contracted with the DSO is of crucial importance for concerted charging of electric vehicles in a parking garage. The battery management system, on its turn, imposes constraints on the sequence of steps in which power is transmitted. Maximum power in individual charging steps has to vary {{as a function of}} the state-of-charge to keep an optimal state-of-health of the battery. Finally, the mobility wishes of the car user, given by the desired departure time and SOC will vary. In the PowerMatchingCity <b>Smart</b> Grid <b>living</b> lab [1] a strategy has been developed to optimize the charging strategies of a collection of cars by using a combination of agent-based optimization, using the PowerMatcher [2], and constrained, combinatorial optimization.

Rapid advances in RFID and sensing technologies enable {{the construction of}} wirelessly instrumented space for variety of applications including assisted <b>living,</b> <b>smart</b> manufacturing facilities, intelligent appliances, and more. The wireless and pervasive nature of these technologies provides an opportunity to glean context-specific and sensitive information leading to privacy issues.
