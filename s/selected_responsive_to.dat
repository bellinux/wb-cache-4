40|$|Src kinase is {{recognized}} as a key target for molecular cancer therapy. However, methods <b>to</b> efficiently <b>select</b> patients <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> Src inhibitors are lacking. We explored the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cell lines to the Src kinase inhibitor saracatinib to identify predictive markers of drug sensitivity using gene microarrays. Pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG 1) was selected as a potential biomarker as mRNA levels were correlated with saracatinib resistance, as well as higher PTTG 1 protein expression. PTTG 1 expression was correlated with proliferation, cell division, and mitosis in ovarian cancer tissues data sets. In sensitive cell lines, saracatinib treatment decreased PTTG 1 and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2) protein levels. Downregulating PTTG 1 by siRNAs increased saracatinib sensitivity in two resistant cell lines. Our results indicate PTTG 1 may be a valuable biomarker in ovarian cancer to predict sensitivity to saracatinib, and could {{form the basis of}} a targeted prospective saracatinib trial for ovarian cancer...|$|R
40|$|Objective and Patients: Twenty-four {{pituitary}} adenomas from acromegalic patients (13 females, 11 males; {{age range}} 19 - 65 yr) were characterized for somatostatin receptor subtype 2 A (sst 2 A), dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R), GH, and prolactin (PRL) expression by immunohistochemistry, and results {{correlated with the}} in vitro and in vivo hormone responses to octreotide and quinagolide. In nine cases, GH and PRL content was further studied by immunoelectron microscopy. Results: Immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively scored as 2 (> 50 % stained cells), 1 (10 - 50 % stained cells), and 0 (< 10 % stained cells). Sst 2 Awas scored as 2 in 13 cases, 1 in 10, and 0 in one; D 2 R was scored as 2 in 13 cases, 1 in nine, and 0 in 2; GH was 2 in 15 cases and 1 in nine; PRL was 2 in six cases, 1 in 13, and 0 in 5. Sst 2 A{{was positively correlated with}} in vitro (P = 0. 003) and in vivo (P = 0. 006) percent GH suppression by octreotide and with the chronic suppression of IGF-I by somatostatin analogs (P = 0. 008). D 2 R was positively correlated with in vitro percent GH (P = 0. 000) and PRL (P = 0. 005) suppression by quinagolide. Electron microscopy revealed two pure somatotroph adenomas, five somatomammotrophs with a variable coexpression of GH and PRL in the same cells, and two tumors consisting of mixed cell types, which were less sensitive to quinagolide and octreotide. Conclusion: Sst 2 Aand D 2 R are frequently coexpressed in adenomas from acromegalic patients, and immunohistochemistry may be helpful in characterizing receptor expression in pituitary adenomas <b>to</b> <b>select</b> patients <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> different treatments.

40|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} {{is a major}} psychiatric condition that affects up to 1 % {{of the general population}} and results in episodes of mania and depression. Genetic epidemiologic studies have consistently shown that genetic factors {{play an important role in}} the etiology of bipolar disorder, however, the precise mechanisms that increase the susceptibility to this condition are not known. In the past three decades, several studies have been carried out hoping to identify major genes. However, conflicting results between and within studies that do not replicate previous findings have constituted a major problem. It is believed that part of this problem is related to genetic heterogeneity. We have attempted to reduce heterogeneity by <b>selecting</b> patients <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> longterm lithium treatment. There is compelling evidence that selecting patients according to lithium response may help define a more genetically homogeneous subgroup of bipolar patients. This evidence is based on the fact that lithium is more effective in bipolar patients with classical symptomatology and the absence of comorbidity. Similarly, nonresponders to lithium treatment are different with respect to neuroendocrine responses and family history from responders, who are more likely to have relatives affected with bipolar disorder than lithium nonresponders. Using association and linkage designs, we have studied 31 lithium responsive bipolar families and 138 unrelated lithium responsive bipolar patients and 163 normal controls. We used a candidate gene as well as a whole-genome scan approach. In the genome scan study, significant evidence for linkage was found with a locus on chromosome 15 q 14, and suggestive linkage with a locus on 7 q 11. In the candidate gene studies, we found preliminary evidence suggesting that a variant of PLCG 1, a gene that codes for phospholipase C gamma 1, is associated with bipolar disorder. Our results provide evidence that these loci may confer susceptibility <b>to</b> lithium <b>responsive</b> bi...|$|R
30|$|To date, only {{gemcitabine}} plus cisplatin {{has been}} accepted for first-line therapy for unresectable biliary tract cancer [3], and the subsequent challenges fail to establish the next promising therapeutic agent [11, 12]. S 1 treatment might be effective for some patients if we can select the good responder to S 1 treatment or arrange the optimal dose of drug [13]. In this case, S 1 treatment plus radiotherapy was eventually effective. However, {{it was difficult to}} determine when adjuvant S 1 treatment was finished. The patient hoped to keep the S 1 treatment, and we continued it for more than 2  years. Translational research is required for finding the biomarker <b>selecting</b> those patients <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> 5 -FU based treatment or the new strategy of how to use 5 -FU based chemotherapeutic agent and how long to continue the treatment. Since the efficacy of radiotherapy alone is limited in terms of the locoregional therapy, the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems to be best additional option to control residual cancer cells at the locoregional area as well as latent cells in distant organ. Furthermore, postoperative complications postpone the chance of adjuvant chemotherapy resulting in the propagation of residual cancer cells. In this sense, neoadjuvant supportive treatment might {{be the best way to}} control microscopic cancer cells both around the main tumor and in distant organ, which are hard to eradicate by surgery alone. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus liver transplantation provided promising outcome for patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma [14].|$|R
40|$|Cold {{acclimation}} {{is important}} for crop survival in environments undergoing seasonal low temperatures. It involves the induction of defensive mechanisms including the accumulation of different cryoprotective molecules among which are dehydrins (DHN). Recently several sequences coding for dehydrins were identified in white clover (Trifolium repens). This work aimed <b>to</b> <b>select</b> the most <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> cold stress DHN analogues in search for cold stress diagnostic markers. The assessment of dehydrin transcript accumulation via RT-PCR and immunodetection performed with three antibodies against the conserved K-, Y-, and S-segment allowed to outline different dehydrin types presented in the tested samples. Both analyses confirmed that YnKn dehydrins were underrepresented in the controls but exposure to low temperature specifically induced their accumulation. Strong immunosignals corresponding to 37 – 40 kDa with antibodies against Y- and K-segment were revealed in cold-stressed leaves. Another ‘cold-specific’ band at position 52 – 55 kDa was documented on membranes probed with antibodies against K-segment. Real time RT-qPCR confirmed that low temperatures induced the accumulation of SKn and YnSKn transcripts in leaves and reduced their expression in roots. Results suggest that a YnKn dehydrin transcript with GenBank ID: KC 247805 and the immunosignal at 37 – 40 kDa, obtained with antibodies against Y- and K-segment are reliable markers for cold stress in white clover. The assessment of SKn (GenBank ID: EU 846208) and YnSKn (GenBank ID: KC 247804) transcript levels in leaves could serve as additional diagnostic tools...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{subjected}} to spring freezes {{are usually not}} acclimated sufficiently long to confer tolerance to sub-zero freezing stress in contrast to fall-grown plants which experience an acclimation period. Barley (L.) periodically suffers from late spring freezes in areas throughout the world, with significant yield loss. We examined the response of ‘Dicktoo’ and ‘Keunal’ barley varieties to non-acclimated freezing (NAF) (− 3 °C) at the jointing stage using the barley 22 K Affymetrix GeneChip to measure transcript abundances. Dicktoo was tolerant of NAF freezing {{for a longer period}} of time than Keunal, and had substantially more variable microarray probesets under the NAF treatment. Three hundred and thirteen probesets were <b>selected</b> as <b>responsive</b> genes <b>to</b> NAF based on their differential response in Dicktoo vs. Keunal. Seventy-one of these probesets had homology-based annotations, with 49 of them showing reduced transcript levels in Dicktoo NAF vs. Dicktoo control, Keunal control, and Keunal NAF treatments, and 22 showing increased transcript levels. Transcription factors, circadian related genes, and other genes involved in photoperiod response were represented among the probesets upregulated in Dicktoo NAF compared to Keunal NAF, while genes involved in RNA metabolism and water and sugar transport were downregulated. The transcriptome response of both Dicktoo and Keunal to NAF also differed from acclimation-based freezing treatments, with 43 % of Dicktoo NAF and 37 % of Keunal NAF probesets unique...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the AMPK activator AICAR as compared to somatostatin- 14 on cell viability and GH secretion in human GH-secreting pituitary adenomas in vitro and in rat GH 3 cells. Overnight treatment with AICAR increased phospho-(threonine- 172) AMPK levels (activated AMPK) in cultured human adenomas. As to the effects on cell viability, four adenomas out of 15 were <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> AICAR (0. 4 mM) and five adenomas were <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> SS- 14 (100 nM). One adenoma was <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> both somatostatin and AICAR. The effects of cotreatment with SS- 14 and AICAR were investigated in eight adenomas. In two adenomas, the effects of AICAR + SS- 14 did not exceed the effect of AICAR. In two adenomas which were not <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> either AICAR or SS- 14, the cotreatment was able to reduce cell viability versus control. Two adenomas were not <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> any treatment. As to the effects on GH secretion, nine adenomas out of 15 were <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> AICAR. Twelve adenomas were <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> SS- 14. Eight adenomas were <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> both AICAR and SS- 14. Cotreatment exceeded the effect of single treatments in 4 out of 10 adenomas. In GH 3 cells, AICAR reduced the activity of p 70 S 6 kinase, which {{plays an important role in}} cell growth. SS- 14 did not affect significantly AMPK phosphorylation and p 70 S 6 K activity but it was able to enhance the inhibitory effect of AICAR on phospho-S 6 levels.
