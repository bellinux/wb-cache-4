5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> a local grain {{elevator}} {{for his second}} crop of the season. He then saved <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|The group stage draw {{was held}} on September 10, 2016. Each group would have one team from pool 1, which {{comprised}} the number one <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> South Korea, China, Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau, and North America; one team from pool 3, which comprised the two international wild cards and the number three <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> Europe and North America; and two teams from pool 2, which comprised all the other teams.|$|E

50|$|The {{four teams}} in the North Division and top four {{finishers}} from the South Division were seeded one through four based on regular season records, with first round matchups of the top <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the North and the fourth <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the South, the second <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the North against the third <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the South, and so on. The winners advanced in the winners' bracket, while first round losers played elimination games. The format means that one team from the South, Florida A&M, {{was not in the}} field. Savannah State claimed the top <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the South over Bethune-Cookman by tiebreaker.|$|R
50|$|The 1987 tournament was a 4-team double-elimination tournament, with seeds {{determined}} by conference regular season winning percentage within each division. The top <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> each division played the second <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the opposite {{division in the}} first round. Iowa claimed the second <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the West by tiebreaker.|$|R
50|$|The 1982 tournament was a 4-team double-elimination tournament, with seeds {{determined}} by conference regular season winning percentage within each division. Ohio State claimed the top <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the East {{by winning the}} season series over Michigan. The top <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> each division played the second <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the opposite division in the first round.|$|R
5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. <b>Seeds</b> <b>from</b> {{these plants}} are noted for their oil content, but little {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.|$|E
5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{is found}} in weeds that come to share {{characteristics}} with a domesticated plant through artificial selection. It is named after Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov. Selection against the weed may occur either by manually killing the weed, or by separating its <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> those of the crop by winnowing.|$|E
5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> {{each other and the}} follicle walls.|$|E

5|$|It {{is one of}} 26 {{vascular}} {{plants on}} Nihoa, 17 of which are indigenous, six alien, and three endemic only to Nihoa, including A. brownii, the Nihoa fan palm or loulu, and the Nihoa carnation. A. brownii is considered the rarest plant on Nihoa {{and has not been}} directly observed on the island since 1983. Past expeditions collected plant samples and seeds, but no specimens have managed to survive ex-situ conservation efforts outside of its native habitat. There are no known plants or <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> A. brownii in any botanical gardens.|$|E
5|$|Such {{behavior}} has been witnessed, {{as well as}} documented from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly from the trees. The discovery of this unexpected part of the American alligator diet further reveals that American alligators {{may be responsible for}} spreading <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> the fruit it digests across its habitat. Additionally, American alligators engage in what seems to be cooperative hunting.|$|E
5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> Monsanto's patent.|$|E
50|$|The {{top four}} {{finishers}} in each division were seeded one through four, {{with the top}} <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> each division facing the fourth <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the opposite division in the first round, and so on. Alcorn State claimed the second <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the East by tiebreaker over Alabama State. The teams played a two bracket, double-elimination tournament with a one-game final between the winners of each bracket.|$|R

50|$|The top two {{finishers}} {{from each}} division, based on conference winning percentage only, {{participated in the}} tournament. The top <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> each division played the second <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the other division in the double-elimination tournament.|$|R
5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (<b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|More than 600 archeological {{sites have}} been found inside the {{boundaries}} of Petrified Forest National Park. Evidence suggests that the earliest inhabitants of the park arrived at least 8,000 years ago. Two Folsom-type spear points, the earliest artifacts of Paleo-Indians found in the park, are at least that old. Between 6000BCE and 1CE, the Archaic–Early Basketmaker Era, nomadic groups established seasonal camps in the Petrified Forest from which they hunted small game such as rabbits, pronghorn antelope, and deer and harvested <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> Indian ricegrass and other wild plants. Around 150BCE, they began to grow corn in the area. By 1CE, as their farming techniques improved, some built houses in the Petrified Forest and began to stay there year-round.|$|E
50|$|The playoffs {{consist of}} two best-of-five divisional series and two best-of-five interdivisional series {{to decide which}} teams will earn a {{promotion}} to the Liga A. On the promotion semifinals, the higher <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the South semifinals winners faces the lower <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the North semifinals winners, and the higher <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the North semifinals winners faces the lower <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the South semifinals winners. The winners from the interdivision semifinals define {{the first of the}} two promotions while the losers compete in another best-of-five series where the winner faces the TNA Finals loser in a five-game series for the second promotion to the Liga A.|$|R
50|$|The 1981 tournament was a 4-team double-elimination tournament, with seeds {{determined}} by conference regular season winning percentage within each division.

5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> a wide variety of annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|The {{cockatoo}} feeds {{primarily on}} seeds of proteaceous {{plants such as}} Banksia, Hakea and Grevillea, and secondarily on <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> myrtaceous plants such as Eucalyptus and Corymbia. Over fifty native plant species are commonly used for food, either as seed or flowers, and this includes western sheoak (Allocasuarina fraseriana), orange wattle (Acacia saligna), and balga (Xanthorrhoea preissii). Typically, Carnaby's black cockatoos sit in the crowns of trees cracking the seed pods or cones. First, a bird chews through the stem holding the item before holding it with its foot and tearing bits off and extracting the seed. Birds may move along the branches breaking stems at random as well. Occasionally they forage for fallen seed and fruit on the ground. This cockatoo acts as an agent in biological control, eating the larvae of invertebrates such as wood-boring insects and moths from rare plants.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{descriptions of}} the tree of heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to Europe by the French Jesuit Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville. D'Incarville had sent <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> Peking via Siberia to his botanist friend Bernard de Jussieu in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d'Incarville {{were thought to be}} from the economically important and similar looking Chinese varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), which he had observed in the lower Yangtze region, rather than the tree of heaven. D'Incarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to Philip Miller, the superintendent at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{occurs in}} all types of woodlands and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives in}} many habitats, {{including}} deserts, forests, woodland and urban areas. They nest underground below logs, stones, twigs, and shrubs, or in decayed wooden stumps, and are sometimes found living in termite mounds. They {{are among the}} first insects {{to be found in}} burnt-off areas after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain presents no threat to colonies {{as long as it is}} a light shower in continuous sunshine. The green-head ant is diurnal, active throughout the day, preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as honeydew from sap-sucking insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal, scattering and consuming <b>seeds</b> <b>from</b> a variety of species. Predators include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and a number of bird species.|$|E

5000|$|Selections {{are made}} based on progeny test {{performance}} instead of phenotypic {{appearance of the}} parental plants. <b>Seed</b> <b>from</b> selected half-sibs, which have been pollinated by random pollen from the population (meaning that only the female parent is known and selected, hence the term [...] "half-sib") is grown in unreplicated progeny rows {{for the purpose of}} selection. A part of the seed is planted to determine the yielding ability, or breeding value, for any character of each plant. The <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the most productive rows or remnant <b>seed</b> <b>from</b> the outstanding half-sibs is bulked to complete one cycle of selection.|$|R
