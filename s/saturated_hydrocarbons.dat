5|$|Carbon–hydrogen bond {{activation}} (C–H activation) {{is an area}} {{of research}} on reactions that cleave carbon–hydrogen bonds, which were traditionally regarded as unreactive. The first reported successes at activating C–H bonds in <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> published in 1982, used organometallic iridium complexes that undergo an oxidative addition with the hydrocarbon.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
25|$|Different type {{of asphalt}} have been used: blown bitumen (partly {{oxidized}} with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation, and harder) and direct distillation bitumen (softer). Blown bitumens like Mexphalte, {{with a high}} content of <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen, with a low content of <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
30|$|Since the {{question}} of the oil saturation of the Paleocene sediments within the Blagodarnenskaya structure is considered for the first time, it is important to confirm the type of <b>saturating</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> Unfortunately, the absence of acoustic and gamma-density tools at the time of logging does not allow to draw a conclusion about the type of <b>saturating</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> by the characteristic separations between the readings of acoustic, neutron- and density-logging instruments. However, since the reservoirs of the Paleocene sediments of the Blagodarnenskaya structure represent siltstones of turbidite origin clamped in source rocks, conclusions on the type of <b>saturating</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> can be made from geochemical studies of core samples by the means of source rock pyrolysis.|$|R

40|$|We present {{accelerator}} {{mass spectrometry}} (AMS) radiocarbon dates on several organic fractions isolated from tropical guano deposits recovered from insular Southeast Asia. Differences were observed between 14 C measurements made on bulk guano {{as well as}} bulk lipids, the <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fraction, solvent-extracted guano, and insect cuticles extracted from the same bulk sample. We infer that 14 C dates from the bulk lipid fraction and <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fractions can be variably contaminated by exogenous carbon. In contrast, 14 C measurements on solvent-extracted guano and isolated insect cuticles appear to yield the most robust age determinations...|$|R

50|$|Being a fully benzenoid PAH {{means that}} {{triphenylene}} {{is much more}} resonance stable than its isomers chrysene, benzaanthracene, benzocphenanthrene, and tetracene. This makes {{it much more difficult}} to hydrogenate to the <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 3-Ethylpentane (C7H16) is a branched, <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> It is an alkane, {{and one of}} {{the many}} {{structural}} isomers of heptane, consisting of a five carbon chain with a two carbon branch at the middle carbon.|$|R
50|$|The {{placeholder}} R {{is often}} used as a generic placeholder for alkyl (<b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon)</b> group side chains in chemical structure diagrams. To indicate other non-carbon groups in structure diagrams, X, Y, or Z are often used.|$|R
25|$|The cycloalkanes, {{also known}} as naphthenes, are <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> which have one or more carbon rings to which {{hydrogen}} atoms are attached according to the formula CnH2n. Cycloalkanes have similar properties to alkanes but have higher boiling points.|$|E
25|$|Petroleum-derived diesel is {{composed}} of about 75% <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (primarily paraffins including n, iso, and cycloparaffins), and 25% aromatic hydrocarbons (including naphthalenes and alkylbenzenes). The average chemical formula for common diesel fuel is C12H24, ranging approximately from C10H20 to C15H28.|$|E
25|$|The alkanes, {{also known}} as paraffins, are <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with {{straight}} or branched chains which contain only carbon and hydrogen and have the general formula CnH2n+2. They generally have from 5 to 40 carbon atoms per molecule, although trace amounts of shorter or longer molecules may {{be present in the}} mixture.|$|E
25|$|Besides this {{standard}} definition by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, in some authors' usage the term alkane {{is applied to}} any <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the cycloalkanes) or polycyclic.|$|R
2500|$|The IUPAC {{nomenclature}} (systematic way {{of naming}} compounds) for alkanes {{is based on}} identifying <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains. Unbranched, <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix [...] "-ane".|$|R
5000|$|Cuneane (C8H8, Pentacyclo2,4.03,7.06,8octane) is a <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> Its name {{is derived}} from the Latin cuneus, meaning a wedge.

25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} {{offers a}} number of advantages over other polymerization methods and in general. The most significant advantage of plasma polymerization {{is its ability to}} produce polymer films of organic compounds that do not polymerize under normal chemical polymerization conditions. Nearly all monomers, even <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and organic compounds without a polymerizable structure such as a double bond, can be polymerized with this technique.|$|E
25|$|Bond length: Hyperconjugation is {{suggested}} {{as a key}} factor in shortening of sigma bonds (σ bonds). For example, the single C–C bonds in 1,3-butadiene and methylacetylene are approximately 1.46 angstrom in length, much less than the value of around 1.54Å found in <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> For butadiene, this can be explained as normal conjugation of the two alkenyl parts. But for methylacetylene, hyperconjugation between the alkyl and alkynyl parts.|$|E
25|$|The chief use of ethane is the {{production}} of ethene (ethylene) by steam cracking. When diluted with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (900nbsp&°C or more), heavy hydrocarbons break down into lighter hydrocarbons, and <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> become unsaturated. Ethane is favored for ethene production because the steam cracking of ethane is fairly selective for ethene, while the steam cracking of heavier hydrocarbons yields a product mixture poorer in ethene and richer in heavier alkenes (olefins), such as propene (propylene) and butadiene, and in aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
5000|$|Methylcyclohexane is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the molecular formula is CH3C6H11. Classified as <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> it is a colourless liquid {{with a faint}} odor. Methylcyclohexane {{is used as a}} solvent. It is mainly converted in naphtha reformers to toluene.|$|R
50|$|Capillary {{action can}} obscure the true water contact in {{permeable}} media like sandstone. Capillary pressure prevents the hydrocarbons from expelling {{all of the}} water in the pores, which creates a transition zone between the fully <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> levels and the fully saturated water levels.|$|R
30|$|The {{oil content}} was {{measured}} using an infrared photometric method (MEP-China 1996). <b>Saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> content, aromatic compounds, resin and asphaltene were analyzed using the Chinese national standard NB/SH/T 0509 - 2010 methodology (NEA-China 2010). The organic composition was characterized using a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) following the method of Wang et al. (2016 a, b).|$|R
25|$|Steam {{cracking}} is a petrochemical {{process in}} which <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter alkenes (or commonly olefins), including ethene (or ethylene) and propene (or propylene). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethane, propane or butane is thermally cracked {{through the use of}} steam in a bank of pyrolysis furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons. The products obtained depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time.|$|E

40|$|The {{photoluminescence}} of diamondoids in {{the solid}} state is examined. All of the diamondoids {{are found to}} photoluminesce readily with initial excitation wavelengths ranging from 233 nm to 240 nm (5. 3 eV). These excitation energies are more than 1 eV lower than any previously studied <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> material. The emission {{is found to be}} heavily shifted from the absorption, with emission wavelengths of roughly 295 nm (4. 2 eV) in all cases. In the dissolved state, however, no uorescence is observed for excitation wavelengths as short as 200 nm. We also discuss predictions and measurements of the quantum yield. Our predictions indicate that the maximum yield may be as high as 25 %. Our measurement of one species, diamantane, gives a yield of 11 %, the highest ever reported for a <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> even though it was likely not at the optimal excitation wavelength...|$|R

2500|$|The {{physical}} properties of alkenes and alkanes are similar. [...] They are colourless, nonpolar, combustable, and almost odorless. [...] The physical state depends on molecular mass: like the corresponding <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> the simplest alkenes, ethene, propene, and butene are gases at room temperature. Linear alkenes of approximately five to sixteen carbons are liquids, and higher alkenes are waxy solids.|$|E
2500|$|In {{petrochemical}} processes, hydrogenation is used {{to convert}} alkenes and aromatics into saturated alkanes (paraffins) and cycloalkanes (naphthenes), which are less toxic and less reactive. Relevant to liquid fuels that are stored sometimes for long periods in air, <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> exhibit superior storage properties. [...] On the other hand, alkene tend to form hydroperoxides, which can form gums that interfere with fuel handing equipment. [...] For example, mineral turpentine is usually hydrogenated. Hydrocracking of heavy residues into diesel is another application. In isomerization and catalytic reforming processes, some hydrogen pressure is maintained to hydrogenolyze coke formed on the catalyst and prevent its accumulation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the term}} [...] "aromatic" [...] was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. [...] Hofmann used the term for a class [...] of benzene compounds, many of which have odors (aromas), unlike pure <b>saturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Aromaticity as a chemical property bears no general relationship with the olfactory properties of such compounds (how they smell), although in 1855, before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood, chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants, such as terpenes, had chemical properties that we recognize today are similar to unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene.|$|E
