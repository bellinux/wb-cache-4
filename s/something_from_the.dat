5|$|In Bangladesh, {{scores in}} the nineties against both the President's XI and Bangladesh A were {{followed}} by a century in the first Test, and 60 in the second. He scored one half century in the three ODIs, although England only used five batsman in the comfortable victories. England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted {{to take control of}} the match with 70 at Colombo, as England tried to get <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> series, but was also criticised for his poor catching.|$|E
5|$|Trondheim {{is later}} {{attacked}} by a Norwegian pirate whaler named Olafsson, who has not aged despite being on the ship {{for the past two}} days. Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to age unnaturally. Scully develops a theory that the Ardent is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, and that it has caused free radicals to rapidly oxidize their bodies and age them. When Mulder notices that the ship's sewage pipe is the only one not corroded through, the agents realize that <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ocean contaminated the Ardents potable water and led to the aging; Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from the sewage system. Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson after he reveals the secret, and sets out to keep the water for himself.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} {{preceding}} his death, {{with the knowledge}} of his imminent demise, Houston talked at length with his old friend Lee Hays, who recorded their sessions for a project he dubbed The Cisco Tapes.

25|$|This, at least, {{is how the}} biographer has it. The whole {{section of}} the vita dealing with Lucius' debaucheries (HA Verus 4.46.6) is an {{insertion}} into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source. Some few passages seem genuine; others take and elaborate <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original. The rest is by the biographer himself, relying on nothing better than his own imagination.|$|E

They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often {{more a matter of}} how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others needs in doing so that is troubling—and how others react to all of this.|$|E
25|$|The third {{invasion}} {{was stopped}} with the improbable French {{victory in the}} Battle of Carillon, in which 3,600 Frenchmen defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia, and Indian allies outside the fort which the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga. Abercrombie saved <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe. Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst, victor at Louisbourg.|$|E

25|$|Hoping to gain <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> exercise, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees {{announced}} that the NICC would be reconvened on 3 February 1976. However, {{a series of meetings}} held between the UUUC and the SDLP failed to reach any agreement about SDLP participation in government, and so the reconvened NICC once again failed to achieve a solution with cross-community support. As a result, Rees announced the dissolution of the body on 4 March 1976 and Northern Ireland remained under direct rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} multiplied as directors' {{personal involvement}} and commitments were disclosed, but the creditors {{were interested in}} retrieving <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mess, and after considerable negotiation an agreement was reached, ratified as the Neath & Brecon Amalgamation and Arrangement Act of 26 July 1869. This authorised the conversion of debts into 6% debentures and extinguished nearly all other claims against the company. The 1867 Act granting additional capital was repealed, and the authorised capital was now £1,280,000. The line {{was said to have}} really cost £300,000 in cash.|$|E
25|$|After {{becoming}} {{better known}} for his writing than his painting in the 1920s and early 1930s, he returned to more concentrated work on visual art, and paintings from the 1930s and 1940s constitute some of his best-known work. The Surrender of Barcelona (1936–37) makes a significant statement about the Spanish Civil War. It was included in an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in 1937 that Lewis hoped would re-establish {{his reputation as a}} painter. After the publication in The Times of a letter of support for the exhibition, asking that <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> show be purchased for the national collection (signed by, among others, Stephen Spender, W. H. Auden, Geoffrey Grigson, Rebecca West, Naomi Mitchison, Henry Moore and Eric Gill) the Tate Gallery bought the painting, Red Scene. Like others from the exhibition, it shows an influence from Surrealism and de Chirico's Metaphysical Painting. Lewis was highly critical of the ideology of Surrealism, but admired the visual qualities of some Surrealist art.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950–51 Ashes series the MCC {{tour manager}} Freddie Brown arrived at Melbourne for the Fifth and final Test having lost the series 4–0, but won the match {{and won a}} great ovation from the Australian crowd who admired his {{fighting}} spirit throughout the series. He now arrived with Peter May's team hoping {{to do the same}} and the players were keen to salvage <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tour. Arthur Milton was sent home with his broken finger, Brian Statham and Peter Loader had been injured in a car accident when their tyre blew, Godfrey Evans was still recovering from his broken finger and Willie Watson suffered a groin strain bowling in the nets. This reduced the touring team to 13 fit players, but Jim Laker was ready to play and returned to the team with Ted Dexter and Roy Swetman. Tony Lock's 5 wickets had cost 75.20 and was dropped in favour of debutant off-spinner John Mortimore. This was a surprise for the Australians, but even more so to Lock, who heard the news on the radio. The home team dropped batsman Les Favell in favour of the fast bowler Ian Meckiff whose bruised foot had healed. Mel McInnes was replaced as umpire by Les Townsend in his only Test as umpire.|$|E
25|$|John's {{children}} were trained rigorously growing up. His {{plan was to}} have an intelligent son who could take his place as king, a strategically married daughter, and well-prepared statesmen sons; but he would achieve only part of his goal. From her birth, Infanta Maria Barbara's marriage had been closely arranged and monitored by John. When the engagement of Mariana Victoria of Spain to Louis XV of France was nullified, John proposed Infanta Maria Barbara as a possible bride for Louis XV, {{but in the end}} she was refused. John still managed to gain <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dissolution of the engagement between Louis XV and Mariana Victoria, i.e., a wife for his son Prince José and a husband for Infanta Maria Barbara, Mariana Victoria's older brother Fernando, Prince of Asturias. Negotiations between Portugal and Spain began in 1725, and four years later John's eldest children would be matched with their spouses-to-be. The princesses Maria Barbara and Mariana Victoria were exchanged at a ceremony, called the Exchange of the Princesses (Troca das Princesas), held on the Caia River on 19 January 1729. Prince José married Mariana Victoria on 19 January 1729 in Elvas, and Infanta Maria Barbara married Prince Fernando on 20 January 1729 in Badajoz.|$|E
500|$|His {{description}} {{of the river and}} the countryside betray the influence of the Post-Impressionist style. Hemingway was heavily influenced by the modernists. He often visited the Musée du Luxembourg, where he saw three Cézanne paintings, L'Estaque, Cour d'une ferme, and Les Peupliers. [...] A series of Cézanne watercolors were exhibited at Berheim-Jeune Gallery before he began writing the story. Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that he had been [...] "learning <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> painting of Cézanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions that I was trying to put in them." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Smith, the album's lyrics had a {{negative}} impact on the band's later career. In 1984, Motown Records expressed interest in signing the band to a new UK division, with a provisional offer of a £46,000 up-front advance. A label executive asked to hear <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fall's back catalogue, but Hex was the only album Smith had available; he remembered thinking, [...] "when he hears that, we've had it." [...] The rejection letter stated that the label saw [...] "no commercial potential in this band whatsoever". Smith believes this was due to the [...] "obligatory niggers" [...] line from the opening track [...] "The Classical".|$|E

They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E

500|$|Make-up artist Greg Cannom {{was pleased}} to be {{involved}} in Hannibal as it offered him the chance to produce [...] "incredible and original make-ups". For Mason Verger, the make-up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring, and not <b>something</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> [...] "House of Wax". Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors {{in an effort to get}} the look of the character as realistic as possible. Scott showed the make-up team pictures of foetal things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn’t lost his sense of humour...almost sympathetic. Oldman would spend six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role.|$|E
500|$|Dean Piper for the Daily Mirror {{called the}} song [...] "fantastic" [...] {{claiming}} that Roberts [...] "means business with her debut solo material", and saying {{he could not}} [...] "get enough of the single", calling it [...] "classic pop, fresh and fantastic."

In response to the general acclaim from critics, Roberts wished that the track would be well received amongst her peers, saying [...] "I haven't seen one bad review from the single or album samplers – it seems {{too good to be}} true. The response from critics has been amazing. It's like being at school and being told ‘well done’ by the teachers but I want my classmates to like it too.
