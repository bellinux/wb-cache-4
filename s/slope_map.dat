Digital elevation models (DEMs) are often used to map important topographic parameters such as slope. However, the quality of such maps depends {{on the quality of}} the DEM’s representation of the earth’s surface. In many cases errors in this representation are neither measured nor estimated. In this paper a real-time differential GPS is used to acquire ground truth data. This ground truth is compared with DEMs generated from contours. This analysis shows that three commonly used contour-based interpolation procedures all produce good quality DEMs. When considering the replacement of more traditional <b>slope</b> <b>maps</b> based on field mapping or air photo and contour interpretation with DEM-derived <b>slope</b> <b>maps,</b> it is important to establish that DEM-derived <b>slope</b> <b>maps</b> do represent an improvement on existing approaches.

Terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) find rapidly growing interest in remote sensing and photogrammetry field as efficient tools for fast and reliable threedimensional (3 D) point cloud data acquisition. The TLS technology is based on the reflectorless and contactless acquisition of a point cloud of the topography using the time-of-flight distance measurement of an infrared laser pulse.

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{the direct}} calculation of topographic <b>slope</b> <b>maps</b> from {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) interferograms is presented. The algorithm derives <b>slope</b> <b>maps</b> without first requiring {{the creation of a}} digital elevational model (DEM) from the interferogram, thus obviating the need for high SNR in the interferogram and altitude calibration points for the scene. SAR data useful for interferometry has been collected by the Active Microwave Imager on board the ERS- 1 satellite, when it was in a short period repeat orbit. Two passes of the radar sensor form a cross-track interferometric baseline. For a point target at some position (x,y,h), the interferometric phase difference phi is proportional to the difference in path lengths for the two sensor positions to the scatterer. Given the phase difference as measured in the complex interferogram and an accurate baseline geometry, the position of the scatterer, most significantly the height h, can be determined through triangulation. The interferometric phase measurement however is known only modulo 2 -pi, and hence it is necessary to determine the correct multiple of 2 -pi to add to the phase at each point to obtain an estimate of the actual phase with respect to an absolute datum. This phase unwrapping process is required for creating DEM's, and is difficult or impossible for regions of low SNR or SAR image layover.

Therefore, a scientific approach needs to be carried out to determine the accuracy level of the result.

Two efficient albeit relatively simple algorithms for modelling glacier dynamics using spaceborne INSAR data have been devised and tested as alternatives to the conventional DINSAR approach. Neither of the algorithms involves the procedure of interferometric phase unwrapping, thus excluding the areal error propagation and improving the modelling accuracy. In general, they remain feasible even under significant phase noise. An original gradient approach (GINSAR) to differential processing of repeat-pass SAR interferograms based on the calculation of interferometric phase gradients, the generation of glacier <b>slope</b> <b>maps</b> and the analysis of differences between multitemporal <b>slope</b> <b>maps</b> provides global and fast solutions to unsupervised glacier change detection and ice motion estimation.

Generally, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) {{such as those}} generated from the HiRISE images on Mars are preferred to generate detailed slopes with a better fidelity of terrain features. Unfortunately, high-resolution datasets normally only cover small area and are not always available. While lower resolution datasets, such as MOLA, provide global coverage of the Martian surface.

In order to carry out slope analysis at large scale on Martian surface based low-resolution data such as MOLA data, while alleviating the smoothness problem of slopes due to its low resolution, this paper presents an amplifying function of slopes derived from low-resolution DEMs based on the relationships between DEM resolutions and slopes.
