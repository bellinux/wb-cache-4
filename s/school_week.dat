He was especially remembered for his dedication to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team, attending nearly every game including those taking place out-of-state. Outside of Georgia Tech, Brittain taught Sunday school classes and maintained active membership {{in a number of}} service organizations. Brittain retired from his position as president of Georgia Tech in 1944, after which he penned a history of the Institute entitled The Story of Georgia Tech, completed in 1948. He died in 1953, survived by three children: McDonald, Marion Luther, Jr., and Ida, three grandsons, and a great-granddaughter. Flags at the university were flown at half-staff for a month in remembrance of Brittain, and classes were cancelled {{for the rest of the}} <b>school</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ferguson-Florissant School District, Missouri: On August 13, in {{response}} to the continuing unrest in the community, Ferguson-Florissant schools that were to open Thursday were closed and scheduled to reopen on Monday. On Sunday Aug 17, the school district again cancelled the first day of classes due to ongoing unrest. On Monday, administrators for the district announced that school would continue to be closed {{through the end of the}} <b>school</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tryouts for Kids Week, Holiday Kids Week, and Back to <b>School</b> <b>Week</b> are {{slightly}} different {{in that the}} mock Jeopardy! game is played before the thirty-question test is given. During the mock game, coordinators sometimes open up triple stumper questions to the other potential contestants. Potential contestants are called or notified by the station on which Jeopardy! airs in that particular market. Fifteen children who are between ten and twelve years old are chosen for each filming, along with one alternate.|$|E
30|$|Because {{global network}} {{analysis}} reveals that <b>school</b> <b>weeks</b> and break weeks have different network structures, with <b>school</b> <b>weeks</b> having more meaningful structures than break weeks (“Results” section), henceforth, we {{focus only on}} <b>school</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|R
30|$|Second, <b>school</b> <b>weeks</b> {{and break}} weeks have {{different}} average clustering coefficients, average shortest path lengths, and modularities (Fig.  3). But focusing either only on <b>school</b> <b>weeks</b> or only on break weeks, these properties do not significantly change with time.|$|R

25|$|Secondary school {{education}} is offered {{for four years}} to pupils {{between the ages of}} 15-18, and leads to a Puntland Secondary School Certificate Examination (PSCE). Ten subjects are taught in secondary schools, namely: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, Somali, Arabic, Islamic studies, English, physical education, geography and history. All subjects, with the exception of physical education, are compulsory. English is the language of instruction in secondary schools, except in the Somali, Arabic, and Islamic courses. Each <b>school</b> <b>week</b> is composed of 40 periods of 45 minutes each.|$|E
25|$|Children usually entered {{primary school}} at {{seven years of}} age for six days a week, which after {{regulatory}} changes in 1995 and 1997 were changed to {{five and a half}} and five days, respectively. The two-semester school year consisted of 9.5 months, and began on September 1 and March 1, with a summer vacation in July and August and a winter vacation in January and February. Urban primary schools typically divided the <b>school</b> <b>week</b> into twenty-four to twenty-seven classes of forty-five minutes each, but in the rural areas, the norm was half-day schooling, more flexible schedules, and itinerant teachers. Most primary schools had a five-year course, except in such cities as Beijing and Shanghai, and later other major cities, which had reintroduced six-year primary schools and accepted children at six and one-half years rather than seven.|$|E
25|$|Dual meets {{usually take}} place on evenings during the <b>school</b> <b>week</b> (Monday through Friday); on Saturday mornings, afternoons, or evenings; or even on Sunday mornings or afternoons during the wrestling season and begin with weigh-ins at a maximum of one hour before the meet begins. No weight {{allowances}} are made for dual meets and multiple-day dual meets. Wrestlers are also examined by a physician or a certified athletic trainer for any communicable skin diseases. If a student-wrestler does not make weight, he is ineligible for that weight class and a forfeit is scored. If there are any communicable skin diseases, it is a ground for disqualification. The wrestler's coach or athletic trainer can provide written documentation from a physician that a skin infection of a wrestler would not be communicable. The final judgement for whether a wrestler {{would be allowed to}} compete lies with the meet physician or athletic trainer on site. In all cases, after determining the sequence of weight classes for the dual meet, the referee will call the wrestlers from each team who have been designated as captains. One of the visiting captains will call a disk toss. The colored disk will then fall to the floor and determine: 1) which team has the choice of position {{at the start of the}} second period and 2) which one of the team's members is to appear first on the mat when called by the referee for each weight class. The wrestler-captain who won the disk toss may choose the even or odd weight classes. That is, he may choose the weight classes, from lowest to highest, that are numbered evenly or oddly. For example, the 125lb, 141lb, 157lb, etc. weight classes would be odd, and the 133lb, 149lb, 165lb, etc. weight classes would be even. This order would work in the traditional sequence until the last even weight class of 285lb.|$|E

30|$|First, <b>school</b> <b>weeks</b> {{and break}} weeks have {{different}} degree distributions (Fig.  3). But focusing either only on <b>school</b> <b>weeks</b> or only on break weeks, degree distributions {{of the different}} snapshots are similar. Existing work argues that many social networks follow scale-free degree distributions (Mislove et al. 2007). In our case, break weeks have power-law-like degree distributions, but school weeks’ degree distributions deviate from the power-law to some extent.|$|R
2500|$|St. Paul's {{operates}} on a six-day <b>school</b> <b>week,</b> Monday through Saturday.

2500|$|Another {{example of}} {{creative}} freedom is Agora Days, a four-day <b>school</b> <b>week</b> in late February when students, parents, faculty, alumni {{and friends of}} the school can teach hour-long classes about a wide range of topics, which have included popular cake decorating and massage classes. Students are required to take a number of academic-oriented classes, but classes based on playing sports, watching films or TV series, and studying video games also exist. Students have the same eight-hour schedule on each of the four days. Agora Days has been a Uni tradition since 1977.|$|E

[...] Likewise, the [...] "roommate" [...] in their dorm is called an [...] "Ol' Lady," [...] though this term is often used throughout a cadet's Corps career. Furthermore, fish are instructed that they are not allowed to want, think, like, or feel, and are prohibited from taking [...] "shortcuts" [...] by using abbreviations (PT must be called [...] "physical training," [...] the Quad the [...] "Quadrangle," [...] etc.). Cadets who started in the same class year are known as [...] "fish buddies". Corps fish sit a mandatory [...] "Evening Study Time" [...] (EST) during the <b>school</b> <b>week</b> after evening chow.

2500|$|Roller {{also saw}} enemies among {{the ranks of}} older {{teachers}} he believed blocked the [...] "cultural revolution", and promoted [...] "re-education of the teaching staff". He sought to imbue the educational system with a class character and make it {{serve the interests of}} workers, peasants and [...] "progressive intellectuals", including those who had rushed to the new regime's side. Already in 1947, students were encouraged to form Marxist [...] "cells", verifying the dogmatic purity of history lessons, and holding the teachers accountable. In one instance, Roller explained that, as long as the old teaching staff could include a [...] "war criminal" [...] such as Ion Petrovici, his own colleagues, Răutu and Chișinevschi, were fit to lecture in Marxism-Leninism at the University of Bucharest. He continued to have a plenary take on education, and insisted that music should form part of schooling. Unintentionally, his position on the subject allowed educators and students to evade politicization for {{at least part of the}} <b>school</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{large part}} of the {{promotion}} was its fundraising activities which raised thousands of dollars for various charities and high schools in the state. It was at one of the events that Shrader, a one-time champion high school wrestler for Woodlawn High, started a feud with Baltimore County school rival Owings Mills High School. On May 16, 1999, Shrader challenged the Owings Mills wrestling team, specifically its head coach Guy Pritzker and assistant Justin Ott, to a wrestling match later that evening. If he and his partner Dino Devine won the match then they would be allowed to become OMHS's wrestling coaching staff for the 1999–2000 winter sports season. Earlier during the <b>school</b> <b>week,</b> Shrader [...] "invaded" [...] the cafeteria while Coach Pritzker was on lunch duty and [...] " [...] him around". The high school coaches ended up winning their match against Shrader and Devine. Shrader continued to appear at Owings High during the school season, however, the feud was cut short when he lost a [...] "loser-leaves-MCW" [...] match.|$|E

At ten months old, Jordan developed a form of pink disease {{and his family were}} advised by doctors to move from Dublin to Bray for [...] "fresh air". His mother Eileen was advised to [...] "take him out of woollens and into cotton during the month of May", advice she opposed, initially. Nevertheless, she conceded and Jordan's condition did gradually improve. During his childhood, Jordan grew up in Dartry, south Dublin and Bray, County Wicklow. He {{spent most of his time}} in Bray, where he became close with his Aunt Lilian, having regularly travelled to visit her at the end of the <b>school</b> <b>week.</b> In his childhood, Jordan was known by the nickname [...] "Flash" [...] as his surname rhymed with the name Gordon.|$|E

In chapel, the school's worship team leads the student body in worship, and guest speakers come to speak the Word of God. Past guests have included Nick Vujicic, Louis Zamperini, and Something Like Silas. Every year, the spiritual life chairman, a student, who is chosen by a committee, proposed a spiritual life theme for the year. The spiritual life chairman is a part of the ASB and presides over the chapel team. The chapel team consists of a group of students who come together to make a few chapels that creatively convey the year's spiritual life theme. This year's spiritual life theme is [...] "God is Greater". Spiritual Life Week, which takes place twice a year, is a week where three days of the <b>school</b> <b>week</b> are set aside for school chapels, which challenge the students' religious life and personal commitment to Christ. From sixth grade to twelfth grade, students are required to take a religion class, including a course that is taken second semester by students in eleventh grade in world religions that studies the beliefs of Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Islam.
