40|$|SUMMARY-Cultivation {{in vitro}} {{of a human}} ductal-cell breast {{carcinoma}} yielded 3 cell lines: one fibro-blast-like and two epithelial-like. The morphology, growth characteristics, and karyology strongly suggested that 1) the epithelial-like cells were derived From the tumor cells and retained their malignant characteristics, and 2) the fibroblast-like cells might be nonmalignant. Epithelial-like cells required insulin For sustained growth j those grown with insulin were inhibited by progesterone and cortisone, but were not al'fected by estrogen, prolactin, growth hormone, and aldosterone. Conversion From monolayer to suspension Forms was made by cultivation in medium with artificially aged human <b>serum.</b> <b>Suspension</b> cultures returned to monolayer form if the aged serum was not used in cultivation.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{correlate}} serological relationships determined by the pili, the flagella and the O-somatic antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and to make a preliminary assessment of use of the pilus antigen as an epidemiological marker. A method is described for the preparation of antiserum specific for the "normal' PSA pili of P. aeruginosa. A high titre of pilus antibodies was obtained by immunizing rabbits with mutants whose pili had lost their ability to retract into the cell. The "normal' form of the organism, with retractile pili, was poorly agglutinated by high-titre anti-pilus <b>serum,</b> but <b>suspensions</b> of it that had been treated with osmium tetroxide showed greatly increased agglutinability. Antibody labelling for electron microscopy was used to determine the serological relations of pili and of flagella for P. aeruginosa strains belonging to different serological groups as defined by O-somatic antigens.

40|$|Both {{chemical}} and physical effects of red cells have {{been implicated in}} the spontaneous aggregation of platelets in sheared whole blood (WB). To determine whether the chemical effect is due to ADP leaking from the red cells, a previously described technique for measuring the concentration and size of single platelets and aggregates was used to study the shear-induced aggregation of platelets in WB flowing through 1. 19 -mm-diameter polyethylene tubing in the presence and absence of the ADP scavenger enzyme system phosphocreatine-creatine phosphokinase (CP-CPK). Significant spontaneous aggregation was observed at mean tube shear rates, (G) = 41. 9 and 335 s- 1 (42 % and 13 % decrease in single platelets after a mean transit time (t) = 43 s, compared to 89 and 95 % decrease with 0. 2 microM ADP). The addition of CP-CPK, either at the time of, or 30 min before each run, completely abolished aggregation. In the presence of 0. 2 microM ADP, CP-CPK caused a reversal of aggregation at (t) = 17 s after 30 % of single cells had aggregated. To determine whether red cells exert a physical effect by increasing the time of interaction of two colliding platelets (thereby increasing the proportion of collisions resulting {{in the formation of}} aggregates), an optically transparent suspension of 40 % reconstituted red cell ghosts in serum containing 2. 5 -micron-diameter latex spheres (3 x 10 (5) /microliters) flowing through 100 -microns-diameter tubes was used as a model of platelets in blood, and the results were compared with those obtained in a control suspension of latex spheres in serum alone. Two-body collisions between microspheres in the interior of the flowing ghost cell or <b>serum</b> <b>suspensions</b> at shear rates from 5 to 90 s- 1 were recorded on cine film. The films were subsequently analyzed, and the measured doublet lifetime, tau meas, was compared with that predicted by theory in the absence of interactions with other particles, tau theor. The mean (tau meas/tau theor) for doublets in ghost cell suspensions was 1. 614 +/- 1. 795 (SD; n = 320), compared to a value of 1. 001 +/- 0. 312 (n = 90) for doublets in serum. Whereas 11 % of doublets in ghost cell suspensions had lifetimes from 2. 5 to 5 times greater than predicted, in serum, no doublets had lifetimes greater than 1. 91 times that predicted. There was no statistically significant correlation between tau meas/tau theor and shear rate, but the values of tau meas/tau theor for low-angle collisions in ghost cell suspensions were significantly greater than for high-angle collisions...|$|R
40|$|While {{using the}} Kahn Precipitation Test and {{especially}} the quantitative procedure, the possibility suggested itself of applying similar principles of concentration to the demonstration of agglu-tinins. If an immediate agglutination reaction could be obtained by an accurate, quantitative method, the advantages would at once be apparent. Working along these lines, a rapid method for the macroscopic agglutination test has been developed. The method involves concentration of the antigen, the use of small amounts of both antigen and serum, together with thorough mixing. Results read within five minutes after adding <b>serum</b> to <b>suspension</b> correspond to those obtained by a standard method requiring from eighteen to twenty-four hours.

40|$|The Widal test {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{utilized}} diagnostic tests for typhoid fever in developing countries. This test demonstrates the presence of somatic (O) and flagellar (H) agglutinins to Salmonella typhi in the patient's <b>serum</b> using <b>suspensions</b> of O and H antigens. Antigens of S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B, S. paratyphi C are included in most commercial kits. The recommended method of performing the Widal test is by the tube agglutination technique where serial two-fold dilutions of the subject's serum from 1 : 20 to 1 : 1280 are tested. 1 In later years, a rapid slide test was developed which is now the most commonly used technique in local laboratories because of its convenience. 1 The over reliance on the Widal test in the diagnosis of typhoid fever has led to the underutilization of blood culture. The unavailability of microbiologic facilities and the long waiting time for culture results have been identified as reasons for the preference for the Widal test. In a number of cases, physicians tended to give too much clinical significance to a "positive" Widal test leading to an over-diagnosis of typhoid fever so that even in the absence of compatible clinical signs and symptoms, antimicrobial therapy including chloramphenicol is given. Finally, follow-up Widal tests have been inappropriately used as the basis for assessing the efficacy of treatment. Some patients continue on prolonged courses of antimicrobial agents because of a persistent "positive " Widal test. The PSMID will present its position in relation to these problems based on local experience and a review of literature...|$|R
40|$|Two of the {{signature}} genetic events {{that occur in}} human gliomas, EGFR amplification and IDH mutation, are poorly represented in experimental models in vitro. EGFR amplification, for example, occurs in 40 to 50 % of GBM, and yet, EGFR amplification is rarely preserved in cell cultures derived from human tumors. To analyze the fate of EGFR amplified and IDH mutated cells in culture, we followed the development over time of cultures derived from human xenografts in nude rats enriched for tumor cells with EGFR amplification and of cultures derived from patient samples with IDH mutations, in serum monolayer and spheroid <b>suspension</b> culture, under <b>serum</b> and serum free conditions. We observed under serum monolayer conditions, that nestin positive or nestin and SMA double positive rat stromal cells outgrew EGFR amplified tumor cells, while serum spheroid cultures preserved tumor cells with EGFR amplification. <b>Serum</b> free <b>suspension</b> culture exhibited a more variable cell composition in that the resultant cell populations were either predominantly nestin/SOX 2 co-expressing rat stromal cells or human tumor cells, or a mixture of both. The selection for nestin/SMA positive stromal cells under serum monolayer conditions was also consistently observed in human oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas with IDH mutations. Our results highlight {{for the first time}} that serum monolayer conditions can select for stromal cells instead of tumor cells in certain brain tumor subtypes.

Predominantly formed in mammalian cells, these therapeutic proteins exist as a spectrum of different isoforms and hence pose {{a unique set of}} challenges that must be addressed to ensure optimum product quality. To better understand whether the product really is the process, quantitative peptide centred multidimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based proteomics studies were performed using a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line that expressed an anti-Interleukin- 8 IgG 1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Following <b>serum</b> free <b>suspension</b> batch culture under varied bioprocess conditions, quantitative proteomics was completed on the producer CHO cells to elucidate the cellular response to altered culture conditions of pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen. The developed platform was also applied for the analysis of naïve CHO K 1 cells following their exposure to spent culture media from the various production runs. Complete characterisation of the expressed mAb was performed, using advanced LC-MS methods including high resolution middle down mass spectrometry; intact protein analysis of critical quality attributes, stable isotope based quantitative glycan analysis and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry for structural comparability analysis. In addition data independent LC-MS quantitative proteomics of residual host cell protein impurities was also carried out to evaluate the effect of downstream processing {{on the quality of the}} final drug substance.

Since remediation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may mitigate the adverse effects caused by exposure, we assessed the effects of As 2 O 3 and its potential reversibility after exposure cessation or coadministration of NAC. Animals received 0. 3 or 3. 0 [*]mg/Kg/day of As 2 O 3 subcutaneously and 40 [*]mM of NAC in tap water.

40|$|Peripheral blood {{lymphocytes}} {{from patients}} with periodontal disease were stimulated in vitro by sonicates of Veillonella alcalescens {{in the presence}} of autologous and substituted sera which were either untreated or absorbed with Veillonella cells. A significant positive correlation was found between the level of lymphocyte stimulation and IgM class of haemagglutinating antibody titres in patients with mild periodontitis (MP) (P< 0 · 01) but not in those with gingivitis (G), severe periodontitis (SP) or in the control group (C). Absorption of autologous <b>serum</b> with a <b>suspension</b> of Veillonella cells resulted in a depression of lymphocyte stimulation by Veillonella antigen in G or MP patients, but had no effect on lymphocyte stimulation in SP patients. Furthermore, absorption with Veillonella abolished the stimulating activity of substituted G or MP sera on lymphocyte cultures from SP patients and the inhibitory activity of SP sera on lymphocyte cultures from G or MP patients. Serum absorption was specific, as it did not affect the mitogenic response of lymphocytes to Actinomyces viscosus, PPD or PHA.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{most common}} {{approach}} used in generating cell lines {{for the production}} of therapetic proteins relies on gene amplification induced by a drug resistance gene e. g., DHFR and glutamine synthetase. Practically, this results in screening large number of clones for the one that expresses high levels of the biologic in a stable manner. The inefficiency of mammalian vector systems to express proteins in a stable manner typically involves silencing of the exogenous gene resulting from modifications such as methylation of CpG DNA sequences, histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation. The use of un-methylated CpG island fragments from housekeeping genes referred to as UCOE (ubiquitous chromatin opening elements) in plasmid vectors is now well established for increased stability of transgene expression. However, few UCOE-promoter combinations have been studied to date and in this report we have tested 14 different combinations. Findings In this report we describe studies with two different UCOEs (the 1. 5 Kb human RNP fragment and the 3. 2 Kb mouse RPS 3 fragment) in combination with various promoters to express a large protein (B domain deleted factor VIII; BDD-FVIII) in a production cell line, BHK 21. We show here that there are differences in expression of BDD-FVIII by the different UCOE-promoter combinations in both attached and <b>serum</b> free <b>suspension</b> adapted cells. In all cases, the 1. 5 Kb human RNP UCOE performed better in expressing BDD-FVIII than their corresponding 3. 2 Kb mouse RPS 3 UCOE. Surprisingly, in certain scenarios described here, expression from a number of promoters was equivalent or higher than the commonly used and industry standard human CMV promoter. Conclusion This study indicates that certain UCOE-promoter combinations are better than others in expressing the BDD-FVIII protein in a stable manner in BHK 21 cells. An empirical study such as this is required to determine the best combination of UCOE-promoter in a vector for a particular production cell line. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{determinant of}} the clinical applicability and value of antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is the cytotoxicity of the treatment to human cells. We evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of PDI to human dermal fibroblasts using 5 -phenyl- 10, 15, 20 -tris(N-methyl- 4 -pyridyl) porphyrin chloride (TriP[4]) as the photosensitiser. The fibroblasts were exposed to a PDI regime that {{is known to be}} sufficient for the inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans [1]. The PDI experiments were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and in 6. 25 %, 12. 5 %, 25 % and 50 % fetal calf <b>serum</b> (FCS) /PBS <b>suspensions.</b> Cell viability subsequent to exposure was evaluated after 0 h, 6 h and 18 h using the methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) assay and compared to pretreatment values. At a TriP[4] concentration previously demonstrated to induce a 5 log(10) -unit reduction in a viable count for S. aureus, 79 % of the fibroblasts were photo-inactivated. Increasing the FCS concentration in the medium protected the fibroblasts against PDI. Based on our in vitro results, we propose that in vivo PDI of S. aureus holds potential; however, PDI of P. aeruginosa and C. albicans will probably require such a strong PDI regime that it will induce substantial damage to fibroblast...|$|R
40|$|DP IV (CD 26), a serine {{protease}} expressed on activated T cells, participates in immune responses in vivo {{as well as}} in vitro. We measured cell surface and serum DP IV in mice of the autoimmune MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr (MRL/l) strain, which is characterized by massive T cell proliferation and production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. The mass of inguinal lymph nodes correlated with serum DP IV activity. Furthermore, serum DP IV activity increased markedly in parallel with the acceleration of lymph node swelling and anti-nDNA antibody production. Serum DP IV activity in 16 -week-old MRL/l mice reached levels up to three higher than those in age-matched MRL/Mp- +/+ mice or BALB/c mice. Immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometric analysis identified DV IV on surfaces of lymphocytes from the enlarged lymph nodes of MRL/l mice. Subcutaneous injection of the mechanism-based inhibitor, Pro-boroPro, reduced protease activity in <b>serum</b> and cell <b>suspensions</b> prepared from spleen and lymph nodes, confirming the identity of the enzyme as DP IV. These results indicate that the massively accumulating lymphocytes of MRL/l mice have a property characteristic of activated T cells, although they express little surface CD 4 or CD 8 and do not produce IL- 2.

Both 20 nm and 200 nm PBs, independent of the suspension media, were observed to cause limited, yet significant (p 0. 05) were also found between NP size and serum content of the suspension media used. The smaller sized PBs were found to affect intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels, causing a significant loss (p < 0. 05) in GSH when suspended in the presence of serum.

40|$|AbstractThe rate {{of change}} of surface pressure, π, in a Langmuir trough {{following}} the deposition of surfactant suspensions on subphases containing serum, with or without polymers, is used to model a likely cause of surfactant inactivation in vivo: inhibition of surfactant adsorption due to competitive adsorption of surface active <b>serum</b> proteins. Aqueous <b>suspensions</b> of native porcine surfactant, organic extracts of native surfactant, and the clinical surfactants Curosurf, Infasurf, and Survanta spread on buffered subphases increase the surface pressure, π, to ∼ 40 mN/m within 2 min. The variation with concentration, temperature, and mode of spreading confirmed Brewster angle microscopy observations that subphase to surface adsorption of surfactant is the dominant form of surfactant transport to the interface. However (with the exception of native porcine surfactant), similar rapid increases in π did not occur when surfactants were applied to subphases containing serum. Components of serum are surface active and adsorb reversibly to the interface increasing π up to a concentration-dependent saturation value, πmax. When surfactants were applied to subphases containing serum, the increase in π was significantly slowed or eliminated. Therefore, serum at the interface presents a barrier to surfactant adsorption. Addition of either hyaluronan (normally found in alveolar fluid) or polyethylene glycol to subphases containing serum reversed inhibition by restoring the rate of surfactant adsorption {{to that of the}} clean interface, thereby allowing surfactant to overcome the serum-induced barrier to adsorption...|$|R

In this study the human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG- 3 was cultured in serum free media, and the characteristics of suspension and parental adherent JEG- 3 cells were compared. Methods: Cell proliferation, colony-formation, soft agar clonogenicity, and transwell invasion assays were performed in vitro, and tumor xenografts in BALB/c nude mice were used to evaluate stem cell properties. Results: In serum-supplemented medium (SSM), JEG- 3 cells were 4. 51 ± 1. 71 % CD 44 +, 7. 67 ± 2. 67 % CD 133 +, and 13. 85 ± 2. 95 % ABCG 2 +. In serum-free medium (SFM), the expression of these markers increased to 53. 08 ± 3. 15 %, 47. 40 ± 2. 67 %, and 78. 70 ± 7. 16 %, respectively. Moreover, suspension JEG- 3 cells exhibited enhanced colony-formation capability as well as invasive and proliferative ability in vitro, alongside enhanced tumorigenic properties in vivo.

Addition of either anti-CD 18 or anti-CD 11 b antibody to the assay system resulted in a marked reduction of PMN adhesion. We also demonstrated immunohistochemically that iC 3 b was formed on the serum-treated corneocytes. These findings suggest that PMN attach to serum-treated corneocytes through an interaction of CR 3 expressed on PMN with iC 3 b-coated corneocytes. In addition, we found that this adhesion was enhanced by activation of PMN with phorbol myristate acetate. From these results, we speculate that complement activation by corneocytes occurs in the cutaneous lesions of aseptic pustular dermatoses and that PMN can be stimulated by the interaction with iC 3 b-opsonized corneocytes as well as by chemotaxins, leading to damage of the surrounding epidermal keratinocytes...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{presented}} by which, with {{the diffusion of}} trypan blue into the nucleus as a criterion of cell injury, {{it is possible to}} study quantitatively the effect of various agencies upon the small thymus cells and upon the tissue lymphocytes. Preliminary studies with this method have led us to the following conclusions, which, however, unless otherwise stated, may be taken as applying only to the lymphocytes of the rat thymus. 1. The small thymus cells, when suspended in balanced phosphate solutions, show no distinct reaction to variations in hydrogen ion concentrations ranging between Ph 7. 0 and PH 7. 8. Beyond PH 7. 0 there is a sudden increase in the permeability of the cells to the dye; plasmolysis of the cells occurs when the alkalinity exceeds PH 8. 0. 2. Heating to 49 ° or 50 °C. is accompanied by a critical increase in the permeability of the cells to the dye. 3. The injury caused by lack of oxygen can be demonstrated by {{the increase in the number}} of stained cells. 4. The addition of <b>serum</b> to <b>suspensions</b> of thymus cells or tonsil lymphocytes greatly inhibits the diffusion of the trypan into the cells. The protection afforded is roughly proportionate to the amount of serum added. Gelatin also exerts a marked protective influence; egg albumin affords a partial protection; starch and gum arabic are inert. Hemoglobin and cholesterol do not modify the stainability of the cells. Arsenious sulfide in weak concentrations partially inhibits the diffusion of the dye. Colloidal iron is without effect, and is precipitated about the cells. 5. The toxicity of the photodynamic substance, hematoporphyrin, and of an impure chlorophyll solution in the presence of sunlight could be strikingly demonstrated by the greatly increased permeability of the cells to the stain. 6. Acute and chronic inanition produces an increased fragility of the cells. The protective power of the serum in acute starvation appears to be increased. 7. The small thymus cells of old animals are more readily injured than are those of young ones, as indicated by the increased proportion of stained cells. 8. The method has been applied to the demonstration of the action of cytotoxic immune sera for rat thymus cells and for human tonsil lymphocytes in vitro. Further experiments dealing with the question of specificity are in progress. The cytotoxins are inactivated by the addition of complement. Thermostabile cytagglutinins have also been produced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background With the {{increased}} manufacture {{and use of}} carbon nanoparticles (CNP) there has been increasing concern about the potential toxicity of fugitive CNP {{in the workplace and}} ambient environment. To address this matter a number of investigators have conducted in vitro and in vivo toxicity assessments. However, a variety of different approaches for suspension of these particles (culture media, Tween 80, dimethyl sulfoxide, phosphate-buffered saline, fetal calf serum, and others), and different sources of materials have generated potentially conflicting outcomes. The quality of the dispersion of nanoparticles is very dependent on the medium used to suspend them, and this then will most likely affect the biological outcomes. Results In this work, the distributions of different CNP (sources and types) have been characterized in various media. Furthermore, the outcome of instilling the different agglomerates, or size distributions, was examined in mouse lungs after one and seven days. Our results demonstrated that CNP suspended in <b>serum</b> produced particle <b>suspensions</b> with the fewest large agglomerates, and the most uniform distribution in mouse lungs. In addition, no apparent clearance of instilled CNP took place from lungs even after seven days. Conclusion This work demonstrates that CNP agglomerates are present in all dispersing vehicles to some degree. The vehicle that contains some protein, lipid or protein/lipid component disperses the CNP best, producing fewer large CNP agglomerates. In contrast, vehicles absent of lipid and protein produce the largest CNP agglomerates. The source of the CNP is also a factor in the degree of particle agglomeration within the same vehicle. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{most widely}} used free {{radicals}} for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments or related Overhauser imaging are nitroxides. The DNP parameters in biological fluids were measured {{in order to provide}} guidelines for the design of new nitroxides, adapted to the biological applications of DNP. Eighteen nitroxides were studied at a concentration of 1 mM. Extrapolation at complete electron paramagnetic resonance saturation and proton longitudinal-relaxation-time measurements enable calculation of the coupling factor between nitroxide free electrons and water protons. In deoxygenated phosphate-buffered solutions, the NMR signal enhancement by DNP ranged from - 36. 3 to - 6. 7, and the coupling factor ranged from 0. 31 to 0. 03. Nitroxides with a long side chain yield poor enhancement, although their relaxivity is far greater than that of nitroxides with small chains. In a 1 mM albumin solution, the loss in enhancement factor is mainly caused by the fact that proton relaxation occurs via interactions, not only with the dissolved free radicals but also with the albumin macromolecules. In serum, the enhancement factor is lower than that in an albumin solution, because of the higher protein concentration in <b>serum.</b> In red-blood-cell <b>suspensions,</b> the enhancement factor was further decreased. Two effects contribute to this decrease: first, the increased viscosity due to the presence of red blood cells, and second, the susceptibility effects of the paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin. The high sensitivity to oxygen of DNP in phosphate-buffered solution is also greatly reduced when nitroxides are dissolved in blood. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe E 8 protein of BPV- 4 {{contributes}} to transformation of primary bovine cells (PalFs) by inducing anchorage-independent growth and by down-regulating gap junction intercellular communication, {{likely due to}} its binding to 16 K ductin. We show here that, in addition, E 8 confers on PalF cells the ability to grow in low serum and to escape from contact inhibition (focus formation). E 8 also transactivates an exogenous human cyclin A gene promoter, suggesting that overexpression of cyclin A {{is responsible for the}} transformed phenotype. Mutant forms of E 8 were generated to establish whether the transforming functions of the protein could be segregated. Mutations were introduced both in the hydrophobic domain and in the hydrophilic C-terminal “tail”, and chimeras with BPV- 1 E 5 were constructed. Cells expressing either wild-type E 8 or mutant forms were analyzed for their ability to grow in low <b>serum</b> and in <b>suspension</b> and to form foci. Wild-type E 8 and its mutants were also analyzed for their ability to transactivate the cyclin A promoter. We show here that the transforming functions of E 8 can be segregated and that both the hydrophilic C-terminal tail and the residue at position 17 in the hydrophobic domain are crucial for E 8 functions and for the transactivation of the cyclin A promoter. These results support the hypothesis that the different aspects of cellular transformation brought about by E 8 might be due to interaction with different cellular targets. They suggest that E 8 might function differently from BPV- 1 E 5 and demonstrate that the separate domains of E 5 and E 8 are not functionally interchangeable...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{control and}} {{monitoring}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) relies upon rapid and accurate disease confirmation. Currently, clinical samples are usually tested in reference laboratories using standardized assays recommended by The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). However, {{the requirements for}} prompt and serotype-specific diagnosis during FMD outbreaks, {{and the need to}} establish robust laboratory testing capacity in FMD-endemic countries have motivated the development of simple diagnostic platforms to support local decision-making. Using a portable thermocycler, the T-COR™ 8, this study describes the laboratory and field evaluation of a commercially available, lyophilized pan-serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay and a newly available FMD virus (FMDV) typing assay (East Africa-specific for serotypes: O, A, Southern African Territories [SAT] 1 and 2). Analytical sensitivity, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the pan-serotype-specific lyophilized assay were comparable to that of an OIE-recommended laboratory-based rRT-PCR (determined using a panel of 57 FMDV-positive samples and six non-FMDV vesicular disease samples for differential diagnosis). The FMDV-typing assay was able to correctly identify the serotype of 33 / 36 FMDV-positive samples (no cross-reactivity between serotypes was evident). Furthermore, the assays were able to accurately detect and type FMDV RNA in multiple sample types, including epithelial tissue <b>suspensions,</b> <b>serum,</b> oesophageal–pharyngeal (OP) fluid and oral swabs, both with and without the use of nucleic acid extraction. When deployed in laboratory and field settings in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, both assays reliably detected and serotyped FMDV RNA in samples (n = 144) collected from pre-clinical, clinical and clinically recovered cattle. These data support the use of field-ready rRT-PCR platforms in endemic settings for simple, highly sensitive and rapid detection and/or characterization of FMDV...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the first multiway comparison of portable isothermal assays {{for the detection}} of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), benchmarked against real-time reverse transcription RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The selected isothermal chemistries included reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). The analytical sensitivity of RT-LAMP was comparable to rRT-PCR (10 (1) RNA copies), while RT-RPA was one log 10 less sensitive (10 (2) RNA copies). Diagnostic performance was evaluated using a panel of 35 samples from FMDV-positive cattle and eight samples from cattle infected with other vesicular viruses. Assay concordance for RT-LAMP and RT-RPA was 86 - 98 % and 67 - 77 %, respectively, when compared to rRT-PCR, with discordant samples consistently having high rRT-PCR CT values (no false-positives were detected for any assay). In addition, a hierarchy of sample preparation methods, from robotic extraction to simple dilution of samples, for epithelial <b>suspensions,</b> <b>serum</b> and oesophageal-pharyngeal (OP) fluid were evaluated. Results obtained for RT-LAMP confirmed that FMDV RNA can be detected in the absence of RNA extraction. However, simple sample preparation methods were less encouraging for RT-RPA, with accurate results only obtained when using RNA extraction. Although the evaluation of assay performance is specific to the conditions tested in this study, the compatibility of RT-LAMP chemistry with multiple sample types, both in the presence and absence of nucleic acid extraction, provides advantages over alternative isothermal chemistries and alternative pen-side diagnostics such as antigen lateral-flow devices. These characteristics of RT-LAMP enable the assay to be performed over a large diagnostic detection window, providing a realistic means to rapidly confirm positive FMD cases close to the point of sampling...|$|R
40|$|Suspensions {{of living}} pneumococci in {{approximately}} isotonic standard solutions and in approximately isotonic bouillon with pH varying from about 4. 0 to 8. 0 after incubation show dissolution of organisms in those solutions having a pH higher than about 5. 0. Dissolution is most marked {{at a critical}} range of about pH 5. 0 to 7. 0. Some dissolution also takes place toward the more alkaline end of the scale. No dissolution occurs at the most acid end of the scale. Dissolution in the standard solutions occurs at incubator, room, and ice box temperature. It is less marked at ice box temperature. Dissolution takes place in standard pH solutions with pneumococci allowed to grow and die out in glucose bouillon but unlike dissolution with living organisms is progressive from the acid toward the alkaline end of the scale. Pneumococci killed by heat for I hour undergo less dissolution than living organisms, the general character of the curve being similar to that with living organisms. Pneumococci killed by heat at 100 °C. for 5 minutes do not undergo dissolution. The addition of fresh human <b>serum</b> to the <b>suspensions</b> of pneumococci at varying pH prevents dissolution. Dissolution of pneumococci takes place more rapidly at pH 6. 1 in standard solutions in which large numbers of pneumococci have been previously dissolved than in fresh standard solutions at the same pH. The dissolution of pneumococci under {{the conditions of the}} experiments may be ascribed to an enzyme derived from the bacteria themselves.

40|$|During {{follow-up}} of anemic hemodialysis patients (HDP) treated with {{recombinant human erythropoietin}} (rHuEpo), it was noticed that in five HDP, some time after suspension of rHuEpo, hemoglobin (Hb) levels remained at acceptable levels. A metabolic block of the pentose phosphate shunt (PPS) has been described in HDP, which leads to increased oxidative damage of red blood cell (RBC) membranes and increased susceptibility to hemolysis. The increased production of short-chain fatty aldehydes, including malonyldialdehyde (MDA), is an appropriate index of oxidative damage. This study aimed to verify whether the maintenance of acceptable levels of Hb was related {{to a change in}} RBC membrane oxidative damage and pentose phosphate shunt activity. In the five HDP in question who required rHuEpo (150 U/kg/week) for severe anemia (Hb = 7. 48 +/- 0. 95 g/dl), after a stable level of Hb > 10 g/dl was reached for at least 1 month, rHuEpo treatment was stopped. Hb levels remained adequate (Hb = 10. 68 +/- 0. 77 g/dl) after 14. 6 +/- 7. 64 months. The oxidative damage was evaluated by measuring RBC MDA (microgram/ml packed RBC) basal levels, and PPS activity by measuring MDA levels after incubation with ascorbate and cyanide (delta % RBC MDA production). Ten anemic HDP not treated with rHuEpo were used as controls (Hb = 8. 12 +/- 1. 32 g/dl). It was found that the maintenance of adequate levels of <b>serum</b> Hb after <b>suspension</b> of rHuEpo therapy is related to a decrease in RBC membrane oxidative damage (RBC MDA HDP = 2. 40 +/- 0. 41 vs. RBC MDA controls = 18. 23 +/- 6. 56; P < 0. 005) in consequence of the normalization of pentose phosphate shunt activit...|$|R
