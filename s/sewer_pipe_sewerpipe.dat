40|$|The {{essential}} work of sewer rehabilitation is a sewer inspection through {{diagnoses of}} <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects. At present, image processing and artificial intelligence techniques {{have been used}} to develop diagnostic systems to assist engineers in interpreting <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects on CCTV images to overcome human's fatigue and subjectivity, and time-consumption. Based on the segmented morphologies on images, the diagnostic systems were proposed to diagnose <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects. However, the environmental influence and image noise hamper the efficiency of automatic diagnosis. For example, the central area of a CCTV image, where is always darker than the surrounding due to the vanishing light and slight reflectance, causes a difficulty to segment correct morphologies. In this paper, a novel approach of morphological segmentation based on edge detection (MSED) is presented and applied to identify the morphology representatives for the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects on CCTV images. Compared with the performances of the opening top-hat operation, which is a popular morphological segmentation approach, MSED can generate better segmentation results. As long as the proper morphologies of <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects on CCTV images can be segmented, the morphological features, including area, ratio of major axis length to minor axis length, and eccentricity, can be measured to effectively diagnose <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects...|$|R

40|$|Piping erosion {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of failure of flood defences. The {{occurrence}} of this failure mechanism is difficult to predict and it can be triggered during a flood event. The inclusion of hard structures under flood defences will change the probability of occurrence of this erosion process. The present study aimed at understanding the effect of an embedded <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> under the flood defence foundation in its safety assessment for piping erosion failure. This was done by setting a probabilistic analysis framework based on emulation of finite element models of porous media flow and the fictitious permeability approach. The effects of size and location of the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> were evaluated via a deterministic safety factor approach. Afterwards, emulators of the most safe and unsafe models were trained and used for probabilistic assessments. The results showed that the embedment of a <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> in the flood defence foundation has a significant effect on its safety. The magnitude of the effect is highly dependent on the size and location of the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe.</b> Furthermore, the foundation permeability uncertainty shows a conditional effect with respect to the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> size and location...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{stochastic}} {{finite element}} method (SFEM) is employed to investigate the probability of failure of cementitious buried <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> subjected to combined effect of corrosion and stresses. A non-linear time-dependant model is {{used to determine the}} extent of concrete corrosion. Using the SFEM, the effects of different random variables, including loads, pipe material, and corrosion on the remaining safe life of the cementitious <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> are explored. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the merit of the proposed SFEM in evaluating the effects of the contributing parameters upon the probability of failure of cementitious <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes.</b> The developed SFEM offers many advantages over traditional probabilistic techniques since it does not use any empirical equations in order to determine failure of pipes. The results of the SFEM can help the concerning industry (e. g., water companies) to better plan their resources by providing accurate prediction for the remaining safe life of cementitious <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{sulphuric acid}} is a known growing threat to {{concrete}} <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes.</b> Acid production is dictated by rapid urbanisation, {{increased use of}} hot water and discharge of toxic metals and sulphate containing detergents into the wastewater. Concrete <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> corrosion due to sulphuric attack {{is known to be}} the main contributory factor of pipe degradation. Very little tools are available to accurately predict the corrosion rate and most importantly the remaining safe life of the asset. This paper proposes a new robust model to predict the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> corrosion rate due to sulphuric acid. The model makes use of a powerful Evolutionary Polynomial Regression method that provides a new methodology of hybrid data-mining. The results obtained by the model which was validated in the field indicates that the proposed hybrid methodology can accurately predict the corrosion rate in concrete <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe’s</b> given that the pipe installation conditions as well as in-pipe sewage conditions are known...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of structural behaviour of buried concrete pipes is fairly understood, except for how material deterioration affects structural behaviour and performance. Consequently, {{information on the}} structural behaviour of deteriorated <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> will contribute to {{better understanding of the}} changes in status, which is essential for achieving the desired efficiency gains for urban drainage systems. In literature, some attempts to study the behaviour of the buried pipes under laboratory conditions have been reported. However, no attempt was made to evaluate the structural response of deteriorated concrete <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes.</b> The paper describes the design of a laboratory set-up for evaluating the strength of deteriorated <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes.</b> The test setup is a representation of field conditions in order to see if it is possible to model the field condition. Overall, this research is a first step in determining the probability of collapse of deteriorated <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> that will enhance proper decision making for sewer rehabilitation.

Looking at the rise in population growth, it will prove more hectic and problematic if the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> blockages are not fully prioritized thereby finding proper ways of mitigating this unwanted catastrophe. In response to this situation, a new concept for mitigating, monitoring and observing the condition within and outside the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> is being introduced to systematically reduce the problem to a zero minimal tendencies of obstacles that can create a blockage or crack in <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes.</b> A lot of researches have made impacts in mitigating and locating these problems, but this research will be mainly focused on achieving a minimal to zero blockages.
