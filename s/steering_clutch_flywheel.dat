40|$|To {{realize a}} smooth and quick {{shift of the}} {{positive}} independent mechanical split path transmission (PIMSPT) equipped with automatic shifting control system (ASCS), the research on the feasibility of improving shift quality by dynamic and cooperative controlling engine, <b>steering</b> <b>clutches,</b> and brakes has been conducted. The shifting control method suited to starting gear of PIMSPT has been proposed. The control method is based on control parameters, such as the driving shaft speed and its derivative. The control laws of <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> and brakes are presented during each gear and stage of shifting.

25|$|The Chevette's 1.3 litre {{engine and}} {{relatively}} small bodyshell allowed for good performance. The Chevette had a light <b>steering,</b> <b>clutch</b> and gearchange, {{as well as}} good visibility and was spacious inside. The Chevette's success was probably due to its versatility, which compared well with larger cars like the Ford Escort. It was available in three-door hatchback for the single driver, and saloon models which suited families, estate car for the service fleets and the 'Chevanne', van version for all other utility purposes.|$|R
25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double differential, replacing the <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> {{with a single}} braked differential similar to controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired output speed in the steering shaft, compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|R
5000|$|The unique long-handled [...] "Thai" [...] type two-wheel tractor was {{developed}} in the late 1950s by M.R. Debriddhi Devakul (M.R. stands for Mom Rajawong, meaning that his great-grandfather was the King of Thailand, and that he could be properly addressed as [...] "Prince"), head of the Engineering Division of the Thai Rice Department, of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. As the early 2WTs did not have <b>steering</b> <b>clutches,</b> longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> were provided on many companies' models. The tractor gear box and chassis are made by many local industries (Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Agri-Mechanics Co Ltd., Ayutthaya Tractor Factory, Cosmonoki Thai International Co. Ltd., C.R. Tractor Co Ltd, Inter Kankaset Co. Ltd, Jakpetch Tractor Co. Ltd., Jor Charoenchai Tractor, Kor Rungruang, Muileng Industry Ltd., Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Siam Kubota Industry Co. Ltd., etc.). Initially, factories copied from one another, and competing for sales {{to the point that the}} tractor's chassis without engine has become very inexpensive, about one third to one half the cost of the engine. The [...] "Thai tractor" [...] eventually evolved into a more general standard [...] "NC" [...] type models with three gears forward, one reverse, and <b>steering</b> <b>clutches.</b> Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, spiked tooth harrows, trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights). Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can drive a rotary tiller and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, maize shellers etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|R

50|$|Clutches {{in typical}} cars are mounted {{directly}} to {{the face of the}} engine's flywheel, as this already provides a convenient large diameter steel disk that can act as one driving plate of the clutch.

5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a <b>steering</b> <b>clutch</b> that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|R

5000|$|The gearbox {{had five}} forward and one reverse gears. The first gear was for [...] "confined spaces, on steep {{inclines}} or...sharp turns". The transmission {{was the new}} Merrit-Brown Z.5, which offered differential <b>steering</b> without <b>clutching</b> or braking, a major advance on previous designs. It gave the Cromwell superb maneuverability, with only the German Tiger I, using a similar design, able to match it.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the system, acting as {{pressure}} sink as well as suspension elements, are the so-called spheres, five or six in all; one per wheel and one main accumulator as well as a dedicated brake accumulator on some models. On later cars fitted with Hydractive or Activa suspension, there may be as many as ten spheres. Spheres consist of a hollow metal ball, open to the bottom, with a flexible desmopan rubber membrane, fixed at the 'equator' inside, separating top and bottom. The top is filled with nitrogen at high pressure, up to 75 bar, the bottom connects to the car's hydraulic fluid circuit. The high pressure pump, powered by the engine, pressurizes the hydraulic fluid (LHM) and an accumulator sphere maintains a reserve of hydraulic power. This part of the circuit is at between 150 and 180 bars. It powers the front brakes first, prioritised via a security valve, and depending on type of vehicle, can power the <b>steering,</b> <b>clutch,</b> gear selector, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Because driver's hatch {{was moved}} from the glacis plate and {{positioned}} so that he exited the vehicle perpendicularly instead of crawling out of the hatch, his seat received an elevating mechanism. While in a relatively safe area the driver could elevate his seat to look outside of the tank, providing greater visibility and easier access to the controls. While in combat the driver lowered his seat back into the tank and {{had to rely on}} the vision slot protected by [...] (three-layer glass). While in this position the pedals of the main clutch, the fuel supply, and incline brake were positioned much higher and the levers of the <b>steering</b> <b>clutch</b> and gear shifting became inconvenient to operate. Early examples had transmission problems. While the driver was switching gears, two gears could engage simultaneously, which caused a broken gear pinion. This and other gearbox related problems were solved in a 1961 T-44M modernization with the introduction of a gearbox from the T-54 main battle tank.|$|R
5000|$|However, it was {{discovered}} that the rear of the vehicle was overloaded and that the vehicle's manoeuvrability was far from satisfactory. To counter the first problem, the rear tension wheels were enlarged, equipped with leaf springs and lowered to the ground, thus converting them to driving wheels. The problem with steering the tractor under heavy load was eventually solved by adding two <b>steering</b> <b>clutches</b> to both sides of the suspension system. The latter modification in 1938 was included also {{in the development of the}} TKS tankette (in the TKS-B variant). However, by then the serial production of TKS was stopped and in the end the C2P's undercarriage remained distinctive. However, as both designs were being developed simultaneously at the same facility, both were supervised by Rudolf Gundlach and their designers sometimes referred to the C2P as [...] "ciągnik TKS" [...] (TKS tractor), some sources call C2P a development version of TKS, which is not entirely true.|$|R

Marcus created the two-cycle combustion engine. The car's second incarnation in 1880 introduced a four-cycle, gasoline-powered engine, an ingenious carburetor design and magneto ignition. He created an additional two models further refining his design with <b>steering,</b> a <b>clutch</b> and brakes.|$|R
50|$|Problems beset the 3512 almost immediately, {{as it was}} {{completed}} later than scheduled, and its layout meant that it was large and heavy.

30|$|High {{temperatures}} {{appear in}} the contacting surfaces of a single-disc clutch system (friction <b>clutch</b> disc, <b>flywheel</b> and pressure plate) due to the relative motion between these parts during the sliding period. These high temperatures are responsible for several disadvantages such as increasing wear rate, surface cracks and permanent distortions. In some cases, these disadvantages may lead the contacting surfaces to failure before the expected lifetime. In this work, mathematical models of the friction clutch system (single-disc clutch) were built to find the temperature field during the sliding period (single engagement). Analysis has been completed using developed axisymmetric models to simulate the friction clutch system during the engagement. The surface temperatures are found based on uniform pressure and uniform wear assumptions.|$|R

5000|$|The Inter Autoscooter is a French {{three-wheeled}} microcar {{that first}} {{appeared at the}} 1953 Paris Salon. Some say it was produced {{to compete with the}} Messerschmitt KR175 which also appeared that year. This is not surprising as both cars were built by aircraft companies and shared a similar cockpit and tandem seating layout. The Inter was produced by SNCAN in their aircraft factory at Villeurbanne in the region of Lyon; Just over 300 units were built between 1954 and 1956. Early advertising literature reveals that two models were offered, one with a cockpit cover that hinged open from the side and named the Berline, the other an open bodied version called the Torpedo. Both cars were powered by a small Ydral 175cc two-stroke engine driving the single rear wheel. The Inter had some unusual features not least being its ability to fold together its two front half axles so as to facilitate easy storage, however this feature only appears on the first few cars made as it proved to be impractical and was soon discontinued. The Inter also featured a device called a gyrostarter, this was in effect a kind of electric kick start made by the American electromechanical giant WestinghouseThe device consists of a built in electric 6 volt motor with a <b>clutched</b> <b>flywheel,</b> the momentum of the rotating flywheel is transferred to the engine by means of its clutch once it has built up sufficient speed, it sounds much like a helicopter preparing for take off! The device switches to being a generator once the engine is running. Considering the very small production run, approximately 38 vehicles survive in the hands of museums and collectors, of which only a few are still in running condition.|$|R

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the <b>clutch</b> housing, <b>clutch,</b> <b>flywheel,</b> and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|R
