40|$|A {{number of}} highway {{projects}} are in progress in Korea to accommodate increasing transportation demands. As the highway route becomes more complex, some projects include tunneling through unconsolidated <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock.</b> Since an unconsolidated <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> mainly consists {{of rock and}} ground mass, the behavior and characteristics in unconsolidated <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> tunnel are quite different from typical rock tunnel. However, construction case histories and rock classifications method on unconsolidated <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> tunnel had not been developed or studied domestically. Consequently the case studies and rock classification system for unconsolidated <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> are required to better understand its behavior for tunneling. In this study, rock mass classification method is proposed to identify unconsolidated <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> based on point load and slake durability tests. Based on this, the proposed method of unconsolidated <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> can be applied well through comparisons {{with the results of}} convergenc...|$|R
50|$|The Tooth {{was formed}} when magma {{from deep within}} the Earth rose through older rock layers and slowly cooled. Over many {{thousands}} of years, the older <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> eroded and left the harder igneous formation. The <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> acted as a mold for the intrusive magma, causing it to harden and cool where the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> was strongest.|$|R

5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were {{deposited}} in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks {{are part of the}} Franciscan Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as greenstone. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of the}} creek, schist and other metamorphic rocks {{can be found}}, while <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E
50|$|The exposed bulk of Turbidite Hill {{consists}} of a very thick diabase (dolerite) sill {{that is part of}} the Ferrar Dolerite. The summit of Turbidite Hill {{consists of}} a relatively thin layer of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> of the Buckley Formation (Coal Measures), which is part of the Beacon Supergroup. This layer is either a large block of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> enclosed within a diabase sill or a layer of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> lying between two sills.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{principles}} that are used to explain the appearance of stratum. When an igneous rock cuts across a formation of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> then we can say that the igneous intrusion is younger than the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock.</b> The principle of superposition states that a <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> layer in a tectonically undisturbed stratum is younger than the one beneath and older than the one above it. The principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds.|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} of intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an igneous intrusion cuts across a formation of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> {{it can be}} determined that the igneous intrusion is younger than the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock.</b> Different types of intrusions include stocks, laccoliths, batholiths, sills and dikes.|$|R
5|$|The Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains {{contains}} low-to-high-grade metamorphic rocks. Many of {{the rocks}} of the Blue Ridge {{appear to be the}} metamorphosed equivalents of Proterozoic and Paleozoic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> Others are metamorphosed igneous rocks, including Corbin metagranite, Fort Mountain gneiss, varieties of mafic and ultramafic rocks, and the metavolcanic rocks of the Gold Belt.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{is formed}} almost {{exclusively}} from <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{dating from the}} Carboniferous period.

5|$|These Precambrian igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks underlie {{most of the}} state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso. <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the {{granitic}} rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E

5|$|Many {{varieties}} of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, {{as well as}} metamorphic rocks derived from volcanic and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7billion years old. Igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the bedrock of the eastern Boundary Waters. Ancient microfossils {{have been found in}} the banded iron formations of the Gunflint Chert.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} {{metamorphism}} {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as chlorite, epidote and actinolite that formed during metamorphism. After metamorphism occurred, these rocks were folded and faulted into a system of mountains by the Algoman orogeny.|$|E
5|$|The {{north-eastern}} {{boundary of}} this geologic region {{is marked by}} the Murihiku escarpment, which runs along {{the southern edge of}} the dormant Hillfoot fault line. The Catlins ranges are strike ridges composed of Triassic and Jurassic sandstones, mudstones and other related <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> often with a high incidence of feldspar. Fossils of the late and middle Triassic Warepan and Kaihikuan stages are found in the area.|$|E

50|$|About 200 {{million years}} ago, during the Mesozoic era, {{the area was}} uplifted above the sea. Tectonic {{activity}} forced molten lava through the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock,</b> creating sheetlike layers of diabase. These layers, when present, protected the softer <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> beneath them from erosion, resulting in mesa-like mountains such as Kinnekulle and its neighbours.|$|R
5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.|$|E
5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are not restricted to reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E
50|$|The main <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> that {{constitutes}} {{the mountains in}} the park was formed during the Cretaceous. Most of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> has extensive karstification that happened {{over millions of years}} creating several underground systems like: subterranean rivers, caves, and aquifers. Grutas de García (García Caves) {{is one of the largest}} cave system in Mexico and is one of the most popular attractions within the park. García Caves were hidden for millions of years until being discovered in 1843. Marine fossils have been discovered inside these caves because the lining of the caves mainly consist of oceanic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock.</b>|$|R
