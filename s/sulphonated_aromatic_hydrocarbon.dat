40|$|Hydroxylated {{polycyclic}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are oxidation {{products of}} polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> {{but have not}} been studied as extensively as polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Several studies have however shown that hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> have toxic and carcinogenic properties. They have been detected in air samples in semi urban areas and combustion {{is assumed to be}} the primary source of those compounds. To better understand the formation and occurrence of particulate hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from residential wood log stove combustion, 9 hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and 2 hydroxy biphenyls were quantified in particles generated from four different types of wood logs (birch, spruce, pine, aspen) and two different combustion conditions (nominal and high burn rate). A previously developed method utilizing liquid chromatography photo ionization tandem mass spectrometry and pressurized liquid extraction was used. Polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were analyzed along with hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions varied significantly across different wood types and burning conditions; the highest emissions for nominal burn rate were from spruce and for high burn rate from pine burning. Emissions from nominal burn rate corresponded on average to 15 % of the emissions from high burn rate, with average emissions of 218 mu g/MJ(fuel) and 32. 5 mu g/MJ(fuel) for high burn rate and nominal burn rate, respectively. Emissions of the measured hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> corresponded on average to 28 % of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> emissions. This study shows that wood combustion is a large emission source of hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and that not only combustion conditions, but also wood type influences the emissions of hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> There are few studies that have determined hydroxylated polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in emissions from wood combustion, and it is therefore necessary to further investigate the formation, occurrence and distribution of these compounds as they are present in significant amounts in wood smoke particles...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it could be}} seen that the primary single <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> formed were C 8 (ethylbenzene and xylenes) <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{followed}} by C 7 (toluene) and C 9 (trimethylbenzenes) <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Considering the limited pore size of HZSM- 5 -based catalyst, larger <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as C 9 + <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (mainly including C 10 and C 11 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons)</b> were difficult to generate. Even if C 9 + <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> could form in the pore volume, considering the diffusion limitations caused by the confined pore diameter, they could not pass through the channel readily and then {{came out of the}} catalyst. The above-mentioned restriction effect could be reflected by the variation trends of C 9 + <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with the increasing loading amount of the Catalyst II. The more loading amount of the Catalyst II indicated more mesoporous existence, the more C 9 + <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> formed. With regard to the rather low selectivity towards C 6 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> Tian et al. [9] have proposed that methanol had a high capability of alkylation. Thus, the alkyls formed during the reaction could easily add to benzene rings through electrophilic attack, and as a result, xylenes and trimethylbenzenes were formed.|$|R

Despite the loading order of the catalyst with γ-alumina, the total aromatic yields for both groups had an upward trend with the increase of the catalyst with γ-alumina. And the gasoline compositions for both groups demonstrated that the increased aromatics were at the expense of paraffins, olefins, and naphthenes. Besides, be compared with the Group I, the Group II had a larger range of aromatic yield from 12.28 to 20.27  wt%. Meanwhile, all single <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> went up gradually with the increasing catalyst with γ-alumina. Among the single <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> formed, the C 8 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were the maximum followed by C 7 and C 9 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Due to the limited pore structure and methylation of methanol, the formations of C 9 + and C 6 <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were relatively lower.

Amino alcohols quench the fluorescence of <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> less efficiently than do amines. This inefficiency has been attributed to hydrogen bonding between the hydroxylic proton and the nitrogen atom of the amino alcohol. Two series of compounds (naphthylalkylamines and anthrylalkylamines) where intramolecular exciplex formation would be expected to occur have been synthesised.

Intramolecular exciplex formation reduces the photoreactivity of these compounds.

40|$|International audiencePolycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are an {{important}} class of environmental pollutants that {{are known to be}} carcinogenic and immunotoxic. This review summarizes the diverse literature on the effects of these pollutants on innate and acquired immunity in fish and the mechanism of PAH-induced immunotoxicity. Among innate immune parameters, many authors have focused on macrophage activities in fish exposed to polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Macrophage respiratory burst appears especially sensitive to polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Among acquired immune parameters, lymphocyte proliferation appears highly sensitive to polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> exposure. However, the effects of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> on both specific and non-specific immunity are contradictory and depend on the mode of exposure, the dose used or the species studied. In contrast to mammals, fewer studies have been done in fish to determine the mechanism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-induced toxicity. This phenomenon seems to implicate different intracellular mechanisms such as metabolism by cytochrome P 4501 A, binding to the Ah-receptor, or increased intracellular calcium. Advances in basic knowledge of fish immunity should lead to improvements in monitoring fish health and predicting the impact of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> on fish populations, which is a fundamental ecotoxicological goal.

The kinetics of the interactions between trifluoroacetic anhydride and the sulphonic acids (methane sulphonic and mesitylene sulphonic acid) have been studied and these results used to propose a mechanism for the trifluoroacetic anhydride 'catalysed' formation of sulphones in the reaction of p-toluene sulphonic acid with <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in nitromethane. This mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate (p-toluene sulphonyl trifluoroacetate) which ionises into p-toluene sulphonylium and trifluoroacetate ions.

Accompanying the fluorescence quenching of <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> an anomalous emission is observed. This new emission is very broad, structureless and red-shifted from the original hydrocarbon fluorescence. Kinetic studies indicate that this anomalous emission is due to an exciplex formed by an <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> molecule in its lowest excited singlet state with an amine molecule. The fluorescence quenching of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{is due to the}} depopulation of excited hydrocarbon molecules by the formation of exciplexes, with subsequent de-excitation of exciplexes by either radiative or non-radiative processes. Analysis of rate constants shows the electron-transfer nature of the exciplex.

The polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> solutions were incubated with each of the biosensors for 280 min and the bioluminescence monitored every 20 min. Over the incubation time period, there was no significant decrease in bioluminescence in any of the biosensors tested with the exception of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii TAl luxAB. In this series of incubations, there was a dramatic increase in bioluminescence in the presence of phenanthrene (2. 5 times) and benzo[a]pyrene (3 times) above that of the background control (biosensor without polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon)</b> after 20 min.
