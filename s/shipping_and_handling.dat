When purchasing directly from the company, customers automatically become members of a Proactiv club. A month after ordering, and every three months thereafter, they are sent a three-month supply costing $60 (in the US as of 2011), plus <b>shipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> They are billed monthly until they cancel the subscription. The approach is based on the customer lifetime value model.|$|E

On that same day, Universal Studios {{announced it}} would release its titles in the Blu-ray Disc format, following two years of exclusive HD DVD support. The studio subsequently released its final two HD DVD titles: Fletch on March 13, 2008 and Atonement on March 18. On February 20, 2008, Paramount Pictures {{announced it would}} back Blu-ray, becoming {{the last of the}} major studios to do so. Paramount ceased HD DVD production on February 28, 2008, with Things We Lost in the Fire and Into the Wild becoming the studio's last HD DVD releases, both released March 4, 2008. The studio scrapped the HD DVD version of Bee Movie, which, on May 20, 2008, joined Face/Off and Next in becoming the studio's first Blu-ray releases since becoming HD DVD exclusive.

They broke the dried slabs with hammers or rollers, and sorted the granules with sieves into different grades. [...] In the United States, Eleuthere Irenee du Pont, who had learned the trade from Lavoisier, tumbled the dried grains in rotating barrels to round the edges and increase durability during <b>shipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> (Sharp grains rounded off in transport, producing fine [...] "meal dust" [...] that changed the burning properties.) ...|$|E

Sometimes they are given away for free as a form of advertising. Model aircraft are often toys that are used by airlines to promote their brand, just as toy cars and trucks and model trains are used by trucking, railroad and other companies as well. Many food manufacturers run promotions where a toy is included with the main product as a prize. Toys are also used as premiums, where consumers redeem proofs of purchase from a product and pay <b>shipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> fees to get the toy.

2500|$|Methylacetylene-propadiene (MAPP) gas and LPG gas {{are similar}} fuels, because LPG gas is {{liquefied}} petroleum gas mixed with MPS. It has the storage and shipping characteristics of LPG and has a heat value {{a little less than}} acetylene. Because it can be shipped in small containers for sale at retail stores, it is used by hobbyists and large industrial companies and shipyards because it does not polymerize at high pressures— above 15 psi or so (as acetylene does) and is therefore much less dangerous than acetylene. Further, more of it can be stored in a single place at one time, as the increased compressibility allows for more gas to be put into a tank. MAPP gas can be used at much higher pressures than acetylene, sometimes up to 40 or 50 psi in high-volume oxy-fuel cutting torches which can cut up to [...] steel. Other welding gases that develop comparable temperatures need special procedures for safe <b>shipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> MPS and MAPP are recommended for cutting applications in particular, rather than welding applications.|$|E
2500|$|By {{using the}} StubHub website, a buyer may select from {{available}} tickets to an event. StubHub charges buyers {{a fee of}} 10% {{of the purchase price}} of the tickets (minimum $5 per transaction). [...] A <b>shipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> charge is then imposed (minimum $4.95) and tickets are either shipped via UPS, email delivered, available for instant download, or picked up the day of the event at a last-minute services office. In total, on a typical order, StubHub earns 20-25% of the purchase price of every ticket sold: buyers typically pay 10% more than the listed price and sellers receive 10-15% less than their listed price depending on certain seller metrics and bonuses. Criteria for reduced seller fees include confirm time, fill rate, and quarterly sales totals. [...] Additional seller incentives include the ability to buy tickets without paying service fees. If a buyer fails to win the ticket, StubHub will help the buyer find alternative tickets. [...] StubHub does not prohibit sellers from listing tickets for any amount, regardless of how absurd the amount might be, but posts the prices at which tickets have sold. [...] A September 2012 Toronto Blue Jays at Tampa Bay Rays game had tickets listed for $52,122, nearly 1000 times the face value of the tickets. Ticket prices for the 2009 Super Bowl averaged $2,500. To increase delivery rate, StubHub uses Goodmail's CertifiedEmail. It promises to refund the price of any ticket that fails to reach a buyer by FedEx. StubHub and MyStoreRewards have been described as examples of [...] "applications that leverage the PayPal platform in creative ways".|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a current {{knowledge}} of the multiple issues regarding motion effects on crew performance. Background: The motions of the ship may create motion sickness, nausea and vomit. Also, these motions also disturb the balance of crew members, increase the energy expenditure of crew for shipboard work, and result in increased levels of injury and fatigue. However, the motion effects of the ship on crew performance has not been thoroughly investigated. Method: Participants(N= 10) were engaged in an experiment in 2 experimental environments(training <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> <b>ship</b> <b>handling</b> simulator) <b>and</b> 2 navigational conditions(day and night). The COP(Center of Pressure) data were recorded as an objective measure of postural balance control and the SSQ(Simulator Sickness Questionnaire) was used as a subjective measure of sickness. Results: The results showed that COP has a no significant difference based on experimental environments, but significant effect on SSQ. Conclusion: During the virtual simulator navigation, subjects showed significant SSQ level changes, which included decreased SSQ data. But, there is no significant difference of COP between training <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> <b>ship</b> <b>handling</b> simulator. Application: The results of this study could be applied to the next generation of ship design to decreas...|$|R
50|$|All {{peroxides}} {{contain an}} oxygen-oxygen bond that, on heating, can break apart homolytically to generate two radicals. As mentioned previously, this decomposition also generates heat. But {{the stability of}} the oxygen-oxygen bond is dependent on what else is present in the molecule. Some peroxides, due to their chemical make-up, are very unstable and need to be refrigerated to avoid a self-accelerating decomposition. Others, particularly those used for crosslinking purposes, are much more stable and can be stored at normal ambient temperatures without risk of self-acceleration. Due to the large variations in the stabilities of peroxides, each is tested to determine the safe maximum temperature for which the peroxide may be stored, <b>shipped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>handled.</b> The result of this test is the self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT).|$|R
