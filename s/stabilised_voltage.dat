40|$|The {{major part}} of the work {{described}} in this thesis is concerned with the development of the techniques of closed-circuit gas chromatography, as originally derived from conventional chromatography by Timms, for the separation and identification of certain volatile silicon and germanium compounds. These techniques were devised to extend the work, classically carried out in high-vacuum distillation systems, to more complex mixtures and smaller samples. In addition to the development work on the basic method, development work was carried out on components and systems, in particular, detector circuitry, a cheap and simple method of temperature control for chromatographic columns, the deoxidisation of nitrogen supplies, and traps for high efficiency removal of volatiles from gas streams. In its final form, the closed-circuit chromatographic apparatus consisted essentially of a preparative gas chromatograph, fitted with two columns and fraction collection traps, and equipped with facility for the recycling of samples, combined with an analytical system. The analytical system consisted of a two-column gas chromatograph equipped with a gas density detector for quantitative analysis of mixtures, provided the components could be identified. Analyses were either effected on products of reactions carried out in external apparatus, or on the products of the reaction of compounds, purified in the preparative system, passed in a nitrogen stream through a reactor containing anhydrous AuCl 3. This reactor with its ancilliary apparatus was fitted as part of the analytical system. The system of a reactor containing gold chloride heated to 170 °C effectively in series with a quantitative gas chromatograph was devised by Timms as a technique for the elucidation of the empirical formulae of the silicon-germanium hydrides, Si n Ge m H 2 (n-hn) + 2, which were quantitatively chlorinated to yield SiCl 4, GeCl 4 and HCl. In this work this technique was developed for the analysis of compounds of silicon and germanium with alkyl groups. Initially it was attempted to convert the tetramethyls and tetraethyls to the tetrachlorides and chlorinated hydrocarbons by reactions under severe conditions. Although this proved feasible, it was realised that partial chlorination under milder conditions should give structural information as well as empirical formulae, provided that all the products could be identified. When the gold chloride reaction, under a variety of conditions, was carried out on GeMe 4, and the methyl germanium chlorides, it was discovered that chlorination of the methyl groups could occur without Ge-C bond fission. In particular, loss of methyl groups from GeMe 2 Gl 2 and GeMeCl 3 mainly occurred after a stepwise chlorination to CCl 3. GeMeCl 2 and CCl 3. GeCl 3. All {{of the members of the}} series CCl n H 3 -n. GeMe m Cl 3 -m (n = 1 to 3, m = 0 to 3) were tentatively identified by their reactions and by gas chromatographic data. In view of the large range of products obtained under these intermediate conditions, it was decided to attempt the reaction of gold chloride at temperatures only between 30 Â° and 90 Â°C, under which conditions no side chain chlorination would be expected to occur. As such, the technique was employed to determine the empirical formulae and, in particular, the structures of the permethyl silanes and permethyl germanes, as the anticipated products of Si-Si and Ge-Ge fission only, the methyl silicon and germanium chlorides were not expected to react further to any great extent. Reactions under these conditions proved to be successful and the following compounds were identified: Si 2 Me 6, Ge 2 Me 6, Si 3 Me 8, Ge 3 Me 8 and n-Si 4 Me 10. The permethyl silanes were prepared by the Wurtz-Fittig reaction of potassium on mixtures of SiMe 3 Cl and SiMe 2 Cl 2 in stainless steel bombs at 125 °C, as originally carried out (but using sodium) by Kumada. Fairly high yields, particularly of n-Si 4 Me 10, were obtained. Although this type of coupling had already been carried out on GeMe 3 Cl, it had not hitherto been carried out on mixtures of GeMe 3 Cl and GeMe 2 Cl 2. This proved successful with potassium at 125 Â°C for 24 hours, and reasonable yields of the permethyl germanes were obtained. The presence of GeMeCL 3 in the reaction mixtures did not apparently lead to the production of branched-chain volatile products. There was, however, strong evidence for the production of straight-chain compounds of both series with longer chains than those identified by the gold chloride technique. In common with most other true homologous series, plots of logarithmic retention volumes (or proportional values) against 'the number of atoms in the chain' of the known members of the two series were approximately linear. Extrapolation of these plots enabled values to be predicted for the next members of the series. These values were very close to the values actually obtained for compounds prepared in these reactions. In this way the following compounds were tentatively identified in the reaction products: n-Ge 4 Me 10, n-Si 5 Me 12, n-Ge 5 Me 12 and n-Si 6 Me 12. This work was extended to the preparation and identification of a new series of compounds, the permethyl silico-germanes, Si n Ge m Me 2 (n+m) + 2, only the first member of which had previously been prepared. Wurtz -Fittig coupling of mixtures of SiMe 3 Cl, SiMe 2 Cl 2, GeMe 3 Cl and GeMe 2 Cl 2 by potassium at 130 Â°C for 24 hours, yielded, in addition to the permethyl silanes and permethyl germanes, at least 12 new compounds in quantities (in terms of volatiles recovered) between 0. 2 % and 6. 5 %. Similar preparations, with SiMe 3 Cl or SiMe 2 Cl 2 omitted, gave higher yields of specific members of this series of compounds and gave some indication of their structure. This information was conditioned, to an extent, by evidence that some rearrangement of groups at silicon and germanium was taking place under the reaction conditions. The principal method employed for the identification of the permethyl silico-germanes was the gold chloride reaction carried out at temperatures between 30 Â° and 50 °C. It was found that samples of the order of 0. 8 mg. were sufficient for three separate determinations of the empirical and structural formulae of these compounds. These determinations, under reasonably ideal conditions, gave results within 5 % of the predicted values, and on larger samples, within 3 %. In addition to this evidence, chromatographic retention data gave an indication as to their probable molecular formulae. Ultimately, a self-consistent hypothesis, confirmed to a large extent by a chromatographic determination of heats of solution, was devised for chromatographic prediction of their structures. The following compounds were identified by the gold chloride technique and the other information as outlined above: SiMe 3. GeMe 3 SiMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 3 GeMe 3. SiMe 2. GeMe 3 SiMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 3 GeMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 3 SiMe 3. SiMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 3 GeMe 3. GeMe 2. GeMe 2. SiMe 3 SiMe 3. SiMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 3 GeMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 2. GeMe 3 SiMe 3. SiMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 3 GeMe 3. SiMe 2. SiMe 2. GeMe 3 and   SiMe 3. SiMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 3 and/or SiMe 3. GeMe 2. SiMe 2. GeMe 3 There was also chromatographic evidence for the presence of at least 10 isomeric forms of compounds with the following formulae: n-Si 4 GeMe 12, n-Si 3 Ge 2 Me 12, n-Si 2 Ge 3 Me 12 and n-SiGe 4 Me 12 For the preparation of the permethyl germanes and the permethyl silicoâgermanes it was necessary to prepare GeMe 3 Cl and GeMe 2 Cl 2 as reactants. Two methods for the preparation of these compounds were developed from existing techniques. The first of these was the 'rearrangement' reaction of GeMe 4, with GeCl 4, originally carried out with limited success in the presence of large amounts of AlCl 3. In this work the reaction was attempted with small amounts of catalyst, in some cases prepared in situ, e. g. by the slow reaction of aluminium with GeCl 4, in the presence of mercury. The reaction was found on occasion to work well with traces of AlCl 3 at 250 Â°C, but was sometimes drastically, and rather unpredictable, inhibited, possibly by moisture. The reaction was shown to be either autocatalytic or catalysed by elemental germanium, to a small extent, at 250 °C. Mercurous chloride was found to be a good catalyst for the primary reaction to GeMe 3 Cl and GeMeCl 3, but indifferent for further reaction to GeMe 2 Cl 2. A mixture of aluminium and calomel was successfully used for the preparative work, presumably as it reacted to form a mixture of both successful catalysts. With this catalyst it was shown that an equilibrium prevented the formation of high yields of GeMe 2 Cl 2 : K = [GeMe 2 Cl 2] 2 [GeMe 3 Cl], [GeMeCl 3] = 22 at 270 °C The equivalent constant for the formation of GeMe 3 Cl was apparently much higher. The preparative work was carried out in stainless steel bombs but some of the experimental work was carried out in small sealed glass tubes which established that the stainless steel was also having some effect on the reaction. The second preparative technique employed for the methyl germanium chlorides was the 'direct reaction' of methyl chloride with germanium in the presence of copper at 360 °C. This reaction, normally carried out as a streaming method, was carried out in a stainless steel bomb. It appeared to take place almost quantitatively and in view of the presence of germanium, and the high temperature employed, it was presumed that equilibrium had been reached. The product ratio indicated that K (see above) for GeMe 2 Cl 2 was approximately 53 at 360 Â°C. The last part of this work was concerned with the design, construction and operation of a chromatograph for operation at cryogenic temperatures. The principal feature of this apparatus was the temperature controlled air bath in which the chromatographic columns were mounted. This consisted of a long vertical glass tube, with an internally mounted wall heater, which was immersed in liquid nitrogen. The air bath was stirred by a series of fans powered by a small electric motor and the temperature was measured by a thermocouple. Temperature control was effected by merely varying the current fed to the heater from a <b>stabilised</b> <b>voltage</b> A. C. supply. With this simple system control of the average air bath temperature within ± 0. 5 Â°C was easily attained in the range - 188 Â° to - 90 Â°C with a maximum, but predictable temperature variation along a 2 X 25 cm. column of 2 Â°C. This performance was better than any quoted in the literature. A conventional katharometer detection system was provided for the chromatograph. This chromatograph was used for studies of the interaction of permanent gases and other low-boiling compounds with metallic ions. This was achieved by measuring the heats of adsorption of these gases on various solid phases with surfaces modified with salts containing a common cation. The initial success of this method has lead to its present use by other workers. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} aims at obtaining thin film {{amorphous}} silicon n-i-p solar cells with improved stability against light-soaking and high electrical performances. First, intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers deposited by Very High Frequency Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (VHF-PECVD) have been studied. Higher stable quality and more absorbing a-Si:H thin films {{have been produced}} by using the hydrogen dilution technique at moderately high temperature (~ 350 °C). The stabilised material quality was quantified by measuring the quality parameter µ 0 τ 0 in the degraded state. Second, these improved intrinsic layers have been incorporated into solar cells. Although the parameters used for solar cells deposited at 350 °C were optimised for 200 °C deposited cells, promising results have already been obtained. The increase in the deposition temperature leads to higher stabilised short circuit current and stabilised fill factor, to a slightly reduced <b>stabilised</b> open circuit <b>voltage</b> and therefore to an increased efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Electrical treeing in {{high voltage}} cable {{insulation}} has been studied {{for a number of}} years and today the mostly used laboratory test set-up is the needle-plane electrode configuration. In this thesis a different type of electrode configuration is described. The new electrode configuration makes use of a thin tungsten wire as the electrode that delivers the high and divergent electrical stress needed to initiate electrical tree growth in insulation material. Multiple electrical trees are formed during the testing, which allows determining the treeing initiation field as well as the rate of tree growth. A comparison between tree initiation conditions in samples prepared of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) materials indicates that electrical trees start to develop in LDPE material at lower fields than in XLPE. Two different mechanisms of tree initiation are identified in LDPE. Also the improvement of the treeing initiation field in XLPE by adding <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilising</b> additives is illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{turbines}} in offshore {{power systems}} contribute to about 23 % of Norway’s total emissions of CO 2. One method for reducing these emissions {{could be the}} addition of wind turbines to the offshore utility grids. Power from shore is another alternative, but has been proven costly due to long cables and expensive HVDC converter stations. In this thesis work, the behaviours of different wind turbine technologies during transient fluctuations in an offshore utility grid have been studied. For this purpose, a dynamic model for an offshore oil platform was developed. Models of squirrel cage and doubly fed induction generator based turbines were developed as well. None of the modelled generators experienced problems with the disturbances caused by the electromechanical transient fluctuations. Based on the behaviour of the DFIG’s grid side converter, {{it is believed that}} the result would be the same for a wind turbine with full frequency conversion. Variable speed wind turbines are expected to remain controllable throughout electromechanical transient fluctuations such as for the simulated case. However, the controllers, converters and equipment have to be designed while bearing these fluctuations in mind. The controllability of the variable speed wind turbines could be used to contribute to voltage control by production and consumption of reactive power. A controller scheme with the purpose of <b>stabilising</b> the <b>voltage</b> at the gas turbine generators’ terminal was developed, but had low impacts on the power system behaviour. A stator flux feed forward term for the speed controller was developed. The term stabilised the power output of the doubly fed induction generator. However, the impact on the power system’s frequency response was minimal, and there is probably no material value of such an addition to the control loop. </p...|$|R

The diesel exhaust gas passes the blades of a capacitor of which one blade {{is connected to}} a high <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilised</b> source of 1200 [V]. The other blade is grounded by a high value resistor (1 M#OMEGA#). By charging the smoke particulates electrical power is transported away from the measuring capacitor causing a leakage of energy. For compensation a charging current effects a voltage across the resistor which is amplified by 40 times {{in order to receive}} an output of several volts. This measuring signal has a non linear behaviour according to the exhaust gas flow. The gas flow is calculated from the air intake and the fuel mass flow together with the gas temperature at the sensor position. In order to receive the smoke particulate concentration mg/m" 3 a mathematical model was designed describing the complete measuring process. The parameters have to be fixed by calibration.

40|$|This work {{looks into}} {{electrical}} treeing in cross-linked polyethylene-based materials (XLPE), where {{the ability to}} resist tree development is considered {{as an indicator of}} improved applicability for insulation in high voltage power cables. The thesis presents results of a twin PhD project involving joint work of two students. One of the students (author of this thesis with a background in electrical engineering) concentrated on developing new methodology for testing the resistance to electrical treeing in XLPE modified by addition of <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilising</b> agents, while the design and syntheses of these agents was the domain of the second student, Markus Jarvid (having his background in chemical engineering). The latter work has been published in a separate thesis. In contrast to the traditionally used needle-electrode test objects, a wire-electrode geometry has been introduced for creating the highly divergent electric field distribution in the insulation, necessary for initiation of an electrical treeing process. The wire-electrode object has shown a benefit of producing several trees during each individual test, therefore providing more data for further analyses. These objects also allow for exposing a larger volume of the material and let trees incept in weak-spot locations. How to conveniently analyse the resulting treeing data from performed experiments is further analysed in the thesis. To increase the applicability of the elaborated methodology for testing materials characterised by different degree of transparency, optical observations of the treeing process were complimented by simultaneous detection of partial discharges (PDs). Analyses of the latter have allowed an interpretation scheme practical for measuring resistance to treeing in non-transparent materials. To evaluate how voltage stabilisers influence the resistance to treeing in XLPE, a broad range of stabilisers have been identified and tested. A detailed analysis demonstrates a positive effect imposed by addition of 4, 4 ’-didocyloxybenzil. This compound is thereafter compared with the effect of various other stabilisers, including benzil-, thiaxanthone- fullerene- and melamine-types. Finally the stabiliser efficiencies are correlated with molecular ionisation potential and electron affinity, where it has been found that the stabilising efficiency increases with electron affinity of the added molecules. The results from this twin PhD project opens up a possibility to design new types of practically useful voltage stabilisers and test their suitability for improving the insulation in future high voltage cables...|$|R
40|$|When an {{ionizing}} particle or radiation enters the sensitive volume of a counter {{an avalanche of}} electrons is formed by the process known as ionization by collisions. In general a counter is operated with the central wire positive {{with respect to the}} cylinder, and consequently the electrons are collected by the wire. A negative voltage pulse is thus developed. On the wire, the size of which depends upon the capacitance of the wire system and the magnitude of the collected charge. The duration and form of the pulse will depend upon the characteristics of the particular counter usedand upon the time constant of the receiving system. In general each {{ionizing particle}} produces a voltage pulse, and it is the function of the associated electrical circuits to record these pulses and thus count the number of particles entering the sensitive volume of counter. The size of the voltage pulse varies with the counter and the type of particle being detected, but the pulses can be increased to the necessary size to actuate scaling and recording devices by means of an amplifier. For counters operating in the Geiger region the pulse size is independent of the type ofionizing agent being detected, providing the voltage across the counter is kept constant, as the counter voltage is increased the pulse size varies over a considerable range until the voltage is reached at which the counter goes into continuous discharge. In consequence, for use in conjunction with different counters, working at various operating potentials, an amplifier with variable gain is necessary. The amplifier can then be set to give a suitable output pulse to the following circuits independently {{of the size of the}} input pulse. For slow counting rates the counter and amplifier can be used directly in conjunction witha suitable mechanical recorder. Many counters have recovery times as short as 10 seconds and correspondingly high counting rates. Amplifiers can be designed with RC time constants as short as 10 seconds or less, so that the results are not affected by the amplifying stage. On the other hand mechanical recorders have comparatively long time constants and if used directly would seriously decrease the possible counting rate. This is avoided by the use of electrical scaling circuits which pass on only a certain proportion of the pulses to the recording circuit. In this case the recovery time and counting rate of the whole system is governed entirely by the characteristics of the counter itself. The pulses from the last stage of the scaling circuit pass on to the recording circuit. It is the function of this circuit to use these pulses to operate some mechanical recorder. The pulses are not usually able to influence the counter directly, and so a hard valve or thyratron is used in conjunction with a telephone or Cenco counter. It will be seen from the above discussion that the electrical circuits needed for use in association with a Geiger counter are as follows 1. Voltage supply circuits for amplifier, scaling and recording circuits. 2. Pulse amplifier. 3. Scaling circuit. 4. Recording circuit. 5. <b>Stabilised</b> high <b>voltage</b> supply for Geiger counter. The arrangement of these circuits will be such as is shown in block form in diagram I. <p...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{voltage control}} methods for maximizing end-of-grid wind farm {{capacity}} uses the Kalbarri Wind Farm {{as a base}} study case. The weakness of end-of-grid feeders {{is that they have}} relatively high resistance and reactance, which lead to high real and reactive power losses and low power transfer capability. This thesis report provides summaries of the voltage control algorithms from the simplest to the most complex algorithm. The parameters of the Kalbarri Wind Farm elements are based on the documents provided by Verve Energy. This thesis investigates the voltage control algorithm including the use of a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) with the wind farm in order to <b>stabilise</b> the grid <b>voltage.</b> The voltage control algorithm study cases are based on the Kalbarri Network Model, and its system simulations are carried out by using DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. The first voltage control algorithm is a wind turbine with fixed power factor which is the simplest voltage control algorithm. The second voltage control algorithm is the wind turbine with fixed power factor combined with a STATCOM, with the STATCOM using the isochronous voltage control method. The STATCOM size required for this voltage control algorithm is so large that it makes the system uneconomic. In order to improve it, the third voltage control algorithm uses a ± 1 MVAr STATCOM. At the same time, an upstream voltage regulator controls the STATCOM within a ± 0. 8 MVAr range. The upstream voltage regulator does the remote control, since there is communications between the upstream regulator and the STATCOM. The fourth voltage control algorithm is built on the third algorithm with the STATCOM using the droop voltage control method. The upstream regulator indirectly controls the Point of Connection (PoC) voltage by using the Line Drop Compensation (LDC) to keep STATCOM within a ± 0. 8 MVAr Range. In the fourth voltage control algorithm, the LDC is used {{to take the place of}} the communications in the third algorithm. The ‘WindFREE’ wind turbine option is also considered in this thesis report, which means the wind turbine is equipped with the feature of providing reactive power under the ‘no wind’ conditions. The dynamic voltage control algorithm with the STATCOM using a variable voltage setpoint, as used in Kalbarri is evaluated. Future works that could be a continuation of this topic are proposed and the thesis report includes a summary of case studies...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There is an increasing need for AC-DC converters to draw a pure sinusoidal current at near unity power factor from the AC mains. Most conventional power factor correcting systems employ PWM techniques to overcome the poor power factor being presented to the mains. However, the need for smaller and lighter power processing equipment has motivated the use of higher internal conversion frequencies in the past. In this context, resonant converters are becoming {{a viable alternative to}} the conventional PWM controlled power supplies. The thesis presents the implementation of active power factor correction in power supplies, using resonance mode techniques. It reviews the PWM power factor correction circuit topologies previously used. The possibility of converting these PWM topologies to resonant mode versions is discussed with a critical assessment as to the suitability of the semiconductor switching devices available today for deployment in these resonant mode supplies. The thesis also provides an overview of the methods used to model active semiconductor devices. The computer modelling is done using the PSpice microcomputer simulation program. The modifications that are needed to the built in MOSFET model in PSpice, when modeling high frequency circuits is discussed. A new two transistor model which replicates the action of a OTO thyristor is also presented. The new model enables the designer to estimate the device parameters with ease by adopting a short calculation and graphical design procedure, based on the manufacturer's data sheets. The need for a converter with a high efficiency, larger power/weight ratio, high input power factor with reduced line current distortion and reduced cost has {{led to the development of}} a new resonant mode converter topology, for power processing. The converter presents a near resistive load to the mains thus ensuring a high input power factor, while providing a <b>stabilised</b> de <b>voltage</b> at the output with a small lOOHz ripple. The supply is therefore ideal for preregulation applications. A description of the modes of operation and the analysis of the power circuit are included in the thesis. The possibility of using the converter for low output voltage applications is also discussed. The design of a 300 W, 80 kHz prototype model of this circuit is presented in the thesis. The design of the isolation transformer and other magnetic components are described in detail. The selection of circuit components and the design and implementation of the variable frequency control loop are also discussed. An evaluation of the experimental and computer simulated results obtained from the prototype model are included in the presentation. The thesis further presents a zero-current switching quasi-resonant flyback circuit topology with power factor correction. The reasons for using this topology for off-line power conversion applications are discussed. The use of a cascoded combination of a bipolar power transistor and two power MOSFETs i the configuration has enabled the circuit to process moderate levels of power while simultaneously switching at high frequencies. This fulfils the fundamental precondition for miniaturisation. It also provides a well regulated DC output voltage with a very small ripple while maintaining a high input power factor. The circuit is therefore ideal for use in mobile applications. A preliminary design of the above circuit, its analysis using PSpice, the design of the control circuit, current limiting and overcurrent protection circuitry and the implementation of closed-loop control are all included in the thesis. The experimental results obtained from a bread board model is also presented with an evaluation of the circuit performance. The power factor correction circuit is finally installed in this supply and the overall converter performance is assessed...|$|R
