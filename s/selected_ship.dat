Many practical features in real-world operations, including multiple types of containers, container transshipment operations, empty container repositioning, origin-to-destination transit time constraints, consistent services with the current network, and joint services with other liner shipping companies, were considered. Given a set of candidate ship routes, some of these routes had to be used, {{and the use of}} others was optional.

As a contributing factor, the sea state plays a significant role in shipping safety. However, the types of dangerous sea states that trigger serious shipping accidents are not well understood. To address this issue, we analyzed the sea state characteristics during ship accidents that occurred in poor weather or heavy seas based on a 10 -year ship accident dataset. Sea state parameters of a numerical wave model, i. e., significant wave height, mean wave period and mean wave direction, were analyzed for the <b>selected</b> <b>ship</b> accident cases.

40|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{modeling}} of prices of commodity transportation by sea. These prices are referred to as (ocean) freight rates. Early contributions go back to the work of Tinbergen and Koopmans in the 1930 s. The shipping industry is characterized by an abun-dance of individual contract data, which is collected and published by so-called charter brokers. The industry publishes this data both in raw form, as monthly and even weekly average prices for <b>selected</b> <b>ship</b> sizes and commodities on selected routes, and in the form of unit value indices. In this paper, we explore the calculation of these indices using a data set of ocean charter contracts for 1997 - 2005. We present unit value indices, which we compare with well known industry indices. We then explore the impact of weighting the subindices for aggregation, present indices based on matched models from period to period and we calculate indices are corrected for quality differences. Finally, we estimate price indices in which the duration of the contracts is reflected. We find that our unit value indices show substantial differences from current industr...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>selected</b> <b>ship</b> collision parameter values on the characteristics of the absorbed energy in several ship collision scenarios. Non-linear simulations were performed using a finite element method (FEM) to obtain virtual experiment data. In the present research, the size of the side damage from a collision phenomenon were measured and used to verify the numerical configuration together with the calculation results using an empirical equation. Parameters in the external dynamics of a ship collision such as the location of the contact point and velocity of the striking ship were taken into consideration. The internal energy and deformation size on the side structure were discussed further in a comparative study. The effects of the selected parameters on several structural behaviors, namely energy, force, and damage extent were also observed and evaluated in this section. Stiffener on side hull was found to contribute significantly into resistance capability of the target ship against penetration of the striking bow. Remarkable force during penetration was observed to occur when inner shell was crushed as certain velocity was applied in the striking bow...|$|E

Second, a numerical ice model HELMI, developed in the Finnish Meteorological Institute, provided information about the ice field.

The case study presented in this paper considers a single and unassisted trip of an ice-strengthened bulk carrier between two Finnish ports in the presence of challenging ice conditions, which varied in time and space. The obtained results show good prediction power of the models. This means, on average 80 % for predicting the ship's speed within specified bins, and above 90 % for predicting cases where a ship may get stuck in ice.

Aim. The aim was to compare the periodontal status of the acromegalic patients with healthy subjects from a large population-based cohort (Study of Health in Pomerania, SHIP). Materials and Methods. We studied 32 acromegalic patients (16 females) and 128 randomly <b>selected</b> <b>SHIP</b> subjects (controls) using a 1 : 4 matching. Serum IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 levels were measured using the Immulite 2500 system. Periodontitis was assessed by clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing depth (PD), and number of missing teeth. Linear and logistic regression models {{were used to assess}} differences in periodontal variables between acromegalic patients and controls. Results. IGF-I levels were comparable in acromegalic patients and controls, whereas IGFBP- 3 levels were significantly higher in acromegalic patients (P = 0. 004). In multivariate modelling, both groups did not differ significantly with respect to mean CAL (P = 0. 12) and high tooth loss (P = 0. 36). Mean PD was higher in acromegalic patients by trend (B = 0. 28 (− 0. 00; 0. 56)). Conclusion. In acromegalic patients, periodontal disease severity did not differ from their healthy SHIP controls. 1...|$|E
40|$|Latent heat fluxes (LHF) play an {{essential}} role in the global energy budget and are thus important for understanding the climate system. Satellite-based remote sensing permits a large-scale determination of LHF, which, amongst others, are based on near-surface specific humidity qa. However, the qa random retrieval error (Etot) remains unknown. Here, a novel approach is presented to quantify the error contributions to pixel-level qa of the Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite (HOAPS, version 3. 2) dataset. The methodology makes use of multiple triple collocation (MTC) analysis between 1995 - 2008 over the global ice-free oceans. Apart from satellite records, these datasets include <b>selected</b> <b>ship</b> records extracted from the Seewetteramt Hamburg (SWA) archive and the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), serving as the in-situ ground reference. The MTC approach permits the derivation of Etot as the sum of model uncertainty EM and sensor noise EN, while random uncertainties due to in-situ measurement errors (Eins) and collocation (EC) are isolated concurrently. Results show an Etot average of 1. 1 ± 0. 3 g kg- 1, whereas the mean EC (Eins) is in the order of 0. 5 ± 0. 1 g kg- 1 (0. 5 ± 0. 3 g kg- 1). Regional analyses indicate a maximum of Etot exceeding 1. 5 g kg- 1 within humidity regimes of 12 - 17 g kg- 1, associated with the single-parameter, multilinear qa retrieval applied in HOAPS. Multi-dimensional bias analysis reveals that global maxima are located off the Arabian Peninsula...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{optimizing}} hull forms {{with respect to}} their hydrodynamic performance in calm and rough water is presented. The method is based on an initial optimization of a parent hull form for seakeeping and the improvement of the resulting optimum hull form for calm water resistance. In {{the first part of the}} method, variant hull forms differing from a parent in the main dimensions and/or in one or more hull form parameters, such as C-WP, LCF, C-B, LCB, KB, C-P, are automatically generated and their seakeeping qualities evaluated. When appropriate ranges for the principal characteristics and parameters of the hull form under investigation are prescribed, a formal optimization procedure is used to obtain the variant with the best seakeeping behavior. The weighted sum of the resonant values of <b>selected</b> <b>ship</b> responses for a number of ship speeds and headings in regular waves forms the objective function. The Hooke and Jeeves algorithm is used to accomplish the optimization. The procedure results in a set of trends regarding the proposed variations of the selected hull form parameters, within the specified constraints. These trends are then applied on the parent hull to derive an optimized hull form with fair lines. Subsequently, this hull form can be locally modified to improve its calm water resistance or, as it should be done, its propulsion characteristics. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two cases: a conventional reefer ship and a naval destroyer. Scaled models of the parent and the optimized hull forms have been tested for calm water resistance and seakeeping. In both cases the validity of the methodology is demonstrated...|$|E

The literature describes numerical and semi-empirical models that characterize ship speed in ice. These however {{often fail to}} account for the joint effect of the ice conditions on ship's speed.

This paper introduces two probabilistic, data-driven models that predict a ship's speed and the situations where a ship is likely to get stuck in ice based on the joint effect of ice features such as the thickness and concentration of level ice, ice ridges, rafted ice, moreover ice compression is considered.
