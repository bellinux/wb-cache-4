5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a <b>synergistic</b> effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
5|$|Team {{cohesion}} {{is viewed}} as ‘‘a general indicator of <b>synergistic</b> group interaction—or process’’. Furthermore, cohesion {{has been linked to}} greater coordination during team-tasks as well as improved satisfaction, productivity, and group interactions. Team efficacy refers to team members’ perceptions of task-specific team competence. This construct is thought {{to create a sense of}} confidence within the team that enables the group to persevere when faced with hardship.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of <b>synergistic</b> benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} importance and interactions between these different antioxidants {{is a very}} complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having <b>synergistic</b> and interdependent effects on one another. The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system. The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a <b>synergistic</b> burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 (excluding PlayStation 3 Slim) also {{supports}} running Linux OS on firmware versions prior to 3.21 {{without the need}} for buying additional hardware purchase. Yellow Dog Linux provides an official distribution that can be downloaded, and other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu have been successfully installed and operated on the console. The use of Linux on the PlayStation 3 allowed users to access 6 of the 7 <b>Synergistic</b> Processing Elements; Sony implemented a hypervisor restricting access to the RSX. The feature to install a second operating system on a PlayStation 3 was removed in a firmware update released in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Independently, {{when the}} effect on fitness of two {{mutations}} is more radical than expected from their effects when alone, it {{is referred to as}} <b>synergistic</b> epistasis. The opposite situation, when the fitness difference of the double mutant from the wild type is smaller than expected from the effects of the two single mutations, it is called antagonistic epistasis. Therefore, for deleterious mutations, negative epistasis is also <b>synergistic,</b> while positive epistasis is antagonistic; conversely, for advantageous mutations, positive epistasis is <b>synergistic,</b> while negative epistasis is antagonistic.|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin and {{doxycycline}} {{can have}} a <b>synergistic</b> effect when combined and kill bacteria (E. coli) with a higher potency {{than the sum of}} the two drugs together. This <b>synergistic</b> relationship is only temporary. After approximately 72 hours, the relationship shifts to become antagonistic, whereby a 50/50 combination of the two drugs kills less bacteria than if the two drugs were administered separately.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol in {{combination}} with diazepam may cause a <b>synergistic</b> enhancement of the hypotensive properties of benzodiazepines and alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Combining {{ablation}} therapy of tumors with immunotherapy {{enhances the}} immunostimulating response and has <b>synergistic</b> effects for curative metastatic cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|Interferon: <b>Synergistic</b> effects when {{administered}} with aciclovir and caution {{should be}} taken when administering aciclovir to patients receiving IV interferon.|$|E
25|$|Green tea extract {{epigallocatechin}} gallate (EGCG), {{which had been}} {{expected to have a}} <b>synergistic</b> effect, was found to reduce the effectiveness of bortezomib.|$|E
25|$|A {{major goal}} of ecology {{over the next}} century will be to {{understand}} how ecosystems will respond to current and future human impacts and the additive or <b>synergistic</b> interactions between them.|$|E
25|$|Thiazide diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, chlorthiazide) – may {{be useful}} for mild CHF, but {{typically}} used in severe CHF in combination with loop diuretics, resulting in a <b>synergistic</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the <b>synergistic</b> {{effect of}} these three {{proteins}} leads to cellular death through a cascade of events that allow the proteins to enter the cell and disrupt cellular function.|$|E
25|$|Together, {{cortisol}} and glucagon {{can have}} huge <b>synergistic</b> results, activating the PEPCK-C gene to levels that neither cortisol or glucagon could reach on their own. PEPCK-C is most {{abundant in the}} liver, kidney, and adipose tissue.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis from 2014 found that concurrent caffeine and -theanine use has <b>synergistic</b> psychoactive effects that promote alertness, attention, and task switching; these effects are most pronounced {{during the first}} hour post-dose.|$|E
25|$|Neither zaleplon, nor any nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} class medication {{should be}} combined with alcohol, as both modulate GABAA receptor sites, and in a <b>synergistic</b> manner increase the chances of fatal respiratory depression and asphyxiation from vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D and {{progesterone}} separately have neuroprotective effects after {{traumatic brain}} injury, but when combined their effects are <b>synergistic.</b> When used at their optimal respective concentrations, the two combined {{have been shown}} to reduce cell death more than when alone.|$|E
25|$|Mechatronics is the <b>synergistic</b> {{combination}} of mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, and software engineering. The {{purpose of this}} interdisciplinary engineering field {{is the study of}} automation from an engineering perspective and serves the purposes of controlling advanced hybrid systems.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Global Futures Collective Intelligence System (GFIS) {{was created}} by The Millennium Project, which epitomizes {{collective}} intelligence as the <b>synergistic</b> intersection among data/information/knowledge, software/hardware, and expertise/insights that has a recursive learning process for better decision-making than the individual players alone.|$|E
25|$|Carbogen {{has also}} played a role in {{psychedelic}} therapy research. Shamans have historically been well known throughout the world to mix two or more of some of the listed substances to produce <b>synergistic</b> effects. See psychoactive, entheogen, hallucinogen, psychotherapy, psychonaut, meditation, trance, mysticism, transcendence (philosophy).|$|E
25|$|Adenylate cyclases (of which 9 membrane-bound and one cytosolic {{forms are}} known in humans) {{may also be}} {{activated}} or inhibited in other ways (e.g., Ca2+/Calmodulin binding), which can modify the activity of these enzymes in an additive or <b>synergistic</b> fashion along with the G proteins.|$|E
25|$|Smoking is {{the most}} {{important}} risk factor for laryngeal cancer. Death from laryngeal cancer is 20 times more likely for heaviest smokers than for nonsmokers. Heavy chronic consumption of alcohol, particularly alcoholic spirits, is also significant. When combined, these two factors appear to have a <b>synergistic</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|PlayStation 3 {{initially}} shipped {{with the}} ability to install an alternative operating system alongside the main system software; Linux and other Unix based operating systems were available. The hardware allowed access to six of the seven <b>Synergistic</b> Processing Elements of the Cell microprocessor, but not the RSX 'Reality Synthesizer' graphics chip.|$|E
25|$|Rifampin {{increases}} the clearance of nitrazepam significantly and probenecid decreases its clearance significantly. Cimetidine slows down the elimination rate of nitrazepam, leading to more prolonged effects and {{increased risk of}} accumulation. Alcohol in combination with nitrazepam may cause a <b>synergistic</b> enhancement of the hypotensive properties of both benzodiazepines and alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Bupropion/naltrexone is a {{combination}} drug used for weight loss in those that are either obese or overweight with some weight-related illnesses It combines low doses of bupropion and naltrexone. Both drugs have individually shown some evidence of effectiveness in weight loss, and the combination {{has been shown to}} have some <b>synergistic</b> effects on weight.|$|E
25|$|Coma can be cyclic, {{with the}} {{individual}} alternating from a comatose state to a hyper-alert state of consciousness, which occurred in a 4-year-old boy who suffered an overdose of clonazepam. The combination of clonazepam and certain barbiturates, e.g. amobarbital, at prescribed doses {{has resulted in a}} <b>synergistic</b> potentiation of the effects of each drug, leading to serious respiratory depression.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to organic solvents {{in the work}} environment can produce a range of adverse neuropsychiatric effects. For example, occupational {{exposure to}} organic solvents {{has been associated with}} higher numbers of painters suffering from alcoholism. Ethanol has a <b>synergistic</b> effect when taken in combination with many solvents; for instance, a combination of toluene/benzene and ethanol causes greater nausea/vomiting than either substance alone.|$|E
25|$|On the PlayStation 3, image {{processing}} for PlayStation Move is {{performed in the}} console's Cell microprocessor. According to Sony, use of the motion-tracking library entails some <b>Synergistic</b> Processing Unit (SPU) overhead as well an impact on memory, though the company states that the effects will be minimized. According to Move motion controller co-designer Anton Mikhailov, the library uses 1-2 megabytes of system memory.|$|E
25|$|This {{hypothesis}} was proposed by Alexey Kondrashov, and is sometimes {{known as the}} deterministic mutation hypothesis. It assumes {{that the majority of}} deleterious mutations are only slightly deleterious, and affect the individual such that the introduction of each additional mutation has an increasingly large effect on the fitness of the organism. This relationship between number of mutations and fitness is known as <b>synergistic</b> epistasis.|$|E
25|$|Loss of pollinators, {{also known}} as Pollinator decline (of which colony {{collapse}} disorder {{is perhaps the most}} well known) has been noticed in recent years. Observed losses would have significant economic impacts. Possible explanations for pollinator decline include habitat destruction, pesticide, parasitism/diseases, climate change and others, and many researchers believe it is the <b>synergistic</b> effects of these factors which are ultimately detrimental to pollinator populations.|$|E
25|$|In {{a simple}} analysis, the Cell {{processor}} can be split into four components: external {{input and output}} structures, the main processor called the Power Processing Element (PPE) (a two-way simultaneous multithreaded Power ISA v.2.03 compliant core), eight fully functional co-processors called the <b>Synergistic</b> Processing Elements, or SPEs, and a specialized high-bandwidth circular data bus connecting the PPE, input/output elements and the SPEs, called the Element Interconnect Bus or EIB.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Crown {{patented}} the <b>synergistic</b> equalizer, {{releasing the}} stereo EQ-2 graphic equalizer which used {{a combination of}} shelving filters and eleven active frequency adjustment faders per channel. The faders were connected to constant bandwidth, variable Q, 1/2-octave filters placed on octave centers but with adjustable frequency knobs to shift the center frequency for greater flexibility. A limited number of units were sold to audiophiles and audio researchers.|$|E
25|$|France and the United States {{played a}} <b>synergistic</b> {{role in the}} {{international}} team, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, which crafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The French judge and Nobel Peace Laureate René Cassin produced the first draft and argued against arbitrary detentions. René Cassin and the French team subsequently championed the habeas corpus provisions enshrined in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.|$|E
25|$|A University of Texas {{publication}} {{notes that}} horned lizard populations continue to disappear throughout the southwest despite protective legislation. The Texas horned lizard has disappeared from {{almost half of}} its geographic range. Population declines are attributed to loss of habitat, human eradication of the ant populations upon which the lizards prey, displacement of native ant populations by invading fire ants (aided by <b>synergistic</b> effects of native ant eradication), and predation by domestic dogs and cats.|$|E
