40|$|Understanding {{the human}} brain remains the Holy Grail in {{biomedical}} science, and arguably {{in all of the}} sciences. Our brains represent the most complex systems in the world (and some contend the universe) comprising nearly one hundred billion neurons with <b>septillions</b> of possible connections between them. The structure of these connections engenders an efficient hierarchical system capable of consciousness, as well as complex thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Brain connectivity and network analyses have exploded over the last decade due to their potential in helping us understand both normal and abnormal brain function. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis examines functional associations between time series pairs in specified brain voxels or regions. Brain network analysis serves as a distinct subfield of connectivity analysis in which associations are quantified for all time series pairs to create an interconnected representation of the brain (a brain network), which allows studying its systemic properties. While connectivity analyses underlie network analyses, the subtle distinction between the two research areas has generally been overlooked in the literature, with them often being referred to synonymously. However, developing more useful analytic methods and allowing for more precise biological interpretations requires distinguishing these two complementary domains.

50|$|The {{yottabyte}} is {{a multiple}} of the unit byte for digital information.

5000|$|Under the Self-Indication Assumption the 'reference class' {{of which}} we are part {{includes}} a potentially vast number of the unborn (at least into this universe). In order to overturn the conventional DA calculation so completely the reservoir of souls (potential births) in the reference class must be astoundingly large. For instance, the certain-birth DA estimates the chance of reaching the trillionth (th) birth at around 5%; to shift this probability above 90% the SIA requires a potential number of humans (...) in the order of [...] (a <b>septillion</b> births). This might be feasible physically, and is also possible within the conventional DA model (though staggeringly unlikely). However, the SIA differs from the normal DA in having the reference class include all <b>septillion</b> unborn potential-humans at this point in history, when only sixty billion have been born. Including unborn people in the reference class we sample from means including in the reference class things for which we can never have any evidence. This puts the SIA at odds with philosophical approaches requiring strictly falsifiable constructs, such as Logical positivism.|$|E

5000|$|The numbers {{past one}} {{trillion}} {{in the short}} scale system, in ascending powers of 1000, are as follows: quadrillion, quintillion, sextillion, <b>septillion,</b> octillion, nonillion, decillion, undecillion, duodecillion, tredecillion, quattuordecillion, quindecillion, sexdecillion, septendecillion, octodecillion, novemdecillion and vigintillion (which is 10 to the 63rd power, or a one followed by 63 zeros). The highest number in this series listed in modern dictionaries is centillion, which is 10 to the 303rd power. [...] The interim powers of one thousand between vigintillion and centillion do not have standardized names, nor do any higher powers, {{but there are many}} ad hoc extensions in use.

5000|$|The device {{consisted}} of 25 aluminium discs {{attached to a}} four-and-a-half inch long rod, each disc containing the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet in scrambled order around its circumference (with {{the exception of the}} 17th disc, which began with the letters [...] "ARMY OF THE US"). Each wheel had a different arrangement of the alphabet, and was stamped with an identifying number and letter; wheels were identified according to the letter following [...] "A" [...] on that wheel, from [...] "B 1" [...] to [...] "Z 25". The wheels could be assembled on the rod in any order; the ordering used during encoding comprised the key. There were 25! (25 factorial) = 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000 (more than 15 <b>septillion)</b> possible keys, which can be expressed as about an 84-bit key size.|$|E
5000|$|The {{calculation}} of random permutations {{is a matter}} of statistics principally relying on the use of factorial calculations. In its simplest sense, the number of unique [...] "B" [...] columns assumes that all 15 numbers are available for the first row. That only 14 of the numbers are available for the second row (one having been consumed for the first row). And that only 13, 12, and 11 numbers are available for each of the third, fourth, and fifth rows. Thus, the number of unique [...] "B" [...] (and [...] "I", [...] "G", and [...] "O", respectively) columns is (15*14*13*12*11) = 360,360. The combinations of the [...] "N" [...] column differ due {{to the use of the}} free space. Therefore, it has only (15*14*13*12) = 32,760 unique combinations. The product of the five rows (360,3604 * 32,760) describes the total number of unique playing cards. That number is 552,446,474,061,128,648,601,600,000 simplified as 5.52x1026 or 552 <b>septillion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common pattern set, known as [...] "Straight-line Bingo" [...] is {{completing}} any of the five rows, columns, or either of the main diagonals. [...] In this case the possibility of multiple winning cards is unavoidable because any one of twelve patterns on every card can win the game. But not all 552 <b>septillion</b> cards {{need to be in}} play. Any given set of numbers in a column (e.g., 15, 3, 14, 5, 12 in the [...] "B" [...] column) can be represented in any of 5! (for the [...] "B", [...] "I", [...] "G", and [...] "O" [...] columns. 4! for the [...] "N" [...] column) or 120 different ways. These combinations are all statistically redundant. Therefore, the total number of cards can be reduced by a factor of (5!4 * 4!) = 4,976,640,000 for a total unique winning card set of 111,007,923,832,370,565 or 111 quadrillion.

Note that the carrying capacity is the maximum number of people in any potential universe, not just this one, but even on Earth the maximum number of people that sunlight can simultaneously support has been estimated (e.g. by Isaac Asimov) at over a trillion; extending this for a million generations gives an upper limit over a quintillion on just this planet, and a <b>septillion</b> if humanity colonizes fewer than 0.001% of the galaxys stars with similar efficiency.
