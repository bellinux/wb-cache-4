40|$|Ethylene {{treatment}} has proven effective in shortening the postharvest cold storage period required for Anjou pears to ripen. This allows Anjou pears to be marketed {{earlier in the}} season. To analyze ethyleneâ s effect on eating quality and elicit consumersâ preferences and values, three sensory tests plus stated preference experiments were conducted {{at different points in}} time after harvest. Results indicate that consumers were willing to pay a premium of $ 0. 65 /lb to have highly edible quality pears in the early season (10 days cold <b>storage).</b> This <b>premium</b> is for pears treated with ethylene to speed ripening. As the cold storage period increased (70 days and 169 days) the premiums for conditioned fruit decreased ($ 0. 20 /lb and $ 0. 29 /lb). Washington State UniversityGallardo, R. K. et al.

50|$|The {{traditional}} architecture of Santorini {{is similar to}} that of the other Cyclades, with low-lying cubical houses, made of local stone and whitewashed or limewashed with various volcanic ashes used as colours. The unique characteristic is the common utilisation of the hypóskapha: extensions of houses dug sideways or downwards into the surrounding pumice. These rooms are prized because of the high insulation provided by the air-filled pumice, and are used as living quarters of unique coolness in the summer and warmth in the winter. These are <b>premium</b> <b>storage</b> space for produce, especially for wine cellaring: the Kánava wineries of Santorini.|$|R

In this paper we address two problems that arise in the practical use of extensible processors. Using multiple extensible regions can lead to avoidable time and space inefficiencies, and the physical placement of the interconnection points strongly affects the overall design timings. Standard tool-flows from FPGA manufacturers require the creation of separate configuration images for each region. The space and time complexities that this entails are undesirable, especially in an embedded system setting where <b>storage</b> is at <b>premium.</b> In this paper we introduce a run-time algorithm that allows the relocation of one configuration image to any number of compatible regions, in linear time.

40|$|With dynamic partial {{reconfiguration}} (PR) we can augment a softcore with application specific {{blocks that}} may change, or reconfigure, during run-time.

40|$|Five {{selected}} traditionally {{dried fish}} species e. g. Puntius ticto, Labeo bata, Wallago attu, Channa striatus and Palaemon sp. were collected for the nutritional composition {{from the study}} area, Chalan Beel, Singra. The nutritional composition of protein, moisture, ash and fat of selected dried species was recorded. Chemical analyses were done by following equations. Moisture content (g/ 100 g of sample) = weight of moisture / weight of fish sample × 100, ash content (g/ 100 g of sample) = weight of ash obtained / weight of fish sample × 100, fat content (g/ 100 mg of sample) = Weight of the ether extractive / Weight of the fish sample × 100 and protein content (g/ 100 mg of sample) = weight of protein obtained / weight of fish sample × 100. The analytical data on chemical composition showed that the moisture content was found varies from 12. 13 % (Puntius ticto) to 18. 18 % (Palaemon sp.). Ash content of was ranging from 10. 78 % (Labeo bata) to 15. 67 % (Palaemon sp.). Protein content of selected dried fishes varied from 28. 20 % (Wallago attu) to 51. 19 % (Palaemon sp.).

40|$|As part of {{the design}} of the Process and Environmental Technology Laboratory (PETL) in FY 97, an energy {{conservation}} report (ECR) was completed. The original energy baseline for the building, established in Title 1 design, was 595, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr, site energy use. Following the input of several reviewers and the incorporation of the various recommendations into the Title 2 design, the projected energy consumption was reduced to 341, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr. Of this reduction, it is estimated that about 150, 000 BTU/sq. ft. /yr resulted from inclusion of more energy efficient options into the design. The remaining reductions resulted from better accounting of energy consumption between Title 1 ECR and the final ECR. The energy efficient features selected by the outcome of the ECR were: (1) Energy Recovery system, with evaporative cooling assist, for the Exhaust/Make-up Air System; (2) Chilled Water Thermal <b>Storage</b> system; (3) <b>Premium</b> efficiency motors for large, year-round applications; (4) Variable frequency drives for all air handling fan motors; (4) Premium efficiency multiple boiler system; and (5) Lighting control system. The annual energy cost savings due to these measures will be about $ 165, 000. The estimated annual energy savings are two million kWhrs electric, and 168, 000 therms natural gas, the total of which is equivalent to 23, 000 million BTUs per year. Put into the perspective of a typical office/light lab at SNL/NM, the annual energy savings is equal the consumption of a 125, 000 square foot building.

40|$|Agro {{ecological}} diversity and favorable environment have enabled Pakistan to harvest bulk of potato crop however facing problems of poor post harvest management practices and unavailability of superior {{raw material for}} the potato processing industry. A comprehensive study was planned to identify best packaging material and appropriate storage conditions for the premium potato variety. The present study has been divided in to three different phase to address specific objectives. The first phase of study encompasses physico-chemical, functional and processing attributes in prominent potato varieties. The selected variety was subjected to different post harvest storage conditions along with their processing parameters analysis in {{second phase of the}} study. The last phase of study evaluated the <b>storage</b> stability of <b>premium</b> variety under best results identified in the second phase. In the first phase of study, physical attributes (tuber size, geometric mean diameter, sphericity, surface area, firmness, specific gravity, total soluble solids, pH, sprouting %, tuber color) Chemical attributes (dry matter, starch, protein, fat, sugar, fibre, ash and predominant minerals) functional attributes (ascorbic acids, glycoalkaloids, total phenolic contents, radical scavenging activity) and processing performance (chip moisture contents, fat absorption, color and sensorial attributes) were evaluated in ten commercial varieties i. e. Agria, Atlantic, Cardinal, Chipsona, Courage, Desi, Desiree, Hermes, Lady Rosetta, and Satellite. In general Lady Rosetta followed by Hermes was the most appreciable variety regarding their physical attributes. Lady Rosetta followed by Atlantic attained maximum dry matter and starch contents. Least sugar contents were recorded in Agria and maximum fat and protein contents were quantified in Desiree. In general functional attributes were found maximum in Desi followed by Desiree. A promising correlation was estimated between most of these parameters with distinctive correlation (R= 0. 903) identified between total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity. Post processing parameters like moisture contents, fat absorption, and sensory evaluation in Lady Rosetta showed its preference over all other varieties followed by Hermes. In the second phase varietyâ€� Lady Rosettaâ€� was evaluated under different storage conditions (packaging, light, temperature, and anti sprouting agents) on the basis of transition in their quality attributes (reported in 1 st phase) and enzymatic (polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase) activities. Potatoes were stored under different packaging materials (jute, nylon, polypropylene, cotton, low density polyethylene, medium density polyethylene, high density polyethylene) at ambient temperature (25 Â± 2 oC). Results revealed that polypropylene packaging and low density polyethylene packaging were found best and maintained tubers quality attributes up to 63 days, while other packaging materials were also found effective as compare to control. Thirty days storage of tubers under different illuminations (blue, fluorescent, green, mercury, red, dark) at ambient temperature (25 Â± 2 oC) was carried out. Potato tubers kept under dark presented minimum loss of quality parameters however green and mercury lights posed best storage performance over all other illuminations during one month. Tubers were found highly susceptible to fluorescent light with poor processing attributes were recorded in red and blue light exposures. Results under comparative temperature regimes (5, 15 and 25 oC) showed maximum storage stability up to 126 days under 5 oC, however associated with low enzyme activity, elevated sugars contents in tubers and poor processing performances in fried chips. Exposing tubers to different anti sprouting agents (hot water treatment, spearmint oil, clove oil, CIPC) showed that CIPC and Clove oils applications were found significant in preventing tuber sprouting at the end of 80 days storage. In general, both retained superior tuber characters with remarkable processing characters during the storage period. Tuber dormancy was ensured under both treatments till the end at ambient temperature (25 Â± 2 oC) storage. In the last phase integrated post harvest management of potato variety â€œLady Rosettaâ€� on the basis of best results identified in second phase ensured tuber dormancy and prolonged storage life up to 180 days with appreciable retention of tuber quality attributes and superior processing performance as compare to 100 % sprouting observed in control on the 80 th day of storage. Coating of potato chips with 20 % aloe vera gel presented best results with reduced fat uptake along with appreciable sensorial scores...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{identify}} the critical operational characteristics for various distribution strategies, and then develop integrated distribution network design models by {{taking into account}} those operational factors. ^ The {{first part of this}} thesis presents a crossdocking network design problem for a two–stage and single commodity supply chain. While crossdocking is an attractive distribution strategy in terms of the substantial reduction of both the inventories at distribution facilities and the flow time of products within a network, the lead time experienced by a customer could be higher in a crossdocking system than in warehousing systems. In crossdocking, customers have to wait additional time for inbound transportation from the plants to the crossdocking center, whereas in warehousing, they receive the products from nearby warehouses which maintain stock in anticipation of the customers’ orders. Load balancing at a crossdocking center is another critical operational consideration. If incoming loads are not sufficient, then the retailers face stock–outs and if the incoming loads are excessive, then overstocked crossdocking centers force managers to acquire third–party <b>storage</b> services at <b>premium</b> rates. Since the effectiveness of a crossdocking strategy primarily depends on the successful management of the lead time and load balancing which are a function of inventory decisions as well as the network topology, both the lead time and inventory decisions should be considered at the strategic network design stage. We present a capacitated crossdocking network design model that minimizes the total logistics cost while controlling the lead times, inventory levels, and load–balancing. The proposed heuristics that are based on Lagrangian relaxation show good performance in terms of solution quality as well as computational requirements. ^ The second part of this thesis is devoted to warehouse capacity acquisition–location models. While location models for distribution facilities have been widely studied, the capacity of warehouses is mostly ignored or assumed to be given. In addition, the capacity of a warehouse should be measured by its physical size, such as the available floor space or the maximum amount of inventory to be stored at any given time, and not the throughput, such as the average number of products going through the warehouse per time period. In this sense, the inventory management decisions should be considered at the strategic network design stage. Furthermore, the capacity cost under our consideration exhibits the economies and diseconomies of scale as well. As the size of a warehouse increases, the unit increment of the capacity cost decreases at first, and after the size of a warehouse exceeds a certain point, the unit increment of the capacity cost increases. The objective of this research is to develop integrated models for designing optimal or near optimal capacitated warehouse–distribution networks by determining the number, the location, the capacities, as well as the inventory policy of warehouses simultaneously. Heuristics based on Lagrangian relaxation are proposed. ^ The third part of this thesis compares crossdocking and warehousing distribution strategies in a quantitative form. The ultimate goal of our research is providing decision support tools for companies to aid them in determining the appropriate distribution strategy under their own business environment. We analyze and compare the efficiency of each distribution strategy in a quantitative form. As a first step towards deriving comparable models for various distribution strategies, we propose analytical integrated network design models under deterministic demand as well as simulation models under stochastic demand. First, we introduce analytical models, which approximate the supply chain network design for both crossdocking and warehousing systems. Specifically, we consider a two–stage, single product, and single plant supply chain. We determine the number of distribution centers to minimize the sum of the location cost for distribution centers (i. e., crossdocking center or warehouse) and the total logistics cost across the supply chain. Each distribution center serves a set of retailers each of which faces deterministic demand. Next, we present simulation models to compare these two strategies when the retailers face stochastic demand. We determine the number of distribution centers and inventory policies at the distribution centers and the retailers. Numerical results showing the performance of these two strategies and the relationship between the level of uncertainty in demand and the total cost of each distribution strategy are presented. Finally, we offer some managerial insights regarding the type of distribution strategies and the associated operational policies that may be appropriate for a given business environment.
