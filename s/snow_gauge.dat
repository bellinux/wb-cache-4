40|$|Snow {{accumulation}} and ablation {{rule the}} temporal dynamics of water availability in mountain areas and cold regions. In these environments, {{the evaluation of}} the snow water amount is a key issue. The spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) over a mountain basin {{at the end of the}} snow accumulation season is estimated using a minimal statistical model (SWE-SEM). This uses systematic observations such as ground measurements collected at <b>snow</b> <b>gauges</b> and snow-covered area (SCA) data retrieved by remote sensors, here MODIS. Firstly, SWE-SEM calculates local SWE estimates at <b>snow</b> <b>gauges,</b> then the spatial distribution of SWE over a certain area using an interpolation method; linear regressions of the first two order moments of SWE with altitude. The interpolation has been made by both confining and unconfining the spatial domain by SCA. SWE-SEM is applied to the Mallero basin (northern Italy) for calculating the snow water equivalent at the end of the winter season for 6 years (2001 ¿ 2007). For 2007, SWE-SEM estimates are validated through fieldwork measurements collected during an ¿ad hoc¿ campaign on March 31, 2007.

Such a {{model can be}} of interest for natural risk management (avalanches, debris flows, flooding), hydropower generation or tourism.

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of snowfall in the Arctic has significant effects on global climate. However, measurements of snowfall from gauges are strongly biased. A new method is described for reconstructing snowfall from observed snow depth records, meteorological observations, and running the NASA Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction Project Catchment Land Surface Model (NSIPP CLSM) in an inverse mode. This method is developed and tested with observations from Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed. Results show snowfall can be accurately reconstructed {{on the basis of}} how much snow must have fallen to produce the observed snow depth. The mean cumulative error (bias) of the reconstructed precipitation for 11 snow seasons is 29 mm snow water equivalent (SWE) for the corrected gauge measurement compared to ‒ 77 mm SWE for the precipitation from the corrected <b>snow</b> <b>gauges.</b> This means the root-mean-square error of reconstructed solid precipitation is 30 % less than that of gauge corrections.

40|$|The {{technique}} for calculating the snow cover characteristics (a water equivalent and a snow cover thickness) with high spatial and time resolution on spacious plains is proposed. The model SPONSOR of local heat- and moisture exchange (Land-Surface Model, LSM) and data of reanalyses NCEP/DOE and ECMWF ERA-Interim {{were used for}} calculations. The above characteristics of the snow cover on the test area of the Moscow region were calculated using this method over the period 1979 – 1996. The results were compared with actual data of the <b>snow</b> <b>gauge</b> stations and with data on snow cover, derived directly from reanalysis. The data from the NCEP/DOE reanalysis did not show satisfactory agreement with data of the observations for both the water equivalent and the thickness (Fig.   1,  б and Fig.   2, б) : deviations reached 60 – 70 %. Monthly mean values of snow water equivalent from the ERA-Interim reanalysis were in a good agreement with the observations, but the snow thicknesses were reproduced much worse. At the same time, using the LSM SPONSOR with input meteorological data from the reanalyses allowed obtaining the snow cover characteristics which were in a good agreement with data of the observations for both the monthly means and individual daily values. The correlation coefficients with the data of <b>snow</b> <b>gauge</b> surveys increased, on the average, up to 0. 83 – 0. 89 for the water equivalent, and up to 0. 85 – 0. 91 for the snow depth (see the Тable in the text).

40|$|The {{closure of}} water balances, {{as well as}} input into hydrologic models, for {{watersheds}} in the Arctic require good estimates of the spatially distributed snowpack (Yang and Woo, 1999). Ignoring the under catch {{of all types of}} precipitation <b>gauges,</b> <b>snow</b> <b>gauges</b> still perform inadequately when used to predict the snowpack distribution at winter’s end in certain environments. The reason is simple; snow on the ground is susceptible to transportation by the wind along the surface in windy treeless environments (Liston and Sturm, 2002). This results in a very heterogeneous snowpack distribution, with greater quantities collecting in depressions, valley bottoms and leeward sides of ridges. Sublimation losses from the snowpack during the winter are further enhanced during transport. From the forecasting point of view, it is imperative to have a relatively good estimate of the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) over the catchment. Because of the heterogeneity of the snow cover, {{it is very difficult to}} come up with a single number that represents the average SWE. Because channel networks generally represent depressions in a catchment and shrubs and small trees are more dominant in riparian ecosystems, drifting snow tends to collect in and adjacent to the drainage network. Obviously this enhances runoff and generally reduces evapotranspiration (ET). Hydrologic models for hydrologic forecasting are becoming more complex. This complexity takes tw...|$|R

The performance of the MM 5 is compared to the gauge data for 3 wet seasons and for 10 large precipitation events. The cumulative MM 5 precipitation forecasts for all seasons and for the sum of all 10 large events compare well with the precipitation measured by the gauges, although some of the individual events are significantly over- or underforecast. This suggests that the MM 5 is reproducing the precipitation climatology {{in the vicinity of the}} gauges, but that errors for individual events may arise due to inaccurate specification of the incident flow. A computationally simple model of orographic precipitation is shown to reproduce the major features of the event precipitation pattern on the windward side of the range.

The modifications induced by the gauge and the windshield onto the space–time patterns of the undisturbed airflow deviate the snowflake trajectories. In Part I, the disturbed air velocity field {{in the vicinity of}} shielded and unshielded gauge configurations is investigated. In Part II, the airflow is the basis for a particle tracking model of snowflake trajectories to estimate the collection efficiency. A Geonor T- 200 B gauge inside a single Alter shield is simulated for wind speeds varying from 1 to 8 m s− 1. Both time-averaged and time-dependent computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed, based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) models, respectively. A shear stress tensor k–Ω model (where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and Ω is the turbulent specific dissipation rate) is used for the RANS formulation and solved within a finite-volume method. The LES is implemented with a Smagorinsky subgrid-scale method that models the subgrid stresses as a gradient-diffusion process. The RANS simulations confirm the attenuation of the airflow velocity above the gauge when using a single Alter shield, but the generated turbulence above the orifice rim is underestimated. The intensity and spatial extension of the LES-resolved turbulent region show a dependency on the wind speed that was not detected by the RANS.

The method is {{tested for the}} semiarid Konya basin (Turkey), {{one of the largest}} endorheic basins in the world. Based on the spatially distributed water balance estimation, the mean irrigation for croplands was 308 mm yr− 1, which corresponds to a total reduction of 2270 million cubic meters per year (106 m 3 yr− 1, or MCM yr− 1) in the groundwater storage during the study period 2005 – 09. The storage change estimated as the residual of the spatially distributed water balance was confirmed by the volume change calculated from groundwater table observations. To obtain an improved precipitation distribution, the monthly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall product was assessed.
