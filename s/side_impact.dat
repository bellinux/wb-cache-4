5|$|The Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) {{rated the}} i-MiEV {{four out of}} five stars for crash safety, scoring 28.35 out of 37. This score takes into account a 10.95 out of 16 rating in the frontal offset crash test, and a score of 14.4 out of 16 {{received}} for the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> test.|$|E
5|$|The case is {{particularly}} notable {{as an example}} of judicial legislation, with the judges significantly modernising the law and moving it forward in a way Parliament had not considered. As a <b>side</b> <b>impact,</b> Coke's arguments were the first to define consideration. The conservative outlook of the Common Pleas soon changed; after the death of Edmund Anderson, the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and other Common Pleas judges, many of whom were uncertain but had followed Anderson's lead in the case, changed their mind.|$|E
5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Voltâ€™s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
50|$|Newer {{cars have}} {{improved}} safety of front crashes, but <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> are also deadly; about 9,700 {{people were killed}} in <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> in the US in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|Euro NCAP, IIHS and NHTSA test <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> in {{different}} ways. , they all test vehicle-to-vehicle <b>side</b> <b>impacts,</b> [...] where heavier vehicles have lower fatality rates than lighter vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|Collisions at {{junctions}} include {{rear-end collision}} and angle or <b>side</b> <b>impacts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
25|$|According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety the Azera {{received}} a Good overall {{score in the}} frontal crash test and an Acceptable overall score in the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> test. The driver's pelvis/leg in the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> category was given a Poor score and the structure/safety category rated Marginal.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the 960 {{introduced}} the first {{three-point seat belt}} for {{the middle of the}} rear seat and a child safety cushion integrated in the middle armrest. Also in 1991, it {{introduced the}} <b>Side</b> <b>Impact</b> Protection System (SIPS) on the 700, 940/960 and 850 models, which channels the force of a <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> away from the doors and into the safety cage.|$|E
40|$|Thoracic side-airbags (SAB) {{have proven}} to protect front seat {{occupants}} in <b>side</b> <b>impacts.</b> This benefit has not been evaluated for rear seat occupants who are typically small statured. The objective was to analyze field data from rear seat occupants in near <b>side</b> <b>impacts,</b> and evaluate {{the effect of a}} SAB in the rear seat, through full scale vehicle tests...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are used}} to study the transient behavior of a four degree-of-freedom, rotational piecewise linear system. This study focuses on the impact between bodies in a system with backlash {{as a result of}} a sudden step input and the associated transient response. The subsequent single <b>sided</b> <b>impacts</b> and double <b>sided</b> <b>impacts</b> are studied as a function of the amplitude of the step input and the size of the backlash. Transitions have been observed between double <b>sided</b> <b>impact</b> regions and single <b>sided</b> <b>impact</b> regions, which agree with earlier findings. However, in this paper a more complete overview of the boundaries is given. The severity of the impacts is quantified with the peak-to-peak acceleration of the impacting bodies. The increase in the size of step input increases the severity of the impacts. However, the increase in backlash size leads to an extremum in impact severity. This is a possible explanation for seeming contradictions in literature...|$|R
5000|$|Angle or <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> (1,779,000 crashes, 28.9% of all US crashes, 20.7% of US fatal crashes) ...|$|R
25|$|The crash {{structure}} was also improved, featuring <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> bars, a reinforced safety cage, improved crumple zones, front seat-belt pretensioners and airbags.|$|E
25|$|In July 2000 new <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> safety {{standards}} {{were to take}} effect in Japan. With the FTO sales moving at an ever slower pace, it was deemed not cost effective to update the car and it was thus discontinued.|$|E
25|$|The S70 scored five of five {{stars for}} front impact {{protection}} for driver and front passenger in the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety testing, and {{four out of}} five stars for driver and rear passenger <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> protection.|$|E

40|$|Under the EU funded project APROSYS, an {{integrated}} sensor-actuator system {{is being built}} to detect and mitigate <b>side</b> <b>impacts.</b> Radar and stereo video in the target car {{will be used to}} detect and track potential bullet objects. As a result, actuators will be triggered if a crash is predicted by the sensor system. The actuators that will be developed under APROSYS can temporarily modify the structure of the target car in order to distribute the impact energy in an optimal way. In this contribution the problem is addressed to detect <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> by analyzing image sequences of a side-looking camera. The authors analyze geometric relations both in image and world coordinates. It can be concluded that the detection of expanding flow fields with a focus of expansion inside the image boundaries is not sufficient to unambiguously detect <b>side</b> <b>impacts.</b> The problem is further constrained by taking into account the shape of the camera carrying car, and by assuming a minimum velocity of the impacting car. Further work will address the robustness of the approach, and its optimization with respect to a real-time implementation...|$|R
25|$|Hybrid IIIs are {{designed}} to research the effects of frontal impacts, and are less useful in assessing the effects {{of other types of}} impact, such as side impacts, rear impacts, or rollovers. After head-on collisions, the most common severe injury accident is the <b>side</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E
25|$|The AMC Hornet {{was also}} the first U.S. made {{automobile}} to feature guardrail beam doors to protect occupants {{in the event of a}} <b>side</b> <b>impact.</b> The 1973 Hornet hatchback was the first U.S.-made compact hatchback design, introduced one year ahead of the 1974 Ford Mustang and the Chevrolet Nova hatchback versions.|$|E
25|$|The Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) {{rated the}} Evoque {{four out of}} five stars for crash safety, scoring 32.49 out of 37. This score takes into account the 12.39 out of 16 rating in the frontal offset crash test, and the score of 16 out of 16 {{received}} for the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> test.|$|E
50|$|In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash {{tests the}} Astra earned a Good overall score in frontal <b>impacts,</b> while in <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> it {{received}} a Marginal overall rating. Front and rear head curtain airbags and front seat-mounted torso airbags were standard.|$|R
30|$|Likewise, {{statistically}} significant differences were observed when the lateral angulations of the long axis of incisors were compared according to the <b>side</b> of the <b>impacted</b> canine. The lateral angulation of the long axis of the incisors was lower on the <b>impacted</b> <b>side</b> presenting disto-angulated incisors on the <b>side</b> of <b>impacted</b> canine and mesial-angulated on the non-impacted side.|$|R
50|$|The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) {{gives the}} 2004 Rainier an overall Marginal score for front impacts while the 2005 and newer models are given an Acceptable score. In <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> the Rainier {{was given an}} overall Marginal score with side airbags present.|$|R
25|$|Also new was a variable-ratio power {{steering}} unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles)for improved <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> protection {{as was the case}} with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.|$|E
25|$|Other notable changes {{include the}} {{addition}} of <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> airbags for the front passengers and a change of format for the navigation system. The 2000 TL switched from a CD database to a DVD-based navigation system. The entire continental United States became accessible with the navigation system; {{it was possible to}} drive from one coast to the other with the new navigation system.|$|E
25|$|One {{innovation}} was {{the attention}} paid to passive safety. The car featured a robust chassis providing above average <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> protection, an unusually short steering column with the steering gear set well back {{from the front of}} the car, and a fuel tank placed in a carefully protected location above the rear axle in order to minimize fire risk in the event of an accident.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, three {{measurements}} on the <b>side</b> of <b>impacted</b> canines {{were significantly lower}} than on the side without impaction; width from premolar to the mid-palatine raphe and lateral angulations of incisors (lateral and central) showed significant reduction, presenting disto-angulated incisors on the <b>side</b> of <b>impacted</b> canine.|$|R
5000|$|The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{gives the}} Charger an overall Good score in frontal crash tests. [...] In <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> Charger models {{equipped}} with optional side airbags {{are given a}} Marginal score overall, and models without side airbags are given the lowest overall Poor score.|$|R
50|$|Crashes at intersections (road junctions) are a {{very common}} type of road {{collision}} types. Collisions may involve head-on impact when one vehicle crosses an opposing lane of traffic to turn at an intersection, or <b>side</b> <b>impacts</b> when one vehicle crosses the path of an adjoining vehicle at an intersection.|$|R
25|$|In 1994, {{to add to}} its SIPS, Volvo was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} side airbags and installed them as standard equipment in all models from 1995. At the start of the 1995 model year, <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> protection airbags were standard on high trim-level Volvo 850s, and optional on other 850s. By the middle of the production year, they were standard on all 850s. In model year 1995, SIPS airbags became standard on all Volvo models.|$|E
25|$|The W124 also {{featured}} a driver's side airbag (optional in Europe, later {{standard in the}} USA), height-adjustable seat belts with electronic-mechanical pre-tensioneers (standard) for both front passengers, rear seat belts which automatically adapted {{to the size of}} the passengers (standard), pedals that were moved inversely in a frontal impact (away from the drivers feet and in the direction of the bulkhead separating the cabin from the engine) and door arm rests with deformable elements designed to reduce abdominal injury risk resulting from a <b>side</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2002 Euro NCAP {{gave the}} PT Cruiser a three (out of five) stars rating. The car {{received}} bad {{results in the}} frontal impact test (6 out of 16 possible points). The height of the seats and side airbags helped to attain a maximum score of 16 points in the <b>side</b> <b>impact</b> test. The low frontal scores are in part explained by the cushioning near the knees, designed to protect unbelted occupants, {{which is not a}} factor in the EU where passengers must wear seat belts.|$|E
50|$|Standard safety {{features}} on all trims include 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, brake-assist, and EBD; electronic stability control; and front, side-, and side-curtain airbags. The NHTSA awarded {{the second generation}} Murano 4 stars on the frontal crash test and 5 stars for <b>side</b> <b>impacts,</b> worse than the first generation.|$|R
5000|$|Vision Zero {{suggests}} the following [...] "possible long term maximum travel speeds {{related to the}} infrastructure, given best practice in vehicle design and 100% restraint use". These speeds are based on human and automobile limits. For example, the human tolerance for a pedestrian hit by a well-designed car is approximately 30 km/h. If a higher speed in urban areas is desired, the option is to separate pedestrian crossings from the traffic. If not, pedestrian crossings, or zones (or vehicles), must be designed to generate speeds of a maximum of 30 km/h. Similarly, the inherent safety of well-designed cars can be anticipated to be a maximum of 70 km/h in frontal impacts, and 50 km/h in <b>side</b> <b>impacts.</b> Speeds over 100 km/h can be tolerated if the infrastructure is designed to prevent frontal and <b>side</b> <b>impacts.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{engaged in}} flight {{operations}} {{off the coast}} of Honduras the evening of 29 January 2001, a large wave rocked the Campbell just as HH-6571, an HH-65 Dolphin helicopter was touching down.
