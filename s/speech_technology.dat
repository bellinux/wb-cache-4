25|$|SAMPA was devised as a hack to {{work around}} the {{inability}} of text encodings to represent IPA symbols. Consequently, as Unicode support for IPA symbols becomes more widespread, the necessity for a separate, computer-readable system for representing the IPA in ASCII decreases. However, text input relies on specific keyboard encodings or input devices. For this reason, SAMPA and X-SAMPA are still widely used in computational phonetics and in <b>speech</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
500|$|Though Mya's {{character}} was {{generally regarded as}} impressive, the underlying technology was described by Peggy Albright in Wireless Week as not surprising; Albright said Motorola was [...] "latest company in recent weeks to introduce a voice-activated virtual assistant", as Mya was announced shortly after Microsoft had announced their MiPad, and Lucent had launched their Mobile Voice Activated Dialing software. However, Tobey Grummet spoke highly {{of the program in}} anticipation of its release, and Mya was described by Elliot Drucker of Wireless Week as a solution to the limitations of accessing the Internet on a mobile phone, without a keyboard or large colour display. While regarding the program with interest, John Sullivan doubted that Mya would persuade people who were not already on the Internet to start using it, and stated that if Mya could only read emails and not actually converse with him, he would rather just read his emails himself. Dawn Chmielewski from the Orange County Register called Mya a [...] "crude interpretation of things to come", noting that <b>speech</b> <b>technology</b> at the time was not without its limitations.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} {{the design and}} implementation of Spoke, a JavaScript framework for building interactive speech-enabled web applications. This project was motivated by {{the need for a}} consolidated framework for integrating custom <b>speech</b> <b>technologies</b> into website backends to demonstrate their power. Spoke achieves this by providing a Node. js server-side library with a set of modules that interface with a handful of custom <b>speech</b> <b>technologies</b> that can perform speech recognition, forced alignment, and mispronunciation detection. In addition, Spoke provides a client-side framework enabling some audio processing in the browser and streaming of the user's audio to a server for recording and backend processing with the aforementioned integrated <b>speech</b> <b>technologies.</b> Spoke's client-side and server-side modules can be used in conjunction to create interactive websites for speech recognition, audio collection, and second language learning, as demonstrated in three sample applications. Though Spoke was designed with the needs of the MIT Spoken Language Systems group in mind, it could easily be adopted by other researchers and developers hoping to incorporate their own <b>speech</b> <b>technologies</b> into functional websites. by Patricia Saylor.

40|$|Older adults {{interacting}} with <b>speech</b> <b>technologies</b> {{may benefit from}} a range of communicative accommodations. Potential accommodations include volume, intonation, and sentence structure, to name a few. This paper reviews the literature on human communication with the elderly in search of recommendations for speech interface design. We conclude that spontaneous human behavior cannot easily be taken as a guide in designing communicative interactions for older adults. Due to substantial variability in the population, successful accommodations are largely dependent on the specifics of speaker and situation. Regrettably, humans are frequently not attuned to these specifics, and inappropriate accommodation is often perceived as patronizing. <b>Speech</b> <b>technologies</b> present a...|$|R
