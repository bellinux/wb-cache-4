40|$|This paper {{grew out}} of my {{interest}} in two areas: sports and business. Unfortunately, my first love, sports, is now becoming a big business. Major league sports are now dependent upon <b>stadiums</b> <b>and</b> the revenue they generate. Unfortunately, these <b>stadiums</b> <b>and</b> their "creative" financing packages have serious ramifications on the local communities.

This project examines the following areas: sources of financing, benefits of sports <b>stadiums</b> <b>and</b> sports franchises, and survey results from local businesspeople to determine {{the impact of the}} Indianapolis Colts on the community.
