5|$|In 1998, the Giants {{were unable}} to build on their {{successful}} 1997 season, and needed a four-game winning <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> close out the season at 8–8. The Giants strength was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense {{continued to be a}} disappointment. Brown had been jettisoned and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. Neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl caliber play, although Graham led the Giants to a 5–1 finish (including an upset of the then-undefeated Denver Broncos in Week 15).|$|E

However, selection of safer odds after winning and riskier ones after losing indicates that online sports gamblers expected their luck to reverse: they suffered from the gamblers’ fallacy.

Denard Robinson gained 192 yards of total offense against the Buckeyes, but left the game {{during the third}} quarter due to two dislocated fingers on his left hand.

With {{the maximum number of}} 100 points from the first four races of the season, Rosberg left Russia with a 43-point lead to Hamilton. By securing pole position, winning the race, setting the fastest lap and leading every lap, Nico Rosberg achieved the first grand slam of his career.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April 2009, Diarra {{scored the}} only goal in Bordeaux's 1–0 win over title rivals Lyon at the Stade de Gerland. The victory helped the club create {{a gap between}} itself and Lyon.

5|$|On November 9, 2007, Yao {{played against}} fellow Chinese NBA and Milwaukee Bucks player Yi Jianlian {{for the first}} time. The game, which the Rockets won 104–88, was {{broadcast}} on 19networks in China, and was watched by over 200million people in China alone, {{making it one of}} the most-watched NBA games in history. In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference. Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> 12games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left foot. He missed the 2008 NBA Playoffs, but he did not miss the 2008 Summer Olympics at Beijing, China in August. After Yao's injury, the Rockets stretched their winning <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> 22 games, at the time the second-longest such streak in NBA history. Yao underwent a successful operation on March 3, which placed screws in his foot to strengthen the bone, and recovery time was estimated at four months. Yao's final averages in 55games were 22.0points, 10.8rebounds, and 2.0blocks a game.|$|E

A week later, he attacked Sheamus with a Pedigree through a broadcast table in retaliation for Sheamus giving him a ten-month injury. At WrestleMania XXVII, Triple H lost, which extended Undertaker's undefeated <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> 19–0; Undertaker was carried from the ring on a stretcher whereas Triple H left on his own accord.|$|E
5|$|SMU's resounding {{victory was}} {{considered}} an upset, and during the game, the Mustangs set a single-season record for most interceptions returned for a touchdown (8), surpassing the 2011 Southern Miss Golden Eagles football team. Margus Hunt was named the game's Most Valuable Player because of his two-forced fumble, three-sack (including one safety) performance. In total, the Mustangs achieved seven sacks, the most Fresno State had surrendered in a single game all year. Davante Adams' third-quarter touchdown reception lengthened his <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> eight consecutive games with a touchdown reception, tying a Fresno State record that was set by Henry Ellard in 1982.|$|E

5|$|The Browns next {{beat the}} Los Angeles Dons 31–14 in Cleveland {{to extend their}} winning <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> seven games. The crowd of 71,134 people who {{attended}} the game on a sunny October day was a professional football record. Cleveland {{got off to a}} slow start, falling behind 7–3 at halftime. The Browns' only score in the first half came on a 49-yard Lou Groza field goal, then the fourth-longest kick in professional football history. A flurry of scoring {{at the end of the}} third quarter and in the fourth quarter, however, won Cleveland the game. Otto Graham passed 36 yards to end Dante Lavelli and then ran in a touchdown with less than three minutes left in the third. It was the first of four touchdowns in 14 minutes of play. Fullback Marion Motley ran in two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, one of them a 68-yard run that tied an AAFC record for a rush from scrimmage. The Browns won despite a strong ground attack by the Dons, who gained 274 yards of rushing. The Dons had 21 first downs compared to Cleveland's 10. Groza made all of his extra point attempts, extending his <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> 22 in a row.|$|E

In addition to extending a home sellout <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> 72games on October 23, the Penguins ranked 113% {{above the national}} average for male television viewers aged 18 to 34. The franchise ranked as the 18th most valuable in the league at US$195million, marking a 26%increase from the past season.

The Penguins finished October with a 3–1–1 record in Pittsburgh and concluded the month with three consecutive road losses.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the Lakers, the 1970s were {{characterized}} by a major breakthrough of the league's western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a 48–34 regular-season record, the Golden State Warriors swept the heavily favored Washington Bullets 4–0 in the 1975 NBA Finals. In 1976, the Phoenix Suns, who only enjoyed eight years of existence as a franchise, overcame a losing record early in the season to build a remarkable win <b>streak</b> <b>to</b> finish 42–40. The events culminated in upset victories over the Seattle SuperSonics and the Warriors, before facing Boston in the Finals.
