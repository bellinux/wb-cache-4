40|$|A fast Doppler (carrier {{frequency}} drift) tracking {{earth station}} modem {{is presented in}} this paper. The modem is designed to track high carrier frequency offsets for low-earth orbital (LEO) satellite applications. LEO satellites have very high Doppler offsets with considerable Doppler rates (rate of change of frequency). The earth station modem tracks Doppler offsets at a data rate of 128 ksym/s for QPSK modulation. The <b>synchronisation</b> <b>circuit</b> of the modem consists of, frequency synchronisation, symbol timing synchronisation and phase synchronisation. We look into the design and performance analysis of the modem, in particularly the synchronisation system of the modem...|$|E
40|$|The 27 km-particle {{accelerator}} Large Hadron Collider (LHC), {{which will}} be completed at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) in 2005, will work with extremely high beam energies (~ 334 MJ per beam). Since the equipment {{and in particular the}} superconducting magnets must be protected from damage caused by these high energy beams the beam dump must be able to absorb this energy very reliable at every stage of operation. The kicker magnets that extract the particles from the accelerator are synchronised with the beam by the trigger generation system. This thesis is a first study for this electronic module and its functions. A special <b>synchronisation</b> <b>circuit</b> and a very reliable electronic switch were developed. Most functions were implemented in a Gate-Array to improve the reliability and to facilitate modifications during the test stage. This study also comprises the complete concept for the prototype of the trigger generation system. During all project stages reliability was always the main determinant for the chosen circuit design...|$|E
40|$|The carrierless {{amplitude}} and phase (CAP) modulation is {{a promising}} candidate for visible light communication (VLC) {{because of its}} high frequency efficiency and low implementation complexity. However, the CAP receiver is highly sensitive to timing errors because of the bad eye diagram performance and requires a complex <b>synchronisation</b> <b>circuit.</b> In this study, the conventional CAP pulse is extended to a generalised CAP pulse. The zero inter-symbol interference (zero-ISI) and the zero cross-channel interference (zero-CCI) constraints are assumed for the generalised CAP pulses. Two new sets of wider eye opened two-dimensional (2 D) CAP pulses {{and a set of}} frequency efficient 3 D CAP pulses are proposed to meet the zero-ISI and zero-CCI constraints for VLC. Simulation results show that the proposed new 2 D CAP pulses are more tolerant to the timing offset than the existing CAP pulses in VLC systems, but the corresponding bit error rate performances are poorer when the accurate timing synchronisation is obtained. Moreover, the proposed new 3 D CAP pulses are more sensitive to the timing offset than the existing CAP pulses...|$|E

The method makes use of the LHC bunch gap and allows for re-synchronisation of the data every LHC orbit. It relies on the distribution by the TTC system of a signal synchronous with the first bunch in the orbit, and is implemented by dedicated <b>synchronisation</b> <b>circuits</b> in each trigger link. We report on the test of a prototype FPGA implementation...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of surface charge {{is an important}} parameter for evaluating the electrical performance of high voltage insulation materials. The method proposed allows on line {{measurement of}} charge and can generate two-dimensional images that represent the charge behaviour {{on the surface of}} the material under test. The measurement system utilises Pockels effect by using a wafer of bismuth silicon oxide (BSO) as the sensing element. This method allows non-destructive measurements since no direct electric signal or component interferes with the surface charge. Unlike conventional surface charge measurement systems, this approach can dynamically observe and simultaneously quantify surface charge. This allows the surface charge distribution under the influence of a time varying electrical field to be studied. the system's accuracy and sensitivity have been improved through the use of an optical phase modulator. The system uses a high speed CCD camera and a purpose built <b>synchronisation</b> control <b>circuit</b> to obtain a high temporal resolution. This has allowed the study of charge behaviour at mains frequencies. Surface charge distributions have been observed by applying AC voltages to a needle electrode in direct contact with the BSO. AC surface discharge behaviour of polymeric materials bonded to the back-face of the BSO has also been investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} electrodeless {{conductivity}} measurement using two coils wound on toroidal ferrite cores in close proximity, coupled by the induced current in the electrolyte and {{operating in the}} audio range of frequencies {{has been used in}} process control since its introduction in the 1950 s. It presents several advantages over the traditional method of measuring conductivity most important of which are stability, ruggedness, and maintenance free operation. Its major disadvantage is the large sample size required for correct operation. Despite its long established use in industry with various configurations of probe design, there is no published theory of its operation. A model of the probe operation is presented which takes into account the pattern of current flow induced in the electrolyte. This allows the electrolyte to be modelled as a resistance and the effect of geometrical factors upon this resistance is described. The operation of the probe can be represented by an equivalent circuit and theoretical expressions for the cell constant are derived. The correctness of this theory is confirmed by practical measurements. 	Factors affecting the performance of the probe such as operating frequency, cable length and coupling have been examined. The design and development of a conductivity meter which operates with an existing electrodeless sensor is described. It comprises analog circuitry which interfaces the sensor to a microcontroller. The microcontroller provides <b>synchronisation,</b> analog <b>circuit</b> control, calculations, display update, and interfacing with a small keyboard. A requirement that the meter be portable necessitated the minimisation of component count, cost and power consumption. Addition of reference curves for various chemicals stored in the microcontroller's EEPROM allows the instrument {{to be used as a}} concentration meter...|$|R
40|$|Timing {{in nuclear}} and {{particle}} physics {{refers to the}} measurement of very small time intervals. Examples of its use include measurement of lifetimes of excited nuclear states or elementary particles, time-of-flight, etc. In this list also, the determination of coincidences, which is essentially the determination of a zero time interval, should be included. The intervals, therefore, range from {{as little as a}} few pico-seconds to as large as a few microseconds. An instrument used for measuring a time interval is called “Time-to-Digital Converter” (TDC). To develop measurement system with characteristics including both reconfiguration and multi-functions, in general, a SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) is preferred. FPGA allow programming of highly complex circuitries by combining a large number of small simple elements and it is more suitable for the application system design with the requirements of fast time-to-market and low development cost. The general architecture of the TDC developed in this work is based on the classic Nutt method. A counter provides a large linear dynamic range and interpolation enables high resolution. The developed two-stage interpolation method provides a high interpolation ratio and makes it possible to reach a high resolution with a relatively low reference clock frequency. The biggest design challenges in the design of a TDC are related {{to the fact that the}} arrival moment of the hit signals (start and stop) is unknown and asynchronous with respect to the reference clock edges. Two synchronization schemes were developed: the first <b>synchronisation</b> <b>circuit</b> is for controlling the operation of the coarse counter, the second one generates the difference signal for the fine interpolation. The fine interpolation is realized using the Vernier delay line architecture. It consists of two tapped rows working in differential mode. The first is created as a chain of the latch flip-flops and the other as a chain of non-inverting buffers. The time to be measured is defined between the rising edges of the pulses START and STOP. During the time-to-digital conversion process, the STOP pulse follows the START pulse along the line, and all latches from the first cell up to the cell where the START pulse overtakes the STOP pulse are consecutively set. The tests executed on this TDC show that the architecture allows us to reach good time resolution of about 50 ps...|$|E
40|$|Spread Spectrum (SS) communication, {{initially}} {{designed for}} military applications, {{is now the}} basis for many of today's advanced communications systems such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global Positioning System (GPS), Wireless Local Loop (WLL), etc. For effective communication {{to take place in}} systems using SS modulation, the Pseudo-random Noise (PN) code used at the receiver to despread the received signal must be identical and be synchronised with the PN code that was used to spread the signal at the transmitter. Synchronisation is done in two steps: coarse synchronisation or acquisition, and fine synchronisation or tracking. Acquisition involves obtaining a coarse estimate of the phase shift between the transmitted PN code and that at the receiver so that the received PN code will be aligned or synchronised with the locally generated PN code. After acquisition, tracldng is now done which involves maintaining the alignment of the two PN codes. This thesis presents results of the research calTied out on a proposed adaptive PN code acquisition circuit designed to improve the synchronisation process in Direct Sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) systems. The acquisition circuit is implemented using a Matched Filter (MF) for the correlation operation and the threshold setting device is an adaptive processor known as the Cell Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) processor. It is a double dwell acquisition circuit where the second dwell is implemented by Post Detection Integration (PDI). Depending on the application, PDI can be used to mitigate the effect of frequency offset in non-coherent detectors and/or in the implementation of multiple dwell acquisition systems. Equations relating the performance measures - the probability of false alarm (Pra), the probability of detection (P d) and the mean acquisition time (E {Tacq}) - of the circuit are deri ved. Monte Carlo simulation was used for the independent validation of the theoretical results obtained, and the strong agreement between these results shows the accuracy of the derived equations for the proposed circuit. Due to the combination of PDI and CA-CFAR processor in the implementation of the circuit, results obtained show that it can provide a good measure of robustness to frequency offset and noise power variations in mobile environment, consequently leading to improved acquisition time performance. The complete <b>synchronisation</b> <b>circuit</b> is realised by using this circuit in conjunction with a conventional code tracking circuit. Therefore, a study of a Non-coherent Delay-Locked Loop (NDLL) code tracking circuit is also calTied out. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design and development of a surface charge measurement system using Pockels effect. The measurement of surface charge is important in determining the electrical performance of high voltage insulation materials. The method proposed allows on-line measurement of charge and can generate two-dimensional images that represent the charge behaviour {{on the surface of the}} material under test. The measurement system is optical and uses a Pockels crystal as the sensing element. The Pockels cell uses a wafer of Bismuth Silicon Oxide (BSO). Surface charge creates an electric field within the Pockels crystal and induces anisotropy. A laser light is used to detect any change in anisotropy. This approach allows non-destructive measurements since no direct electric signal or component interferes with the surface charge. Furthermore, the optical measurement system can dynamically observe and simultaneously quanta surface charge which is not possible using conventional methods. This allows the surface charge distribution under the influence of a time varying electric field to be studied. The system's accuracy and sensitivity have been improved through the use of an Optical Phase Modulator. The system uses a high speed CCD camera with a maximum frame rate of 1000 frames per second and <b>Synchronisation</b> Control <b>Circuit</b> to obtain a high temporal resolution. This has allowed the study of charge behaviour at mains power frequencies. Surface charge distributions have been observed by applying both impulse and AC voltages to a needle electrode in direct contact with the BSO. AC surface discharge behaviour of polymeric materials bonded to the BSO has also been investigated. The effect of the surrounding environment has been experimentally examined by placing the cell inside a vacuum chamber. Surface charge measurements have been made at various atmospheric pressures. The effect of an electro-negative gas (Sulphur Hexafluoride) on the surface charge distribution has also been investigated.

40|$|Mammalian brains {{generate}} complex, dynamic {{structures of}} oscillatory activity, in which distributed regions transiently engage in coherent oscillation, often at specific stages in behavioural or cognitive tasks. Much {{is now known}} about the dynamics underlying local <b>circuit</b> <b>synchronisation</b> and the phenomenology of where and when such activity occurs. While oscillations have been implicated in many high level processes, for most such phenomena we cannot say with confidence precisely {{what they are doing}} at an algorithmic or implementational level. This thesis presents work towards understanding the dynamics and possible function of large scale oscillatory network activity. We first address the question of how coherent oscillatory activity emerges between local networks by measuring phase response curves of an oscillating network in vitro. The network phase response curves provide mechanistic insight into inter-region synchronisation of local network oscillators. Highly simplified firing models are shown to reproduce the experimental data with remarkable accuracy. We then focus on one hypothesised computational function of network oscillations; flexibly controlling the gain of signal flow between anatomically connected networks. We investigate coding strategies and algorithmic operations that support flexible control of signal flow by oscillations, and their implementation by network dynamics. We identify two readout algorithms which selectively recover population rate coded signal with specific oscillatory modulations while ignoring other distracting inputs. By designing a spiking network model that implements one of these mechanisms, we demonstrate oscillatory control of signal flow in convergent pathways. We then investigate constraints on the structures of oscillatory activity {{that can be used to}} accurately and selectively control signal flow. Our results suggest that for inputs to be accurately distinguished from one another their oscillatory modulations must be close to orthogonal. This has implications for interpreting in vivo oscillatory activity, and may be an organising principle for the spatio-temporal structure of brain oscillations...|$|R
