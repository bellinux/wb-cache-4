40|$|Abstract: In this letter, we {{reconsider the}} {{delicate}} issue of symmetry and supersymmetry breakings for gauge theories with gauge-field mixings. The {{purpose is to}} study generalyzed potentials {{in the presence of}} more than a single gauge potential. In this work, following a stream of investigation on supersymmetric gauge theories without flat directions, we contemplate the possibility of building up D- and F-term potentials by means of a gaugefield mixing in connection with a U(1) × U(1) ′-symmetry. We investigate a generalized potential including an N= 1 supersymmetric extension of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model focusing on the study of cosmic string configurations. This analysis sheds some light on the formation of cosmic strings for model with violation of Lorentz symmetry.
