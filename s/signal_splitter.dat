40|$|In this work, three {{strategies}} for shortening the output pulse of a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) are reported. The first strategy is passive filtering, where band-pass filtering removes the lowest frequency {{components in the}} signal, getting a noticeable reduction in pulse width (a compression ratio of 10 : 1 was obtained). In the second place, a reflectometric scheme is proposed where the amplified signal coming from the SiPM is injected into a <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> with one of its stubs connected to a short-circuited stub. In the last strategy, the reflectometric part is replaced by an analog subtractor circuit. In this approach, a <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> with stubs of different lengths is used. All solutions provide good compression ratios, up to 10 : 1. Best pulses obtained are single narrow peaks, with width below 10 ns, preserving the photonic modulation and with good pseudo-Gaussian shape, single polarity and low ringing. The potential of pulse shortening for improving the capability of the detector to resolve single photons is demonstrated by mean of single photon counting patterns. The detection error probability is reduced in one order of magnitude when shortening is used for conditioning the output photosignal...|$|E

40|$|High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) Inner Tracker designs {{may include}} {{the sharing of}} Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) signals between several tracker modules. This is {{possible}} because the highest frequency signals are common to all modules. Such designs are an attractive option because they {{reduce the number of}} optical links required and hence the cost. These designs will require optical <b>signal</b> <b>splitters</b> that are radiation hard up to high doses and capable of operating in cold temperatures. Optical splitters are available as either fused-fibre splitters or Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) splitters. PLC splitters are preferable because they are smaller than fusedfibre splitters. A selection of PLC splitters from different manufacturers and of two different technologies (silica and glass based) have been tested for radiation hardness up to a dose of 500 kGy(Si) and for temperature stability. All the tested splitters displayed small increases in insertion losses (< 0. 1 dB) in reducing the operating temperature from 25 °C to ? 25 °C. The silica based splitters from all manufacturers did not exhibit significant radiation induced insertion losses, despite the high dose they were exposed to. The glass based sample, however, had a per channel radiation induced insertion loss of up to 1. 16 dB. Whilst the silica based splitters can be considered as qualified for HL-LHC use with regards to radiation hardness, the glass technology would require further testing at a lower, more realistic, dose to also be considered as a potential component for HL-LHC upgrade designs. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA...|$|R

50|$|Let's {{begin by}} tracing the signal {{path from the}} {{splitter}} to the audience. The <b>signal</b> leaves the <b>splitter,</b> typically via an Audio multicore cable, and travels to the Front of House position. Here, the still-mic-level signal enters into a microphone preamplifier, which boosts the signal voltage to line level. For this example, the microphone preamplifier is built into a mixing board. It is typical for a mixing board to include a line trim after the preamplifier. This allows the amplitude of the now line-level signal to be adjusted. This may be done for artistic or technical reasons. A typical application for the line trim is attenuating signals that were intentionally amplified too much by the microphone preamplifier. Over amplifying the signal can cause the preamplifier to distort, which can under certain circumstances produce a desirable sound.|$|R

This communication requires low cost ways for much information to be sent simultaneously. Because of this, using Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) concept, a low cost and green 3 × 3 POF splitter is fabricated. It is fabricated using cheap and easy-to-find tools such as metal tube and candle. Approach: The fabrication is being done by taking three strands of POF and heating the middle parts {{so that it will}} melted and fused together until it elongated and shrink to a diameter of 1 mm. Successfully fabricated POF splitter are characterized by measuring the output losses, before and after the POF’s end is being smoothed and polished using two sand study of different degree of coarseness. This is to observe the effect of polishing on optical <b>signal</b> losses. POF <b>splitter’s</b> losses are also measured on different temperature to observe the effect of temperature on the splitter’s performance. Results: Based on the result, it is obvious that cleanliness and a flat POF’s end surface influenced the losses with a reduction between 0. 3 - 5. 0 dB. Temperature, even though subtle, does also affect the signal losses with increased losses averaging around 0. 3 dB. Overall, the losses in the fabricated POF splitter are still high, but show promising improvement with amelioration of fusion technique and the use of tools with higher quality...|$|R

40|$|The FTTH (Fiber To The Home) market {{currently}} needs new {{network maintenance}} technologies that can, economically and effectively, cope with massive fiber plants. However, operating these networks requires adequate means for an effective monitoring cost. Especially for troubleshooting faults {{that are associated}} with the possibility of remote identification of fiber breaks, which may exist in the network. Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) techniques are widely used in point-to-point optical network topologies. Nevertheless, it has major limitations in tree-structured PONs (Passive Optical Networks), where all different branches backscatter the light in just one conventional OTDR trace with combined signals arriving on the OLT (Optical Line Terminal) side. Furthermore, passive power splitters used in FTTH networks input large attenuation, impoverishing the reflected signal. This makes the identification of the very branch affected by the problem practically impossible, when considering conventional analyses. The use of constraint-based techniques have been applied in a large amount of applications for Engineering Design, where the duties imposed for graphics and equations constraints result in valued features to CAD/CAE software capabilities. Currently, it provides a faster decision making capacity for engineers. This work applies the constraint based approach along with a Differential Evolutionary Algorithm to separate the superimposed OTDR <b>signals,</b> after the <b>splitters</b> of a FTTH Passive Optical Networks.

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Passive optical {{networks}} (PONs) are point-to-multipoint networks where {{a single}} Central Office (CO) {{is connected to}} a number of downstream Optical Network Units (ONUs) via a single optical fiber by splitting the optical <b>signal</b> with passive <b>splitters.</b> Due to technology advances and increasing bandwidth requirements, these networks have moved to last mile deployment, also known as fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). The planning of these PONs are traditionally done by hand, but automated methods can be used to decrease deployment costs and planning time. Even though a number of methods have been proposed to address this problem through the solving of integer linear programming (ILP) models, they suffer from limited availability, inaccuracies and limited scalability due to the problem complexity. This dissertation focusses on improving the accuracy of these models as well as improving scalability to a point where large-scale problems can be solved feasibly. To address this, a basic model is implemented to capture the network structure and verified accordingly. Results show this model can be solved quickly, but has large discrepancies with real-world plans. Refinements in the form of fiber duct sharing, network constraints, multiple splitter types and economies of scale among others are then incorporated into a refined model and solved. Analysis of the experimental results indicates improved accuracy and lower deployment costs, at the expense of increasing computation effort considerably. Heuristic techniques are then examined to improve computational performance, including an elementary heuristic (ELEM), the Branch Contracting Algorithm (BCA) and problem decomposition. It is demonstrated that through the use of k-means clustering, the refined model can be solved in a fraction of the time while keeping deployment costs comparably low. Master...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} optical power {{splitters}} is growing globally, {{due to the}} rapid deployment of fibre-to-the-premises, optical metropolitan area network (MAN), and active optical cables for TV/Video <b>signal</b> transport. Optical <b>splitters</b> {{play an important role}} in passive optical network (PON) technology by enabling several hundred users to share one optical line terminal. However, current PONs, which use fixed optical power splitters, have limited reconfigurability particularly in adding/dropping users to/from an optical network unit. An adaptive optical power splitter (OPS) can dynamically reallocate the opticalpower in the entire network according to the real-time distribution of users and services, thus providing numerous advantages such as improve an optical network efficiency, scalability, and reliability. An adaptive OPS is also important for realizing self-healing ring-to-ring optical MAN, thus offering automatic communication recovery when line break occurs. In addition, future optical line protection systems will require adaptive optical splitters to switch optical signals from faulty lines to active power lines, avoid the use of optical attenuators and/or amplifiers, and achieve real time line monitoring. An adaptive OPS can also be incorporated in tunable optical dispersion compensators, optical attenuator and optical gain equalizer, and reconfigurable optical switches. This thesis proposes and demonstrates the principle of a novel Opto-VLSI-based adaptive optical splitter/combiner for next generation dynamic optical telecommunication networks. The proposed splitter structure enables an input optical power to be split adaptively into a larger number of output fibre ports, through optimized phase holograms driving the Opto-VLSI processor. The new adaptive optical splitter has additional advantages including lossless operation, adequate inter-port crosstalk, compressed hardware and simple user interface. This thesis demonstrates, in particular, the concept of an adaptive optical power splitter employing an Opto-VLSI processor and a 4 -f imaging system experimentally in three stages as follow: (i) a 1 × 2 adaptive optical power splitter based on an Opto-VLSI processor, a fibre collimator array and 4 -f imaging systems (single lens), (ii) a 1 × 4 adaptive optical power splitter based on an Opto-VLSI processor, a fibre array and 4 -f imaging systems (single lens), and (iii) a 1 ×N lossless adaptive optical power splitter structure integrating an Opto-VLSI processor, optical amplifiers, a fibre array, and an array of 4 -f imaging systems (lens array). The thesis also demonstrates the concept of an adaptive optical signal combiner which enables multiple signals to be combined with user-defined weight profiles into a single fibre port. Experimental results demonstrate that an input optical signal can arbitrarily be split into N signals and coupled into optical fibre ports by uploading optimized multicasting phase holograms onto the Opto-VLSI processor. They also demonstrate that N input optical signals can be dynamically combined with arbitrary weights into a single optical fibre port. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results is demonstrated. The total insertion loss of the optical power splitter is only 5 dB. Results also show that the optical amplifiers can compensate for the insertion and splitting losses, thus enabling lossless splitter operation. A crosstalk level around - 25 dB and a wavelength spectral range exceeding 40 nm is experimentally realized. In addition, a novel broadband adaptive RF power splitter/combiner based on Opto-VLSI processor is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. By uploading optimized multicasting phase holograms onto the software-driven Opto-VLSI processor, the input RF signal is dynamically split and directed to different output ports, with userdefined splitting ratios. Also, multiple input RF signals can be dynamically combined with arbitrary user-defined weights. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, two input RF signals are dynamically combined with different user-defined weight profiles. We also propose and demonstrate a photonic microwave filter based on the use of an Opto-VLSI-based adaptive optical combiner. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed Opto-VLSI-based adaptive optical combiner can dynamically route multiple input optical signals to a single output, with user-defined weight profiles, thus realising a tunable microwave filter. Overall this Opto-VLSI-based adaptive optical power splitter should allow as many as 32 output ports to be supported while achieving high splitting resolution and dynamic range. This will greatly enhance the efficiency of optical communication networks...|$|R
40|$|Important {{requirements}} of a millimetre-wave heterodyne receiver for radio astronomy are that it can detect dual-linear polarisation and retain both upper and lower sidebands.

In contrast to the conventional FD system where self-interference (SI) is harmful, SI can be beneficial in terms of energy source for harvesting in FD SWIPT system [6 – 10]. A number of studies using this advantage were performed for FD relay system where relay has no external power supply except for transmitted power from base station (BS) [7, 8, 10]. Also, the self-energy recycling (S-ER) scheme was proposed in point-to-point (P 2 P) FD system where PS-based EH is used at user equipment (UE) [9].

40|$|Abstract. It is very {{important}} to detect fiber orientation error in orthotropic composite laminates because the layup of a CFRP (carbon-fiber reinforced plastics) composite laminates affects the properties of the laminate, including stiffness, strength and thermal behavior. In this study, an investigation of shear wave ultrasonic technique was carried out in order to detect stacking orientation error for the orthotropic composite laminates. During testing, the most significant problem is that the couplant conditions do not remain the same because of changing the viscosity of the couplant. Therefore, the design and use of a shear wave transducers would greatly aid in alleviating the couplant problem. A pyramid with an isosceles triangle with two 45 o was made of aluminum to generate shear waves using two longitudinal transducers based on ultrasonic-polarized mechanism. Also, the <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> was connected to the pulser jack on the pulser/receiver and to the longitudinal transducers which were mounted with mineral oil.

We illustrate the dimensioning process for WAPs, the antenna system and network support. The typical number of WAPs per carriage is two but this can {{vary depending on the}} layout and length of the carriage. The number of WAPs is also dependent on the expected service demand. The threshold for a decent connection will vary according to the bandwidth demand per user. When the number of connecting passengers is above this threshold, the service operator should consider adding an extra WAP. Based on expert opinion, we estimate that an industrial grade WAP can support 60 concurrent connections of 1 MB. For the case considered, 2 WAPs per rail car will be sufficient. A train will typically install several antennas which each make an individual connection to the wayside. Per train, eight antennas will be installed. For each antenna, a <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> is required, a transmitter radio and a receiver radio. Network support is provided by a manned network operations center.

40|$|The work {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the accuracy and reliability of collecting geospatial data by hybrid and conventional GPS apparatus in terms of selected forest locations at the SLP ML Krtiny. For this comparison, the chosen standard equipment was the Trimble GPS Pathfinder ProXH which processes signals only from the global satellite navigation system NAVSTAR GPS and the hybrid receiver Pathfinder ProXRT receiver, which is able to receive GPS signals and the signals of the global navigation satellite system GLONASS. For this purpose, a self-testing kit was designed consisting of a Trimble Tornado dual-frequency antenna, which was the connected to the GNSS receivers via a <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> unit. The advantage of this system is that both GNSS devices receive signals from a common antenna, ensuring that observational conditions are completely identical. Data collection was carried out at three sites with different terrain and forest conditions and on the spot with the best observational conditions (roof LDF). Observations were made for a period of one hour at each location. The processed results revealed that the GLONASS system used in conjunction with the GPS system delivered less accurate results than expected. In only one instance did the hybrid system deliver accurate data; this was when observational conditions were particularly poor, due to forest conditions and terrain. In this case the GLONASS plus GPS system benefited from a continuous satellite signal, whereas the GPS system suffered from only intermittent satellite contact. After the application of post-processing correction through the virtual reference station network CZPOS the margin of error was generally reduced, resulting in a lower RMS for both receivers, but the higher number of satellite contacts with the hybrid system resulted in more accurate results only under especially poor environmental conditions...|$|E
30|$|The bill of {{resources}}-related service drivers {{refer to}} the set of resources that are required per service. The free Wi-Fi service and the crew communication service share usage of the same on-board and wayside resources but the crew communication service uses dedicated crew mobile devices. The video-on-demand service shares usage of the on-board distribution network and the wayside resources with the other services and uses a dedicated video-on-demand server on-board the train and a dedicated content creation server at the wayside. The video-on-demand server and the content creation server {{need to be able}} to store 470 GB. We assume that all content is updated once per year. As such, 470 GB has to be transferred per train over Wi-Fi for the video-on-demand service. The connection to the wayside uses an on roof antenna system consisting of the antenna itself, a <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> and radios that receive and transmit the signal. Coaxial cables interconnect the roof antenna system with the on-board equipment. The on-board network equipment consists of an on-board gateway server which will direct the traffic from the offered services to the right destination. A Wi-Fi distribution system is deployed to bring the service to the customer. The Wi-Fi distribution system consists of WAPs attached to the ceiling of the carriages that are connected via Category 5 e UTP cables to the on-board servers and access routers. Switches are used to interconnect all network elements efficiently. The passenger services are offered via their own devices (e.g. laptop, smartphone or tablet), the crew communication service is offered on mobile devices that are included in the service offering. On-board the train, a video-on-demand server is deployed. For the train-to-wayside connection, multiple technologies and/or network operators can be used. For the case considered, the existing cellular infrastructure and Wi-Fi access points of a single network operator are used to transmit and receive data signals. For this case, this combination of technologies is adequate, but for other areas, the offered bandwidth may not be sufficient and a satellite connection or the deployment of a dedicated Wi-Fi/WiMAX network can be considered. At the wayside, a manned network operations center has to be set up to provide support for network maintenance, upgrades and failures. Several servers are required to provide the services. A wayside gateway server which is complementary to the on-board gateway server directs the traffic to the right destination. A server is required for the management of the services and a content creation server is used to update the video content.|$|E
