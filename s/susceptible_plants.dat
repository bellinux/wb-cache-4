25|$|Many of the {{pests and}} {{diseases}} that afflict other solanaceous plants, such as tomato, capsicum, and potato, are also troublesome to eggplants. For this reason, it should generally not be planted in areas previously occupied by its close relatives. However, since eggplants {{can be particularly}} susceptible to pests such as whiteflies, they are sometimes grown with slightly less <b>susceptible</b> <b>plants,</b> such as pepper, as a sacrificial trap crop. Four years should separate successive crops of eggplants to reduce pest pressure.|$|E
25|$|Crown gall disease {{caused by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be {{controlled}} via {{a variety of different}} methods. The best means of control for this disease is by taking preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools if these tools are used on infected trees and shrubs, performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting <b>susceptible</b> <b>plants</b> in infected fields. Another useful practice is to avoid wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation, such as budding and not grafting plants, since wounds are the main means of bacterial entry. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Increasing shoreland {{development}} is altering submerged aquatic vegeta-tion with potential {{negative effects on}} fish species dependent on submerged vegetation, such as bluegill. We evaluated the relationship of bluegill growth, recruitment, size structure, mor-tality, maturity, production, and relative abundance to submerged aquatic vegetation species richness, quality, value to fish and occurrence using data from 2, 571 surveys on Minnesota lakes to better understand how bluegill population dynamics are affected by alterations in submerged aquatic vegetation. Bluegill populations exhibited fast juvenile growth, high mor-tality and production in lakes where plant communities were less susceptible to disturbance and had low diversity, compared to diverse, <b>susceptible</b> <b>plant</b> communities. Adult bluegill grew faster in diverse, <b>susceptible</b> <b>plant</b> communities. The susceptibility and diversity of submerged aquatic vegetation communities explained variation in bluegill growth, mortality, and production based on Akaike and Bayes Information Criteria. These results serve to clar-ify the relationships between bluegill population dynamics and submerged aquatic vegetation, and provide a foundation for further research into causal mechanisms...|$|R

50|$|There may be {{production}} of conidia if {{the environment is}} suitable. Conidia are produced when there has been rain, because moisture is {{a key factor in}} their production. Rain or high humidity causes leaf wetness, which is the optimal environment for the pathogen to produce the conidia. A normal temperature range for production is 55-75 degrees Fahrenheit. If these conditions are present, there will be innumerable conidia disseminated by the wind. The conidia is a source of secondary inoculum. If <b>susceptible</b> <b>plants</b> are being grown in the same area as these infected plants, the disease can spread rapidly as the conidia infect the surrounding <b>susceptible</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E

40|$|With 2 tables Sunflower {{broomrape}} (Orobanche cumana Wallr.) constrains sunflower cultivation in {{many areas}} of Europe and Asia. Populations classified as race G that overcome all known resistance genes have recently appeared. The objective of this research was to study the inheritance of resistance to broomrape race G in a resistant accession of Helianthus debilis subsp. tardiflorus. Heads of H. debilis subsp. tardiflorus were emasculated and pollinated with pollen of the Helianthus annuus-susceptible line HA 89. BC 1 F 1, BC 1 F 2, BC 1 F 3, BC 2 F 1, BC 2 F 2 and BC 2 F 3 generations were developed and evaluated for broomrape resistance. F 1 plants were resistant, indicating dominance of resistance. BC 1 populations segregated in a ratio of one resistant to one <b>susceptible</b> <b>plant,</b> whereas BC 1 F 2 and BC 2 F 2 populations segregated in a ratio of three resistant to one <b>susceptible</b> <b>plant,</b> which was confirmed in the evaluation of the BC 1 F 3 and BC 2 F 3 populations. The results indicated that resistance to broomrape race G in H. debilis subsp. tardiflorus is controlled by dominant alleles at a single locus.
