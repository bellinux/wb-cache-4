60|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} investigations have concurred {{in the establishment}} of the view that a gas is a body, the particles of which are in incessant rectilinear motion at high velocities, colliding with one another and bounding back when they strike the walls of the containing vessel; and, on this theory, the already ascertained relations of gaseous bodies to heat and pressure {{have been shown to be}} deducible from mechanical principles. Immense improvements have been effected, in the means of exhausting a given space of its gaseous contents; and experimentation on the phenomena which attend the electric discharge and the action of radiant heat, within the extremely rarefied media thus produced, has yielded a great number of remarkable results, some of which have been made familiar to the public by the Gieseler tubes and the radiometer. Already, these investigations have afforded an unexpected insight into the constitution of matter and its relations with thermal and electric energy, and they open up a vast field for future inquiry into some of the deepest problems of physics. Other important steps, in the same direction, have been effected by investigations into the absorption of radiant heat proceeding from different sources by <b>solid,</b> <b>fluid,</b> and gaseous bodies. And it is a curious example of the interconnection of the various branches of physical science, that some of the results thus obtained have proved of great importance in meteorology.|$|E

50|$|The {{pedosphere}} lies {{below the}} vegetative {{cover of the}} biosphere and above the hydrosphere and lithosphere. The soil forming process (pedogenesis) can begin {{without the aid of}} biology but is significantly quickened in the presence of biologic reactions. Soil formation begins with the chemical and/or physical breakdown of minerals to form the initial material that overlies the bedrock substrate. Biology quickens this by secreting acidic compounds (dominantly fulvic acids) that help break rock apart. Particular biologic pioneers are lichen, mosses and seed bearing plants but many other inorganic reactions take place that diversify the chemical makeup of the early soil layer. Once weathering and decomposition products accumulate, a coherent soil body allows the migration of fluids both vertically and laterally through the soil profile causing ion exchange between <b>solid,</b> <b>fluid</b> and gaseous phases. As time progresses, the bulk geochemistry of the soil layer will deviate away from the initial composition of the bedrock and will evolve to a chemistry that reflects the type of reactions that take place in the soil.|$|E

40|$|The volume {{averaging}} technique for obtaining macroscopic {{equations of motion}} for materials that are microscopically inhomogeneous is extended {{to the situation in}} which multiple solid constituents form a porous matrix while a uniform fluid fills the pores. Previous volume averaging efforts of Pride et al. (1992) and others have concentrated on single solid constituent porous media. The analysis for multiple solid constituents is complicated by the presence of internal interfaces between the solid constituents within the averaging volume. These interfaces are characterized by constants that measure the fraction of the interface on which solid touches <b>solid,</b> <b>fluid</b> touches one <b>solid,</b> <b>fluid</b> touches the other solid, or fluid lies {{on both sides of the}} interface. These fractions are easily computed if the interface fractions are assumed to be uncorrelated, but real materials may be expected to exhibit some correlation. On the other hand, these interface fractions do not appear in the volume average equations at the macroscopic level. To complete the analysis, it is found that the jacketed and unjacketed tests of Biot and Willis (1957) together with the thought experiments of Berryman and Milton (1991) for solid matrix composed of two constituents are required in order to obtain definite results. Results are found to be in complete agreement with earlier work of Brown and Korringa (1975) concerning the most general possible form of the quasistatic equations for volume deformation and therefore of the equations of motion for wave propagation through such media...|$|E

40|$|Within this thesis, {{work has}} been done on three topics: - The {{partition}} coefficients of phenol between carbon dioxide and water or aqueous solutions of tetramethylammonia bromide were measured at 313 K. At the highest pressure of 30 MPa and the maximum salt concentration of 2 mol/l, the partition coefficient decreased from 0. 47 to 0. 2. This observed salting-in effect was described by the Setschenow equation. The investigated salting-out effect of sodium chloride on phenol between water and CO_ 2 was compared with salting-out between water and organic solvents. For that purpose, the Setschenow constants of sodium chloride on phenol in the system of water and cyclohexane were measured between 293 and 333 K and calculated by a surface tension model. The Setschenow constants at high pressures in CO_ 2 were comparable to those at atmospheric pressures. Analogous to binary <b>solid</b> <b>fluid</b> phase equilibria, an enhancement factor was introduced to describe high pressure partitioning equilibria. Differences in the distribution behaviour of single solutes are discussed in terms of the enthalpy of hydration. indicate novel types of <b>solid</b> <b>fluid</b> phase equilibria. The increasing degree of fluorination of these four substances led to an increase of the solubility in carbon dioxide. The solubility of tris(p-trifluoromethylphenyl) phosphine was higher than the solubility of the triphenylphosphine derivatives that are fluorinated at the aromatic ring. By a comparison of the enhancement factors, it was shown that this finding can be explained by increasing interactions between the substrate and the solvent molecules. (orig.)

The {{purpose of the}} present work is to study the influence of the porosity and the geometry of the solid matrix on the characteristics of aerosol particle streams through porous structures. The flow field was obtained by numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations (laminar flow) and by solving the set of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k-E model for turbulence (turbulent flow). Particle transport was described based on a force balance equation.

40|$|The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is {{preferred}} to solve wave propagation problems in semi-infinite continua numerically. One crucial condition {{to establish a}} BE formulation is the knowledge of a fundamental solution. For poroelastic constitutive equations, up to now, such a solution has only been available for the case of compressible constituents in Laplace/Fourier domain. Here, the Laplace domain fundamental solutions for incompressible constituents are derived using Hörmanders method for two different sets of unknowns, for the <b>solid</b> displacements and <b>fluid</b> pressure and for the <b>solid</b> and <b>fluid</b> displacements. The solutions are used in a time-dependent BE formulation based on the Convolution Quadrature Method, which only requires the Laplace domain fundamental solutions.
