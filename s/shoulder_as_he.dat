25|$|The gang {{attempted}} to rob {{the bank in}} Northfield at about 2pm. To carry out the robbery, the gang divided into two groups. Three men entered the bank, two guarded the door outside, and three remained near a bridge across an adjacent square. The robbers inside the bank were thwarted when acting cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused to open the safe, falsely claiming that it was secured by a time lock even as they held a Bowie knife to his throat and cracked his skull with a pistol butt. Assistant cashier Alonzo Enos Bunker {{was wounded in the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> fled through {{the back door of the}} bank. Meanwhile, the citizens of Northfield grew suspicious of the men guarding the door and raised the alarm. The five bandits outside fired into the air to clear the streets, driving the townspeople to take cover and fire back from protected positions. They shot two bandits dead and wounded the rest in the barrage. Inside, the outlaws turned to flee. As they left, one shot the unarmed cashier Heywood in the head. Historians have speculated about the identity of the shooter but have not reached consensus.|$|E
500|$|Enter the Void is a 2009 English-language French drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Gaspar Noé and starring Nathaniel Brown, Paz de la Huerta, and Cyril Roy. Set in the neon-lit nightclub environments of Tokyo, the story follows Oscar, a young American drug dealer who gets shot by the police, but continues to watch subsequent events during an out-of-body experience. The film is shot from a first-person viewpoint, which often floats above the city streets, and occasionally features Oscar staring over his own <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> recalls moments from his past. Noé labels the film a [...] "psychedelic melodrama".|$|E
500|$|Kouma's {{force was}} then ambushed {{by a group}} of North Koreans dressed in US {{military}} uniforms. Kouma was wounded a second time, in the <b>shoulder,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> beat back repeated North Korean crossings on his machine gun. Several strong attacks came within meters of the tank, but Kouma was able to drive them back despite his wounds. Eventually, the other three vehicles withdrew or were neutralized, and Kouma held the Agok crossing site until 07:30 the next morning with his tank. At one point, the tank was surrounded and Kouma had to engage the North Koreans from outside the tank with machine gun fire at point blank range. After the tank gun's ammunition was expended, Kouma used his pistol and grenades to hold off the North Koreans. The tank then withdrew [...] to the newly established American lines, destroying three North Korean machine gun positions along the way. During his action, Kouma had killed an estimated 250 North Korean troops. His actions in this fight alone surpassed the highly decorated US Army soldier Audie Murphy, who was credited with 240 kills during World War II, and who had been the second most decorated US soldier in the war.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depictions of}} the death or murder of Troilus are on shield bands {{from the turn of}} the 7th into the 6th century BC found at Olympia. On these, a warrior with a sword is about to stab a naked youth at an altar. On one, Troilus clings to a tree (which Boitani takes for the laurel sacred to Apollo). [...] A crater contemporary with this shows Achilles at the altar holding the naked Troilus upside down while Hector, Aeneas and an otherwise unknown Trojan Deithynos arrive in the hope of saving the youth. In some depictions Troilus is begging for mercy. On an amphora, Achilles has the struggling Troilus slung over his <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> goes to the altar. Boitani, in his survey of the story of Troilus through the ages, considers it of significance that two artifacts (a vase and a sarcophagus) from different periods link Troilus' and Priam's death by showing them on {{the two sides of the}} same item, as if they were the beginning and end of the story of the fall of Troy. [...] Achilles is the father of Neoptolemus, who slays Priam at the altar during the sack of Troy. Thus the war opens with a father killing a son and closes with a son killing a father.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was on this}} hill that, in 1936, {{defending}} champion John A. [...] "Johnny" [...] Kelley overtook Ellison [...] "Tarzan" [...] Brown, giving him a consolatory pat on the <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> passed. This gesture renewed the competitive drive in Brown, who rallied, pulled ahead of Kelley, {{and went on to}} win—thereby, it was said, breaking Kelley's heart.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome Lester Horwitz (October 22, 1903 – January 18, 1952), {{better known}} by his stage name Curly Howard, was an American comedian and vaudevillian actor. He {{was best known}} {{as a member of the}} American farce comedy team, the Three Stooges, which also {{featured}} his elder brothers Moe and Shemp Howard and actor Larry Fine. Curly was generally considered the most popular and recognizable of the Stooges. He was well known for his high-pitched voice and vocal expressions ("nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!", [...] "woob-woob-woob!", [...] "soitenly!" [...] , and barking like a dog) as well as his physical comedy (e.g., falling on ground and pivoting on his <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> [...] "walked" [...] in circular motion), improvisations, and athleticism. An untrained actor, Curly borrowed (and significantly exaggerated) the [...] "woob woob" [...] from [...] "nervous" [...] and soft-spoken comedian Hugh Herbert. Curly's unique version of [...] "woob-woob-woob" [...] was firmly established by the time of the Stooges' second Columbia film, Punch Drunks (1934).|$|E

2500|$|In January 2014, {{the museum}} mounted a third, {{significantly}} larger, exhibition {{centered on the}} novella's creative origins and its history. The major showing of The Little Prince: A New York Story celebrated the story's 70th anniversary. It examined both the novella's New York origins and Saint-Exupéry's creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book's highly polished first edition. [...] "The exhibition allows us to step back to the moment of creation and witness Saint-Exupéry at work..." [...] wrote the museum's director, William Griswold. It was if visitors were able to look over his <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.|$|E
2500|$|A {{follow up}} report was {{published}} on February 18, 1890 with the title, [...] "A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station." [...] In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles. The article was republished {{a few days}} later with the subtitle [...] "More Tales of a Fishy Flavor." [...] In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that a Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and were discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a knocking at the door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at another door. They sat down and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door flew open and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing his <b>shoulder</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.|$|E
