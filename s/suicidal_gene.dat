40|$|Knowledge of {{molecular}} mechanisms governing malignant transformation brings {{new opportunities for}} therapeutic intervention against cancer using novel approaches. One of them is gene therapy based on the transfer of genetic material to an organism {{with the aim of}} correcting a disease. The application of gene therapy to the cancer treatment has {{led to the development of}} new experimental approaches such as <b>suicidal</b> <b>gene</b> therapy, inhibition of oncogenes and restoration of tumor-suppressor genes. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>gene</b> therapy is based on the expression in tumor cells of a gene encoding an enzyme that converts a prodrug into a toxic product.

40|$|Purpose: We {{have used}} a genetically {{attenuated}} adenoviral vector which expresses HSVtk to assess the possible additive role of <b>suicidal</b> <b>gene</b> therapy for enhanced oncolytic effect of the virus. Expression of TK was measured using a radiotracerbased molecular counting and imaging system. Materials and Methods: Replication-competent recombinant adenoviral vector (Ad-ΔE 1 B 19 / 55) {{was used in this}} study, whereas replicationincompetent adenovirus (Ad-ΔE 1 A) was generated as a control. Both Ad-ΔE 1 B 19 / 55 -TK and Ad-ΔE 1 A-TK comprise the HSVtk gene inserted into the E 3 region of the viruses. YCC- 2 cells were infected with the viruses and incubated with 2 '-deoxy- 2 '-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl- 5 -iodouracil (I- 131 FIAU) to measure amount of radioactivity.

40|$|Abstract: There {{have been}} major changes since the {{incidents}} of leukemia development in X-SCID patients after the treatments using retroviral gene therapy. Due {{to the risk}} of oncogenesis caused by retroviral insertional activation of host genes, most of the efforts focused on the lentiviral therapies. However, a relative clonal dominance was detected in a patient with �-thalassemia Major, two years after the subject received genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells using lentiviral vectors. This disappointing result of the recent clinical trial using lentiviral vector tells us that the current and most advanced vector systems does not have enough safety. In this review, various safety features that have been tried for the retroviral gene therapy are introduced and the possible new ways of improvements are discussed. Additional feature of chromatin insulators, co-transduction of a <b>suicidal</b> <b>gene</b> under the control of an inducible promoter, conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells, targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, targeted local administration, splitting of the viral genome, and site specific insertion of retroviral vector are discussed here...|$|E
40|$|The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society {{announced}} that 1. 6 million new cancer cases {{are projected to}} occur in the USA in 2016. One of the most innovative approaches against cancer is suicide gene therapy, in which suicide-inducing transgenes are introduced into cancer cells. When cancer treatments target the total elimination of tumor cells, there will be no side effects for normal cells. Cancer tissues are targeted through various targeted transport methods, followed by tissue-specific enzymes converting a systemically suitable prodrug into an active drug in the tumor. <b>Suicidal</b> <b>genes</b> are delivered by transporters, such as viral and non-viral vectors, into cancer cells. Suicide gene therapeutic strategies currently pursued are herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene with prodrug ganciclovir, cytosine deaminase gene, carboxyl esterase/irinotecan, varicella zoster virus thymidine kinase/ 6 -methoxypurine arabinonucleoside, nitroreductase Nfsb/ 5 -(aziridin- 1 -yl) - 2, 4 -dinitrobenzamide, carboxypeptidase G 2 / 4 -[(2 -chloroethyl) (2 - mesyloxyethyl) amino]benzoyl-L-glutamic acid, cytochrome p 450 -isofosfamide, and cytochrome p 450 -cyclophosphamide. The goal of this review is to summarize the different suicide gene systems and gene delivery vectors addressed to cancer cells, with a particular emphasis on recently developed systems. Finally, we briefly describe the advantageous clinical applications and potential side effects of suicide gene therapy...|$|R
50|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of cancer therapy is the complete elimination of all cancer cells, while leaving all healthy cells unharmed. One {{of the most promising}} therapeutic strategies in this regard is cancer suicide gene therapy (CSGT), which is rapidly progressing into new frontiers.The therapeutic success, in CSGT, is primarily contingent upon precision in delivery of the therapeutic transgenes to the cancer cells only. This is addressed by discovering and targeting unique or / and over-expressed biomarkers displayed on the cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Specificity of cancer therapeutic effects is further enhanced by designing the DNA constructs, which put the therapeutic genes {{under the control of the}} cancer cell specific promoters. The delivery of the <b>suicidal</b> <b>genes</b> to the cancer cells involves viral, as well as synthetic vectors, which are guided by cancer specific antibodies and ligands. The delivery options also include engineered stem cells with tropisms towards cancers. Main mechanisms inducing cancer cells' deaths include: transgenic expression of thymidine kinases, cytosine deaminases, intracellular antibodies, telomeraseses, caspases, DNases. Precautions are undertaken to eliminate the risks associated with transgenesis. Progress in genomics and proteomics should help us in identifying the cancer specific biomarkers and metabolic pathways for developing new strategies towards clinical trials of targeted and personalized gene therapy of cancer.By introducing the gene into a malignant tumor, the tumor would reduce in size and possibly disappear completely, provided all the individual cells have received a copy of the gene.|$|R
40|$|As lithium {{has been}} shown to have a {{protective}} effect against <b>suicidal</b> behavior, <b>genes</b> on which mood stabilizers act may be involved in biological susceptibility to suicide. A recent study showed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response was impaired in the bipolar disorders and the impairment was ameliorated by a mood stabilizer, valproate. We hypothesized that an alteration of ER stress response is involved in the biological susceptibility to suicide through genetic polymorphisms, and examined the association of polymorphisms of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP 1) and heat shock 70 -kDa protein 5 (HSPA 5) genes with suicide. We found {{no significant difference in the}} distribution of these polymorphisms between the suicide victims and the controls. These results suggest that the polymorphisms examined in this study are not involved in the susceptibility to suicide of the Japanese. It has been suggested that suicide involves a genetic factor. Many genes involved in transmitter synthesis and degradation, such as the genes for serotonergic transduction, have been examined in case-control studies on suicide. Although some of these studies have reported a positive association with suicide, the results are controversial (1, 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Microglia are the {{resident}} immune {{cells of the}} central nervous system (CNS). Although the microglial response can be beneficial, there is increasing evidence for detrimental effects of the microglial activation in cases of acute CNS trauma and neurodegenerative disorders. To better understand the role of these cells in CNS pathogenesis, we have created a mouse model with selective and conditional ablation of microglia as well as other cells of myeloid origin in proliferation. To achieve the elimination of proliferating microglia, transgenic mice that express the <b>suicidal</b> <b>gene</b> herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV- 1 TK) driven by the myeloid specific promoter CD 11 b were generated. HSV- 1 TK is itself unable to mediate cell death. However, unlike the mammalian thymidine kinase, HSV- 1 TK is capable of phosphorylating specific nucleoside analogues such as ganciclovir which lead during cell proliferation to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. Here, we will describe the creation and the characterization of CD 11 b-TK mouse lines {{that can be used to}} ablate proliferating myeloid cells in paradigms of acute CNS injury...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability of}} Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) {{to persist in}} the body {{has proven to be}} a long-standing {{challenge}} to virus eradication. Current antiretroviral therapy cannot selectively destroy infected cells; it only halts active viral replication. With therapeutic cessation or interruption, viral rebound occurs, and invariably, viral loads return to pre-treatment levels. The natural reservoirs harboring replication-competent HIV- 1 include CD 4 T cells and macrophages. In particular, cells from the macrophage lineage resist HIV- 1 -mediated killing and support sustained viral production. To develop a complementary strategy to target persistently infected cells, this proof-of-concept study explores an HIV- 1 Rev-dependent lentiviral vector carrying a bacterial hemolysin, anthrolysin O (anlO) from Bacillus anthracis, to achieve selective killing of HIV- 1 - infected cells. Results We demonstrate that in the Rev-dependent lentiviral vector, anlO expression is exclusively dependent on Rev, a unique HIV- 1 protein present only in infected cells. Intracellular expression and oligomerization of AnlO result in membrane pore formation and cytolysis. We have further overcome a technical hurdle in producing a Revdependent AnlO lentivirus, through the use of β-cyclodextrin derivatives to inhibit direct killing of producer cells by AnlO. Using HIV- 1 -infected macrophages and T cells as a model, we demonstrate that this Rev-dependent AnlO lentivirus diminishes HIV- 1 - positive cells. Conclusion The Rev-dependent lentiviral vector has demonstrated its specificity in targeting persistently infected cells. The choice of anlO as the first <b>suicidal</b> <b>gene</b> tested in this vector is based on its cytolytic activity in macrophages and T cells. We conclude that Rev-regulated expression of suicidal genes in HIV- 1 -positive cells is possible, although future in vivo delivery of this system needs to address numerous safety issues. </p...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{for suicide}} may have {{heritable}} contributions. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes strong and consistent findings {{from more than}} 20 controlled family studies indicating nearly 5 -fold greater relative risk of suicidal acts among relatives of index cases with suicidal behavior compared to relatives of nonsuicidal controls. Relative risk was greater for completed suicide than for attempts. Contributions of genetic instead of environmental factors are indicated by a higher average concor-dance for suicidal behavior among co-twins of suicidal identical twins compared to fraternal twins or to relatives of other suicidal subjects, in at least seven studies. Three studies indicate significantly greater suicidal risk, particularly for completed suicide, among biological versus adoptive relatives of suicidal or mentally ill persons adopted early in life. Molecular genetics studies have searched inconclusively for associations of <b>suicidal</b> behavior with <b>genes</b> mainly for proteins required for cen-tral serotonergic neurotransmission. Complex interactions of environmental with heritable risk and protective factors for suicide and psychiatric illnesses or vulnerability traits are suspected, but spe-cific intervening mechanisms remain elusive. Familial or genetic risks for psychiatric factors strongly associated with suicide, such as major affective illnesses and alcohol abuse, as well as impulsive or aggressive traits, have not consistently been separated from suicidal risk itself.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{heritable}} {{component to}} suicidal behaviour, encouraging {{the search for}} the associated risk alleles. Given the putative role of the 5 -HT (5 -hydroxytryptamine; serotonin) system in <b>suicidal</b> behaviour, serotonergic <b>genes</b> are leading candidates. In particular, several studies have reported an association with variants in the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene. METHOD: We studied six serotonergic gene polymorphisms in a well-characterized sample of 129 deliberate self-harm subjects and 329 comparison subjects. The polymorphisms were TPH (A 779 C), 5 -HT transporter (5 -HTT, LPR S/L), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA G 941 T), 5 -HT 1 B receptor (HTR 1 B G 861 C), 5 -HT 2 A receptor (HTR 2 A T 102 C), and 5 -HT 2 C receptor (HTR 2 C Cys 23 Ser). Genotyping was done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assays. The primary analyses compared allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls. There were a limited number of planned secondary analyses within the deliberate self-harm group. RESULTS: The TPH A 779 allele was more common in deliberate self-harm subjects than in controls (OR 1. 38, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 88; P = 0. 03). None of the other polymorphisms was associated with deliberate self-harm. Within the deliberate self-harm group there were no associations with impulsivity, suicide risk, lifetime history of depression, or family history of deliberate self-harm. CONCLUSIONS: Our data extend the evidence that allelic variation in the TPH gene is a risk factor for deliberate self-harm. No evidence was found to implicate the other polymorphisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{gene therapy}} dream started {{well over a}} decade ago. Despite its wide and {{successful}} application in research, it still has not reached the clinics in a meaningful way. No doubt that successful gene therapy {{has a lot to}} offer to patients with inherited, benign or malignant diseases. Several challenges need to be addressed for gene therapy to succeed. The therapeutic gene has to go from the general circulation to the targeted diseased liver cell. It has to go through the cell membrane, escape the lysosome compartment in the cytoplasm and subsequently penetrate the nuclear membrane and reach the nucleosome. Finally, the gene should be expressed highly enough to produce significant level of protein that would change the behaviour of targeted cells and/or affect the function of neighbouring or distant cells. Various imaginative ways were developed to overcome these difficulties, {{such as the use of}} liposome to surround the plasmid containing the therapeutic gene, the introduction of the cassette containing the gene in a viral vector such as adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, vaccinia virus and others. These were successful but not enough to have a clinical impact. They were not effective as in non-viral plasmid approach. They were toxic such as in the use of adenoviruses. They were also associated with malignant transformation such as in the use of retrovirus. The most potent viral vector available today is the lentivirus. However due to its inherent danger this vector has only been used today in HIV patients. It is difficult to speculate on its introduction to the clinic in the near future let alone in patients with benign disease. Our group has been involved in several clinical trials with the use of plasmid DNA, adenovirus, retrovirus and vaccinia virus. It is unfortunate that these clinical trials failed. Despite our lack of success our research is still going strong. Currently we believe clinical breakthrough success in the near future could be achieved via one of these three approaches: (1) Hydrodynamic Gene Delivery (fig. 35. 1, 35. 2, 35. 3) : This technique was developed successfully in mice. We applied it successfully in pigs and subsequently to man. The principle is the percutaneous introduction of a Gene-Cath via the internal jugular vein or femoral vein to the hepatic vein. Then a large volume of fluid containing the therapeutic gene is injected rapidly. This creates a large pressure on the hepatocyte and produces holes in their cell membrane through which the plasmid gets entry into the hepatocytes. (2) The cholesterol-DNA mixture that allows genes to be introduced into the hepatocytes via a systemic injection. This is a new technique and if successful will contribute greatly to the field. (3) Combination of gene with cell therapy and in particular with adult bone-marrow derived stem cells progenitors. This approach allows the introduction of genes using viral vectors in an in-vitro ex-vivo approach where the cells are exposed to the vector and then the cells are washed. This would remove any virus that is still remaining outside the cells, therefore reducing the risks of potential toxicity and potential immune reactions. Some of the clinical applications potentially could include the following: -Introducing the genetically defective genes in adult bone marrow stem cell progenitors in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, glycogen storage diseases etc. - Introducing siRNA in the stem cells in order to protect them from HBV and HCV infection. -Introducing in the stem cells anti-cancer genes that would produce soluble tumour suppressor <b>genes,</b> cytokines or <b>suicidal</b> <b>genes</b> with by-stander effect. We believe that the above three approaches will have their clinical debut in the near future. If successful this will lead to the introduction of clinical gene therapy in conditions, where transient gene expression could be beneficial in patients with liver disease. Long term gene expression will remain a problem with existing technologies. Currently the only technology that offers gene expression is with integra ing viruses such as retrovirus, lentivirus or some non-viral approaches such as with the integrate system. These approaches succeed in long term expression as they lead to genetic integration in the host DNA. However, the integration is random and can occur at sensitive locus that may lead to activation of an oncogene or inactivation of a tumour suppressor gene leading to cell malignant transformation. At the time of writing long term gene expression remains a clinical challenge that still awaits further scientific breakthrough. It is a reality that sometimes attractive scientific and biological concepts take long time for their clinical exploitation. Translational research can be a long lead way from the basic science discovery to the clinical application such as in the monoclonal field. Once considered as an area that never delivered monoclonal antibodies have provided recently important pharmaceuticals nearly three decades following their d 6 but in basic research. No doubt the same will happen in the gene therapy area. Its success will be both in its purest basic form with systemic and local delivery of genetic material as well as piggy-backed on the cell therapy application such as stem cell, adoptive T-cell or dendritic cell. When the gene therapy field will succeed it will have a major positive impact in the management of patients with liver diseases.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Psychiatric {{disorders}} cost {{an estimated}} $ 273 billion annually. This cost comes {{largely in the}} form of lost income and the chronic disability that often strikes people when they are young and can last decades. While the monetary costs are quantifiable, the suffering of each individual patient is no less vital. As many as 1 in 5 persons diagnosed with mental illness will commit suicide, a contributing factor in suicide being the second leading cause of death of people age 15 - 34. There is a critical need to find better ways to identify and help those who are at risk. Understanding mental illness and improving treatment has been difficult due to the heterogeneous and complex etiology of these illnesses. A significant challenge for the field is integrating findings from diverse laboratories all over the world contributing to the ever expanding literature and translating them into actionable treatment. Our lab employs a convergent functional genomics approach which incorporates multiple independent lines of evidence provided by genetic and functional genomic data published in the primary literature as a Bayesian strategy to prioritize experimental findings. Heritability and genetics clearly {{play an important role in}} psychiatric disorders. We looked at schizophrenia and alcoholism in separate case-control analyses in order to identify and prioritize genes related to these disorders. We were able to reproduce these findings in additional independent cohorts using polygenic risk scores. We found overlap in these disorders, and identified possible underlying biological processes. Genetics play an important role in identifying clinical risk, particularly at the population level. At the level of the individual, gene expression may provide more proximal association to disease state, assimilating environmental, genetic, as well as epigenetic influence. We undertook N of 1 analyses in a longitudinally followed cohort of psychiatric participants, identifying genes which change in expression tracking an individual’s change in <b>suicidal</b> ideation.

40|$|Background: Suicide is the {{consequence}} of {{a complex set of}} factors that results in devastation for a staggering number of people. Worldwide, suicide is responsible for over 800 000 deaths annually, while many more millions of survivors are left to cope with the repercussions of this tragedy. Despite the rampant prevalence and dire consequences, the medical community has yet to successfully establish an effective way for clinicians to anticipate a suicide attempt. However, researchers have recently identified several genes that appear altered in both suicide completers and patients suffering from <b>suicidal</b> ideation. These <b>genes</b> can be measured via RNA extraction from a sample of blood. The implications of this research are significant, for if a blood test can aid in the predication of suicide risk, clinicians may have a feasible tool to assist in the prevention of millions of deaths. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, PsychINFO, and Web of Science using the keywords: suicide, SAT 1, and acetyltransferase. The search was narrowed to include only English language and human study articles. The bibliographies of the articles were further searched for relevant sources. Articles with primary data evaluating SAT 1 gene expression in subjects who completed suicide or experienced suicidal ideation were included. Results: Four studies were ultimately included in this systematic review. All four studies demonstrated significantly altered levels of SAT 1 gene expression in suicide victims compared to controls. Additionally, a cohort study demonstrated increased SAT 1 gene expression in live patients reporting severe suicidal ideation. These authors further determined that live patients with increased SAT 1 gene expression have increased rates of hospitalizations resulting from a suicide attempt. Conclusion: Dysregulation of SAT 1 gene expression appears to be associated with suicidal behavior, though it remains unknown why this link exists and the quality of available data is very low. At this time, applications for clinical practice are minimal. However, additional research is highly warranted, as these preliminary findings suggest that SAT 1 gene expression may indeed act as a biomarker and could someday aid in the prediction of a patient’s susceptibility for suicide.

40|$|Human Papillomavirus (HPV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of sexually {{transmitted}} disease worldwide. Infections by high-risk HPVs, such as HPV- 18, have been associated etiologically with cervical cancer. The successful development of HPV vaccines may be beneficial to the HPV-naïve population, but women that have already been exposed to the virus are still at risk of developing HPV-associated malignancies. A need for a systemic cure for HPV-infection therefore still exists. Gene therapies using tissue-specific promoters have been reported to be a promising tool for treating cancers; however, few studies have explored this possibility for cervical cancer. 	The aim of this project is to construct a gene expression vector that can specifically target HPV-infected cervical cancer cells, by making use of the activity and selectivity of the P 105 promoter which is determined by transcription control elements within the HPV- 18 long control region (LCR). The first part of this study involved the construction of LCR deletion plasmids, and examining the subsequent level of gene expression induced within different mammalian cell lines. The results suggest the LCR to be capable in achieving cervical cancer-specific gene expression. The 3 &# 8242;-end of the viral L 1 gene upstream of the LCR appeared to have a repressive effect on the promoter and therefore should be excluded for maximum LCR promoter activity. The second part of the project involved site-directed mutagenesis studies performed on selected transcription factor binding sites with an attempt to further increase the level of LCR promoter activity and specificity towards HPV-infected cervical cancer cells. The results suggest that a GRE/YY 1 mutation may significantly enhance promoter activity. In terms of promoter regulation, the E 2 BSs appeared to be responsible for promoter activation in the absence of viral E 2 proteins.
