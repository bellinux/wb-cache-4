40|$|Metal-air battery {{performance}} rested {{largely on the}} property of air electrode, which includes electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction. Noble metals such as platinum as electrocatalyst for molecular oxygen reduction in air electrode are well known. While they offer the advantages of high catalytic activity, electronic conductivity and stability, their high costs and susceptibility to catalyst poisoning are a serious concern for commercial applications. As one of promising pathway to replace noble metal, manganese oxide as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction has been long-time investigated [1 - 5]. However, the power density of the battery is still limited primarily by the high polarization of air electrodes that are ascribed to a slow reduction of oxygen.

40|$|Chronic skin wounds (CW) {{represent}} a significant world health problem including reservoirs of multi-drug resistant bacterial biofilms. The precise role of {{bacteria in the}} aetiology of chronic inflammation and non-healing remains unclear. This study characterised MRSA from human CW and investigated how they inhibit wound healing, modulate immunological responses and resist treatment in comparison to control MRSA from asymptomatic nasal carriers (NC). Routine cultural analysis of 150 chronic wounds revealed 50 % were colonised with S. aureus, of which 22. 6 % were MRSA. Multi-locus sequence typing identified two new sequence types and demonstrated that wound MRSA represented two clonal complexes (22 and 30) with almost 90 % identified as hospital-acquired EMRSA- 15. MRSA isolated from CW and NC were characterised for virulence factor (VF) expression and modulation of the innate immune system. Presence and expression of MRSA VFs indicated an association with sequence type. Greater expression of colonisation- (cna) and degradation- associated (hysA) VFs {{was evident in the}} wound MRSA, suggesting that modulation of virulence is important for non-healing. The ability of conventional biocides (iodine, <b>silver,</b> and potassium <b>permanganate)</b> to treat chronic wound bacteria, using the carrier-test method, revealed iodine as the only effective biocide. In vitro stimulation of the ability of the MRSA to induce innate immunity showed that CW-MRSA exhibited decreased TLR, cytokine and complement responses compared with NC-MRSA (IL- 8, TNFa, complement activation PO. 05). Moreover, biofilm- induced reductions in immunogenicity were observed compared with planktonic growth in monocyte and complement assays (PO. 05). Scratch wound assays indicated that MRSA failed to inhibit keratinocyte migration (P> 0. 05), although bacterial growth conditions (biofilm vs. planktonic) significantly affected the observed cellular migration (PO. 05). Virulence factor production and ability to modulate/evade the host innate immune response are important potential mechanisms by which MRSA are able to colonise chronic wounds. These studies provide important new insights into the role of MRSA in delayed dermal healing. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of <b>silver</b> <b>permanganate,</b> pre-irradiated in BEPO {{and in a}} ⁶°C₀ Ϫ 'hot spot' has been investigated in the temperature range 100 - 125 °C. The results {{are similar to those}} for irradiated KMn 0 ₄ and the mechanism proposed for the latter is again suggested. The activation energy for the migration of point defects over the induction period is 1. 03 ev. The decompositions of unirradiated and irradiated crystals differ in that the latter undergo physical disintegration over the acceleratory period. X-ray studies immediately prior to disintegration show strain and fragmentation in the irradiated crystal. An explanation involving the annealing of point defects at dislocation is advanced to explain the changes produced in the p/t plots with increased dosage, and fixed decomposition temperature.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{reported in this}} thesis {{is divided into three}} parts. Each part describes the historic background the significance the experimental details and results and discussion that encompasses characterization of each type of reaction and bioassay of the final products. Part-I is related to the synthesis of mimetics of neurotensin, NT (8 - 13) and their binding affinity to the NT receptor. The synthesis and biostudies of mimetics of NT are directed to design a drug for psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia, parkinson and alzheimer. NT is linear trideca peptide (pGlu-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr-lle-Leu) present in brain and has a wide range of central and peripheral pharmacological effects. NT and NT (8 - 13), being peptides cannot be used as drugs because of their susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, difficulty in crossing the blood brain barrier and poor bioavailability. Development of non peptidic analogs has therefore, been a continuing interest. In this effort to develop full or partial non peptidic NT mimetics, two compounds, (1) and (2) were synthesized following the multiple template approach (MT A). Compound (2), due to its unique properties over compound (1) was selected as the lead compound for the synthesis of NT mimetics. Some of these mimetics were found to posses different degrees of affinities to NT receptor. During the present work three NT (8 - 13) mimetics (52), (74) and (76) were synthesized. This synthesis involved the use of pyrrole - 2 -carboxylic acid, 3 -hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4 -methoxy- 3 -hydroxybenzaldehyde in different synthetic schemes. The bioassays of the three synthesized mimetics (52), (74) and (76) were performed at the Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville Florida, USA under the supervision of ProÂ£ Dr. E. Richelson. All the intermediate and final products were fully characterized from their spectroscopic data. Part-II of the thesis is concerned with the synthesis and bioactivities of some naturally occurring anthraquinones, These natural anthraquinones have often been reported to be biologically active. They include anthracycline antibiotics and their analogues which are used in chemotherapy of solid tumors of breast, lung, bladder and ovary. As a result of the present work, four naturally occurring anthraquinones (97 - 100) were successfully synthesized by an easy and highly selective general method, starting from the relatively inexpensive commercially available starting materials i. e. 1, 8 -dihydroxy- 9, 10 -anthraquinone (101) and its regioisomer 1, 5 -dihydroxy- 10 - anthraquinone (102). The sequence of reactions consist of the protection of hydroxyl groups by MOM chloridet reduction of anthraquinone to corresponding anthracene by metalation /stannylationt iodination and coupling of the methyl groups, selectively at ortho position of the antyhracene rings using Nigishi methodology. The regeneration of the anthraquinones from anthracenes by specific oxidizing reagent bis <b>silver</b> <b>permanganate</b> followed by deprotection reaction yielded isochrysophanol (97) and isozyganein (98). In the synthesis of the other two anthraquinones, w-hydroxy isochrysophanol (99) and morindaparvin (100), the intermediate stannanes were routed to esters. Then the corresponding esters were reduced to alcohols using di-isobutyl aluminum hydride (DiBAL). The crude alcohols were protected using ethyl vinyl ether (EVE). Anthraquinones were regenerated from anthracenes and the deprotection process yielded the desired anthraquinones ",-hydroxyl isochfygophanol (99) and morindaparvin (l 00). Each of the four synthesized compound was screened out for in-vitro antibacterial activity which showed moderate activity against these bacteria. The in-vitro cytotoxic bioassay of the synthesized compounds showed no cytotoxic activity. An antioxidative assay of compounds revealed that they act as a weak 1 - 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers. Part III of the thesis describes the cost effective synthesis of dithioacetals and oxathioacetals. Some enantiomerically pure dithioacetals and oxathioacetals were synthesized with the same method in order to study asymmetric induction reaction in future. All the synthesized dithioacetals and oxathioacetals were fully characterized from their spectral data and optical rotations. The synthesized dithioacetals and oxathioacetals were also screened out for in-vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity. They showed variable activity. The in-vitro cytotoxic bioassay (lethality test) of compounds using Mc-Laughlin brine shrimp was also performed. All the compounds tested were nontoxic except menthoxy methyl phenyl sulphide (135) which showed positive lethality...|$|E
