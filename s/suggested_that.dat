5|$|A 2011 genetic {{study showed}} that two {{examined}} specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E

In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{confidence}} judgements <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{people are}} often overconfident. However, some {{studies have found that}} depressed mood reduces this positive bias. To date this has been explained as a mood phenomenon. In this study we explore an alternative theory which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> confidence is related to internal judgements of social rank and status. This theory <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the lower one perceives oneself to be in status and rank the less one can afford to be overconfident.
