40|$|Expression of hepcidin, {{a central}} {{regulator}} of systemic iron metabolism, is transcriptionally {{regulated by the}} bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. However, the factors other than the BMP pathway also participate in the regulation of hepcidin expression. In the present study, we show that <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> increased hepcidin expression and transcription without inducing the phosphorylation of Smad 1 / 5 / 8 in primary hepatocytes, HepG 2 cells or Hepa 1 - 6 cells. Co-treatment with LDN- 193189, an inhibitor of the BMP type I receptor, abrogated this hepcidin induction. Reporter assays using mutated reporters revealed {{the involvement of the}} BMP response element- 1 (BMP-RE 1) and signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) - and activator protein (AP) - 1 -binding sites in serum-induced hepcidin transcription in HepG 2 cells. <b>Serum</b> <b>treatment</b> induced the expression of the AP- 1 components c-fos and junB in primary hepatocytes and HepG 2 cells. Forced expression of c-fos or junB enhanced the response of hepcidin transcription to <b>serum</b> <b>treatment.</b> By contrast, the expression of dominant negative (dn) -c-fos and dn-junB decreased hepcidin transcription. The present study reveals that serum contains factors stimulating hepcidin transcription. Basal BMP activity is essential for the serum-induced hepcidin transcription, although <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> does not stimulate the BMP pathway. The induction of c-fos and junB by <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> stimulates hepcidin transcription, through possibly cooperation with BMP-mediated signaling.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{previously}} found that overexpression of CHF 1 /Hey 2 in the myocardium prevents {{the development of}} phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy. To identify transcriptional pathways regulated by CHF 1 /Hey 2, we cultured primary neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes from wild type and transgenic mice overexpressing CHF 1 /Hey 2 and treated them with serum, a potent hypertrophic stimulus. We verified that overexpression of CHF 1 /Hey 2 suppressed cardiac myocyte hypertrophy induced by serum and then determined transcriptional profiles by microarray hybridization. We identified and verified important downstream target genes by single gene analysis and qRT-PCR and then identified important biological processes by Gene Set Analysis using Biological Process Gene Sets from the Gene Ontology Consortium. We found that CHF 1 /Hey 2 suppresses pathways involved in water transport, adenylate cyclase activity, embryonic eye morphogenesis, gut development and fluid transport after serum stimulation. Genes involved in protein dephosphorylation, demonstrate increased expression in myocytes overexpressing CHF 1 /Hey 2, independent of <b>serum</b> <b>treatment.</b> Genes overexpressed prior to <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> are involved in regulation of transcription factor activity, nuclear protein export and steroid hormone receptor signaling.

Among Src family kinases only Yes, not Fyn or Src, was functionally {{involved in the}} increased cell proliferation and invasion of GD 3 -expressing transfectant cells (GD 3 +). Yes was located upstream of p 130 Cas and paxillin and at an equivalent level to focal adhesion kinase. Yes underwent autophosphorylation even before <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> and showed stronger kinase activity in GD 3 + cells than in GD 3 − cells following <b>serum</b> <b>treatment.</b> Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Yes bound to focal adhesion kinase or p 130 Cas more strongly in GD 3 + cells than in GD 3 − cells. As a possible mechanism for the enhancing effects of GD 3 on cellular phenotypes, it was shown that majority of Yes was localized in glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts in GD 3 + cells even before <b>serum</b> <b>treatment,</b> whereas it was scarcely detected in glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts in GD 3 − cells. An in vitro kinase assay of Yes revealed that coexistence of GD 3 with Yes in membranous environments enhances the kinase activity of GD 3 − cell-derived Yes toward enolase, p 125, and Yes itself. Knockdown of GD 3 synthase resulted in the alleviation of tumor phenotypes and reduced activation levels of Yes. Taken together, these results suggest a role of GD 3 in the regulation of Src family kinases...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Na+/H+ {{exchanger}} 1, {{which plays}} {{an essential role}} in intracellular pH regulation in most tissues, is also known to be a key actor in both proliferative and apoptotic processes. Its activation by H+ is best described by the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model: the dimeric NHE- 1 oscillates between a low and a high affinity conformation, the balance between the two forms being defined by the allosteric constant L(0). In this study, influence of cholesterol- and caveolin-rich microdomains on NHE- 1 activity was examined by using cholesterol depleting agents, including methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD). These agents activated NHE- 1 by modulating its L(0) parameter, which was reverted by cholesterol repletion. This activation was associated with NHE- 1 relocation outside microdomains, and was distinct from NHE- 1 mitogenic and hormonal stimulation; indeed MBCD and <b>serum</b> <b>treatments</b> were additive, and serum alone did not change NHE- 1 localization. Besides, MBCD activated a serum-insensitive, constitutively active mutated NHE- 1 ((625) KDKEEEIRK(635) into KNKQQQIRK).
