The police's efforts to disperse the crowd from the Square were unsuccessful. Eventually there was a re-grouping and the workers began to move off from George Square to march towards Glasgow Green.

60|$|The box, {{to which}} the mint-master pointed, was a huge, <b>square,</b> <b>iron</b> bound, oaken chest; it was big enough, my children, for all four of you to play at hide-and-seek in. The {{servants}} tugged with might and main, but could not lift this enormous receptacle, and were finally obliged to drag it across the floor. Captain Hull then took a key from his girdle, unlocked the chest, and lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! it was full to the brim of bright pine-tree shillings, fresh from the mint; and Samuel Sewell {{began to think that}} his father-in-law had got possession of {{all the money in the}} Massachusetts treasury. But it was only the mint-master’s honest share of the coinage.|$|E

"You {{construct}} six slight <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> frames, each {{hinged to}} the other; each, say, two feet square, or {{the breadth of}} two common tiles, and shaped on the edges so as to take in tiles;--tiles {{are to be found}} on every human cottage. This iron frame, when you hook it together, becomes the ghost of a cubic box, and by the help of twelve tiles becomes a compact field-oven; and you can bake with it, if you have flour and water, and a few sticks. The succinctest oven ever heard of; for your operation done, and your tiles flung out again, it is capable of all folding flat like a book." [...] [Retzow, ii. 82 n.] Never till now had Wobersnow's oven been at fault: but in these Polish Villages, all of mere thatched hovels, there was not a tile to be found; and the Bakery, with astonishment, saw itself unable to proceed.|$|E
6000|$|... "4. A {{portion of}} the poison, as much as could be applied, was smeared over the <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> head of an arrow, and allowed to dry. The arrow was then shot into the buttock of a goat with {{sufficient}} force to carry the head out of sight; twenty minutes afterwards, no effect whatever having followed, the arrow was extracted. The poison had become softened and was wiped completely off two of the sides, and partly off the two other sides. The animal appeared to suffer very little pain from the wound; he was kept for a fortnight, and then died, but not apparently from any cause connected with the wound. In fact he was previously diseased. Unfortunately {{the seat of the}} wound was not then examined, but a few days previously it appeared to have healed of itself. In the rabbit of the former experiment, three days after the insertion of the poison in the wound, the latter was closed with a dry coagulum and presented no marks of inflammation around it.|$|E
60|$|But at {{that moment}} the {{carriage}} began to slow down, and the clank of the hoofs of the riders in front of them died suddenly away. Peeping through the windows, the prisoners saw a huge dark building stretching in front of them, so high and so broad that the night shrouded it in upon every side. A great archway hung above them, and the lamps shone on the rude wooden gate, studded with ponderous clamps and nails. In {{the upper part of the}} door was a small <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> grating, and through this they could catch a glimpse of the gleam of a lantern and of a bearded face which looked out at them. De Vivonne, standing in his stirrups, craned his neck up towards the grating, so that the two men most interested could hear little of the conversation which followed. They saw only that the horseman held a gold ring up in the air, and that the face above, which had begun by shaking and frowning, was now nodding and smiling. An instant later the head disappeared, the door swung open upon screaming hinges, and the carriage drove on into the courtyard beyond, leaving the escort, with the exception of De Vivonne, outside. As the horses pulled up, a knot of rough fellows clustered round, and the two prisoners were dragged roughly out. In the light of the torches which flared around them they could see that they were hemmed in by high turreted walls upon every side. A bulky man with a bearded face, the same whom they had seen at the grating, was standing in the centre of the group of armed men issuing his orders.|$|E

6000|$|As we have said, {{just before}} Gertie's arrival Sam Natly chanced to be {{attempting}} to dine. The telegraph needles pointed to [...] "Line clear" [...] {{on both sides}} of him. Dinner consisted of a sort of Irish stew cooked in a little <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> pan that fitted into the small stove. Being a placid, good-humoured man, not easily thrown off his balance either mentally or physically, Sam smiled slightly to himself as he put the first bit of meat into his mouth. He thought of his wife, wished that she was there to assist in the eating of it and shut his lips on the savoury morsel. A piece of potato was arrested by the sharp telegraph bell--one beat--of warning. The potato followed the meat as he was in the act of rising. Sam touched his telegraphic bell in reply to his signal-friend on the right, and [...] "Train on line" [...] was marked by a telegraphic needle pointing to these words. As the train was yet a great way off, at least as to distance, he sat down again and disposed of bit number two. Number three followed, and he had made some approach to engulfing number four when a shrill whistle struck his ear. Up he sprang, glanced at the time-piece, wiped his mouth, and went to the levers. He touched his bell--a single note of warning to his signal-friend on the left and received a reply, one beat, meaning [...] "Ready." [...] The train appeared, came up like a rocket and went past like a thunderbolt. When Sam saw its red tail-light, and thus knew that all the train was there,--that none of the tail carriages or trucks had broken loose and been left behind,--he gave a mighty pull to one of the levers, which turned up the arms of his distant signal, and thus blocked the line to all other trains. The needle was now [...] "pegged down" [...] or fixed at [...] "Train on line," [...] so that there could be no mistake about it, and no trusting to memory. Having accomplished this, he went to a large book which lay open on a desk in a corner, glanced at the time-piece, recorded the passage of the train--a passenger one, and once more sat down to dinner.|$|E

50|$|The mill was {{of three}} storeys, the base being of ragstone {{and the upper}} storeys of timber, clad in tarred weatherboarding. The {{overshot}} waterwheel was 14 ft diameter and 6 ft wide, mounted on a 9 in <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> axle, driving an iron pit wheel. The iron pentrough was dated 1887. The final remains of Mill Hall Mill were demolished {{to make way for}} the foundations of a footbridge over the M20.|$|E
50|$|The {{overshot}} waterwheel {{was some}} 12 ft diameter by 6 ft wide and was {{carried on a}} wooden axle. it drove a cast iron pit wheel 10 ft diameter with 112 wooden cogs. A 5 in <b>square</b> cast <b>iron</b> layshaft was driven which powered at least two pairs of millstones.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{consists of}} a granite fountain with five naked, female, bronze sculptures (by Tore Strindberg), representing five continents: Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Australia (Oceania). A ship at the top is seen sailing five streams, symbolizing the five oceans. Since the piece is {{to remind us of}} the old iron scale which used to be located on this spot (hence the <b>square's</b> name, The <b>Iron</b> <b>Square),</b> 30 hallmarks from those ironworks who exported their goods via Göteborg can be seen throughout the sculpture.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the church}} is a gallery that curves round three sides. This is carried on <b>square</b> cast <b>iron</b> columns, and {{contains}} raked seating.

50|$|Spectators {{stood on}} a {{platform}} which represented {{the deck of a}} steamship, complete with smoking funnels and steam whistles. In order to give it a rolling and pitching motion, it was mounted on a 5 m (16 ft) <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> frame on a gimbal. A combination of hydraulic cylinders, chains, and electric motors allowed the platform to pitch by up to 50 cm (20 inches) from horizontal, and to roll by up to 20 cm (8 inches).|$|E
5000|$|To inscribe {{the grid}} onto the land, Randel {{and his staff}} erected almost 1,600 markers [...] - [...] {{primarily}} 3 ft long, 9 in square marble monuments inscribed {{with the number of}} the street, placed at each intersection. Where rocks prevented the use of the marble markers, they blasted holes wioth gunpowder, poured in lead, and anchored 6 in long, 1 in <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> bolts. In all, they positioned 1,549 marble markers and 98 iron bolts to define the pattern of the grid.|$|E

40|$|There it lies. In {{an archaeological}} {{collections}} drawer in the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, in Connecticut Tier 78, Drawer 4. A single wrought iron nail (perhaps a ship’s nail) rests amidst bits of copper and other metal debris, European trade goods, clay pipe fragments, and a rusty jaw harp, all {{recovered from a}} layer of earth four centuries past. This material was salvaged from a dig at Fort Shantok (also called Uncas’s Fort, at Trading Cove), a well-known 17 th century Mohegan habitation site, in the homelands of the present-day Mohegan Tribe. At first, this nail is almost too ordinary to notice…but its shape is unusual. This common nail, hammered and drawn from quarter-inch <b>squared</b> <b>iron</b> rod stock (typical of the 17 th century) has been re-worked, and the point has been drawn out and narrowed into a tubular shape. Also, the head has been flattened {{in such a way}} that it would never hold a wooden seam secure. Who would alter such a good nail? To what purpose...|$|R
5000|$|During World War II a 30-foot <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> widow's walk on {{the roof}} was donated to the US Government which was looking for scrap metal from civilians to aide in the war effort. [...] During that same period trains {{transporting}} US troops would pass the house and deliver German prisoners of war to a factory next door to work. Children {{growing up in the}} house described having conversations German prisoners with the assistance of a translator as well as playing games of catch with them.|$|E
50|$|The dirk-type was forged {{with a sharp}} dirk-like point, {{which could}} be used to parry an opponent's sword, to hook the cords of armor or a helmet, or like a can opener to {{separate}} armor plates. The sharp point could pierce unprotected or weak areas of an opponent's armor like the armpit area. The blade of this type of kabutowari was a curved tapered <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> or steel bar with a hook on its back edge. In combat, one could parry and catch a blade with that hook, as with a jitte. Some kabutowari of this type were mounted in the style of a tanto with a koshirae.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{brick walls}} of Gunfoundry are approximately 50 ft high with a tapered portion commencing above 25 feet. Due to poor maintenance, the tapered walls {{were reduced to}} 25 to 30 feet. The lower portion was plastered with lime. The shape of the bricks used {{in the construction of}} Gunfoundry is square with less thickness. The binding material used is lime mortar. The wall surfaces were covered with lime mortar on the exterior and interior. The walls have joints of <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> rods. In the lower portions, brick arches were made in semi-circular shape, where the smelting was carried out under the supervision of Michel Joachim Marie Raymond.|$|E
50|$|Bertholme is a {{substantial}} single-storey residence built of sandstone. Its hipped roof, originally slate, is now of corrugated <b>iron.</b> <b>Square</b> in shape, but with a bay projecting slightly at the front, the house {{is surrounded by a}} convex roofed verandah.|$|R
50|$|The Peace Pole {{located near}} the church was created for the church’s sesquicentennial in 2007. Each <b>square</b> of <b>iron</b> was carved by a member, then cast {{as part of the}} Zumbrota Area Arts Council’s Iron Pour, which coincided with the anniversary celebration. The words, “Peace: Let It Begin With Me,” echo the words of the Peace Hymn {{frequently}} sung at Sunday worship. First Congregational United Church of Christ, Zumbrota, welcomes visitors.

50|$|Caesar's Camp, {{also called}} Schapsbury Hill and Shasbury Hill, was a <b>square,</b> Early <b>Iron</b> Age, British (not Roman) fort site of c. 500 BC, south of Bath Road, about halfway between Heathrow Road and Hatton Road, {{and a bit}} north of due east of Heathrow Hall. It was about 300 feet square (c. 1820 measurement) or 380 feet square (1911 measurement). It survived because it was on common land until the {{enclosure}} of the Commons of Harmondsworth parish, after which the fort's ramparts were fairly quickly ploughed out.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{cause of}} the riot has been disputed - some sources {{indicate}} it was caused by an unprovoked baton charge by the police, while others indicate that strikers attempted to stop trams traveling through the square.

50|$|Between 1940 and 1946, the DGEMN {{completed}} many {{repairs and}} recuperation of the castle, including: the central {{pillar of the}} tower was reconstructed, including the construction of foundation and installation of new masonry; reconstruction of double windows, including the exchange of damaged masonry (general repairs and shoring-up masonry); covering openings in masonry and stonework; repointing and cleaning; placing two rods and a <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> hanger in the roof frame including the finial iron plate; execution of the roof covering with double national tile; execution and settlement of thick elm beams in two floors; demolition of masonry walls; general consolidation of the tower battlements including the replacement of damage stones; execution of mortared masonry walls; and regularization of the surrounding land. On 27 April 1942, the castle was ceded to the Casa do Povo de Santo Estêvão.|$|E
50|$|This picturesque covered bridge, one of {{the last}} of its kind in Michigan, was built in 1867 by Jared N. Brazee and J. N. Walker, {{builders}} of several covered bridges in this area. The name of the bridge derives from the White family, a prominent pioneer family. The crossing of the Flat River here was known as White's Crossing before the first primitive bridge was built. In 1840, a bridge of log corduroy construction was erected. It was replaced by this covered bridge, costing $1700. It is of the through-truss type with a gable roof. The hand-hewn trusses are sheeted over with rough pine boards. Wooden pegs and handcut <b>square</b> <b>iron</b> nails are used to secure the various parts of the bridge. White's Bridge has been in constant use since 1867, proof that it was well made.|$|E
50|$|The site of this {{watermill}} now lies in {{the middle}} of Bewl Water. It was one of those very rare watermills that was an overdrift mill, with the millstones driven from above. This arrangement is more commonly found in windmills. When Bewl Water was built, the fourteenth century Mill House was dismantled and re-erected at Three Legged Cross, Wadhurst. The overshot waterwheel was some 12 ft diameter by 6 ft wide and was carried on a wooden axle. it drove a cast iron pit wheel 10 ft diameter with 112 wooden cogs. A 5 in <b>square</b> cast <b>iron</b> layshaft was driven which powered at least two pairs of millstones.|$|R
50|$|Järntorget (The <b>Iron</b> <b>Square)</b> {{is a small}} {{public square}} in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Located in the southernmost corner of the old town, the square connects the {{thoroughfares}} Västerlånggatan and Österlånggatan, while the two alleys, Södra Bankogränd and Norra Bankogränd, stretches east to connect the square to Skeppsbron, and two other alleys, Järntorgsgatan and Triewaldsgränd, leads south to Slussplan and Kornhamnstorg respectively.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} {{historically}} as Walbridge Spring, located 900 ft {{east of the}} Big Spring and a block east of the courthouse <b>square,</b> Bell's <b>Iron</b> Spring {{played an important role}} in Neosho's development. Originally rising in the valley and capable of supplying a city of 50,000 people, though hidden from view for many years, this spring is currently the focus of an ongoing restoration project, which includes plans to re-expose the spring and redevelop the surrounding property as a public historic park. Due to the recent discovery of the presence of endangered Ozark cave fish in the spring, the city is working closely with Missouri Department of Conservation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|R
