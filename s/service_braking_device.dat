50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> concurrently with the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers.

40|$|The {{significance}} of the <b>braking</b> <b>devices</b> is increasing due to the intensification of manufacturing, increase in the moving masses, speeds of movement and frequency of braking. During a short time period the <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> needs to convert {{a significant amount of}} mechanical energy into heat energy and transfer it into the environment without compromising the operability of both devices and machines in general. For electric actuators braking a normally closed mechanical brake is frequently used. When disconnecting the motor from the network the brake friction surfaces are closed and prevent rotation, and when the motor is switched on, they are opens under the action of the electromagnet, electro-hydraulic pusher, special electric motor, mechanical or pneumatic device. In the case of joint implementation of the asynchronous motor and the mechanical brake, the drive of quick stop is more compact and convenient. Such devices are further called asynchronous motors with electromechanical braking systems henceforth. The large number of requirements as well as different conditions of operation cause a large variety of designs of such motors. One of the major shortcomings of the functioning of well-known design is the periodic wear of the friction linings and the need for frequent replacement of them. The solution to this problem is the use of asynchronous motor with recessed combo <b>braking</b> <b>device.</b> However, for some mechanisms that do not require a smooth stop of the motor shaft and that have a speed of rotation of the motor shaft less than 1500 rpm, more simple and cheap solution would be the use of an electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with an air gap compensation. Due to wear of the friction linings the air gap of the electromagnet increases. Due to the compensation of the air gap of the electromagnet these devices make it possible to rub the material of the friction lining longer. The current designs of the electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with compensation of the air gap are quite bulky and complicated to be manufactured. Therefore, the authors developed, experimentally investigated and implemented two new, simple and cheap designs of electromechanical <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> with compensation of the air gap. </p...|$|R

50|$|With a <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{relay valve}} installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers, and quickly applies the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes.</b> The pressure delivered to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers.|$|R
