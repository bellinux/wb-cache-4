30|$|Essentially, <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> {{and junior}} editors are treated {{differently}} in publishing houses, {{leading to a}} growing tension between them. First, <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> and junior editors sign contracts based on different time spans. In the publishing houses I have examined, junior editors sign contracts once every year in their first three years. Beginning in their fourth year, only those “excellent” (well-behaved) editors are allowed to sign contracts once every three years. Maybe a few years later, they can sign contracts once every five years, depending on their performance. Meanwhile, <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> initially sign their contracts once every three years according to the Labor Law effective in 1995. Afterwards, they sign contracts that guarantee their lifetime employment. Contracts for <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> are more symbolic in meaning than real in their effects. They sign contracts only {{to conform to the}} requirements of the Labor Law.|$|R

The <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> were told to [...] "gradually devote more extensive coverage" [...] to Lam.|$|R

30|$|Third, {{both the}} reward and {{punishment}} systems are different for <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> and junior editors. In {{terms of the}} reward system, <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> easily get promoted. In the publishing industry, <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> are more respected due to their seniority instead of their professional skills and abilities because seniority is widely honored according to the Chinese tradition. As for the punishment system, on the one hand, <b>senior</b> <b>editors,</b> most of who lack marketing knowledge, can hardly make enough profit specified in their contracts. They are, however, allowed to stay in publishing houses by the managers {{even if they are}} not working hard, so long as they do not make any trouble for the managers’ control and management of other editors. On the other hand, the profit that junior editors generate for publishing houses is carefully calculated and mainly determines their incomes. That is to say, the annual incomes of junior editors can be largely reduced if they fail to earn the amount of profit specified in their contracts. As such, {{there is no doubt that}} junior editors experience tremendous work pressure to ensure that their books sell well, and they need to be extremely sensitive to the demands of readers.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 Robbins mailed off 30 {{pages of}} his novel to Nichols who sent them on to the New York office. The <b>senior</b> <b>editors,</b> holdovers from when Doubleday was a Roman Catholic {{publishing}} house, did not approve, but Nichols encouraged Robbins to keep writing. When he had 70 pages, Nichols tried them again on New York, but the <b>senior</b> <b>editors</b> were still unconvinced. It wasn't until 1970 that Doubleday finally accepted the manuscript and in 1971 published 6,000 copies of Another Roadside Attraction.|$|R
