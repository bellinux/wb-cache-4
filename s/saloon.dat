5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a <b>saloon</b> in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the <b>saloon,</b> and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the <b>saloon,</b> Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the <b>saloon.</b> Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of <b>saloon</b> owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E

Several witnesses said that Clark pulled a pistol on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the <b>saloon,</b> including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E

25|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{was born in}} Ohio and New York State in 1873 when local women, concerned about alcohol's influence on home life, met in churches for prayer and then embarked on visits to <b>saloons</b> to confront those they felt responsible. During {{the next couple of}} years, the movement caught fire, with women demanding that <b>saloons</b> cease selling alcohol. The women of Fredonia, New York were the first credited with visiting local <b>saloons</b> under the aegis of their leader Mrs. Esther McNeil and, on December 22, 1873 were the first to call themselves the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Two days later, following a lecture at the Hillsboro, Ohio Music Hall the night before, the Crusade was born when Mrs. Eliza Thompson, a judge's wife and the daughter of a former governor, gathered 70 women in prayer at the Presbyterian Church and marched to the local <b>saloons.</b> Singing hymns as they went, the women demanded the <b>saloons</b> cease selling alcohol.|$|R

5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a <b>saloon.</b> They left there to race horses and open a <b>saloon</b> during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story <b>saloon</b> called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another <b>saloon</b> in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E
