5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> to make teaching more effective.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus {{is known}} to be a bioaccumulator of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and selenium. To reduce exposure, {{authorities}} recommend avoiding mushrooms from polluted areas such as those near mines, smelters, roadways, incinerators and disposal sites.

His intent is to show a friend, Brigadier General Wheeler (Delroy Lindo), the commandant's {{superior}} officer, that the commandant is unfit and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from command under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During a visit, Winter receives a letter threatening the kidnapping of General Wheeler by the prisoners. After ordering his men into action, Winter discovers that the scheme was a fake orchestrated by Irwin to detect how prison guards would react during an actual uprising.|$|E
5|$|Ness {{returned}} {{in the first}} sequel, Melee, alongside an EarthBound-themed item and battle arena. Lucas of Mother 3 joined Ness in Brawl. Several years after Brawl release, Official Nintendo Magazine wrote that Ness was an unpopular Smash character who <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from future installments. Ness, however, {{returned in}} the latest Smash games, 3DS/Wii U, and Lucas was later added as downloadable content. Nintendo also produced Ness and Lucas Amiibo figurines.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} {{the city}} council's hearing into the case, Christine and Briegleb arrive at Los Angeles City Hall, where they {{encounter}} thousands of protesters who are demanding answers from the city. The hearing is intercut with scenes from Northcott's trial. The council concludes that Jones and Davis <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from duty, and that extrajudicial internments by police must be stopped. Northcott's jury finds him guilty of murder and the judge sentences him to death by hanging.|$|E

Paul stated that Treasury Secretary James Baker <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from his office for the administration's monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very close to it.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E

5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from the Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, {{as well as the}} decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the {{commission}} submitted a threefold plan of {{proposal to the}} government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed,</b> the monument cleared {{up to the first}} balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{established}} {{procedure for}} removing an English king. Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Hereford, {{made a series}} of public allegations about Edward's conduct as king, and in January 1327 a parliament convened at Westminster at which the question of Edward's future was raised; Edward refused to attend the gathering. Parliament, initially ambivalent, responded to the London crowds that called for Prince Edward to take the throne. On 12 January the leading barons and clergy agreed that Edward II <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> and replaced by his son. The following day it was presented to an assembly of the barons, where it was argued that Edward's weak leadership and personal faults had led the kingdom into disaster, and that he was incompetent to lead the country.|$|E

40|$|In the beginning, laparoscopic {{general surgery}} {{was like an}} elusive thought, sweet in nature, but hauntingly vague. Could an organ <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> with a laparoscope, <b>should</b> it <b>be</b> <b>removed,</b> and, more importantly, by what manner <b>should</b> it <b>be</b> <b>removed?</b> — {{questions}} without ready answers. And so, major laparoscopic surgery remained out of general surgical consciousness. There were those, however, including Mühe, Mouret, Dubois, Périssat and others, who thought that laparoscopic cholecystectomy was feasible. 1 - 5 In this country, a gynecologist, William Saye, collaborated with general surgeon Barry McKernan to perform the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the United States. 6 Reddick and Olsen soon followed with their series. ...|$|R
5|$|When {{civil war}} broke out in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of Charles and those of Parliament, Camber Castle had not been entirely closed and was {{being used as a}} royal munitions store. The citizens of Rye sided with Parliament, which agreed that the weapons and stores in the castle <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> and taken to the town for safe-keeping. Concerned that it might be seized by Royalist forces, Parliament went on to dismantle the castle over the next year, stripping the lead from the roof, blocking up the gunports and demolishing the living accommodation. As a result, Camber Castle was not used by the Royalists during the Second English Civil War in 1648, despite several other of the Device Forts along the south coast being occupied.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E
5|$|Miller, the vice-captain, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. On arrival in India, Miller scored 46 in a draw against North Zone. Miller then captained the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay, top-scoring with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In a match against India, Miller took two wickets. At this point, {{with most of the}} team {{suffering}} from dysentery and the leadership not permitting the team to travel by air, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from the captaincy, with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him. This would have increased his prospects of leading Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when a RAAF plane was acquired to transport the team.|$|E

5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed,</b> the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
5|$|Miller, the vice-captain of the team, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. The {{servicemen}} arrived in Bombay and took a two-day train journey to Lahore to play North Zone. Miller scored 46 in a drawn match. The Australians headed to Delhi, but Miller missed the tour match due to food poisoning. He then led the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay with Hassett being rested. Miller top-scored with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In the first match against India at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium, regarded as unofficial Tests, Miller took two wickets: Rusi Modi in the first innings and Abdul Hafeez Kardar in the second. The match ended in a high-scoring draw with Miller unbeaten on 15 as Australia were 1/31 in pursuit of 112 for victory. At this point, {{with most of the}} team suffering from dysentery, some of the Australians became disenchanted with the long train journeys across the subcontinent, and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was rejected, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed,</b> with Miller as one of the candidates to replace him. With Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services captain {{would be one of the}} leading candidates to lead Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Squadron Leader Stan Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team. On the first flight to Calcutta, the squad survived an electrical storm that caused the plane to drop altitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} the Witham had {{deteriorated}} by 1802, and the Commissioners asked John Rennie for advice. He stated that the Kirkstead lock was badly placed, and the associated staunch {{was in danger of}} collapse. He recommended that it be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere, and also suggested that access to Boston should be through the Witham Naviagable Drains, rather than the Grand Sluice, or that a new cut should be built to the south of the sluice, to rejoin the river at Boston Harbour. In 1803, he suggested that High Bridge at Lincoln should be demolished and rebuilt. Four years later, he suggested that the locks at Kirkstead and Barlings <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed,</b> and replaced by one near Washingborough church. The Commissioners petitioned parliament in 1808, and a new Act of Parliament authorised the work, to be carried out by a company of proprietors. They could borrow £30,000 for the drainage element of the scheme and £70,000 for the navigation element. Two new locks were built, one at Stamp End and the other at Bardney, which replaced the original locks. A new channel was cut near Fiskerton, upstream of Bardney, and the plan for a lock at Washingborough was dropped. While Stamp End lock was being rebuilt, an alternative route was provided, utilising the Sincil Dyke and the South Delph. Rennie recorded that Branston Delph, Carlton Dike, Nocton Delph and Timberland Dike were navigable at the time. The proprietors obtained three more Acts of Parliament, in 1812, 1826 and 1829, all with the main aim of allowing more capital to be raised.|$|E
