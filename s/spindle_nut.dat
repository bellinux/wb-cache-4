2500|$|From 1942 {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of rubber so handlebar grips and foot pegs were replaced by canvas covered metal items and production was standardised, with only minor modifications {{until the end of}} World War II. [...] By early 1942 a new large rear carrier was fitted to hold universal WD steel pannier-frames and bags. This meant repositioning the long prop stand to forward of the nearside rear wheel <b>spindle</b> <b>nut.</b> In 1943 further modifications were made including redesign of the crankcase sump shield and fitting of the Vokes high capacity air cleaner, which was a box shaped canister on top of the fuel tank and was intended to assist operations in dusty environments. [...] In early 1945 a push-button switch was introduced for the headlight and the main lighting switch relocated to a bracket beneath the offside of the saddle.|$|E
50|$|A center cap, or centercap is a {{decorative}} disk on an automobile wheel that covers a central {{portion of the}} wheel. Early center caps for automobiles were small and primarily served the purpose of keeping dirt away from the <b>spindle</b> <b>nut</b> and wheel bearings of vehicles. Center caps are often found on new cars to hide the lug nuts, and/or the bearing. Center caps are a type of hubcap, the other primary type being wheel covers. Some modern center caps are retained to the wheel using spring clips, while others are retained by the wheel lugs or other threaded fasteners.|$|E

50|$|Titanium {{has been}} used {{in an effort to make}} bottom {{brackets}} lighter, but early attempts were not entirely successful. Several manufacturers have built bottom brackets with titanium spindles and alloy cups but their durability was lower than that of steel. Early Campagnolo Super Record titanium spindles (which were hollow) were replaced by a later version that used solid, <b>nutted</b> <b>spindles</b> for improved reliability.|$|R
30|$|Process time of {{all these}} {{workstations}} after improvement is 90, 88, 89, 88 and 89 Â s. Thus, workstation 28 becomes bottleneck station again. To reduce this time further, it is proposed to use six <b>spindle</b> <b>nut</b> runner and also to automate tyre loading process. This will need additional investment and approval. As of now process reached to saturation level, additional investment may not prove to be competitive in the market because as investment increases, cost of the product also increases. There can be tradeoff {{between the number of}} vehicles produced and additional investment cost. Therefore, present state can be considered as an optimal solution for the said plant.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an articulated arm robot-type device for handling a payload, comprising a robot arm (R), which {{is attached to}} a base (1) that can be rotated about a first axis (A 1), and at least two arm elements (2, 3), which are arranged one behind the other {{in the form of a}} kinematic chain and a first arm element (2) of which is mounted on the base (1) in a pivotal manner about a second axis (A 2) that is oriented orthogonally relative to the first axis and a second arm element (3) of which is attached to the first arm element (1) in a pivotal manner about a third axis (A 3) that is oriented parallel to the second axis (A 2). The device also comprises a central hand (4) which is attached to the end of the kinematic chain. A first linear actuator (4) is provided which pivots the first arm element (2) about the second axis (A 2) and which is operatively connected to the base (1) and to the first arm element (2) via a first coupling transmission (K 1), and a second linear actuator (5) is provided which pivots the second arm element (3) about the third axis (A 3) and which is operatively connected to the base (1), the first arm element (2), and the second arm element (3) via a second coupling transmission (K 2). The first and the second linear actuator (4, 5) are each designed in the form of a spindle drive, each spindle drive providing a motor-driven <b>spindle</b> <b>nut</b> unit (41, 51) which is engaged with a spindle (42, 52) in the form of a threaded rod, wherein the threaded rod is mounted in a pivotal manner about a pivot axis (SA 4, SA 5) which is oriented parallel to the second axis (A 2). The invention is characterized in that the first coupling transmission (K 1) is operatively connected to the motor-driven <b>spindle</b> <b>nut</b> unit (41) of the first linear actuator (4) in a pivotal manner via a first universal joint (4 K), and the second coupling transmission (K 2) is operatively connected to the motor-driven <b>spindle</b> <b>nut</b> (51) of the second linear actuator (5) in a pivotal manner via a second universal joint (5 K); the first and the second universal joint (4 K, 5 K) each has a pivot axis which is oriented parallel to the second axis (A 2) and a pivot axis which is oriented orthogonally to the second axis (A 2); the second coupling transmission (K 2) has a first coupling means (8) and a second coupling means (9), each of which transmits pulling and pushing forces; the first coupling means (8) is a ternary transmission element in the form of a rigid triangular structure, the first coupling means (8) being mounted on each corner of the triangular structure about a pivotal axis such that the coupling means (8) is connected to the <b>spindle</b> <b>nut</b> unit (51) in a pivotal manner about a first pivot axis, which is a pivot axis of the second universal joint (5 K), to the first arm element (2) in a pivotal manner about a second pivot axis (SA 51), and to the second coupling means (9) in a pivotal manner about a third pivot axis (SA 53); and the second coupling means (9) is designed in the form of a rigid connecting brace, one end of which is connected to the first coupling means (8) in a pivotal manner about the third pivot axis (SA 53) and the other end of which is connected to the second arm element (3) in a pivotal manner about a pivot axis (SA 52) ...|$|E
40|$|World {{industries}} in Indonesia {{now starting to}} grow mainly a cottage industry (Home industry was). One is the industrial processing of nuts (Anacardium occidentale). The main result is the seed (nut) nut; worlds oil (Cashew Nut Shell Liquid = CNSL) Cashew Liquid Skin (CKBM) {{as well as the}} cashew fruit flesh. Both of the foregoing results obtained from the <b>spindle</b> <b>nut</b> which is the original fruit. Cashew (Cashew kernel) can be consumed as a snack / snack) as well as raw materials in the food industry, which currently has a high selling value. Market demand for both export and domestic very high, but all was not balanced with high production. All because until now stripping cashews still manually, by means of even the traditional manner (Agriculture Information Sheet (liptan) in February 1996). Has been designed machine skinner cashew capacity 54 kg / hour. In this thesis the results of the calculation will be described skinner machine cashew capacity 54 kg / h to get the design and drawing machine. Calculation 913. 2 N/m 2 be produced get the press that occurred on the shaft shredder and gained 2 hp to power the motor. In this design available 180 m / s using a round shaft with pully ratio calculation and obtained 7457. 5 kg. cm total load that occurs on the shaft shredder...|$|E
