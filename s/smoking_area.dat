25|$|The {{problem of}} smoking {{at home is}} {{particularly}} difficult for women in many cultures (especially Arab cultures), where {{it may not be}} acceptable for a woman to ask her husband not to smoke at home or in the presence of her children. Studies have shown that pollution levels for smoking areas indoors are higher than levels found on busy roadways, in closed motor garages, and during fire storms. Furthermore, smoke can spread from one room to another, even if doors to the <b>smoking</b> <b>area</b> are closed.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{original}} attractions are outside {{the gates of the}} current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee <b>smoking</b> <b>area.</b> Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of low bridges on {{almost all of}} the city routes implemented by 1927 prevented the use of double-deckers, and so attention turned to 6-wheeled single-deckers to meet the needs for extra capacity in rush hour. An batch of six such vehicles were bought from Karrier Motors, bodied by Hall, Lewis and Co. Designated the Type WL6/1, the chassis was the mandated maximum 30' length, but specially built with a longer 19' wheelbase to meet the requirement for comfortably seating 39. A 61-80hp six-cylinder engine powered single tyres on both rear axle, with air pressure braking applying on all four driving wheels. These were half-cab buses, with the driver sitting in his own compartment to the front, beside the engine. The two doors were automatically controlled by the driver. A <b>smoking</b> <b>area</b> was still in use - achieved by a division in the body, with 17 smokers sitting in the rear section. The interior featured bucket seats, upholstered in green leather, with generous leg room. Comparative trials of the six-wheelers with the shorter single-deckers on the East Road had shown that, based on a working life of 8 years, the increased revenues generated by the larger buses offset the increased capital, licensing and petrol costs. This led to eight more being ordered.|$|E
500|$|As {{with each}} series since Big Brother 2002, the {{programme}} was filmed at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. A total of 27 editing suites, manned by over 300 members of staff, were {{situated in the}} [...] "George Lucas Stage" [...] to produce the programme. In the 18 May issue of Star magazine, aerial photographs of the House were published, showing the garden under construction. Official pictures of the House interior were released by Channel 4 on 1 June, showing the entrance stairway, living room and garden. The entrance stairway had images of insects on its walls whilst the garden and living room had a science fiction theme; the former included a bus stop as the designated <b>smoking</b> <b>area.</b> On 3 June, Metro published {{an image of the}} Diary Room, which has a multicoloured chair and wall pattern. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, a sitting room with red sofas, a wood panelled kitched with purple, black and white fittings and a bedroom with splats of paint covering the walls. The house contained 44 cameras, 75 two-way mirrors and 57 fixed microphones, as well as individual microphones for each housemate.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Animal {{studies have}} shown that when {{nicotine}} is administered in the presence of other animals (as compared with alone), it is more rewarding. As a human analogue to these studies, rewards associated with designated <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> on university campuses were examined, since these areas promote using nicotine in the presence of others. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 118 (Sample 1, collected November 2011) and 94 (Sample 2, collected April 2012) student smokers at a midwestern university. METHOD: Data were collected via an Internet survey. RESULTS: Social interaction while smoking on campus (as compared with smoking alone) significantly increased the perceived reward of smoking, looking forward to spending time in the campus <b>smoking</b> <b>areas,</b> and how many times the campus <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> were visited. CONCLUSIONS: Although designated <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> may protect nonsmoking students from the dangers of secondhand smoke, these areas may increase the rewards associated with nicotine for the smokers who use them...|$|R

2500|$|On 4 June 2008, {{only one}} day before {{the launch of the}} series, Channel 4 {{released}} images of the luxury bedroom {{and for the first time}} before the launch show in the programme's history, the Diary Room. The luxury bedroom was accessed via the garden and contains eight double beds with an oval wardrobe built into the back. The Diary Room was in between the two sets of stairs by which housemates entered and exited the House (they join together at the top). This meant that the housemates had to exit the House through the main doorway to enter the Diary Room; however, the Diary Room button that the housemates used to notify Big Brother of their intent to go to the Diary Room was located next to the main door inside the House. Outside the bathroom were tokens, which housemates bought from the shopping list and gave to Big Brother if they wanted to use hot water or get rewards. The tokens were not returned afterwards. When the house was split into Heaven and Hell, the garden had to be modified, with a new outside bathroom in [...] "hell" [...] and the seating area in heaven was located as the <b>smoking</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

40|$|Office {{buildings}} <b>Smoking</b> <b>areas</b> Field monitoring {{was conducted}} in office buildings in Seattle and Dallas to assess the effectiveness of various workplace smoking configurations in con-trolling non-smokers exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Simul-taneous measurements of vapour-phase and particle-phase tracers of ETS were conducted in adjacent <b>smoking</b> and non-smoking <b>areas.</b> Pressure rela-tionships between <b>smoking</b> and non-smoking <b>areas</b> were determined. The Seattle portion of the study focused on the direct infiltration of ETS from <b>smoking</b> to non-smoking <b>areas,</b> as minimal recirculation of return air was occurring. Negative pressurisation of <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> eliminated the direct migration of ETS. Tracers of ETS exposure were not detected in non-smoking areas adjacent to negatively pressurised smoking lounges. In the Dallas study buildings, the impact of recirculation of ETS through the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems was assessed. Vapour-phase ETS constituents were recirculated into non-smoking areas at diluted concentrations. However, elevated particle-phase constituents were not found in non-smoking areas. The overall results indicate that non-smokers exposure to ETS can be effec-tively reduced in the office workplace without regulations or policies that require either direct exhaust of air from <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> to the outdoors by dedicated ventilation systems or total prohibition of smoking within build-ings...|$|R

40|$|From November to December 2006 {{air quality}} was {{assessed}} in 20 outdoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> (OSA) attached to Capital Regional District (CRD) area bars and restaurants. The <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> ranged {{in the degree}} to which they were enclosed, with some areas being fully enclosed and some being substantially open to the outdoors. The concentration of fine particle air pollution, PM 2. 5, was measured with a TSI SidePak AM 510 Personal Aerosol Monitor. PM 2. 5 is particulate matter in the air smaller than 2. 5 microns in diameter. Particles of this size are released in significant amounts from burning cigarettes, are easily inhaled deep into the lungs, and cause a variety of adverse health effects including cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and death. Key findings of the study include: The average level of fine particle air pollution in outdoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> was 16 times higher than outdoor background levels and more than 3 times higher than indoor air in smokefree hospitality venues. The average fine particle air pollution exposure in outdoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> was 96 μg/m 3, which is similar to indoor levels in restaurants and other hospitality venues where smoking is permitted. 94 % of fine particle pollution exposure in the OSA’s was attributed to tobacco smoke. Peak 30 -second PM 2. 5 exposures in the outdoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> were 268 μg/m 3, almost 3 times higher than the average PM 2. 5 exposure. The average PM 2. 5 concentration was significantly correlated with the average number of burning cigarettes during the sampling (Spearman’s rho= 0. 68, p<. 01) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: We aimed to: (i) assess {{compliance}} {{with a new}} smokefree law {{in a range of}} hospitality settings; and (ii) {{to assess the impact of}} the new law by measuring air quality and making comparisons with air quality in outdoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> and with international data from hospitality settings. Methods: We included 34 pubs, restaurants and bars, 10 transportation settings, nine other indoor settings, six outdoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> of bars and restaurants, and six other outdoor settings. These were selected using a mix of random, convenience and purposeful sampling. The number of lit cigarettes among occupants at defined time points in each venue was observed and a portable real-time aerosol monitor was used to measure fine particulate levels (PM 2. 5). Results: No smoking was observed during the data collection periods among over 3785 people present in the indoor venues, nor in any of the transportation settings. The levels of fine particulates were relatively low inside the bars, pubs and restaurants in the urban and rural settings (mean 30 -minute level = 16 μg/m 3 for 34 venues; range of mean levels for each category: 13 μg/m 3 to 22 μg/m 3). The results for other smokefree indoor settings (shops, offices etc) and for smokefree transportation settings (eg, buses, trains, etc) were even lower. However, some "outdoor" <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> attached to bars/restaurants had high levels of fine particulates, especially those that were partly enclosed (eg, up to a 30 -minute mean value of 182 μg/m 3 and a peak of maximum value of 284 μg/m 3). The latter are far above WHO guideline levels for 24 -hour exposure (ie, 25 μg/m 3). Conclusion: There was very high {{compliance with}} the new national smokefree law and this was also reflected by the relatively good indoor air quality in hospitality settings (compared to the "outdoor" <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> and the comparable settings in countries that permit indoor smoking). Nevertheless, adopting enhanced regulations (as used in various US and Canadian jurisdictions) may be needed to address hazardous air quality in relatively enclosed "outdoor" <b>smoking</b> <b>areas.</b> </p...|$|R
