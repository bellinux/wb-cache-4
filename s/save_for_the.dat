The look was inspired from the original uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2007, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bold silver border that pays homage to Colorado's silver mining industry.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{sometimes}} {{appear to}} age under great stress. Círdan {{appeared to be}} aged himself, since he is described as looking old, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stars in his eyes; {{this may be due}} to all the sorrows he had seen and lived through since the First Age. Also, the people of Gwindor of Nargothrond had trouble recognizing him after his time as a prisoner of Morgoth.|$|E

5|$|The British {{followed}} the main raids and {{were aware of}} all the approaching aircraft, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> low-altitude 9 Staffel. The radar station near Dover began reporting a build-up over the Pas-de-Calais area. This activity increased until 12:45 when six separate concentrations were reported.

5|$|Banks {{made what}} he {{believed}} to be three of the best saves {{of his career in}} a Stoke shirt. In the first instance he saved and caught a powerful and well-placed header from Manchester City's Wyn Davies from just eight yards out; in the second case he saved a Francis Lee header at Maine Road; and he made his third great <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club by catching a volley from Tottenham Hotspur's Alan Gilzean that had been hit from just six yards out at White Hart Lane.|$|E

50|$|Jiménez was {{acquired}} by the 2000 season and became a staple in the Rockies bullpen, transitioning from starter to closer. From 2000-2003 he collected 102 <b>saves</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Rockies, becoming the all-time saves leader in the Rockies franchise. He set a franchise record 41 saves in 2002, while having an ERA of 3.56 despite having a record of 2-10. The following season he swung back into a starter, making 7 starts and 20 <b>saves</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Rockies, but ballooned his ERA to 5.22 and again having a record of 2-10.|$|R

The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.|$|E
5|$|Records of the {{bramble shark}} are fairly rare and {{originate}} from widely scattered locations in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eastern Pacific Ocean.

In the western Atlantic, this species is represented by a handful of specimens from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tobago, Brazil, and Argentina. In the Indo-Pacific, it is known from Oman, India, southern Japan, southern Australia, New Zealand, and possibly Kiribati.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Cleeve became Crown property, it was leased to Anthony Busterd for 21years. In 1538, the {{freehold}} of {{the site}} was granted to Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex. The church was demolished, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> south wall which bounded the cloister, {{and the rest of}} the abbey converted into a mansion suitable for a gentleman. By the early seventeenth century, however, Cleeve had turned into a farm. The dormitory was now a large barn, the cloister was the farmyard {{and the rest of the}} buildings were used for agricultural purposes and a farm house. A red sandstone barn was built which abuts the south-west corner of the abbey.|$|E
5|$|Subordinate to the MVM {{were all}} the diocesan comitatus commanders in the West: Gaul, Britannia, Illyricum (West), Africa, Tingitania and Hispania. In {{contrast}} to their eastern counterparts, who all held magister militum rank, the commanders of the Western regional comitatus were all of the lower comes rei militaris ("military count") rank, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> magister equitum per Gallias. This was presumably because all but the Gaul comitatus were smaller than the 20–30,000 typically commanded by a magister militum.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, revisionist {{authors would}} {{formulate}} accusations against Moreno, depicting {{him as a}} British agent and a man of mere theoretical European ideas without a strong relation with the South American context. Saavedra is depicted instead as a popular caudillo, a predecessor of José de San Martín and Juan Manuel de Rosas. This perspective did not acknowledge that the wealthy citizens were aligned with Saavedra against Moreno, that Saavedra himself was wealthy and aristocratic, and that the 1811 revolution made no requests of a social nature, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> removal of Morenist forces from the Junta.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} NY418 {{date back to}} the 19th century when Thurman Station and Warrensburg were first {{connected}} by way of a road. This highway was reconstructed by the state of New York during the early 1910s and added to the state highway system in 1915. It was designated as NY418 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The highway has remained mainly unchanged since, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> replacement of its bridges over the Schroon and the Hudson Rivers in the 1930s and 1940s, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} aircraft, registered N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight {{under the command}} of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak. The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.|$|E
5|$|With the VT Commodore of 1997, Holden {{looked again}} to Opel in Germany for a donor platform. The {{proposal}} {{was to take}} the Opel Omega B and broaden the vehicle's width and mechanical setup for local conditions. In the early days, Holden considered adopting the Omega as is, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> engines and transmissions, and even investigated reskinning the existing VR/VS architecture. Later on, the VT bodywork spawned a new generation of Statesman and Caprice (again based on the long-wheelbase wagons), and even went as far as resurrecting the iconic Monaro coupé of the 1960s and 1970s via a prototype presented at the 1998 Sydney Motor Show.|$|E

5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen {{becoming}} the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> southerly Dorne.

5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats <b>save</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
