40|$|Inadequate Reynolds number {{similarity}} in testing of scaled models affects {{the quality of}} aerodynamic data from wind tunnels. This is due to scale effects of boundary-layer shock wave interaction {{which is likely to}} be severe at transonic speeds. The idea of operation of wind tunnels using test gas cooled to cryogenic temperatures has yielded a quantrum jump in the ability to realize full scale Reynolds number flow {{similarity in}} small transonic tunnels. In such tunnels, the basic flow control problem consists of obtaining and maintaining the desired test section flow parameters. Mach number, Reynolds number, and dynamic pressure are the three flow parameters that are usually required to be kept constant during the period of model aerodynamic data acquisition. The series of activity involved in modeling, control law development, mechanization of the control laws on a microcomputer, and the performance of a globally stable automatic control system for the 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (TCT) are discussed. A lumped multi-variable nonlinear dynamic model of the cryogenic tunnel, generation of a set of linear control laws for small perturbation, and nonlinear control strategy for large <b>set</b> <b>point</b> changes including tunnel trajectory control are described. The details of mechanization of the control laws on a 16 bit microcomputer system, the software features, operator interface, the display and safety are discussed. The controller is shown to provide globally stable and reliable temperature control to + or - 0. 2 K, pressure to + or - 0. 07 psi and Mach number to + or - 0. 002 of the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> value. This performance is obtained both during large <b>set</b> <b>point</b> <b>commands</b> as for a tunnel cooldown, and during aerodynamic data acquisition with intrusive activity like geometrical changes in the test section such as angle of attack changes, drag rake movements, wall adaptation and sidewall boundary-layer removal. Feasibility of the use of an automatic Reynolds number control mode with fixed Mach number control is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) {{program will}} develop a flight 13 kW Hall {{thruster}} propulsion system based on NASA's HERMeS thruster. The AEPS system includes the Hall Thruster, the Power Processing Unit (PPU) and the Xenon Flow Controller (XFC). These three primary components must operate together {{to ensure that the}} system generates the required combinations of thrust and specific impulse at the required system efficiencies for the desired system lifetime. At the highest level, the AEPS system will be integrated into the spacecraft and will receive power, propellant, and commands from the spacecraft. Power and propellant flow rates will be determined by the throttle <b>set</b> <b>points</b> <b>commanded</b> by the spacecraft. Within the system, the major control loop is between the mass flow rate and thruster current, with time-dependencies required to handle all expected transients, and additional, much slower interactions between the thruster and cathode temperatures, flow controller and PPU. The internal system interactions generally occur on shorter timescales than the spacecraft interactions, though certain failure modes may require rapid responses from the spacecraft. The AEPS system performance model is designed to account for all these interactions in a way that allows evaluation of the sensitivity of the system to expected changes over the planned mission as well as to assess the impacts of normal component and assembly variability during the production phase of the program. This effort describes the plan for the system performance model development, correlation to NASA test data, and how the model will be used to evaluate the critical internal and external interactions. The results will ensure the component requirements do not unnecessarily drive the system cost or overly constrain the development program. Finally, the model will be available to quickly troubleshoot any future unforeseen development challenges...|$|R

50|$|The HIV <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is the viral load of {{a person}} {{infected}} with HIV, which stabilizes {{after a period of}} acute HIV infection.

5000|$|Brickman and Campbell {{originally}} {{implied that}} everyone {{returns to the}} same neutral <b>set</b> <b>point</b> after a significantly emotional life event. In the literature review, [...] "Beyond the Hedonic Treadmill, Revising the Adaptation Theory of Well-Being" [...] (2006), Diener, Lucas, and Scollon concluded {{that people are not}} hedonically neutral, and that individuals have different <b>set</b> <b>points</b> which are at least partially heritable. They also concluded that individuals may have more than one happiness <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> such as a life satisfaction <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and a subjective well being <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> and that because of this, one's level of happiness is not just one given <b>set</b> <b>point</b> but can vary within a given range. Diener and colleagues point to longitudinal and cross-sectional research to argue that happiness <b>set</b> <b>point</b> can change, and lastly that individuals vary in the rate and extent of adaptation they exhibit to change in circumstance.|$|R

50|$|The book {{features}} short anecdotes from {{followers of}} the diet who had heard of it through Roberts' blog or The New York Times. Roberts' diet {{is based on the}} fundamental principle of a <b>set</b> <b>point</b> - the weight which, according to Roberts, a person's brain strives to maintain. When actual weight is below the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite increases; when actual weight is above the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite decreases. Furthermore, eating certain foods can raise or lower the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Foods that have a strong flavor-calorie relationship (such as fast food or donuts) raise the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> whereas bland foods which are slowly digested (like extra light olive oil or fructose mixed with water) lower the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Roberts states that the diet is based upon connecting two unconnected fields: weight control and associative learning. Because of this, the research behind the diet is from multiple fields, ranging from Pavlovian psychology to physiology to rat psychology.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, the {{longitudinal}} {{study conducted by}} Fujita and Diener (2005) described the life satisfaction <b>set</b> <b>point</b> as a [...] "soft baseline". This means that for most people, this baseline is similar to their happiness baseline. Typically, life satisfaction will hover around a <b>set</b> <b>point</b> {{for the majority of}} their lives and not change dramatically. However, for {{about a quarter of the}} population this <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is not stable, and does indeed move in response to a major life event.Other longitudinal data has shown that subjective well being <b>set</b> <b>points</b> do change over time, and that adaptation is not necessarily inevitable. In his archival data analysis, Lucas found evidence that it is possible for someone's subjective well-being <b>set</b> <b>point</b> to change drastically, such as in the case of individuals who acquire a severe, long term disability. [...] However, as Diener, Lucas, and Scollon point out, the amount of fluctuation a person experiences around their <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is largely dependent on the individual's ability to adapt.|$|R

40|$|Using an {{improved}} valve design developed under an SBIR contract with Stennis Space Center, Marotta Scientific's PRV 95 provides stability {{over the entire}} operational range, from fully closed to fully open. The valve employs a concept known as upstream control for valve positioning, making it more dependable with excellent repeatability and minimal lag time. The PRV 95 design is unique {{in its ability to}} maintain a seal near the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> of the relief limit. Typically, relief valves seal tightly up to 90 percent <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and then reseat when pressure is reduced to 85 percent of <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> This new technology maintains seal integrity until 98 percent of <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and will reseat at 95 to 97 percent of <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> This allows the operator to protect a system without exceeding its limits...|$|R
5000|$|The {{happiness}} <b>set</b> <b>point</b> idea is {{that most}} people return to an average level of happiness - or a <b>set</b> <b>point</b> - after temporary highs and lows in emotionality. People whose <b>set</b> <b>points</b> lean toward positive emotionality tend to be cheerful {{most of the time}} and those whose <b>set</b> <b>points</b> tend to be more negative emotionality tend to gravitate toward pessimism and anxiety. Lykken found that we can influence our level of well-being by creating environments more conductive to feelings of happiness and by working with our genetic makeup. A reason why subjective well being is for the most part stable is because of the great influence genetics have. Although the events of life have some effect on subjective well being, the general population returns to their <b>set</b> <b>point</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Roberts {{argued that}} weight is {{controlled}} by maintaining body fat at a certain amount, {{referred to as a}} [...] "set point." [...] When weight is above the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite decreases, and it takes less food to feel full. When weight is below the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite increases, and it takes more food to feel full. He further stated that eating strongly flavored foods (like soda or donuts) can raise the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> whereas flavorless foods (like sugar water, canola oil, extra light olive oil) can lower the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> These flavorless foods must be consumed in a [...] "flavorless window," [...] at least one hour after and one hour before consuming flavors.

50|$|The {{concept of}} the {{happiness}} <b>set</b> <b>point</b> can be applied in clinical psychology to help patients return to their hedonic <b>set</b> <b>point</b> when negative events happen.

When a change occurs, clinical psychologists work with patients {{to recover from the}} depressive spell and return to their hedonic <b>set</b> <b>point</b> more quickly. Because acts of kindness often promote long-term well-being, one treatment method is to provide patients with different altruistic activities that can help a person raise his or her hedonic <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> This can in turn be helpful in reducing reckless habits in the pursuit of well-being. Further, helping patients understand that long-term happiness is relatively stable throughout one's life can help to ease anxiety surrounding impactful events.|$|R

40|$|<b>Set</b> <b>point</b> viral load in HIV {{patients}} ranges {{over several}} {{orders of magnitude}} and is a key determinant of disease progression in HIV. A number of recent studies have reported high heritability of <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral load implying that viral genetic factors contribute substantially to the overall variation in viral load. The high heritability is surprising given the diversity of host factors associated with controlling viral infection. Here we develop an analytical model that describes the temporal changes {{of the distribution of}} <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral load as a function of heri-tability.
