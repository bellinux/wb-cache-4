40|$|A B ST RA C T: Measurement of clay {{particle}} size invariably presents {{data in the}} form of equivalent spherical diameters. For asymmetric particles the equivalent <b>spherical</b> <b>diameter</b> varies with the method of measurement. Based upon an understanding of the theoretical concepts involved, a method has been proposed whereby comparison of data on a given sample from two different techniques can reveal information about he minor dimension ofthe particle. Theoretical expressions are given for the equivalent <b>spherical</b> <b>diameter</b> of cylindrically s mmetric rods and discs from which it is shown that some of the existing measurement methods are more dependent upon size than the degree of non-sphericity whilst for others the reverse is true. It is shown how for rods and discs one can obtain information on both an average axial ratio and the distribution of this parameter for heterogeneous samples. Illustrated ata are given for three kaolin samples. Far from showing inconsistency between the variable spherical diameters yielded by different instruments, the data produce compatible size and thickness parameters which match those observed in supplementary, unreported electron microscope experiments.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A {{critical}} issue with nanomaterials is the {{clear understanding of}} their potential toxicity. We evaluated the toxic effect of 24 nanoparticles of similar equivalent <b>spherical</b> <b>diameter</b> and various elemental compositions on 2 human pulmonary cell lines: A 549 and THP- 1. A secondary aim was to elaborate a generic experimental set-up {{that would allow the}} rapid screening of cytotoxic effect of nanoparticles. We therefore compared 2 cytotoxicity assays (MTT and Neutral Red) and analyzed 2 time points (3 and 24 hours) for each cell type and nanoparticle. When possible, TC 50 (Toxic Concentration 50 i. e. nanoparticle concentration inducing 50 % cell mortality) was calculated. RESULTS: The use of MTT assay on THP- 1 cells exposed for 24 hours appears to be the most sensitive experimental design to assess the cytotoxic effect of one nanoparticle. With this experimental set-up, Copper- and Zinc-based nanoparticles appear to be the most toxic. Titania, Alumina, Ceria and Zirconia-based nanoparticles show moderate toxicity, and no toxicity was observed for Tungsten Carbide. No correlation between cytotoxicity and equivalent <b>spherical</b> <b>diameter</b> or specific surface area was found. CONCLUSION: Our study clearly highlights the difference of sensitivity between cell types and cytotoxicity assays that has to be carefully taken into account when assessing nanoparticles toxicity...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} experiments {{aimed to}} study the supercooling and cold-energy storage characteristics of nanofluids and water-based nano-media in ball-packed porous structures (BPS). Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) measuring 20 nm and 80 nm were used as additives and sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (SDBS) was used as anionic surfactant. The experiments used different concentrations of nanofluid, distilled with BPS of different <b>spherical</b> <b>diameter</b> and different concentrations of nano-media, and were conducted 20 times. Experimental results of supercooling were analysed by statistical methods. Results show that the average and peak supercooling degrees of nanofluids and nano-media in BPS are {{lower than those of}} distilled water. For the distilled water in BPS, the supercooling degree decreases on the whole with the decrease of the ball diameter. With the same <b>spherical</b> <b>diameter</b> (8 mm) of BPS, the supercooling degree of TiO 2 NPs measuring 20 nm is lower than the supercooling degree of distilled water in BPS. Step-cooling experiments of different concentrations of nanofluids and nano-media in BPS were also conducted. Results showed that phase transition time is reduced {{because of the presence of}} TiO 2 NPs. The BPS substrate and the NPs enhance the heat transfer. Distilled water with a porous solid base and nanoparticles means the amount of cold-energy storage increases and the supercooling degree and the total time are greatly reduced.
