50|$|High winds, salt spray, {{and sandy}} soil provide a harsh {{environment}} for plant life. Maritime forests {{are composed of}} deciduous, coniferous, and broadleaf evergreens. Some of the trees that occupy maritime forests include the southern sugar maple, <b>swamp</b> dogwood, mockernut <b>hickory,</b> white ash, and the white poplar.Some animals that live in these forests are: foxes, deer, rabbits, tree frogs, raccoons, toads, painted buntings, and many others.|$|R

These included the Hickory Ridge Colliery, the Luke Fiddler Colliery, the <b>Hickory</b> <b>Swamp</b> Washery, the Natalie Colliery, and the Colbert Colliery. The first three were owned by the Susquehanna Coal Company, the fourth was owned by the Colonial Collieries Company, and the fifth was owned by the Shipman Coal Company.|$|R

50|$|Carya cordiformis, the {{bitternut}} hickory, {{also called}} bitternut or <b>swamp</b> <b>hickory,</b> {{is a large}} pecan hickory with commercial stands located mostly north of the other pecan hickories. Bitternut hickory is cut and sold in mixture with the true hickories. It is the shortest-lived of the hickories, living to about 200 years.|$|E
50|$|Swamp tupelo, {{along with}} water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), {{dominate}} mixed-hardwood swamp forests. These grow aside water-adapted oaks that include water oak (Quercus nigra), swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda), willow oak (Quercus phellos), and overcup oak (Quercus lyrata). <b>Swamp</b> <b>hickory</b> (Carya glabra) and water hickory (Carya aquatica) {{are also found}} here. Pawpaw (Asimina triloba) grows in the understory.|$|E
50|$|Carya myristiciformis, the nutmeg hickory, of the Juglandaceae or walnut family, {{also called}} <b>swamp</b> <b>hickory</b> or bitter water hickory, is found as small, {{possibly}} relict populations across the Southern United States and in northern Mexico on rich moist soils of higher bottom lands and stream banks. Little {{is known of}} {{the growth rate of}} nutmeg hickory. Logs and lumber are sold mixed with other hickories. The nuts are an oil-rich food for wildlife.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHurricane {{wind and}} {{saltwater}} surge {{may have different}} influences on the subsequent composition of forests. During Hurricane Sandy, while damaging winds were highest near landfall in New Jersey, inundation occurred along the entire eastern seaboard from Georgia to Maine. In this study, a comparison of damage from salinity intrusion vs. wind/surge was recorded in swamps of the Delmarva Peninsula along the Pocomoke (MD) and Nanticoke (DE) Rivers, south of the most intense wind damage. Hickory Point Cypress <b>Swamp</b> (<b>Hickory)</b> was closest to the Chesapeake Bay {{and may have been}} subjected to a salinity surge as evidenced by elevated salinity levels at a gage upstream of this swamp (storm salinity= 13. 1 ppt at Nassawango Creek, Snow Hill, Maryland). After Hurricane Sandy, 8 % of the standing trees died at Hickory including Acer rubrum, Amelanchier laevis, Ilex spp., and Taxodium distichum. In certain plots of Hickory, up to 25 % of the standing trees were dead, corresponding with high soil salinity. The most important variables related to structural tree damage were soil salinity and proximity to the Atlantic coast as based on Stepwise Regression and NMDS procedures. Wind damage was mostly restricted to broken branches although tipped-up trees were found at Hickory, Whiton and Porter (species: Liquidamabar styraciflua, Pinus taeda, Populus deltoides, Quercus pagoda and Ilex spp.). These trees fell mostly in an east or east-southeast direction (88 – 107 °) in keeping with the wind direction of Hurricane Sandy on the Delmarva Peninsula. Coastal restoration and management can be informed by the specific differences in hurricane damage to vegetation by salt vs. wind...|$|E
