5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E

25|$|Jim Moray, an English folk singer, {{released}} the album 'Upcetera' in September 2016. It contains the track 'Sounds of Earth' {{in which he}} interweaves {{the stories of the}} production of the Golden Record and the romance between Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. It refers to the recording of an EEG of Druyan as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Sagan as the sound of someone falling in love.|$|E
25|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{herself as}} a true pioneer in the industry. Her {{correspondence}} with Dunlap also revealed her intent {{to become one of}} the first female filmmakers in the U.S. Owen funded the film solely from her earnings in the public speaker circuit. In her letters, Owen discussed the support she gained from the General Federation of Women’s Clubs, and their contribution to help secure a distribution deal with the Society for Visual Education.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact nature}} of her {{relationship}} with her royal sister-in-law is not clear either, and there is no evidence as to what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her other sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn, who had been at court with Jane since they were both teenagers. It is generally assumed that Jane was not overly fond of Anne, allegedly because of Jane's jealousy of her. Regardless, Jane plotted with Anne to banish one of the King's young unnamed mistresses from court in 1534. When the King discovered her involvement, Lady Rochford was herself exiled for a few months.|$|E

25|$|Later in 2012, Hathaway played sly, morally {{ambiguous}} cat burglar Selina Kyle in The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher Nolan's final installment in the Batman trilogy. Hathaway auditioned {{not knowing}} what role she was being considered for, admitting that she had one character in mind, but only learned that the role was Selina Kyle after talking with Christopher Nolan for an hour. She described the role as being the most physically demanding she had ever played, and confessed that while <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> herself as being fit she had to redouble her efforts in the gym {{to keep up with}} the demands of the role. Hathaway trained extensively in martial arts for the role, and looked to Hedy Lamarr—who was the inspiration for the Catwoman character—in developing her performance. The Dark Knight Rises received a positive critical response and grossed over $1.085 billion worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2012. Hathaway also won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Selina Kyle.|$|E

500|$|Miranda Keyes was {{voiced by}} Julie Benz in Halo 2, but Bungie recast the role for Halo 3, ostensibly {{because they wanted}} someone with an accent. Despite not {{being a part of}} Halo 3, Benz said that she loved voiceover work and that it was pure chance she had become the voice of Keyes in the first place. When IGN asked Benz what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her character, she {{admitted}} she hadn't played Halo 2, even though Bungie had sent her [...] "like four copies of the game."

[...] Meldal-Johnsen chose the album Reign in Blood, and after listening to it, Amos agreed to make a cover version of [...] "Raining Blood". In an interview, she stated that upon first hearing the song, the imagery <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> was [...] "this beautiful vulva ... raining blood over this male abusive force".|$|E
500|$|One early promo for 30 Rock portrayed Alec Baldwin mistakenly {{thinking}} {{he would meet}} Sorkin, and when asked on her [...] "Ask Tina" [...] space what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the criticism that 30 Rock received, Fey jokingly replied that {{people who did not}} like it were probably confusing it with Studio 60. However, none of 30 Rocks producers have given Studio 60 any serious criticism, positive or negative. In a November 1, 2006 interview, Fey said she had seen the first two episodes of Studio 60.

For a break during the war, Maria, her sisters and mother sometimes visited the Tsar and Tsarevich Alexei at the war headquarters in Mogilev. During these visits, Maria developed an attraction to Nikolai Dmitrievich Demenkov, an officer of the day at the Tsar's Headquarters.

The single was initially planned to be called [...] "Soy Latinna", but after Inna presented the track to a private group of friends, they wanted her to sing the [...] "Cola Song"—a title they created—ten more times to them, thus resulting in Inna deciding to change the name.|$|E
500|$|Manga artist Natsumi Ando's concept art of Arisa had two earlier {{models of}} Tsubasa with chin-length and shoulder-length hair, respectively. Ando {{initially}} felt {{worried about the}} absence of a potential romantic partner for Tsubasa, as Arisas target audience is girls; however, as the manga progressed, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it as [...] "a selling point." [...] As a result of this, she was able to focus on Tsubasa's emotions towards her twin. Soon after beginning the manga's serialization, Ando created [...] "Tsubasa", a bonus chapter focusing on Arisa's pretending to be her elder sister; she continued to delay its publication, because it seemed inappropriate to have a bonus story with Arisa appear when she was comatose in the main storyline. According to Ando, it made a good chapter with which to conclude the series.|$|E

500|$|A {{professional}} cat burglar, grifter, and femme fatale who {{establishes a}} playful, teasing relationship with Bruce that [...] "takes {{some of the}} somberness away from his character", and pursues a [...] "clean slate" [...] (a computer program rumored {{to be able to}} erase a person's criminal history) when she crosses paths with both Bruce and Batman.

500|$|In 1960, Ronald William Clark {{published}} a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing [...] "this very readable little book" [...] as being [...] "adulatory" [...] in tone, [...] "but hardly {{more so than}} its subject deserves." [...] In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes {{published a}} second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed [...] "a very great liking" [...] for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had [...] "a daemonic energy", with his accomplishments in India being [...] "almost superhuman". Ultimately, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him as being [...] "an epic hero in an anti-heroic age" [...] in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley {{described}} Midas as a [...] "short mythological comic {{drama in}} verse". Her efforts {{to publish it}} as a children's drama suggest that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it as children's literature. At this time, [...] "instructional" [...] literature for children was most often written by women, who were viewed as having superior knowledge regarding the raising of the young. While placing women in a traditional maternal role, this literature also allowed {{them the opportunity to}} participate in the public sphere as authors and directors of morality. Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, had written two such works, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) and Original Stories from Real Life (1788) that she undoubtedly knew. As Purinton writes, [...] "Mary Shelley's seemingly simple plays are complicated by their position with this context of 'instructional' literature at a historical moment when the boundaries of private and public discourse are blurred." ...|$|E
