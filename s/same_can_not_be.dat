6000|$|A remark of {{a similar}} nature may be applied to most of those distinctions among propositions which {{are said to have}} {{reference}} to their modality; as, difference of tense or time; the sun did rise, the sun is rising, the sun will rise. These differences, like that between affirmation and negation, might be glossed over by considering the incident of time as a mere modification of the predicate: thus, The sun is an object having risen, The sun is an object now rising, The sun is an object to rise hereafter. But the simplification would be merely verbal. Past, present, and future, do not constitute so many different kinds of rising; they are designations belonging to the event asserted, to the sun’s rising to-day. They affect, not the predicate, but the applicability of the predicate to the particular subject. That which we affirm to be past, present, or future, is not what the subject signifies, nor what the predicate signifies, but specifically and expressly what the predication signifies; what is expressed only by the proposition as such, and not by either or both of the terms. Therefore the circumstance of time is properly considered as attaching to the copula, which is the sign of predication, and not to the predicate. If the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> said of such modifications as these, Cæsar may be dead; Cæsar is perhaps dead; it is possible that Cæsar is dead; it is only because these fall altogether under another head, being properly assertions not of any thing relating to the fact itself, but of the state of our own mind in regard to it; namely, our absence of disbelief of it. Thus “Cæsar may be dead” means “I am not sure that Cæsar is alive.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract— This paper {{deals with}} the design of {{permanent}} magnet (PM) motors for mechatronic systems requiring an imperative fault-tolerant capability. The PM motors {{are more and more}} used in many applications for their high torque density. However, for critical applications, the motor geometry has to be suitably designed to limit the maximum short–circuit currents and brake torque. In case of short–circuit, the PMs on the rotor induce an e. m. f. on the faulty phases. Thus, even redundant solutions with two motors placed on the <b>same</b> shaft <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> enough when PM motors are used. As a consequence, the PM quantity has to be reduced. In addition, some winding arrangements can be adopted to improve the fault–tolerant capability. Fractional–slot motors yield a high leakage inductance and allow both a physical and magnetic separation among the phases...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding [...] "third" [...] variables, media {{violence}} {{researchers who}} argue for causal effects acknowledge that other variables {{may play a}} role in aggression (Bushman & Anderson, 2001) and that aggression is due to a confluence of variables. These variables are known as [...] "third variables" [...] and if found, would probably be mediator variables (which differ from moderator variables). A mediator variable could 'explain away' media violence effects, whereas a moderator variable cannot. For instance, some scholars contend that trait aggressiveness has been demonstrated to moderate media violence effects (Bushman), although in some studies [...] "trait aggression" [...] does appear to account for any link between media violence exposure and aggression. Other variables have also been found to moderate media violence effects (Bushman & Geen, 1990). Another issue is the way in which experimental studies deal with potential confounding variables. Researchers use random assignment to attempt to neutralize the effects of what commonly are cited as third variables (i.e. gender, trait aggressiveness, preference for violent media). Because experimental designs employ random assignment to conditions, the effect of such attributive variables on experimental results is assumed to be random (not systematic). However, the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> said for correlational studies, and failure to control for such variables in correlational studies limits the interpretation of such studies.

However the photographic object manifests a spatial concept alien to the viewer’s. For example: Taking a photograph of an object form above will always result in an image with that perspective. If on takes this photo-object and places it over the viewer’s head one makes the physical experience of looking up.

In this work, for a given sequence of prescribed estimation accuracy (in sample size), we give an upper bound (in terms of metric entropy) {{on the number of}} regression functions for which the accuracy is achieved.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore, from the {{political}} economy perspective, public policy towards enterprise restructuring in Serbia in the post-Milosevic period, including incentives to decision-makers for such a policy, its achievements, and dynamics. Also, it empirically tests the conventional wisdom in Serbia that economic issues, such as employment and real wages, are dominant factors for voters in deciding whether to vote for pro-reform or anti-reform political parties. Conventional models of voting behavior that stress economic variables find strong support in both theoretical and empirical literature. By regressing election results from 150 municipalities on various economic, social and demographic variables, we distinguish whether and to what extent enterprise restructuring and, more broadly, economic transition, influences voting behavior in Serbia. We find that economic variables are mostly statistically insignificant, but that employment in failed companies did influence voting behavior in 2000 and 2007.
