5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under {{the floor of his}} horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice from beyond the grave and that {{the important thing is that}} it saved Josh Underwood.|$|E
5|$|By 1874, the Louvre Palace had {{achieved}} {{its present form}} of an almost rectangular structure with the Sully Wing to the east containing the Cour Carrée (Square Court) and the oldest parts of the Louvre; and two wings which wrap the Cour Napoléon, the Richelieu Wing {{to the north and}} the Denon Wing, which borders the Seine to the south. In 1983, French President François Mitterrand proposed, as one of his Grands Projets, the Grand Louvre plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry, allowing displays throughout the building. Architect I. M. Pei was awarded the project and proposed a glass pyramid to <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> a new entrance in the main court, the Cour Napoléon. The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988; the pyramid was completed in 1989. The second phase of the Grand Louvre plan, La Pyramide Inversée (The Inverted Pyramid), was completed in 1993. As of 2002, attendance had doubled since completion.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E

25|$|The {{fourteen}} Hooded Men {{were the}} only internees subjected to the full five techniques. However, over the following months, some internees were subjected {{to at least one}} of the five techniques, as well as other interrogation methods. These allegedly included waterboarding, electric shocks, burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> hot electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, whipping the soles of the feet, and psychological abuse such as Russian roulette.|$|E

25|$|Corfe Castle is {{a village}} and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It {{is the site}} of a ruined castle of the same name. The village and castle <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> a gap in the Purbeck Hills on the route between Wareham and Swanage. The village lies in the gap below the castle, and is some eight {{kilometres}} (five miles) south-east of Wareham, and the same distance west of Swanage. Both the current main A351 road Lytchett Minster to Swanage and the Swanage Railway thread their way through the gap and the village.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suggested}} that one method to avoid endangering {{the public would}} be for shooters to <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> setts and shoot badgers near the entrances. However, a report to Defra by The Game Conservancy Trust (2006) indicated that a major problem with shooting near the sett is that wounded badgers are very likely to bolt underground, preventing a second shot to ensure the animal is killed. Under these conditions the first shot must cause the badger to collapse on the spot, limiting the choice of target sites to the spine, neck or head.|$|E
25|$|In the {{alternate}} ending, Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting {{a few people}} in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> at a different spot. Cody goes over there, but is followed by Santa Claus. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into The Hulk. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from The Matrix and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be M. Night Shyamalan.|$|E

25|$|Saving {{the game}} and {{leveling}} a character up can be done at specific locations in the game, albeit in a somewhat unconventional manner. Large red and blue flowers are scattered through the game. The player can save by directing the character to <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> a flower (both red and blue), although saving can also be done when navigating the sub-world screen. Leveling up can only be done via a blue flower, which allows the player to warp back to a church. At the church, he/she can pray to the priest in order to level up, {{as well as to}} upgrade their class. A level up results in an increase in the character's primary attributes such as HP and attack and defense, while a class up results in an increase in the character's deck capacity. The latter can only be done once a certain item Magnus is obtained (one per character per class).|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey just stood there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E
500|$|Mothers with calves {{will gather}} in nursery herds, moving or {{browsing}} together. Mothers {{in such a}} group may sometimes leave their calves with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere. This {{is known as a}} [...] "calving pool". Adult males play almost no role in raising the young, although they appear to have friendly interactions. Calves are at risk of predation, and a mother giraffe will <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> her calf and kick at an approaching predator. Females watching calving pools will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance, although the others will take notice and follow.|$|E

500|$|This {{vision was}} {{included}} in the cinematography for the episode, with one scene having Captain Janeway <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> Chakotay's shoulder much {{in the same way that}} a guardian angel would. The set-up for that particular scene came from a collaboration between McNeill and actress Kate Mulgrew. From that, he developed a series of close-up shots to bring some intimacy to the scene. The montage scene in the episode was created by McNeill, Biller, Jeri Taylor, Bob Ledermen and Wendy Neuss using footage from the episodes [...] "Q Who" [...] in The Next Generation, [...] "" [...] from Voyager, as well as both [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] from [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{oil painting}} measures [...] It shows a muscular, wounded youth surrounded by ten peasants in a humble, single-room dwelling. The peasants wear hand-sewn shirts, rough leggings and leather shoes. They <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> a dirt floor, {{and in the}} background, a collection of eating utensils hang precariously from a makeshift shelf. The youth is cradled {{in the arms of}} a crouching, shaved-headed warrior. The two are surrounded by a pair of heavily armed men on either side of them. Nearby, a light-haired girl quietly grieves. To the right of these figures stands a grief-stricken old man, himself surrounded by a number of figures in folk attire. To the far right, two figures can be seen standing inauspiciously in the shadows. The artist's signature, rendered as Joanowits P., {{can be found at the}} bottom right.|$|E
500|$|On June 1, 1995, Abu-Jamal's {{death warrant}} {{was signed by}} Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Its {{execution}} was suspended while Abu-Jamal pursued state post-conviction review. At the post-conviction review hearings, new witnesses were called. William [...] "Dales" [...] Singletary testified that he saw the shooting and that the gunman was the passenger in Cook's car. Singletary's account contained discrepancies which rendered it [...] "not credible" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the court. William Harmon, a convicted fraudster, testified that Faulkner's murderer fled in a car that pulled up to the crime scene, and could not have been Abu-Jamal. Robert Harkins testified that he had witnessed a man <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> Faulkner as the latter lay wounded on the ground, who shot him point-blank in the face and then [...] "walked {{and sat down on the}} curb".|$|E

500|$|In the 1996–97 season, Wetherall played less {{regularly}} as {{new manager}} George Graham experimented with defensive combinations, though {{by the following}} season he had re-established himself in the starting eleven, sometimes acting as captain, and signed a new five-year contract. On 27 September 1997, he scored in the 1–0 victory over arch-rivals Manchester United when Roy Keane's knee was badly injured {{in the act of}} fouling Alf-Inge Håland, who then accused Keane of feigning injury. Keane later took revenge on Håland during a Manchester derby and said to Håland as he lay on the ground: [...] "And don't ever <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> me again sneering about fake injuries, and tell your pal Wetherall there's some for him as well." [...] Later that season Wetherall was among the Leeds travelling party who escaped unhurt as their aircraft crash-landed after an engine caught fire on takeoff.|$|E
500|$|Development at Gunwharf Quays {{continued}} until 2007 with {{the completion of}} the [...] tall No.1 Gunwharf Quays residential tower (nicknamed 'Lipstick Tower'). The development of the former Brickwoods Brewery site included the construction of a 22-storey tower known as the Admiralty Quarter Tower, the tallest in a complex of mostly low-rise residential buildings. A new 25-storey tower named 'Number One Portsmouth', was made public at the end of October 2008, which has been proposed at a height of , and will stand opposite Portsmouth & Southsea Station. As of August 2009, internal demolition has started on the building that currently occupies the site. A new student accommodation tower, nicknamed 'The Blade', has started construction {{on the site of the}} old Victoria swimming baths, on the edge of Victoria Park. The tower will <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> , and will become Portsmouth's second tallest structure after the Spinnaker Tower.|$|E
500|$|Lusitanos are {{generally}} gray, bay or chestnut, though {{they can be}} of any solid color, including black, dun and palomino. Only bays are bred at the Alter Real stud. They usually stand [...] high, although some <b>stand</b> <b>over</b> [...] [...] Members of the breed have narrow, but well-proportioned, heads with profiles that are slightly convex. The necks are thick and arched, leading to well defined withers, shoulders that are muscular and sloping and a deep, broad chest. The horses have short, strong backs and rounded, sloped croups, leading to a low-set tail. The legs are sturdy and muscled. Lusitanos are known as powerful horses, noted for their intelligence and willing nature. The breed's gaits are agile and elevated, but generally comfortable to ride. The Lusitano differs from the Andalusian through having a more sloped croup, a lower-set tail, and a more convex head profile. The mane and tail are extremely thick in both breeds.|$|E
