5|$|Ballhaus, at Finerman and Frankel's suggestion, {{composed}} as many shots as possible, whether interiors or exteriors, to {{at least}} partially take in busy New York street <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the background, to convey the excitement of working in a glamorous industry in New York. He also used a handheld camera during some of the busier meeting <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> Miranda's office, to better convey the flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover.

The cinéma vérité style used heavily in Cannibal Holocaust was also used before in Climati's first Mondo film, Ultime grida dalla savana, in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions. Another scene, in which a native man is captured, tortured, and murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.|$|E
