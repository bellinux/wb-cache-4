30|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} is proposed, namely local line directional neighborhood pattern (LLDNP) for texture classification, which effectively describes the texture by extracting the <b>sign</b> and <b>magnitude</b> patterns in 12 directions. The <b>sign</b> and <b>magnitude</b> patterns for each direction are computed by comparing the neighborhood pixel values. Further investigations {{on the size of}} the local region for texture analysis confirm that the proposed method performs significantly better in 13 [*]×[*] 13 region. The experiments are conducted by considering the <b>sign</b> and <b>magnitude</b> patterns individually. The results show that by integrating <b>sign</b> and <b>magnitude</b> patterns, higher retrieval rate is achieved in comparison with LLDNP_S and LLDNP_M. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by conducting experiments on Brodatz, Outex, CUReT, UIUC, and Virus databases, and the results endorse that the proposed method achieves higher retrieval rate than that of the other existing methods. Future research is on the way to extend the proposed LLDNP to retrieve images invariant to rotation and scale.|$|R

The <b>sign,</b> <b>magnitude</b> and significance of the effects largely diverge between these measures.

With respect to undereducation, we have no clear results. When years of required education are controlled for, no robust results are found for job satisfaction and mobility. Overeducated workers earn more than adequately educated colleagues, but have similar training opportunities. None of the measures clearly outperforms the alternatives for the explanation of all variables of interest. ...|$|E
