5|$|HIV is {{the cause}} of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a {{retrovirus}} that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E

40|$|MRI and CT {{have become}} the ideal methods for {{assessing}} the complex morphology of the conotruncal region, including the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Detailed information about the embryology and anatomy of the RVOT provides a better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> this region and helps to narrow the differential diagnoses of abnormalities involving this important structure. In this review, {{we focus on the}} role of CT and MRI to evaluate morphology in relation to developmental malformation of the RVOT. A <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> conotruncal anomalies with abnormally positioned great arteries may arise from a perturbation of RVOT formation. Complications after surgery are common, and many patients need follow-up imaging for diagnosis and surgical planning. In this regard, the <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases,</b> differential diagnoses, and postoperative findings are briefly described. With CT and MRI, the relationship of the RVOT to critical structures, such as the coronary arteries, can be revealed. 2. 744 JCR (2013) Q 2, 32 / 122 Radiology, nuclear medicine & medical imagingUE...|$|R
