5|$|<b>Smuts</b> was {{admitted}} to Christ's College, where he elected to study Law.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's time at Cambridge {{had been}} one of {{outstanding}} success; his tutor Professor FW Maitland, himself one of the most eminent legal minds of the time, described <b>Smuts</b> as the most brilliant Law student he had ever taught. With testimonials such as this, in summer 1894 <b>Smuts</b> was able to persuade the Ebden trustees to award him £100 for a further year's study. After a short holiday in Strasbourg, spent studying English conveyancing and German philosophy, <b>Smuts</b> returned to England. For a short time he contemplated moving to the Netherlands to seek a Dutch degree, but by October 1894 he had instead decided to read for the Bar. In December 1894 he passed the Honours Examination of the Inns of Court, passing first in his year. <b>Smuts</b> was called to the Middle Temple and soon received an offer of a fellowship in Law from his old college, Christ's. The possibility of a distinguished legal career in England, whether in practice or in academia, now lay before him. Instead, he rejected both paths; in June 1895, as his Ebden funding came to an end, the homesick <b>Smuts</b> returned to the Cape, determined to make his future there.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for <b>Smuts,</b> yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. <b>Smuts,</b> having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged <b>Smuts</b> to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which <b>Smuts</b> took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should <b>Smuts</b> have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E

50|$|Ustilago esculenta is {{a species}} of fungus in the Ustilaginaceae, a family of <b>smut</b> fungi. It {{is in the same}} genus as the fungi that cause corn <b>smut,</b> loose <b>smut</b> of barley, false loose <b>smut,</b> covered <b>smut</b> of barley, loose <b>smut</b> of oats, and other grass diseases. This species is {{pathogenic}} as well, attacking Manchurian wild rice (Zizania latifolia), also known as Manchurian ricegrass, Asian wild rice, and wateroat. This grass is its only known host.|$|R
40|$|Ways to {{identify}} and treat <b>smut</b> fungi are given here. <b>Smut</b> fungi infect various grasses, either cultivated or found naturally in the wild. In turfgrass, {{one of the most}} common <b>smut</b> diseases is stripe <b>smut</b> caused by Ustilago striiformis. Stripe <b>smut</b> occurs most commonly on Kentucky bluegrass, occasionally on bentgrass and rarely on fine fescues and perennial ryegrass; it has not been reported to occur on zoysia. The widespread use of susceptible Kentucky bluegrass cultivars has contributed to the common occurrence of stripe <b>smut.</b> Stripe <b>smut</b> should not be taken lightly by turfgrass managers. Infection causes a general decline, and often an early death of grass stands. Plants infected by U. striiformis remain infected for life...|$|R
5|$|In 1888 Cecil Rhodes paid a {{visit to}} Victoria College. As the leader of the College debating society, <b>Smuts</b> was called upon to deliver the {{welcoming}} address on behalf of the student body. Rhodes, on the verge of becoming Prime Minister of Cape Colony, was a vocal advocate of Southern African political and economic unity. Now, on the occasion of this visit, <b>Smuts</b> chose to give his address on the theme of Pan-Africanism.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{religious}} observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical teachings {{and who was}} destined for a future in the Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led <b>Smuts</b> towards a more critical examination of his faith. From this time onwards <b>Smuts</b> was, by gradual degrees, to start {{to move away from}} the uncompromisingly Calvinist outlook within which he had been raised.|$|E
5|$|Jan <b>Smuts</b> {{was born}} in 1870, the second son of a {{traditional}} Boer farming family. By rural tradition, the eldest son {{would be the only}} child to receive a full formal education; however, on the death of his elder brother in 1882, 12-year-old Jan was sent to school for the first time. After four years of education he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He graduated in 1891 with first-class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge. After further academic success, and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First-class honours. After graduating, <b>Smuts</b> passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple. In 1895, despite the prospect of a bright future in the United Kingdom, the homesick <b>Smuts</b> returned to South Africa.|$|E
50|$|Covered <b>smut</b> {{of barley}} {{is caused by}} the fungus Ustilago hordei. The disease is found {{worldwide}} and it is more extensively distributed than either loose <b>smut</b> or false loose <b>smut.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fifty-five {{spring barley}} {{varieties}} from the German official varieties list were tested for their susceptibility to loose <b>smut</b> (Ustilago nuda) and covered <b>smut</b> (Ustilago hordei) under a simulation of natural infection conditions. For loose <b>smut</b> infection cv. ‘Lawina’ with about 5 % infected plants {{was used as}} spreader. In the trial with covered <b>smut</b> 1 kg of seeds were shaken with 1 g of spores to contaminate the surface of barley seeds before sowing. Only ‘Steffi’ stayed absolutely free from loose <b>smut</b> during two infection cycles at two locations. With an average of 12. 6 % plants with loose <b>smut</b> ‘Danuta’ was the most susceptible. Most susceptible to covered <b>smut</b> were ‘Tunika’ with 13. 2 % and hulless ‘Taiga’ with 15 % infected plants. Thirteen varieties remained free of covered <b>smut.</b> Among these ‘Auriga’, ‘Hendrix’, ‘Jacinta’ and ‘Sigrid’ showed a low loose <b>smut</b> infection with always less than 1 %. No correlation between loose and covered <b>smut</b> susceptibility could be detected. Under organic farming a variety with a susceptibility below 1 % under natural infection could be acceptable for maintaining seeds on farm, but for organic seed multiplication during all generations from breeding to production more loose <b>smut</b> resistant varieties are necessary to fulfil the demands of current seed regulations...|$|R

5|$|<b>Smuts</b> {{thrived in}} this environment. With these new vistas of {{knowledge}} and learning now revealed that he spared no effort in his attempts to master them. His surviving notebooks from this period reveal the range and breadth of his studies: Latin, Greek, German, the Classics, Optical Physics, Inorganic Chemistry and Metallurgy, Organic Chemistry and Agriculture, and Geology - to name but a few. Once again, as had been the case at Riebeek West, this was not merely study {{for the sake of}} exams - as ever, <b>Smuts</b> continued to study avidly outside the confines of the curriculum.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Smuts</b> {{family lived}} in an almost {{exclusively}} Afrikaner world. Nevertheless, this cultural identity, unlike that of the Boer republics to the north, did not define itself on opposition to Britain or the British. Swartland farmers had been largely insulated from the causes of discontent of earlier years, discontent which eventually culminated in the mass Boer migrations of the Great Trek. As a result, Jacobus <b>Smuts</b> largely unmoved by the Afrikaner nationalism preached by such organisations as the Afrikaner Bond, founded by Rev. SJ du Toit in 1877. After 1884, having come {{under the leadership of}} Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, the Bond became more to the Smuts' taste. Hofmeyr changed the fundamental basis of the organisation, from one preaching Afrikaner separatism to one which combined a pragmatic policy of economic protectionism for Cape farmers and their produce with a call for unity between the English and Dutch-speaking populations and cooperation with the Colonial authorities. As a member of the Cape legislature Jacobus <b>Smuts</b> pledged his support to Hofmeyr and the reformed Bond.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for <b>Smuts.</b> The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. <b>Smuts,</b> though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that <b>Smuts</b> came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
50|$|Sugarcane <b>smut</b> or Ustilago scitaminea Sydow {{is caused}} by the fungus Sporisorium scitamineum; <b>smut</b> was {{previously}} known as Ustilago scitaminea. The <b>smut</b> 'whip' is a curved black structure which emerges from the leaf whorl, and which aids in the spreading of the disease. Sugarcane <b>smut</b> causes significant losses to the economic value of a sugarcane crop. Sugarcane <b>smut</b> has recently been found in the eastern seaboard areas of Australia, one of the world's highest-yielding sugar areas.|$|R
40|$|Amongst the {{cultivated}} plants subjected to serious <b>smut</b> diseases, the cereals {{are the most}} common. In India, loose <b>smut</b> and flag <b>smut</b> are the important diseases attacking wheat crop. Loose <b>smut</b> is distributed throughout the country but {{appears to be more}} in North than in the South. On the other hand, flag <b>smut</b> is important only in certain localized regions of the country. <b>Smut</b> fungi belonging to order Ustilaginales are parasites both on monocots and dicots. Since they impart sooty appearance due to production of black spore mass they are generally described as <b>smut</b> fungi.

40|$|After a short {{historical}} review, {{our current}} {{knowledge about the}} <b>smut</b> fungi of the world, their number, classification, occurrence on host plant groups {{and their relationship to}} other groups of fungi are presented. Surprising results of the new classification of <b>smut</b> fungi are shown. The estimated number of existing species, expected results and trends in <b>smut</b> fungus taxonomy, the necessity and modalities of the conservation of <b>smut</b> fungi and the preparation of an illustrated world monograph of <b>smut</b> fungi are discussed...|$|R
5|$|This {{could of}} course have simply been {{a case of}} Smuts's diffidence and reserve re-asserting itself {{in the face of}} new and {{unfamiliar}} surrounding; however Smuts's biographers almost universally ascribe it to the poverty <b>Smuts</b> endured during this first year.|$|E
5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, <b>Smuts</b> began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards <b>Smuts</b> began to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no longer so reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E
5|$|With the hurdle of Matriculation {{behind him}} {{the start of}} the 1887 term finally saw <b>Smuts</b> {{admitted}} as a student of Victoria College and enrolled as an undergraduate of the University of the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E

5|$|In 1882 tragedy {{struck the}} <b>Smuts</b> family. Their eldest son, Michiel, {{suddenly}} succumbed to typhoid while attending school at Riebeek West.

5|$|In the {{examinations}} of 1891, <b>Smuts</b> took a double-First in Literature and Science.

5|$|Jan Christian <b>Smuts</b> (aka Jan Christiaan <b>Smuts),</b> OM, CH, ED, KC, FRS (24 May 187011 September 1950) was a {{prominent}} South African and Commonwealth statesman, military leader, and philosopher. He served as a Boer General during the Boer War, a British General during the First World War and was appointed Field Marshal by King George VI during the Second World War. In addition to various cabinet appointments, he served as Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa from 1919 until 1924 and from 1939 until 1948. From 1917 to 1919 {{he was one of}} five members of the British War Cabinet, helping to create the Royal Air Force. He played a leading part in the post-war settlements at the end of both world wars, making significant contributions towards the creation of the League of Nations and the United Nations. He did much to redefine the relationship between Britain and the Dominions and Colonies, leading to the formation of the British Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Smuts</b> {{family were}} prosperous yeoman farmers, {{long-established}} in the area.
