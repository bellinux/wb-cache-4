5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> women.|$|E
5|$|Podgorny's {{removal from}} office in 1977 {{has become the most}} notable example of power {{transfer}} in the late Brezhnev Era. According to Robert Vincent Daniels, Podgorny was before his removal the second most powerful man in the Soviet Union, behind Brezhnev but ahead of Premier Kosygin. The post of Chairman of the Presidium had acquired more powers during his tenure, and had changed from a largely honorary office to the second most important office in the USSR. Though there were some Sovietologists who foresaw Podgorny's fall, the decision to remove Podgorny from the Politburo took the world by surprise. On 24 May 1977, a unanimous vote was taken by the Central Committee after Grigory Romanov proposed removing Podgorny from the Politburo. The vote seemed to have taken Podgorny by surprise, and immediately after the vote, he got up from his politburo seat to instead <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ordinary members. The Central Committee had however only voted him off the Politburo, and Podgorny still retained the position of Chairman of the Presidium. After his removal from the Politburo Podgorny's name disappeared from Soviet media. The Soviet media told the Soviet people that he had retired due to his stance against détente and producing more consumer goods. Podgorny finally lost his Chairmanship of the Presidium on 16 June 1977.|$|E

25|$|Like her family, Bankhead was a Democrat, but {{broke with}} many Southerners by campaigning for Harry Truman's reelection in 1948.

25|$|If Philip II of Macedon had {{not been}} the father of Alexander the Great, he would be more widely known as a first-rate {{military}} innovator, tactician and strategist, and as a consummate politician. The conquests of Alexander {{would have been impossible}} without the army his father created. Considered semi-barbarous by some metropolitan Greeks, the Macedonians were a martial people; they drank deeply of unwatered wine (the very mark of a barbarian) and no youth was considered to be fit to <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> men at table until he had killed, on foot with a spear, a wild boar.|$|E

25|$|In November 2016, Sales won an {{internal}} election among state Senate Republicans {{to be the}} president of the Montana Senate in the 2017 election. His opponent was Senator Eric Moore of Miles City. Although the vote was by secret ballot, it was described as a close case. He assumed office in January 2017. Sales broke with tradition in January 2017 by deciding to not <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> state House in the customary beginning-of-session joint sitting to hear speeches from members of Montana's congressional delegation, the chief justice of the Montana Supreme Court, the Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction, and a Native American leader.

25|$|In the 2014 European elections, Fianna Fáil {{received}} 22.3% of first-preference votes {{but only}} returned a single MEP, {{a reduction in}} representation of two MEPs from the previous term. This was due {{to a combination of}} the party's vote further dropping in Dublin and a two candidate strategy in the Midlands North West constituency, which backfired, resulting in sitting MEP Pat the Cope Gallagher losing his seat. On 23 June 2014, returning MEP Brian Crowley announced that he intended to <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) rather than the ALDE group during the upcoming 8th term of the European parliament. The following day on 24 June 2014 Crowley had the Fianna Fáil party whip withdrawn. He has since been re-added to Fianna Fáil's website.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much of the}} {{pomp and}} {{ceremony}} behind the State of the Union address is governed by tradition rather than law, in modern times, the event is seen {{as one of the}} most important in the US political calendar. It is one of the few instances when all three branches of the US government are assembled under one roof: members of both houses of Congress constituting the legislature, the President's Cabinet constituting the executive, and the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court constituting the judiciary. In addition, the military is represented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while foreign governments are represented by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. The address has also been used as an opportunity to honor the achievements of some ordinary Americans, who are typically invited by the President to <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> First Lady.|$|E

25|$|Nationals WA {{candidate}} Tony Crook defeated Liberal Party incumbent Wilson Tuckey in {{the lower}} house seat of O'Connor at the 2010 federal election, where a four-seat deficit for both sides saw the first hung parliament since the 1940 federal election.

In April 2012, however, he moved from the crossbench to <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Nationals. His main platform was pro-Royalties for Regions policy and anti-Mineral Resource Rent Tax. Since his election, Crook voted at times for federal Labor government policies in parliament contrary to the official position of the National Party of Australia. Crook retired at the 2013 federal election and the seat of O'Connor was won by Liberal Rick Wilson, who narrowly defeated Nationals WA candidate Chub Witham.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{may also}} sit {{with just two}} Judges of Appeal in appeals in civil matters against {{interlocutory}} orders and other orders apart from judgments handed down after trials commenced by writs of summons or hearings commenced by other originating processes such as originating summons. High Court judges may be requested by the Chief Justice to sit as judges of the Court of Appeal to hear specific appeals. Judges of Appeals cannot sit {{as members of the}} Court when appeals are against judgments or orders made by them, convictions made or a sentences passed by them, or questions of law reserved by them for the Court of Appeal to decide when they were acting as High Court judges.

25|$|State legislatures can impeach state officials, {{including}} governors. The {{court for}} the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the federal model—in New York, for instance, the Assembly (lower house) impeaches, and the State Senate tries the case, but {{the members of the}} seven-judge New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest, constitutional court) <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> senators as jurors as well. Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally throughout the history of the United States, usually for corruption charges. A total of at least eleven U.S. state governors have faced an impeachment trial; a twelfth, Governor Lee Cruce of Oklahoma, escaped impeachment conviction by a single vote in 1912. Several others, most recently Connecticut's John G. Rowland, have resigned rather than face impeachment, when events seemed to make it inevitable. The most recent impeachment of a state governor occurred on January 14, 2009, when the Illinois House of Representatives voted 117-1 to impeach Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges; he was subsequently removed from office and barred from holding future office by the Illinois Senate on January 29. He was the eighth U.S. state governor to be removed from office.|$|E
