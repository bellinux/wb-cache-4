5000|$|It {{was one of}} four concept {{vehicles}} {{produced by}} the company in the five-month period following the appointment of Olivier Boulay as its head of design in 2001, after DaimlerChrysler's purchase of a controlling interest in Mitsubishi Motors. Boulay, the General Manager of DCX's Advanced Design Studio in Yokohama, was seconded to MMC, and immediately began creating a strong image for their cars through a common [...] "face" [...] seen on all the concepts, in the curvature of the lower edge of the grille, {{the size and shape of}} the badge and the <b>sharp</b> <b>crease</b> rising up the leading edge of the bonnet. More radical styling concepts included the thick wraparound tubeline encircling the body which also housed the front and rear lamp units, detachable, semi-transparent body panels in the doors, and seatback-mounted backpacks. The hardtop's large louvred sunroof was replaced by a convertible top and hideaway rear glass in the cabriolet.|$|E
50|$|Following DaimlerChrysler's {{assumption}} {{of control of}} Mitsubishi Motors, Boulay was appointed the head of Mitsubishi Motors' design office in May 2001. The continual financial struggle of Mitsubishi Motors hastened DaimlerChrysler's exit from being the company's biggest stockholder. It meant that only one all-new vehicle, the Mitsubishi Grandis, was developed and released during his tenure. However, {{he was able to}} exert his stylistic influence on several other vehicles in development, thanks to a heavy schedule of four concept vehicles created in five months prior to the 2001 Tokyo Motor Show. These concepts, the CZ2, CZ3 Tarmac, Space Liner and SUP, all shared a common face created by the curvature of the lower edge of the grille, {{the size and shape of}} the badge and the <b>sharp</b> <b>crease</b> rising up the leading edge of the bonnet. Boulay saw this family likeness as important in establishing a strong image for the company. This would later be seen in his facelift of the Australian market Mitsubishi Magna in 2003, its successor the Mitsubishi 380, and the Japanese Mitsubishi i kei car, the latter two of which would only be released after Boulay had left the company.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of processing scanned datasets of man-made scenes such as building interiors and office environments. Such datasets are produced in huge quantity and often share a simple structure with <b>sharp</b> <b>crease</b> lines. However, their usual acquisition with mobile devices often leads to poor data quality and established reconstruction methods fail – at least at reconstructing sharp features. We propose to overcome the lack of reliable information by using a strong shape prior in the reconstruction method: {{we assume that the}} scene can be represented as a collection of cuboid shapes, each covering a subset of the data. The optimal configuration of cuboids is found by formulating the reconstruction problem as a discrete maximum a posteriori (MAP) optimization in a statistical sense. We propose a greedy algorithm which iteratively extracts new shape candidates and optimizes over the shape of the cuboids. A new candidate is selected by scoring its ability to reconstruct previously uncovered data points. The iteration converges at the first significant drop in the score of new candidates. Our method is fast and extremely robust to noisy and incomplete data which we show by applying it to scanned datasets acquired with different devices...|$|E

40|$|Paneling an {{architectural}} freeform surface {{refers to an}} approximation of the design surface {{by a set of}} panels that can be manufactured using a selected technology at a reasonable cost, while respecting the design intent and achieving the desired aesthetic quality of panel layout and surface smoothness. Eigensatz and co-workers [Eigensatz et al. 2010] have recently introduced a computational solution to the paneling problem that allows handling large-scale freeform surfaces involving complex arrangements of thousands of panels. We extend this paneling algorithm to facilitate effective design exploration, in particular for local control of tolerance margins and the handling of <b>sharp</b> <b>crease</b> lines. We focus on the practical aspects relevant for the realization of large-scale freeform designs and evaluate the performance of the paneling algorithm with a number of case studies.

40|$|Large {{deformations}} of thin elastic {{plates and}} shells present a formidable problem in continuum mechanics {{which is generally}} intractable except by numerical methods. Conventional approaches break down {{in the limit of}} small plate thickness due to appearance of discontinuities in the solution which require boundary layer treatment. We examine a simple case of a plate bent by forces exerted along its boundary so as to create a <b>sharp</b> <b>crease</b> in the limit of infinitely small thickness. We find a separable boundary layer solution of the von Karman plate equations which is valid along the ridge line. We confirm a scaling argument (T. A. Witten and Hao Li, Europhys. Lett. 23 51 (1993)) that asserts that the ridge possesses a characteristic radius of curvature R given by the thickness of the sheet h and the length of the ridge X viz. R ∼ h^ 1 / 3 X^ 2 / 3. The elastic energy of the ridge scales as E ∼κ (X/h) ^ 1 / 3 where κ is the bending modulus of the sheet. We determine the dependence of these quantities on the dihedral angle of the ridge π - 2 α. For all angles R ∼α^- 4 / 3 and E ∼α^ 7 / 3. The framework developed in this paper is suitable for determination of other properties of ridges such as their interaction or behavior under various types of loading. We expect these results to have broad importance in describing forced crumpling of thin sheets. Comment: 10 pages, RevTeX, available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|General Description: A matted {{perennial}} shrub with {{an opposite}} leaf arrangement. The shrub can reach heights of 2 to 7 in. (5 to 18 cm). The leaves are broader {{at the tip}} then {{at the base of}} the leaf. The leaves have a thin, flexible, almost translucent membrane on their margins. There are patches of small hairs on the underside of the leaf surface. The upper side of the leaf surface is covered with short, stiff hairs. The younger leaves have curly white to rust-colored hairs located at the stem tip. The stems are usually hairy. The long thin branches of the taxon are trailing or lying on the ground and do not root at the nodes. The white petals are fused together, giving the flower a bell shape. The flowers hang separately off of individual hairless stalks. Flower stalks are found towards the top of branches. The calyx of C. lycopodioides is red, and the bell-shaped flowers are white. Identification Tips: Distinguishing characteristics of this species include the membranes on the leaves and the hair on both sides of the leaves. Other species of Cassiope, which grow in the same regions as C. lycopodioides, have hairless leaves. In C. stelleriana the leaves are flat on the leaves ’ upper surface, and the branches are somewhat hairy. The leaves of C. mertensiana are sharply creased on the bottom surface, and the leaves are in distinct rows. With C. tetragona there is a <b>sharp</b> <b>crease</b> on the upper surface of the leaf, and the leaves are in distinct rows. C. tetragona is also darker green and notably coarse...|$|E

Our simulation uses a framework of adaptive mesh refinement to dynamically align mesh edges with folds and creases. This framework allows efficient modeling of sharp features and avoids bend locking that would be otherwise caused by stiff in-plane behavior. By using an explicit plastic embedding space we prevent remeshing from causing shape diffusion.

A simple method for converting distance fields to bounded fields is described, allowing implicit sweep templates to be generated from any set of closed 2 D contours (including "holes").
