500|$|There {{are many}} churches in Shrewsbury, {{including}} Shrewsbury Abbey, founded by Roger de Montgomery in 1083. Shrewsbury Greek Orthodox Church, a former Anglican church building, is off Sutton Road to the south. Shrewsbury {{is home to}} the Roman Catholic Shrewsbury Cathedral, by the Town Walls, as well as two other parishes in Harlescott and Monkmoor, within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury. One of the , facing St Alkmund's Church, was the site of John Wesley's first preaching in Shrewsbury; a [...] records the date as 16 March 1761. According to legend, the spire of St Alkmund's Church was damaged by the Devil in 1553, and climbed four times by a drunken <b>steeplejack</b> in 1621.|$|E
500|$|When Dibnah was born, Britain {{relied heavily}} upon coal to fuel its industry. [...] As a child he {{was fascinated by}} the steam engines which powered the many textile mills in Bolton, but he paid {{particular}} attention to chimneys and the men who worked on them. He began his working life as a joiner, before becoming a <b>steeplejack.</b> [...] From age22, he served for two years in the armed forces, as part of his National Service. [...] Once demobilised, he returned to steeplejacking but met with limited success until he was asked to repair Bolton's parish church. [...] The resulting publicity provided a welcome boost to his business, ensuring he was almost never out of work.|$|E
500|$|Fred Dibnah, <b>Steeplejack</b> won the 1979 BAFTA {{award for}} best documentary, {{and over the years}} Haworth {{returned}} to film more documentaries. With his newly found fame, however, came distractions from his work. Visitors would arrive at his house, to see his garden. He began to receive fan mail; one individual wrote to offer Dibnah a steam-powered machine he no longer wanted. One company, who were apparently disturbed to see Dibnah's matches being extinguished by the wind while {{at the top of a}} chimney, sent him a sample of their windproof matches. Filming would also interfere with his work. Cameraman Martin Lightening would climb with [...] Dibnah to the top of a chimney—with a 16mm film camera—and film him at work, often hundreds of feet above the ground.|$|E

500|$|In 1978, {{while making}} repairs to Bolton Town Hall, Dibnah was filmed by a {{regional}} BBC news crew. [...] The BBC then commissioned an award-winning documentary, which followed the rough-hewn <b>steeplejack</b> {{as he worked}} on chimneys, interacted {{with his family and}} talked about his favourite hobby—steam. [...] His Lancastrian manner and gentle, self-taught philosophical outlook, proved popular with viewers and he featured in a number of television programmes. [...] Toward the end of his life, the decline of Britain's industry was mirrored by a decline in his steeplejacking business and Dibnah increasingly came to rely on after-dinner speaking for his income. [...] In 1998, he presented a programme on Britain's industrial history and went on to present a number of series, largely concerned with the Industrial Revolution and its mechanical and architectural legacy.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1997, {{the celebrity}} <b>steeplejack</b> Fred Dibnah {{was hired by}} Safeway {{supermarkets}} to demolish the unused [...] concrete chimney {{that was part of}} the abandoned oil refinery. Safeway had planned for the 2,500-ton chimney to be demolished on 18 September in front of a large crowd of invited guests. This would have been the first time Fred Dibnah's demolition technique of pit props and fire (without explosives) had been attempted on a concrete chimney and it was also the tallest chimney he had ever attempted to fell. However the chimney unexpectedly collapsed the previous day whilst Fred and his team were making the final preparations for the controlled demolition, fortunately without injury. The incident is described in detail in various biographies and by Fred himself in his public speaking events afterwards. Fred Dibnah later presented Safeway head office staff with brass paper weights (made from material salvaged from the chimney) stamped [...] "The Great Canvey Island Chimney Disaster 1997".|$|E
2500|$|The next day's {{newspapers}} {{were full of}} the story of Reichelt's [...] "tragic experiment" [...] (...) complete with photographs; at least four newspapers, Le Petit Parisien, L'Humanité, Le Matin and La Croix, showed images of the fatal jump. Film of the attempt, including footage of Reichelt's body being removed and the onlookers measuring the depth of the hole created by his impact (15 centimetres; 5.9 in), was distributed by news organizations. Initial reports speculated on Reichelt's state of mind: none assumed he had been suicidal, but many called him reckless or foolish. A journalist in Le Gaulois suggested that only half the term [...] "mad genius" [...] applied to Reichelt – although the same report included an interview with one of Reichelt's friends, who claimed that the tailor had felt pressured into giving a dramatic demonstration to attract sponsors, without whom he could not expect to make a profit before any patent expired. Reichelt's death was the first to result from a parachuting accident since Charles Leroux died giving a demonstration in Tallinn in 1889. In fact, on 2 February 1912 – two days prior to Reichelt's fatal jump – an American <b>steeplejack,</b> Frederick R. Law, had successfully parachuted from the viewing platform of the torch of the Statue of Liberty ( [...] above sea level and [...] {{from the base of the}} statue), seemingly on a whim. On 6 February, La Croix added a footnote to the report on Reichelt's death: another parachuting experiment was to take place on 18 or 25 February at Juvisy-sur-Orge, in which the aviator Camille Guillaume planned to leap from his Blériot monoplane at a height of [...] to test a parachute design (the plane would be allowed to crash).|$|E
60|$|Saton {{deliberately}} {{turned into}} the Park, and sauntered along under {{the trees in the}} wake of a throng of fashionable promenaders. He exchanged greetings with many acquaintances, and here and there he stopped to say a few words. He noted, as usual, and with a recurrence of his constant discontent, the extraordinary difference in the demeanor of the women and the men of his acquaintance. The former, gracious and smiling, accepted him without reservation. Their murmured words and smiles were even more than gracious. On the other hand, there was scarcely a man whose manner did not denote a certain tolerance, not unmixed with contempt, as though, indeed, they were willing to accept the fact that he was of their acquaintance, but desired at the same time to emphasize the fact that he was outside the freemasonry of their class--a freak, whom they acknowledged on sufferance, as they might have done a wonderful lion-tamer, or a music-hall singer, or a <b>steeplejack.</b> He knew very well that there was not one of them who accepted his qualifications, notwithstanding the approval of their womankind, and the knowledge stung him bitterly.|$|E
5|$|Dibnah {{had watched}} the {{activities}} of <b>steeplejacks</b> throughout his childhood, and witnessed his first chimney felling from his father's allotment near Bolton's greyhound track at Raikes Park.

They then lit a fire, destroying the supports and causing the chimney to collapse. Unfortunately, on this occasion the chimney fell in the wrong direction, onto the greyhound track's dog kennels, a local cafe and a series of power cables.|$|R

5000|$|By 1997 Dibnah {{was living}} alone, with little work or money. Competition from Manchester had reduced his income from <b>steeplejacking</b> and filming for the BBC had dried up completely.
