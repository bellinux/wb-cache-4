40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{was performed to}} investigate effects of geometrical and coolant flow parameters for a three row compound hole design over a flat plate. These included ?: + 45 and - 45, in-line and <b>stagger</b> <b>arrangement,</b> hole spacing (4 d, 6 d and 8 d), five blowing ratios (0. 5 - 1. 5) and three density ratios (1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0). The mainstream Reynold?s number was kept constant at 285, 000 with a turbulence intensity of 6 %. Average effectiveness plots and contours were developed using Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) technique and cross comparisons were carried out. The parametric results obtained from experimentation generally agreed with widely accepted trends: the cascade effect of coolant jets for multi hole design increases overall effectiveness especially at large x/d, increasing density ratio increases effectiveness particularly at higher blowing ratio and increasing hole spacing has a detrimental effect on film cooling. However, few {{of the more interesting}} observations included: <b>stagger</b> <b>arrangement</b> is not always the most optimum design (?: + 45, - 45, - 45 with staggered 2 nd and 3 rd row reported the lowest effectiveness for all blowing ratios and density ratios); inline arrangement of holes with opposing orientation angles (?: + 45, - 45, - 45) yields better effectiveness; blowing ratio effect is strongly dependent on geometric design. Moreover, hole spacing effect is closely related to neighboring coolant jet coalescence and interaction with mainstream flow. Currently, little data is available on three row design in open literature; this study provides systematic, baseline information for future studies...|$|R

The magazine had two columns of 9 mm cartridges in a <b>staggered</b> <b>arrangement,</b> merging at the top to form a single column. While other staggered magazines, such as the Thompson, fed from both the left and right side alternately (double-column, double feed), the Sten magazine, like the MP38, required the cartridges to gradually merge {{at the top of the}} magazine to form a single column (double column, single feed). As a consequence, any dirt or foreign matter in this taper area could cause feed malfunctions. Additionally, the walls of the magazine lip had to endure the full stresses of the rounds being pushed in by the spring. This, along with rough handling could result in deformation of the magazine lips (which required a precise 8° feed angle to operate), resulting in misfeeding and a failure to fire.|$|E
