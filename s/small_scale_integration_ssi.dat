40|$|A {{simplified}} physics package, containing parametrizations {{of vertical}} diffusion, subgrid-scale orographic drag, stratiform precipitation and convective precipitation, {{was built for}} the four-dimensional variational data assimilation system that is being developed for the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale model. To validate this package and measure {{its impact on the}} behaviour of unstable disturbances, a series of singular vector experiments was conducted. In a control experiment with vertical diffusion only, a set of 45 extratropical singular vectors was generated for a northern hemisphere winter case, using the total energy norm and an optimization time interval of 48 hours. Subsequently, the remaining components of the simplified physics were activated one by one and their influence was measured by changes in the energy partition, energy growth and spatial distribution of singular vectors. Cross-propagation tests were also made, where singular vectors from one experiment were evolved with the tangent-linear model of another. Results show that the orographic drag reduces the growth of singular vectors while the moist physics enhance the growth and shifts the energy of singular vectors toward <b>smaller</b> <b>scales.</b> <b>Integrations</b> of the nonlinear model with full physics indicate that, for amplitudes typical of analysis increments, the evolution of extratropical singular vectors is well described by the linearized model although growth rates are reduced by nonlinearities...|$|R

According {{to the current}} standards for <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> PV <b>integration,</b> PV systems are basically the devices of real power generation and do not generally regulate voltages {{at the point of}} common coupling. Moreover, PV generation highly depends on weather conditions, so its power varies all the time throughout a day.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Development of very {{high-speed}} {{integrated circuits}} {{is of great}} interest. The experimental Si circuits with an average propagation delay below 100 ps were realized in <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> of <b>integration</b> [6, 7]. However for VLSI circuits some limits exist. The most important is that the average interconnection length per gate increases with the gate count and logic cell layout area. Speed becomes limited {{not only by the}} device speed itself, but also by the fact that each gate should drive interconnections [1, 7]. For long interconnections propagation delay is limited by the interconnection parameters. The second aspect is that the speed of device does not grow sufficiently with the feature size decreasing [3]. The scaling of different areas does not proceed in the same manner. The channel area decreases faster than active areas. For modern technologies the doping of the active area increases. This causes that for technologies with small feature size the junction capacitance become...|$|R

Explicit viscosity terms are not needed. This does not imply that energy would not cascade to the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> flow but suggests that the nature of the large scale flow is independent of the viscosity at <b>small</b> <b>scales.</b> Numerical time <b>integration</b> shows the flow to be chaotic but, in some cases, with transient propagating features and meandering zonal flow...|$|R
40|$|The Syrian crisis entered {{its fifth}} year of {{existence}} this year, displacing {{millions of people}} and forcing millions of them to search refuge in neighbouring countries. During this time, Turkey received the highest amount of Syrian refugees. In the current context, where Syrians cannot {{go back to their}} homeland because it is not safe for them to do so and resettlement through the UNHCR is done on a very <b>small</b> <b>scale,</b> <b>integration</b> is the only solution. A major catalyst for local integration is acquiring employment (Lundborg, 2013; Bloch, 2002; Cheung and Phillimore, 2014). Against this background, and with a specific focus on Istanbul because of the high concentration of Syrian refugees (330. 000), this researched aimed to get an insight in the labour market experience of these refugees. In order to achieve this aim, desk research was carried out since January 2015 and fieldwork in Istanbul was conducted from February 2015 until May 2015. During these months extensive open interviews were conducted with Syrian refugees. Although literature suggests otherwise (Connor, 2010; Ortensi, 2015; Peromingo, 2014; Bevelander, 2011 : Bloch, 2002; Cheung and Phillimore, 2014), the refugee gap is not universally applicable to Syrian refugees. They initially experience a downward occupational mobility due to the desperate need for employment (and income), depressions, a language barrier and being unknowledgeable about where to look for employment opportunities. However, subsequently, many respondents experience upward occupational mobility due to social networks and investments in destination-specific skills such as the Turkish language and understanding where employment opportunities can be found. Accordingly, many respondents, though not every respondent, are able to (professionally) develop themselves, make progression on the labour market and pursue a career in (highly skilled) employment commensurate with their skills, education and/or experience. Consequently, along with favourable working conditions, this results in satisfaction among respondents about their current occupations. On the other hand, bad working conditions and being employed in occupations not commensurate with their skills, education and/or experience are important factors for respondents not to be satisfied with their current employment situation. The satisfaction of respondents about their occupations influences their occupational mobility and desired occupational mobility, indicating the importance of agency in occupational mobility...|$|R
40|$|As is {{well known}} the amount of {{installed}} wind power increases every day. In the past single wind turbines were installed separately, today wind turbines often {{are connected to the}} grid as a group of many turbines, i. e. wind parks. Grid integration considerations have moved from flicker phenomena in the low voltage grid to voltage stability analyses in the transmission grid. This paper starts with an overview of the voltage stability phenomena in a transmission system. Suitable models of wind power generation for power system stability studies - both long and short-term stability - are presented. Different levels of detail of the wind generation models are investigated carefully considering the type of stability study, result accuracy and simulation efficiency. Important aspects such as protection, fault ride-through capability and the capability of producing reactive power are taken into account. The models are then validated against measurements. Three types of wind turbines are considered in this study; fixed speed with induction generator, variable speed operation with doubly fed induction generator and variable speed turbine with full power converter. The main phenomenon that determines the behaviour of a system where fixed speed wind turbines are connected is the large reactive power consumed by the induction machines immediately after the fault has been cleared. This mechanism leads to a voltage stability problem with a risk of voltage collapse as a final consequence. Investigations in short and long term voltage stability have examined the factors affecting the stability limit such as: generated power, fault types, fault duration, fault clearing time, fault voltage and remaining voltage. Variable speed wind turbines with power electronic converter are capable of producing active power at unity power factor. Possibility lies to control reactive power during grid disturbance {{with the help of an}} over-rated grid side converter. In this paper the long- and short-term voltage stability aspects of variable speed wind turbines with power electronic converters are illustrated by case studies. Large <b>scale</b> wind power <b>integration</b> at the transmission level has the possibility to improve long term voltage stability of the grid by injecting reactive power. The possibility to produce reactive power increases with a decreased active power production. As well <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration</b> at the distribution level can increase short-term voltage stability of the local grid by utilizing its fast reactive power control capability. Finally, several issues related to the modelling and the compatibility of wind power generation in typical power system simulation tools is discussed...|$|R

The performer sits at a horizontal control panel of 291 lightable touch-sensitive switches (no moving parts). The two-state switches are used by a performer to dial sequences of numbers that are characterized by a variety of intervals and lengths. A sequence may bypass, address, or be added to other sequences forming an interlocked tree of control and data according to a performer's choice. The unique characteristic of the switch is that it can be driven both manually and logically, which allows human/machine interaction. The most innovative feature of the human/machine interface is that it allows the user to switch from control of macro to micro parameters of the information output.
