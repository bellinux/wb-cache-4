40|$|This study {{describes}} a cost-effective check-in baggage screening system, based on "on-belt tomosynthesis" (ObT) and close-range photogrammetry, {{that is designed}} to address the limitations of the most common system used, conventional projection radiography. The latter's limitations can lead to loss of information and an increase in baggage handling time, as baggage is manually searched or screened with more advanced systems. This project proposes a system that overcomes such limitations creating a cost-effective automated pseudo- 3 D imaging system, by combining x-ray and optical imaging to form digital tomograms. Tomographic reconstruction requires a knowledge of the change in geometry between multiple x-ray views of a common object. This is uniquely achieved using a close range photogrammetric system based on a small network of web-cameras. This paper presents the recent developments of the ObT system and describes recent findings of the photogrammetric system implementation. Based on these positive results, future work on the advancement of the ObT system as a cost-effective pseudo- 3 D imaging <b>of</b> <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> for airport security is proposed...|$|R
40|$|R. Benjamin (1995) {{addressed}} {{the application of}} the “object 3 D” X ray reconstruction technique for electronically “unpacking” suspect items, when screening aircraft luggage. However, there is no satisfactory solution to the mass <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> <b>hold</b> luggage. Computed Tomography, CT, entails excessive radiation dosages, and its rate of throughput is quite inadequate. A novel variant of “object 3 D” is therefore put forward, adapting some of the technology of existing cabin luggage screening systems-but on a substantially larger scale-which does achieve the required throughput at an acceptable radiation dosage and cost...|$|R

40|$|For years, {{terrorist}} attacks have presented a constant threat to civil aviation and highlighted {{the importance of}} aviation security. Threats that have reached new dimensions demand a reliable security check, not only for <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> but also for passengers and their carry-on baggage. For example, the terror attack on September 11, 2001, has revealed a new dimension. Former terror attacks were comparable to Lockerbie 1988, when Pan Am Flight 103 was destroyed by a bomb in the <b>hold</b> <b>baggage.</b> As a result, immediate changes regarding <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> screening were introduced, and automated systems for detecting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> were developed. However, in the recent past, suicide bombings have become more likely, and therefore enhanced security checks of passengers and their carry-on bags have become necessary. Although new state-of-the-art technology, such as automatic liquid detectors, millimeter wave systems, X-ray machines with automatic detection of explosive materials, and so forth, facilitate the detection of threat items, the final decision is still made by human operators (screeners). It {{has been argued that}} with advances in technology, the cognitive demands on humans are increased rather than lowered. ...|$|R

25|$|EasyJet, like Ryanair, uses a {{business}} model pioneered by Southwest Airlines. Both airlines have adapted this {{model for the}} European market through further cost-cutting measures, such as not selling connecting flights or providing complimentary snacks on board. The key points of this business model are high aircraft utilisation, quick turnaround times, charging for extras (such as priority boarding, <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> and food) and keeping operating costs low. One main difference easyJet and Ryanair have from Southwest is they both fly a young fleet of aircraft. Southwest has an average fleet age of 11.9 years whereas Ryanair's and easyJet's average fleet ages are just a little over six years each.|$|R

Flights to the UK were allowed again from 6 November, to enable people to travel home, but with restrictions and increased security measures. Passengers were permitted to travel home with only hand luggage, with hold luggage to be returned following a more stringent screening process.

Unlike the UK, most western countries do allow airlines to carry dogs/cats on flights provided that specific requirements are met regarding the container the pet will travel in. All animals (except guide dogs) travelling to the UK must travel in the hold as manifest cargo. Most airlines do not offer cargo services to individual passengers directly and specialist agents must be used.
