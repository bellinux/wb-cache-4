25|$|Advancing {{technology}} {{since the}} mid-2000s led to chasers more commonly targeting less amenable areas (i.e. hilly or forested) {{that were previously}} eschewed when continuous wide visibility was critical. These advancements, particularly in-vehicle weather data such as radar, also led {{to an increase in}} chasing after nightfall. Most chasing remains during daylight hours with active storm intercepting peaking from mid-late afternoon through early-to-mid evening. This is dictated by a chaser's schedule (availability to chase) and by when storms form, which usually is around peak heating during the mid-to-late afternoon but on some days occurs in early afternoon or even in the morning. An additional advantage of later season storms is that days are considerably longer than in early <b>spring.</b> <b>Morning</b> or early afternoon storms tend to be associated with stronger wind shear and thus most often happen earlier in the spring season or later during the fall season.|$|E

(Make room in the wedding-hall, you dog!), as some unruly soldiers interfere in a chaotic wedding, mixing roughly with the musicians and the wedding-party. Shouts of [...] "Shoulder arms!" [...] and panic at a chimney fire combine with a complex rhyming pattern to create a humorous picture of the disastrous event. The story ends with the priest pocketing some of the collection money. A later Epistle, No. 48, Solen glimmar blank och trind (The sun gleams smooth and round), narrates the relaxed and peaceful journey of a boat bringing Ulla Winblad home to Stockholm across Lake Mälaren on a lovely <b>spring</b> <b>morning,</b> {{after a night of}} carousing. The boatmen call to each other, apparently haphazardly, but each detail helps to create a pastoral vision as [...] "Gradually the wind blows up / In the fallen sails; / The pennant stretches, and with an oar / Olle stands on a hayboat;".

2500|$|In Charles M. Schulz's {{comic strip}} Peanuts, Snoopy was often stated to have seven siblings.

According to the 1991 TV special Snoopy's Reunion, their names are Molly and Rover; however, their appearance is not considered canonical in the comic strip. In the June 6, 1959 comic strip, following the birth of Charlie Brown's sister Sally, Snoopy remarks {{that he has no}} brothers or sisters, and is an [...] "only dog." [...] However, in a March 18, 1971 strip, Snoopy writes in his autobiography: [...] "I was born one bright <b>Spring</b> <b>morning</b> at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm.

2500|$|Smith {{said that}} when he was about twelve (c. 1817–18), he became {{interested}} in religion and distressed about his sins. He studied the Bible and attended church, but the accounts differ as to whether he determined on his own that there was no existing religion built upon the true teachings of Jesus or whether the idea that all churches were false had not [...] "entered his heart" [...] until he experienced the vision. During this period of religious concern, he determined to turn to God in prayer. An early account says the purpose of this prayer was to ask God for mercy for his sins while later accounts emphasize his desire to know which church he should join. Therefore, as his mother had done years before when concerned about an important religious question, Smith said he went one <b>spring</b> <b>morning</b> to a secluded grove near his home to pray. He said he went to a stump in a clearing where he had left his axe the day before and began to offer his first audible prayer.|$|E

And that's a good thing. ... It's a great thing when an artist digs up his roots, discovers what's down there and creates wholesome goodness from what he's found.

50|$|The {{climate of}} the Galilee Basin is {{generally}} hot and dry throughout, becoming more extreme towards the west. Monthly mean temperatures show daytime summer temperatures are mostly in the mid 30 °C with winter overnight temperatures most commonly between 5 and 12 °C. The temperature records from the past 36 years shows values ranging from -2 °C to 44 °C. ‘Hot days’, with temperatures exceeding 35 °C, can be expected up to 74 to 101 days per year. ‘Frost days’ with screen temperatures below 2 °C can be expected up to 1.4 to 10.4 days per year. Relative humidity is highest in the mornings and during February, while the lowest is {{in the mid to}} late <b>spring</b> <b>mornings</b> and afternoons. The annual rainfall within the Galilee Basin ranges between 150 mm and 1,477 mm, with an average rainfall of between 492mm & 610 mm depending on location. Rainfall in December through March accounts for approximately 65 per cent of annual mean rainfall. The wettest month on average is January and the driest month is May.|$|R
50|$|Tent {{caterpillars}} hatch {{from their}} {{eggs in the}} early spring at the time the leaves of their host trees are just unfolding. The caterpillars establish their tent soon after they eclose. The tent is constructed at a site that intercepts the early morning sun. The position of the tent is critical because the caterpillars must bask in the sun to elevate their temperatures above the cool ambient temperatures that occur {{in the early spring}}. Studies have shown that when the body temperature of a caterpillar is less than about , digestion cannot occur. The tent consists of discrete layers of silk separated by gaps and the temperature in these compartments varies markedly. Caterpillars can adjust their body temperatures by moving from one compartment to another. On cool mornings they typically rest in a tight aggregate just under a sunlit surface of the tent. It is not uncommon to find that the temperature of the aggregate is as much as 30°C (54°F) warmer than the surrounding air temperature on cold but sunny <b>spring</b> <b>mornings.</b> Later on in the spring, temperatures may become excessive at midday and the caterpillars may retreat to the shaded outside surface of the tent to cool down.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe dawn chorus is a {{striking}} feature of <b>spring</b> <b>mornings</b> and a characteristic behaviour of many bird species, particularly the passerines. Dawn singing has been considered a reliable signal of male quality for mate and rival assessment. Singing is presumed to be relatively costly at dawn both because air temperatures are relatively low and because birds have not fed overnight. Models of optimal daily routine predict {{the existence of a}} “dusk chorus” in nocturnal birds, although this prediction has received little empirical attention. Nocturnal birds at dusk may be energy-limited {{because of a lack of}} daytime feeding, and singing at dusk may thus ensure signal reliability. Here, we used an observational and experimental approach to study vocal behaviour at dusk and dawn in a nocturnal raptor, the little owl Athene noctua. We assess whether male little owls adjust their vocal behaviour according to feeding stage (i. e. period of the night), ambient air temperature and territorial context (i. e. spontaneous calling behaviour vs elicited calling by intrusion). Across different temperatures, we find that both spontaneous vocal activity and inter-individual variability in call duration increased at dusk, clearly indicating a dusk chorus phenomenon. Results from playback presentations suggest that food, rather than air temperature, is likely to be more constraining at dusk. We discuss how comparing dusk and dawn choruses in nocturnal and diurnal species can provide insights into both mechanistic and functional aspects of signalling behaviour...|$|R
