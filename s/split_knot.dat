40|$|A New Zealand {{stand of}} Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden was pruned up to height 8 m and grown for 15 years at low {{stocking}} to 57 cm diameter at breast height. This stand provided 15 trees, preselected {{for a range}} of wood density. Lumber and veneer were cut from the 5 -m butt logs, veneer was peeled from the second logs from height 7 to 13 m, and each tree was evaluated for production of appearance-grade lumber and rotary-peeled veneer. Butt-log quality was good as pruning had effectively restricted the knotty core, and there was little decay from branches in either butt logs or veneer billets. Longitudinal growth stresses varied widely among trees, resulting in log end-splitting and sawlog flitch movement during sawing (spring), which led to crook in sawn timber, substantially reducing timber conversion in some trees. Collapse and internal checking were prevalent in air-dried lumber, and numbers of checks varied widely among trees. Face-checking was found in boards from all trees after kiln-drying and reconditioning, and even those with very few face checks had internal checks. Veneer thickness varied unacceptably, caused probably by incorrect knife- and pressure-bar settings. Veneer splitting also varied among trees, and was worse in butt-log than in second-log veneers. Unsatisfactory pre-heating of billets before peeling may have exacerbated <b>splitting.</b> <b>Knots</b> severely downgraded structural plywood veneer grades, < 8 % of sheets from the second logs being acceptable compared with 87 % of sheets from the pruned butt logs. Stiffness of veneer sheets was successfully measured using a sonic device (Pundit™) to sort veneers for manufacture of laminated veneer lumber...|$|R

40|$|We {{establish}} several results {{about two}} short exact sequences involving lower {{terms of the}} n-solvable filtration, {F^m_n} of the string link concordance group C^m. We utilize the Thom-Pontryagin construction {{to show that the}} Sato-Levine invariants μ̅_(iijj) must vanish for 0. 5 -solvable links. Using this result, we show that the short exact sequence 0 →F^m_ 0 /F^m_ 0. 5 →F^m_- 0. 5 /F^m_ 0. 5 →F^m_- 0. 5 /F^m_ 0 → 0 does not split for links of two or more components, in contrast {{to the fact that it}} <b>splits</b> for <b>knots.</b> Considering lower terms of the filtration {F^m_n} in the short exact sequence 0 →F^m_- 0. 5 /F^m_ 0 →C^m/F^m_ 0 →C^m/F^m_- 0. 5 → 0, we show that while the sequence does not split for m> 3, it does indeed split for m= 2.

The electric field of TDR sensor is very sensitive to moisture trapped within the timber and can thus be used to infer anomalies in the grain down to a depth of approximately 10 cm below its surface.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of {{high-resolution}} long-slit spectra of the narrow-line region (NLR) in NGC 1068 obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard The Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectra were retrieved from the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST) obtained from two visits and seven orbits of HST time. We also obtained MERLIN radio maps {{of the center of}} NGC 1068 to examine the dependence of the NLR cloud velocities on the radio structure. The radial velocities and velocity dispersions of the bright NLR clouds appear to be unaffected by the radio knots, indicating that the radio jet is not the principal driving force on the outflowing NLR clouds. However, the velocities of the fainter NLR clouds are <b>split</b> near <b>knots</b> in the jet, indicating a possible interaction. Biconical outflow models were generated to match the data and for comparison to previous models done with lower dispersion observations. The general trend is an increase in radial velocity roughly proportional to distance from the nucleus followed by a linear decrease after roughly 100 parsec similar to that seen in other Seyfert galaxies, indicating common acceleration/deceleration mechanisms.

40|$|According to work of Hartley and Kawauchi in 1979 and 1980, the Conway Polynomial of all {{negative}} amphicheiral {{knots and}} strongly positive amphicheiral knots factors as ϕ(z) ϕ(-z) for some ϕ(z) ∈ Z[z]. Moreover, a 2012 example due to Ermotti, Hongler and Weber {{shows that this}} is not true for general amphicheiral knots. On the other hand, in 2006 the first author made a conjecture equivalent to saying that the Conway polynomial of all amphicheiral <b>knots</b> <b>splits</b> as ϕ(z) ϕ(-z) in the ring Z_ 4 [z]. In this paper, we establish this conjecture for all periodically amphicheiral knots built from braids, where the period preserves the braid structure.

40|$|A filling Dehn {{surface in}} a 3 -manifold M is a generically {{immersed}} surface in M that induces a cellular decomposition of M. Given a tame link L in M {{there is a}} filling Dehn sphere of M that "trivializes" (diametrically splits) it. This allows to construct filling Dehn surfaces in the coverings of M branched over L.

40|$|The {{nondestructive}} evaluation of wood is of considerable importance in several structural {{applications such as}} wooden bridge decks, wooden structural components, and wooden railway ties. This problem has {{attracted the attention of}} several researchers [1 – 19]. The specific topics that are being considered include: detection of natural defects like bacterial growth, knots, and splits; grading of wood; estimation of strength and stiffness characteristics; assessment of the effect of chemical treatment on strength; and, in-situ evaluation of degradation in wooden structural components and railway ties. Ultrasonic techniques have achieved a reasonable amount of success in the estimation of structural properties and defects [11, 16, 18]. Detection of natural defects such as <b>knots,</b> <b>splits</b> and decays provides valuable information which can be used for the grading of wood. The wave velocity measurements can also be used for the determination of structural properties (e. g., modulus of elasticity) of wood leading to grading, and to monitor the in-situ degradation of wooden structural members exposed to loads and environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the plywood}} used in Germany is {{imported}} but, {{on the other}} hand, resources of large-diameter timber are available. The potential for new plywood plants was investigated regarding the supply potential with spruce and beech timber from forests in North and South Germany and new processing technologies like e. g. defect clipping and jointing of the veneer ribbon. During peeling tests in two German plywood mills with 170 peel rolls from selected locations complete veneer ribbon surfaces were scanned and digitized. Defects (<b>knots,</b> <b>splits</b> etc.) were detected and statistically evaluated. A software was developed which is capable to simulate several processing methods: E. g. clipping between defects and jointing of clear areas vs. clipping of strips with a fixed width and post-sorting of the strips according to their individual defect frequency. Preliminary results show that simulated yield statistics reflect the visual grade of the logs. Moreover, processing parameters like defect tolerance, minimum clear area between defects and grade specifications can be changed to predict and optimize the yield for each peel roll...|$|R
40|$|Hardwood sawmill {{operators}} need {{to improve}} the conversion of raw material (logs) into lumber. Internal log scanning provides detailed information that can aid log processors in improving lumber recovery. However, scanner data (i. e. tomographic images) need to be analyzed prior to presentation to saw operators. Automatic labeling of computer tomography (CT) images is feasible, but no research has established labeling accuracy or demonstrated real time operation. An automated labeling scheme is {{presented in this paper}} that is both very accurate and very fast. The procedure segments and classifies each pixel in a CT image as either <b>knot,</b> <b>split,</b> bark, decay, or clear wood by using a small 3 D pixel neighborhood as input to an artificial neural network classifier. Initial results with two species of oak and with yellow poplar indicate that species-dependent classifiers of this type can be constructed. This classification approach can also be applied to other types of images encountered in industrial inspection applications, e. g., gray-scale and color images.

5000|$|Plywood {{production}} {{requires a}} good log, called a peeler, {{which is generally}} straighter and larger in diameter than one required for processing into dimensioned lumber by a sawmill. The log is laid horizontally and rotated about its long axis while a long blade is pressed into it, causing {{a thin layer of}} wood to peel off (much as a continuous sheet of paper from a roll). An adjustable nosebar, which may be solid or a roller, is pressed against the log during rotation, to create a [...] "gap" [...] for veneer to pass through between the knife and the nosebar. The nosebar partly compresses the wood as it is peeled; it controls vibration of the peeling knife; and assists in keeping the veneer being peeled to an accurate thickness. In this way the log is peeled into sheets of veneer, which are then cut to the desired oversize dimensions, to allow it to shrink (depending on wood species) when dried. The sheets are then patched, graded, glued together and then baked in a press at a temperature of at least , and at a pressure of up to [...] (but more commonly 200 psi) to form the plywood panel. The panel can then be patched, have minor surface defects such as <b>splits</b> or small <b>knot</b> holes filled, re-sized, sanded or otherwise refinished, depending on the market for which it is intended.|$|R
5000|$|The canoes were {{typically}} {{made out of}} planks split from redwood (Sequoioideae) or pine driftwood washed up on the shore. This driftwood was usually chosen because it was available and usually knot free and easy to work with. Some of these driftwood logs were selected, cut to length, split, shaped and then their split out planks [...] "sewn" [...] {{together to form a}} canoe. The side planks and canoe bottom were split out of straight knot free logs utilizing whalebone and antler Wedges driven by rock mallets. The planks were then shaped, trimmed and leveled using flint and seashell tools and shark hide sandpaper. Where planks needed to be connected holes were bored in the planks using wood drills tipped with chert or bone. These drilled planks were then connected by [...] "sewing" [...] <b>split</b> and shaped <b>knot</b> free planks together on their ends to get the necessary length. They {{were typically}} fastened together with red milkweed (tok) fiber cords. After the planks had been shaped and sewn together for length they were carefully shaped, bent and mounted six to eight planks vertically to form the canoe's sides around a large split bottom plank that formed the bottom of the canoe. Over 20 pieces of shaped wood are used to make a typical tomol. Once the planks were bent, fitted and lashed together the heart of dry tule rush was forced into the cracks between the planks {{on the outside of the}} canoe hull to act as caulking. All seams between planks, plank ends and holes for cords or thongs were then caulked with 'yop', a mixture of hard tar and pine pitch melted and then boiled. In many respects their boat construction technique mirrored that utilized for making small wooden boats around the world. The lack of metal tools and fasteners forced them to use stone age tools and materials.|$|R
40|$|Laminated bending of veneers {{mean that}} dried, thin veneers or thin wood sheets are glued {{together}} {{under influence of}} pressure and eventually increased temperature. At {{the same time the}} product is given its desired shape, most often curved. This thermo hydro mechanical process offers several benefits. For example thick bends of small radiuses of any species of wood may be formed and poor quality wood containing <b>knots,</b> <b>splits</b> and other defects may be utilised. Laminated bends can usually be set more readily and made to conform better to the shape of the form than similar bends of solid wood. Further no softening treatment is generally required before the pieces are bent. However, there are also disadvantages e. g. more technical skill and better equipment are usually required than for solid wood bending. The presence of glue may be somewhat detrimental to the machines used for the final cleaning up of the bent pieces. Further the glue lines which are usually visible on the sides may be an aesthetical unappreciated effect [1],[2]. The quality of the laminated bended veneer products are obtained as an interaction between the process, the veneers and the glue [3]. In industries designing and producing these products it is of interest to obtain better understanding of how processing- and material parameters affect the product quality. With an improved understanding of the material and processing parameters {{it may be possible to}} increase the efficiency of wood utilisation and promote the development of new processes and products that manipulate the viscoelastic nature of wood. In particular the possibilities to obtain narrower radius of curvature and better possibilities of bending in more than one plane would be advantageous. This study has focused on the moisture content (MC) and the grain angle orientation in the veneers. These two specific aspects were assumed to have a great influence on spring-back and distortions of the laminated bended veneer products. Spring-back and distortions were therefore studied in separate tests where MC and the grain angle orientation was varied separately in manufactured laminated bended wood products. After manufacturing the products were exposed to variations in humidity and temperature whereupon the spring-back and distortions were measuredThree tests were performed. For the first and the second test a seat shell was selected as test product, figure 1 a. To the third test another product was selected, figure 1 b. This product was a small bookshelf. The company producing this shelf had experienced large problems considering distortions of this product. Further the product was very simple in shape with only one bend and therefore suitable for measurements. In the first test the influence of MC of the veneers was investigated. In the second and third test the influence of grain angle of the veneers was studied. For the study veneers of birch and beech were selected in the production. For the first and third study only birch veneers were used. The veneers were initially conditioned to equilibrium moisture contents (EMC) according to setups in different test groups. For the first study a test group was also built up from veneers taken directly out of production to study the industrial conditions. The seat shells in this test group contained veneers conditioned to EMC 4 %, except for the surface veneers that had been stored in the production hall. The humidity and temperature conditions in this room corresponded to MC 7 %. The manufacturing of the products were performed in industrial conditions. In the tests the products were built up from a number of veneers and the studied factors were varied between the veneers in a controlled manner. The results from the first test showed that the MC of the veneers influenced the spring-back and the distortions. A large moisture gradient between veneers and especially unsymmetrical placements of these in the construction were especially critical. The results from the second and third tests showed that grain angle deviation has large effect on the distortions of the products. Even a small grain angle deviation as in study two (5 °) resulted in large problems with distortions. The study also showed that when crossing two or more veneers with deviating grain angles there were cases when these faults interacted and multiplied the distortions. In production grain angle deviations can be a result of inaccurate placement of the veneers during pressing, incorrect cutting of the veneers, inherent from the growth of the tree or a combination of these factors. Deviations of the grain angle were, however, shown to have only small effects on spring-back. Upprättat; 2011; 20130911 (ysko...|$|R
