5|$|John VI died in Lisbon in 1826. His elder son Peter, who had {{declared}} {{the independence of}} Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Peter I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Peter IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Peter abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> so Peter stated she would marry his brother Miguel who would act as regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started {{the period of the}} Liberal Wars.|$|E

Tulsidas mentions this in the Ramcharitmanas.|$|E
