25|$|When visiting {{friends or}} family and staying with them, all foreign {{visitors}} are required to register with the Aliens Department of the local MUP {{in the place of}} the intended stay, within twenty-four hours of entering the country. At the Department, they will fill in a form (a sort of a landing card) made of two parts (both parts should be filled in). The form is processed by the officer in charge and a stamped segment is returned to the applicant. Visitors should always have this certificate on them during the entire stay in the country together with their passport or (for certain nationals) ID card. Foreigners who, at the time of registering with the police, know the date of their departure from Serbia, <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> it to the officer processing their registration in order to avoid additional visit to the same police department for de-registration. The registration is free of charge. At passport control at the port of exit, the certificate is collected by the immigration officer. Failing to complete the registration may result in fines.|$|E
500|$|Cresswell was not {{buried at}} Knockholt and was {{possibly}} interred in the Bridewell graveyard. Several accounts claim {{that in her}} will she left £10 for a sermon to be read that said nothing ill of her. After a long search, a young clergyman prepared to perform the funeral rites was found. Following a lengthy sermon on social morality, he intoned: [...] "By {{the will of the}} deceased it is expected that I <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> her and say nothing but what was well of her. All I shall say of her, therefore, is this– she was born well, lived well, and died well; for she was born with the name of Cresswell, lived at Clerkenwell, and died in Bridewell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{gave the}} film very mixed to {{negative}} reviews. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "This family film {{is willing to}} tackle important issues such as burgeoning sexuality, alcoholism and a troubled home life but does so in a bland and unconvincing story." [...] However, the film's technical qualities were praised. Both The Hollywood Reporter and the St. Paul Pioneer Press felt the story was slow and contrived. The Los Angeles Times called the film flawed, and placed the blame squarely on the screenplay for not knowing whether to depict a Disney-esque innocent adventure or a real world that confronted a teenager's emerging sexuality, a father's alcoholism, and the break-up of a marriage. The Deseret News called the film [...] "hokey" [...] and felt the direction {{and some of the}} performances were amateurish. The newspaper labeled the score as [...] "one of the worst musical scores in recent memory", and felt the period songs were [...] "ill-chosen". The Minneapolis Star Tribune was particularly harsh in its criticism. The newspaper felt the picture was [...] "insulting to your child's intelligence, veer wildly between broad humor (and I <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that there is literally not one funny scene in this whole movie), sugary nostalgia and the worst melodrama", and [...] "fraught with leaden direction and horrible acting".|$|E
