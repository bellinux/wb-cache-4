5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, {{an all-night}} vigil is celebrated in the churches {{dedicated}} to the saint, as is celebrated in other Orthodox churches on the eves of their patron saints' feasts. The liturgical celebration of Vladimir's feast day begins on the evening of 21May, because, in the Orthodox Church, the liturgical day is reckoned from one evening to the next. Despite the name of the service, the all-night vigil is usually not held throughout the entire night, and may last only for two hours. In the Church of StJovan Vladimir near Elbasan, it lasts from 9 pm to 3 am. Hymns either to Jovan Vladimir or to another saint whose commemoration falls on 22May, are chanted, on that liturgical day, at <b>set</b> <b>points</b> during services in all Orthodox churches.|$|E
5|$|This match {{featured}} the longest ever first set (and the longest ever tiebreak) in a men's championship match; the 87-minute first set, won by Murray, included four breaks of {{serve in the}} first four games of the match, a 54-shot rally in the sixth game, and the 24-minute tiebreak which lasted up until 12–10; additionally, the tiebreak included two 30-shot rallies. Murray required six <b>set</b> <b>points</b> to win the first set, and required five sets to win the match. Murray said that a toilet break {{at the end of the}} fourth set helped him to restore his concentration after Djokovic took the third and fourth sets.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Ivan Lendl {{agreed to}} return to his former role as Murray's coach. Murray started his grass season at the 2016 Aegon Championships as the 1st seed and the {{defending}} champion. Murray defeated Nicolas Mahut in straight sets despite facing a set point in the first set and three <b>set</b> <b>points</b> in the second set. He then defeated his countryman Aljaž Bedene in straight sets. He then had three set wins over Kyle Edmund, another countryman, and No. 5 seed Marin Čilić. In the final he was down a set and a break to 3rd seed Milos Raonic. Murray still managed to come back and win a record 5th Queen's Club Championships and it was also his 2nd title in 2016. Murray then played at the third major of the year at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships as the 2nd seed. Murray had straight set wins over Liam Broady, Lu Yen-hsun, John Millman, and Nick Kyrgios in the first four rounds. Murray then defeated 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five sets in the quarterfinal and 10th seed Tomáš Berdych in straight sets to reach his third straight major final. In the final on 10 July, Murray defeated Raonic in straight sets to win his second Wimbledon title and third Major title overall. His Wimbledon crown was his 3rd title of the season and 38th career Tour title.|$|E
50|$|Spring-loaded {{pressure}} {{safety valves}} use a compressed spring {{to hold the}} valve closed. The valve will remain closed until the process pressure exceeds the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> of the spring pressure. The valve will open 100% when the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is reached and will remain open until a certain blow down factor is reached. Oftentimes the blow down is {{a percentage of the}} <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> such as 20% of the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> That means that the valve will remain open until the process pressure decreases to 20% below the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> of the spring-loaded relief valve.|$|R
50|$|The HIV <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is the viral load of {{a person}} {{infected}} with HIV, which stabilizes {{after a period of}} acute HIV infection. The <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is reached after the immune system has developed specific Cytotoxic T cells and begins to attempt to fight the virus. The higher the viral load of the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> the faster the virus will progress to AIDS; the lower the viral load of the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> the longer the patient will remain in clinical latency. The only effective way to lower the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is through highly active antiretroviral therapy. The <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is not completely fixed and constant, but can be quite dynamic with significant fluctuations.|$|R

5|$|After these losses Cochet {{took two}} weeks off to recover. Despite {{the rest in}} the 1931 Wimbledon Championships he shocked the tennis world by losing {{in the very first}} round to Nigel Sharpe. In the mixed doubles Cochet and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall were not more successful, falling in the fourth round. The doubles final {{remained}} unconquered for Brugnon and Cochet as the team of George Lott and John Van Ryn came back from 3–2 down in the fifth set to win the match. In July the Four Musketeers were ready to be challenged for the fifth time in the Davis Cup final. This time the opponent was the British Davis Cup team. In the first rubber Cochet was facing two <b>set</b> <b>points</b> for a two sets-love lead by Bunny Austin but fought back to claim the second set and won the next two for the match. Fred Perry battled through Borotra while the doubles were won by Cochet and Brugnon. Austin brought back the British hopes after a four set victory over the exhausted Borotra. The match was suspended multiple times due to rain, which made the court almost unsuitable for playing, which left its mark on the deciding rubber between Cochet and Perry. The recurring slight rain in the first set led Perry to drop the set from a 4–1 advantage. The second set went to Perry after he utilized passing shots as a counter for Cochet's net play. The third and fourth set however were taken by Cochet which gave the French team its fifth successive Davis Cup.|$|E
25|$|At the 2008 Sony Ericsson Open, Miami, {{they met}} in a final for the first time. Serena won in three sets. They played again in the final, and again in USA – at the US Open in 2008. Serena won in two sets. In the 2nd set Janković had 5–3 and 3 {{consecutive}} <b>set</b> <b>points</b> on Serena serve. Later, when she was serving for the set at 5–4, she missed one more set point. However, Serena saved all <b>set</b> <b>points</b> and won four {{games in a row}} for US Open title.|$|E
25|$|Dementieva was seeded fifth at the Australian Open, {{the first}} Grand Slam {{event of the}} year. She {{defeated}} Vera Dushevina of Russia in the 1st round. In the second round she lost to wild card, former world No. 1, and eventual finalist Justine Henin, 5–7, 6–7 (6), despite having two <b>set</b> <b>points</b> in the first set, and one set point at 6–5 in the second set tie-break.|$|E
50|$|The book {{features}} short anecdotes from {{followers of}} the diet who had heard of it through Roberts' blog or The New York Times. Roberts' diet {{is based on the}} fundamental principle of a <b>set</b> <b>point</b> - the weight which, according to Roberts, a person's brain strives to maintain. When actual weight is below the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite increases; when actual weight is above the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite decreases. Furthermore, eating certain foods can raise or lower the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Foods that have a strong flavor-calorie relationship (such as fast food or donuts) raise the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> whereas bland foods which are slowly digested (like extra light olive oil or fructose mixed with water) lower the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Roberts states that the diet is based upon connecting two unconnected fields: weight control and associative learning. Because of this, the research behind the diet is from multiple fields, ranging from Pavlovian psychology to physiology to rat psychology.|$|R
50|$|Self-regulating {{heat tracing}} tapes are cable whose {{resistance}} varies with temperature - low resistance for temperatures below the cable <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and high resistance for temperatures above the cable <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> When the cable temperature reaches the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> the resistance goes high and then no more heat is supplied. This means heat is only supplied where needed {{along the length}} of the cable.|$|R
40|$|Using an {{improved}} valve design developed under an SBIR contract with Stennis Space Center, Marotta Scientific's PRV 95 provides stability {{over the entire}} operational range, from fully closed to fully open. The valve employs a concept known as upstream control for valve positioning, making it more dependable with excellent repeatability and minimal lag time. The PRV 95 design is unique {{in its ability to}} maintain a seal near the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> of the relief limit. Typically, relief valves seal tightly up to 90 percent <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and then reseat when pressure is reduced to 85 percent of <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> This new technology maintains seal integrity until 98 percent of <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and will reseat at 95 to 97 percent of <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> This allows the operator to protect a system without exceeding its limits...|$|R
25|$|Tsonga, {{the sixth}} seed, retired with an {{adductor}} muscle injury from his French Open third-round match against Latvia's Ernests Gulbis {{when he was}} leading 5–2 in the first set. This injury also forced Tsonga {{to pull out of}} the 2016 Aegon Championships. Tsonga took part in Wimbledon, where he lost in the quarterfinals to the second seed Andy Murray in five sets, after holding three <b>set</b> <b>points</b> in the first set and having a break point at the start of the final set.|$|E
25|$|Her successes at Wimbledon continued. She lost in {{the semifinals}} to Lindsay Davenport 4–6, 2–6. Jelena reached the fourth round of the US Open, where she lost to Serena Williams 6–7, 0–6 after holding two <b>set</b> <b>points</b> in the first set tiebreaker. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, {{representing}} Australia, she lost to Monica Seles in the bronze medal match 1–6, 4–6. In doubles, she teamed with Rennae Stubbs, but they {{lost in the}} second round. Dokic finished the year at world No. 26.|$|E
25|$|In the men's draw, nineteen-year-old Latvian, unseeded Ernests Gulbis was {{the first}} player to qualify for the round of eight, by {{defeating}} Michaël Llodra in straight sets. He was followed by Novak Djoković, who defeated Paul-Henri Mathieu 6–4, 6–3, 6–4, to reach his third consecutive quarterfinal in Roland-Garros, Nicolás Almagro, whose opponent, the French wild card Jérémy Chardy held <b>set</b> <b>points</b> in all three sets, but eventually lost on the score of 7–6(0), 7–6(7), 7–5, and ATP No. 2 and defending champion Rafael Nadal, who crushed compatriot and twenty-second seed Fernando Verdasco 6–1, 6–0, 6–2, in little less than two hours.|$|E
5000|$|Roberts {{argued that}} weight is {{controlled}} by maintaining body fat at a certain amount, {{referred to as a}} [...] "set point." [...] When weight is above the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite decreases, and it takes less food to feel full. When weight is below the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> appetite increases, and it takes more food to feel full. He further stated that eating strongly flavored foods (like soda or donuts) can raise the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> whereas flavorless foods (like sugar water, canola oil, extra light olive oil) can lower the <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> These flavorless foods must be consumed in a [...] "flavorless window," [...] at least one hour after and one hour before consuming flavors. Consumption of 100-500 flavorless calories per day lowers the <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> and therefore, lowers weight.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} known ways {{to build a}} <b>set</b> of <b>point</b> on an Edwards curve: the <b>set</b> of affine <b>points,</b> the <b>set</b> of {{projective}} <b>points,</b> the <b>set</b> of inverted <b>points,</b> the <b>set</b> of extended <b>points</b> and the <b>set</b> of completed <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the {{happiness}} <b>set</b> <b>point</b> can be applied in clinical psychology to help patients return to their hedonic <b>set</b> <b>point</b> when negative events happen. Determining when someone is mentally distant from their happiness <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and what events trigger those changes can be extremely helpful in treating conditions such as depression. When a change occurs, clinical psychologists work with patients {{to recover from the}} depressive spell and return to their hedonic <b>set</b> <b>point</b> more quickly. Because acts of kindness often promote long-term well-being, one treatment method is to provide patients with different altruistic activities that can help a person raise his or her hedonic <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> This can in turn be helpful in reducing reckless habits in the pursuit of well-being. Further, helping patients understand that long-term happiness is relatively stable throughout one's life can help to ease anxiety surrounding impactful events.|$|R
25|$|A game point {{occurs in}} tennis {{whenever}} {{the player who}} is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, <b>set</b> <b>points,</b> and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.|$|E
25|$|The chair umpire was Lars Graff of Sweden. Both players {{began the}} match {{strongly}} {{with the first}} eleven games of the first set going with serve. However, with Federer serving at 5-6, Roddick broke {{to take the first}} set. Perhaps the most critical moment of the match was in the second set tiebreaker when Roddick led 6-2 with four <b>set</b> <b>points</b> to take a commanding lead. Federer subsequently reeled off six consecutive points to even the match at one set a piece. The most memorable moment of the tiebreaker was when Roddick served at 6-5 set point and botched a back-hand volley wide to even up the tiebreaker.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{gameplay}} {{alterations in}} Ties That Bind concern pickups. Firstly, Torque {{can no longer}} stockpile Xombium bottles, allowing the player to refill their health whenever they wish. Instead, Torque must rely on stationary Xombium located at <b>set</b> <b>points</b> throughout the game. Secondly, the player is limited to carrying only two weapons at any given time, although is free to choose which two; the play may carry two melee weapons, two guns, or one of each. Also, whereas in the first game, Torque could only dual-wield the handgun, in Ties That Bind, he can dual-wield any one handed weapon, including the sawed-off shotgun. Guns {{can also be used}} to inflict minor melee damage.|$|E
50|$|A {{thermostat}} on {{a heater}} {{is an example}} of control that is on or off.

There is no measurement of the difference between the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and the measured temperature (e.g. no error measurement) and no adjustment to the rate at which heat is added other than all or none.|$|R
40|$|<b>Set</b> <b>point</b> viral load in HIV {{patients}} ranges {{over several}} {{orders of magnitude}} and is a key determinant of disease progression in HIV. A number of recent studies have reported high heritability of <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral load implying that viral genetic factors contribute substantially to the overall variation in viral load. The high heritability is surprising given the diversity of host factors associated with controlling viral infection. Here we develop an analytical model that describes the temporal changes {{of the distribution of}} <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral load as a function of heri-tability. This model shows that high heritability is the most parsimonious explanation for the observed variance of <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral load. Our results thus not only reinforce the credibility of previous estimates of heritability but also shed new light onto mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. Author Summary Following an initial peak in viremia, the viral load in HIV infected patients settles down to a <b>set</b> <b>point</b> which remains more or less stable during chronic HIV infection. This <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral load {{is one of the key}} factors determining the rate of disease progression. The exten...|$|R
40|$|In a cybernetic or feedback-controlled system, some {{variable}} is maintained around a predetermined level, variously {{known as the}} <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> null point, or the quiescent value [1 – 6]. Perhaps the example most familiar to us is {{the role played by}} the thermostat in our home heating system. Any description of a cybernetic system that omits the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is incomplete. Sodium homeostasis, especially the control of extracellular fluid volume, provides an excellent example of a feedback-controlled system. The afferent and efferent limbs of this system have received considerable attention, but the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> has received remarkably little emphasis—an omission that has led to inevitable confusion. I will focus, therefore, on the definition of the normal <b>set</b> <b>point</b> for sodium balance and on the implications of the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> for a number of related disciplines. Only a few examples of the implications will be cited, but those interested in the field will find many more...|$|R

She reached the final after {{defeating}} Elena Vesnina, Ysaline Bonaventure, eighth seed Roberta Vinci and surprise qualifier Samantha Crawford. She faced fourth seed Angelique Kerber in the final and won the title without losing a set in the entire tournament. This was her eighteenth WTA title and her first since the 2013 Western & Southern Open. At the Australian Open, Azarenka was seeded 14th and reached the quarterfinals without dropping a set, including a double-bagel win over Alison Van Uytvanck. However, in her quarterfinal match she was defeated in straight sets by seventh seed and eventual champion Angelique Kerber, who had never defeated Azarenka in their previous six matches. Azarenka was ahead in the second set but failed to convert five <b>set</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E

25|$|Williams's {{next stop}} was the 2012 Summer Olympics Games {{which was held}} at the All England Club, Wimbledon. She entered the women's singles and women's doubles events, partnering with sister Serena in doubles. In singles, Williams {{defeated}} Sara Errani and Aleksandra Wozniak in convincing fashion to reach the third round where she faced Angelique Kerber. She lost to Kerber in two tiebreaks despite having three <b>set</b> <b>points</b> and leading 5–1 in the tiebreak in the first set. In doubles, the unseeded Williams sisters advanced to the final, which was a repeat of their final at Wimbledon against Hlaváčková and Hradecká. The sisters won their third gold medal in doubles after defeating the Czech pair in straight sets. With the win (and Serena's win in the singles event), the Williams sisters claimed the most Olympic gold medals than any other tennis player, male or female.|$|E
50|$|A {{thermostat}} on {{a heater}} {{is an example}} of open loop control that is on or off.

50|$|Shivering (also called shuddering) is a bodily {{function}} {{in response to}} early hypothermia or just feeling cold in warm-blooded animals. When the core body temperature drops, the shivering reflex is triggered to maintain homeostasis. Skeletal muscles begin to shake in small movements, creating warmth by expending energy. Shivering {{can also be a}} response to a fever, as a person may feel cold. During fever the hypothalamic <b>set</b> <b>point</b> for temperature is raised. The increased <b>set</b> <b>point</b> causes the body temperature to rise (pyrexia), but also makes the patient feel cold until the new <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is reached. Severe chills with violent shivering are called rigors. Rigors occur because the patient's body is shivering in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new <b>set</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

25|$|The game uses several {{different}} level types and layouts. The game starts {{out in a}} front yard, and progresses to nighttime levels, where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added. The final levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (on the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a mad scientist {{who is also a}} zombie known as Dr. Zomboss). At <b>set</b> <b>points</b> throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by Crazy Dave to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come up on a small selection, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.|$|E
25|$|Their {{next meeting}} at a Grand Slam was {{again at the}} Australian Open, in the 2010 quarterfinals, exactly two {{years to the day}} since Djokovic {{defeated}} Tsonga to win his first Grand Slam singles title. However, this time it was Tsonga who prevailed, winning in five sets after Djokovic fell ill during the match. It was not until another year and a half until they met again, with the stakes even higher, in the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2011, with the winner advancing to his first Wimbledon final. It was their first meeting on grass, and Djokovic prevailed in four sets to advance to his first Wimbledon final, and in the process ending the seven-and-a-half-year reign of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal {{at the top of the}} rankings. At the 2012 French Open, Tsonga and Djokovic met again in an important match, in the quarterfinals. After losing the first set, Tsonga rallied to take the next two sets and held two match points on Djokovic's serve in the fourth set before the Serb fought back to force a tie-break. Despite the Frenchman's saving <b>set</b> <b>points</b> in the breaker, Djokovic took one at the third opportunity. This forced a deciding set, which Tsonga lost after more than four hours of play.|$|E
25|$|After a {{slow start}} at the {{beginning}} of the season, Seles went on a 36-match winning streak and won 6 consecutive tournaments starting in Miami at the Lipton Player's Championships. During that winning streak she also won the U.S. Hard Court Championships (San Antonio, Texas), the Eckerd Open (Tampa, Florida), the Italian Open, and the Lufthansa Cup in Berlin, Germany (defeating Steffi Graf in the final in straight sets). Seles then won her first Grand Slam singles title at the 1990 French Open. Facing world no. 1 Steffi Graf in the final, Seles saved four <b>set</b> <b>points</b> in a first set tiebreaker, which she won 8–6, and went on to take the match in straight sets. In doing so, she became the youngest-ever French Open singles Champion at the age of 16 years, 6 months.

Seles then won the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles title against Martina Navratilova and then defeated Navratilova again in winning the Oakland California tournament, in straight sets. She also won the 1990 year-end Virginia Slims Championships, defeating Gabriela Sabatini in five sets (in the first five-set women's match since 1901 US National Championships), becoming the youngest to ever win the Season-Ending Championships.
