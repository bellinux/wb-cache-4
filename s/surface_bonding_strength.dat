40|$|This report {{covers the}} second year of a project {{investigating}} water-gas shift catalysts for use in membrane reactors. It has been established that a simple iron high temperature shift catalyst becomes ineffective in a membrane reactor because the reaction rate is severely inhibited by the build-up of the product CO{sub 2 }. During the past year, an improved microkinetic model for water-gas shift over iron oxide was developed. Its principal advantage over prior models is that it displays the correct asymptotic behavior at all temperatures and pressures as the composition approaches equilibrium. This model has been used to explore whether {{it might be possible to}} improve the performance of iron high temperature shift catalysts under conditions of high CO{sub 2 } partial pressure. The model predicts that weakening the <b>surface</b> oxygen <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> by less than 5 % should lead to higher catalytic activity as well as resistance to rate inhibition at higher CO{sub 2 } partial pressures. Two promoted iron high temperature shift catalysts were studied.

40|$|Aim of the investigation was to assess the effect of different surface treatments on the <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of veneering ceramics to zirconia. In a  shear  test,  the  influences  of  polishing,  sandblasting,  and  silica-coating  of  the  zirconia  <b>surface</b>  on  <b>bonding</b>  were {{assessed}} with  five  different  veneering  ceramics. In  addition  the  effect  of  liner  application  was  examined. With  one veneering ceramic,  the impact of regeneration firing of zirconia was also evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA and post hoc Scheffé’s test. Failure in every case occurred in the veneering ceramic adjacent to the interface with a thin layer of ceramic remaining on the  zirconia  <b>surface,</b>  indicating  that  <b>bond</b>  <b>strength</b>  was  higher  than  the  cohesive  strength  of  the  veneering  ceramic. Shear strength ranged from  23. 5 ± 3. 4 MPa to  33. 0 ± 6. 8 MPa without explicit correlation to the respective surface treatment. Regeneration firing significantly decreased the shear strength of both polished and sandblasted surfaces. Findings of  this  study  revealed  that  bonding  between  veneering  ceramics  and  zirconia  might  be  based  on  chemical bonds. On  this  note,  sandblasting  was  not  a  necessary  surface  pretreatment  to  enhance  <b>bond</b>  <b>strength</b>  and  that regeneration firing was not recommended...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of multiple decontamination procedures for salivary contamination after curing of a universal adhesive on dentin <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> according to its etch modes. Materials and Methods Forty-two extracted bovine incisors were trimmed by exposing the labial dentin surfaces and embedded in cylindrical molds. A universal adhesive (All-Bond Universal, Bisco) was used. The teeth were randomly divided into groups according to etch mode and decontamination procedure. The adhesive was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions for a given etch mode. With the exception of the control groups, the cured adhesive was contaminated with saliva for 20 sec. In the self-etch group, the teeth were divided into three groups: control, decontamination with rinsing and drying, and decontamination with rinsing, drying, and adhesive. In the etch-and-rinse group, the teeth were divided into four groups: control, decontamination with rinsing and drying, decontamination with rinsing, drying, and adhesive, and decontamination with rinsing, drying, re-etching, and reapplication of adhesive. A composite resin (Filtek Z 350 XT, 3 M ESPE) was used for filling and was cured on the treated <b>surfaces.</b> Shear <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> was measured, and failure modes were evaluated. The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variation and Tukey's HSD test. Results The etch-and-rinse subgroup that was decontaminated by rinse, drying, re-etching, and reapplication of adhesive showed a significantly higher <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> Conclusions When salivary contamination occurs after curing of the universal adhesive, additional etching improves the <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> to dentin...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of load transfer from matrix to fiber though the interface and, as a consequence, {{the effects of}} the interface on composite structural integrity are discussed. Specifically, the present work deals with the role of interfacial <b>bonding</b> in composite <b>strength,</b> the dependence of fracture <b>surface</b> on interface <b>bond</b> <b>strength,</b> and methods of measuring and predicting the stress at the interface, the microresidual stress, and load condition effects on the interface bond. The possibility of designing composites with specified bond properties is examined. Many of these effects are illustrated graphically to indicate general trends and to illustrate significant points. The discussion is based on theoretical considerations and is supplemented with pertinent experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The bonding {{structure}} and binding character {{for the initial}} stage of thin film growth of Ni on a rutile(110) surface are studied using first principles density functional theory. Our results show that, in the first monolayer, Ni atoms are preferentially adsorbed on top of bridging oxygen atoms, and upon secondary <b>surface</b> oxygen. The <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> between Ni adatom and substrate is much stronger than that between Ni adatoms. About 0. 3 electrons are transferred from Ni atoms to substrate in low coverage; the adsorption of additional Ni atoms on neighboring sites decreases this transfer. In addition to the ionic bonding component, some covalent character {{is found in the}} Ni adatom-substrate bond...|$|R
