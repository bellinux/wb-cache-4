50|$|Flood {{prevention}} {{work was}} carried out on Sandwell Valley in the 1980s. Forge Mill Lake was created as a stormwater retention basin by enlarging an existing depression. The river was dredged to deepen it and the gravel used to construct {{an island in the}} lake. This evolved into part of a nature reserve, at present leased to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. At about the same time, a similar arrangement was constructed at Sheepwash Urban Park, utilising old brickworks excavations as a <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> to relieve flooding by the Oldbury Arm.|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} a {{feasibility}} study for a joint gravimetric and geometric survey of geophysical signals. As test area the TERENO alpine and prealpine Ammer observatory is chosen since this initiative {{is associated with the}} installation of instruments for measuring meteorological and hydrological quantities. Gravimetric and geometric signals, which occur in the TERENO area, are estimated from available measured data. At the beginning the theory of signals from solid Earth tide, ocean loading, pole tides, atmosphere and hydrology is outlined. The magnitudes of the expected signals are compared. It is distinguished between direct effects due to Newtonian attraction and indirect effects due to mass loading variations. Therefore the basics of mass loading calculations using Green’s functions are described. Hydrologic and atmospheric signals shall be measured with different measurement techniques; the other mentioned effects can be reduced by models. As gravimetric measurement techniques different gravimeter types and the GRACE mission are introduced. For measuring geometric signals spaceborne SAR (TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X) and GNSS are presented. The Scintrex CG- 3 M gravimeter, owned by the IAPG, was used for test measurements. First it was utilized as stationary instrument to investigate the influence of air pressure and drift. A field campaign was performed as a second experiment [...] It was measured above a <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> to simulate a groundwater change. A further test measurement was performed to validate ranges and azimuths measured in SAR-images against ranges and azimuths derived from corner reflector coordinates, determined by GPS measurements. This method is used to evaluate the accuracy level of absolute SAR measurements. Starting from the estimated signals and the experiences from the test measurements, different approaches are introduced for measuring atmospheric and hydrological signals using gravimetric and geometric techniques. For every approach the measurement configuration and the required instrumentation is described...|$|E

40|$|Ogden City is {{currently}} redeveloping an urban industrial and residential corridor {{adjacent to the}} Ogden River, involving land reclamation and restoration of the riverine corridor. In January 2010, Ogden City began restoration of 17 acres of riparian habitat and 1. 1 miles of river {{in an effort to}} improve river health, aesthetics, and public access. With an expected completion date of fall 2011, construction of the Ogden River Restoration Project has an estimated cost of more than $ 3. 5 million. Over 10 different landowners, multiple water users, flooding issues, future development needs, and other diverse interests have made project coordination difficult. Furthermore, multiple goals were incorporated into project planning and design in order to address these diverse community needs. Societal uses and demands of this river system reflect diverse and sometimes competing interests. For instance, the Ogden River must function as water supply, provide habitat and recreation, convey <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> and flood flows, and prevent flooding.

30|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{investigation}} of the <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> sedimentation <b>basin</b> (SSB) in Dürren (Allgäu region, Southern Germany), receiving road runoff from a nearby motorway (A 96) during rain fall events. The SSB represents an isolated <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> retention system for the treatment of polluted road runoff during rainfall events and has no connection to the municipal wastewater system. Its purpose is to clarify the incoming road runoff by means of sedimentation of suspended solids and traffic-related pollutants. The upper water fractions are then released by an outflow {{at one end of the}} SSB into the Argen River, a tributary of Lake Constance. Notably, heavy rainfall events may thus have a negative impact on the flora and fauna of the receiving stream due to the discharge of large volumes of potentially polluted water. Consequently, the resulting hydraulic shock loads may lead to an acute exposure of aquatic organisms to a complex mixture of traffic-related substances.|$|R
30|$|The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{forms the}} basis for a {{sustainable}} water management policy. With its implementation, the focus was addressed not only to measures like renaturations of stream systems but also to upgrades of wastewater treatment plants with the aim of improving the ecological conditions of streams and reducing discharges of trace pollutants into surface waters. In general, surface waters receive a large number of pollutants in low concentrations [1], especially due to the discharge of diffuse but also point sources like road runoffs in combination with <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> drainage systems. As a consequence, the aquatic fauna frequently experiences chronic exposure to low concentrations of harmful substances, which may result in a serious impairment of the health condition in the affected organisms. When it comes to the question of potential point sources, often little attention is given to <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> relief systems like <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> overflow <b>basins</b> (SOBs), <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> sedimentation <b>basins</b> (SSBs) or road runoff drainage systems. Particularly in the case of heavy rainfall events or enduring snowmelts, these systems gain further importance due to their massive discharge of untreated water (originating from municipal waste waters and road runoff) into the connected surface waters. These discharges contain a mixture of organic and inorganic contaminants that may cause multiple biological effects (e.g., estrogenic, genotoxic, cytotoxic, or carcinogenic effects) due to interactions with multiple target sites in the exposed organisms [2, 3]. Ellis et al. [4] reported that 30 % of total hydrocarbons and 50 % of the total suspended solids in urban drainage water originate from road runoff. Such runoff contains a complex mixture of pollutants as, e.g., hydrocarbons, dioxins, metals, de-icing salts, and halogenated phenols originating mainly from traffic and vehicle abrasion [5]. These compounds are of particular concern since {{it has been shown that}} they can lead to adverse effects in aquatic organisms [6 – 9]. Once they (especially those with hydrophobic properties) have been emitted, they can accumulate in sediments and biota. One particular problem is that contaminants in sediments rarely cause effects as single substances, but rather in concert with numerous others that are present in complex mixtures [10]. Furthermore, many contaminants accumulate in the sediments of rivers and reach concentrations far higher than those in the surrounding water. As a consequence, benthic organisms such as invertebrates or ground-living fish species run the risk of continuous exposure to both dissolved and sediment-bound contaminants [11].|$|R
30|$|The present work {{investigates the}} impact of {{discharges}} from a <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> sedimentation <b>basin</b> (SSB) receiving runoff from a connected motorway in southern Germany. The study lasted {{for almost two years}} and was aimed at assessing {{the impact of}} the SSB on the fauna of the Argen River, which is a tributary of Lake Constance. Two sampling sites were examined up- and downstream of the SSB effluent. A combination of different diagnostic methods (fish embryo test with the zebrafish, histopathology, micronucleus test) was applied to investigate health impairment and genotoxic effects in indigenous fish as well as embryotoxic potentials in surface water and sediment samples of the Argen River, respectively, in samples of the SSB effluent. In addition, sediment samples from the Argen River and tissues of indigenous fish were used for chemical analyses of 33 frequently occurring pollutants by means of gas chromatography. Furthermore, the integrity of the macrozoobenthos community and the fish population were examined at both investigated sampling sites.|$|R

In order to characterise the ecotoxicity of urban sediments from <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> detention <b>basins,</b> the sediments accumulated over a 6 -year period were sampled at five different points through {{the surface of a}} large detention basin localised in the east of Lyon, France.

They show that the ecotoxicological effect of the sediments over the basin is heterogeneous and greater in areas often flooded. They also show the relationship between, on one hand, the physical and chemical characteris- tics of the sediments and, on the other hand, their ecotoxicity. Lastly, they contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the dynam- ics of the pollution close to the bottom of detention basins, which can be useful for improving their design.

40|$|Mosquito feeding {{patterns}} identify vertebrate species potentially {{involved in}} the amplifi cation of West Nile virus. In New York, northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) were the predominant hosts in most habitats. Crow (Corvus sp.) blood meals were most frequently identifi ed from sewage treatment plant and <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> catch <b>basin</b> habitats. In the northeastern United States, Culex pipiens and Cx. restuans {{are the most important}} vectors of West Nile virus (WNV), according to the frequency of viral detection, vector competence, and their largely ornithophilic feeding habits (1 – 4). Mosquito feeding studies suggest that American robins (Turdus migratorius) are the preferred avian hosts that support enzootic transmission in the Northeast (4, 5). A shift in hosts from birds to mammals, including humans, as robins begin fall migratory movements is hypothesized to be responsible for the seasonal rise in human WNV cases (5). We identified blood meals of Culex mosquitoes collected in New York and found feeding patterns unlike those previously reported (4, 5).

40|$|Background Mosquitoes in {{the genus}} Culex {{are thought to}} play a major role as vectors in the {{transmission}} cycle of West Nile virus (WNV) and other arboviruses in the United States. Effective control of mosquitoes through larviciding and adulticiding is expensive for communities and should be guided by reliable surveillance data on the distribution of mosquito breeding habitats. However, few small to medium sized cities in rural areas of the midwestern United States have this type of baseline information available. Objective During the summer of 2004, we investigated the characteristics of Culex and other mosquito-breeding habitats in a rural central Wisconsin community with a population of approximately 19, 000. Such baseline information will aid in the development of rational strategies to control mosquito populations and prevent human exposure to WNV and other mosquito-transmitted viruses. Methods Mosquito larvae were collected and identified weekly from 14 below-ground <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> catch <b>basins</b> and 10 above-ground standing water sites distributed throughout the community.
