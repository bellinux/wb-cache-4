25|$|The {{water in}} the toilet bowl is {{connected}} to a pipe shaped like an upside-down U. One side of the U channel is arranged as a siphon tube longer than the {{water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the drain pipe limits the height of {{the water in the}} bowl before it flows down the drain. The water in the bowl acts as a barrier to <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> entering the building. <b>Sewer</b> <b>gas</b> escapes through a vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drainâ€”thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. <b>Sewer</b> <b>gas</b> is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning and fatalities {{are often}} caused by faulty vents and chimneys, {{or by the}} burning of charcoal indoors or in a confined space, such as a tent. Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning can result even from poorly-adjusted pilot lights. Traps are built into all domestic plumbing to keep <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> and hydrogen sulfide, out of interiors. Clothing emits tetrachloroethylene, or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after dry cleaning.|$|E
50|$|Fully vented <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> {{contribute}} to greenhouse gas emissions. Septic vent pipes can be fitted with filters that remove some odors.|$|R
5000|$|In plumbing, a trap is {{a device}} {{which has a}} shape that uses a bending path to capture water to prevent <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from {{entering}} buildings. In refinery applications, traps are used to prevent hydrocarbons and other dangerous gases from escaping outside through drains.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{unlike the}} {{plumbing}} trap, the catchbasin {{does not necessarily}} prevent <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> such as hydrogen sulfide and methane from escaping. However, in the United Kingdom, where they are called gully pots, they are designed as true water-filled traps and do block the egress of gases and rodents.|$|R
500|$|An 1883 Sanitary Order in Council {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} health risks defined Flat Bastion Road {{as one of the}} boundaries of the [...] "streets, ramps, roads, lanes, passages, alleys, stairs and public places" [...] within which the new regulations would apply. The Army Medical Department reported in 1889 that several cases of diphtheria had occurred in the married quarters on Flat Bastion Road. It turned out that the rainwater pipes from the roof were cracked. The pipes were connected directly to the sewer, and <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> was escaping into the rooms.|$|E
2500|$|Reported {{scientific}} {{interest in}} the manufacturing of gas produced by the natural decomposition of organic matter dates from [...] the 17th century, when Robert Boyle (1627-1691) and Stephen Hales (1677-1761) noted that disturbing the sediment of streams and lakes released flammable gas. In 1808 Sir Humphry Davy proved the presence of methane in the gases produced by cattle manure. In 1859 a leper colony in Bombay in India built the first anaerobic digester. In 1895, the technology was developed in Exeter, England, where a septic tank was used to generate gas for the <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> destructor lamp, a type of gas lighting. Also in England, in 1904, the first dual-purpose tank for both sedimentation and sludge treatment was installed in Hampton, London. In 1907, in Germany, a patent was issued for the Imhoff tank, an early form of digester.|$|E

5000|$|Excessive {{negative}} air pressure, {{behind a}} [...] "slug" [...] {{of water that}} is draining, can siphon water from traps at plumbing fixtures. Generally, a toilet outlet has the shortest trap seal, making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced siphonage. An empty trap can allow noxious <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> to enter a building.|$|R
5000|$|The Buchan trap was devised in the 19th {{century to}} stop the flow of <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> also known as miasmas. [...] It was {{believed}} that the disease cholera was an air born infection, not water born. The Buchan trap is normally found in the bottom of manholes or drop-shafts. It normally denotes the end point of the domestic property's sewer before it joins the main public sewer.|$|R
50|$|A blocked vent is a {{relatively}} common problem caused by anything from leaves, to dead animals, to ice dams in very cold weather, or a horizontal section of the venting system, sloped the wrong way and filled with water from rain or condensation. Symptoms range from bubbles in the toilet bowl when it is flushed, to slow drainage, {{and all the way}} to siphoned (empty) traps which allow <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> to enter the building.|$|R

An {{immaterial}} but visible {{being that}} inhabited {{the air when}} the air was an element and before it was fatally polluted with factory smoke, <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> and similar products of civilization. Sylphs were allied to gnomes, nymphs and salamanders, which dwelt, respectively, in earth, water and fire, all now insalubrious. Sylphs, like fowls of the air, were male and female, to no purpose, apparently, for if they had progeny they must have nested in accessible places, none of the chicks having ever been seen.|$|E

[...] With a flame generated by burning town <b>gas,</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> were drawn from the sewer below and discharged above the heads of passers-by to dissipate odours. The flame in the lamp does not actually generate sufficient thermal energy to combust any of the odour compounds in the air.|$|R
5000|$|Inverted siphons are {{commonly}} called traps for their function in preventing smelly <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from coming {{back out of}} drains and sometimes making dense objects like rings and electronic components retrievable after falling into a drain. Liquid flowing in one end simply forces liquid up {{and out the other}} end, but solids like sand will accumulate. This is especially important in sewage systems or culverts which must be routed under rivers or other deep obstructions where the better term is [...] "depressed sewer".|$|R
50|$|Alexhander Cumming (sometimes {{referred}} to as Alexander Cummings) FRSE (1733 -8 March 1814) was a Scottish watchmaker and instrument inventor, {{who was the first}} to patent a design of the flush toilet, that had been invented by Sir John Harrington. The S-trap (or bend) was invented by Cumming in 1775 to retain water permanently within the bowl, thus preventing <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from entering buildings. It survives in today's plumbing modified as a U- or J-shaped pipe trap located below or within a plumbing fixture.|$|R
6000|$|In China, to be brief, and {{to quote}} a ghost (who {{ought to know}} what he was {{speaking}} about), [...] "supernaturals are to be found everywhere." [...] This is the fact that makes life so puzzling and terrible to a child of a believing and trustful character. These Oriental bogies do not appear in the dark alone, or only in haunted houses, or at cross- roads, or in gloomy woods. They are everywhere: every man has his own ghost, every place has its peculiar haunting fiend, every natural phenomenon has its informing spirit; every quality, as hunger, greed, envy, malice, has an embodied visible shape prowling about seeking what it may devour. Where our science, for example, sees (or rather smells) <b>sewer</b> <b>gas,</b> the Japanese behold a slimy, meagre, insatiate wraith, crawling to devour the lives of men. Where we see a storm of snow, their livelier fancy beholds a comic snow-ghost, a queer, grinning old man under a vast umbrella.|$|E
60|$|Weatherbee was a clerk who {{had known}} naught but clerking all his life; Cuthfert was a master of arts, a dabbler in oils, and had written not a little. The one was a lower-class man who {{considered}} himself a gentleman, {{and the other was}} a gentleman who knew himself to be such. From this it may be remarked that a man can be a gentleman without possessing the first instinct of true comradeship. The clerk was as sensuous as the other was aesthetic, and his love adventures, told at great length and chiefly coined from his imagination, affected the supersensitive master of arts {{in the same way as}} so many whiffs of <b>sewer</b> <b>gas.</b> He deemed the clerk a filthy, uncultured brute, whose place was in the muck with the swine, and told him so; and he was reciprocally informed that he was a milk-and-water sissy and a cad. Weatherbee could not have defined 'cad' for his life; but it satisfied its purpose, which after all seems the main point in life.|$|E

50|$|In the {{developed}} world, sewers are pipes from buildings {{to one or}} more levels of larger underground trunk mains, which transport the sewage to sewage treatment facilities. Vertical pipes, usually made of precast concrete, called manholes, connect the mains to the surface. Depending upon site application and use, these vertical pipes can be cylindrical, eccentric or concentric. The manholes are used for access to the sewer pipes for inspection and maintenance, and as a means to vent <b>sewer</b> <b>gases.</b> They also facilitate vertical and horizontal angles in otherwise straight pipelines.|$|R

50|$|An island fixture vent {{provides}} an elegant solution for this necessity: when the drain is opened, water displaces the <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> {{up to the}} sanitary tee, the water flows downward while <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> is displaced upward and toward the vent. The vent can also provide air to fill any vacuum created.|$|E
50|$|In {{plumbing}} a {{smoke test}} forces non-toxic, artificially created smoke through waste and drain pipes under a slight pressure to find leaks. Plumes of smoke form {{where there are}} defects. This test can be performed when the plumbing is brand new, but more often {{it is used to}} find <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> leaks that may plague a building or an area. Any sign of smoke escaping can be considered a possible site for <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> to escape. <b>Sewer</b> <b>gas</b> typically has a rotten egg smell and can contain methane gas, which is explosive, or hydrogen sulfide gas, which is deadly.|$|E
50|$|Biogas {{forming in}} sewers via {{anaerobic}} digestion {{can be a}} potentially foul-smelling and explosive hazard (chiefly due to chemical spills). Unlike ordinary gas lamps for street lighting, {{the main purpose of}} <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> destructor lamps is to remove sewer gases and their hazards. Joseph Edmund Webb of Birmingham patented a <b>sewer</b> <b>gas</b> destructor lamp.|$|E
2500|$|Flush toilets usually {{incorporate}} an [...] "S", [...] "U", [...] "J", or [...] "P" [...] shaped bend (called a trap, such as P trap or S trap) {{that causes}} {{the water in the}} toilet bowl to collect and act as a seal against <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> (trapping the gases). Since flush toilets are typically not designed to handle waste on site, their drain pipes must be connected to waste conveyance and waste treatment systems. When a toilet is flushed, the wastewater flows into a septic tank or sewage system and from there to a sewage treatment plant.|$|R
5000|$|All {{plumbing}} waste fixtures use traps {{to prevent}} <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> from leaking into the house. Through traps, all fixtures {{are connected to}} waste lines, which in turn take the waste to a [...] "soil stack", or [...] "soil vent pipe". At the building drain system's lowest point, the drain-waste vent is attached, and rises (usually inside a wall) to {{and out of the}} roof. Waste exits from the building through the building's main drain and flows through a sewage line, which leads to a septic system or a public sewer. Cesspits are generally prohibited in developed areas.|$|R

5000|$|The venting system, or {{plumbing}} vents, {{consists of}} a number of pipes leading from waste pipes to the outdoors, usually through the roof. Vents provide a means to release <b>sewer</b> <b>gases</b> outside instead of inside the house. Vents also admit oxygen to the waste system to allow aerobic sewage digestion, and to discourage noxious anaerobic decomposition. Vents provide a way to equalize the pressure on both sides of a trap, thereby allowing the trap to hold the water which is needed to maintain effectiveness of the trap, and avoiding [...] "trap suckout" [...] which otherwise might occur.|$|R
40|$|Risks of {{exposure}} to toxic gases are well recognized during work in sewers, the principal hazards resulting from hypoxia due to the accumulation of methane, carbon dioxide, or hydrogen sulfide and explosive risk {{as a result of}} flammable gases. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a colourless rotten egg odour gas resulting from organic matter decomposition. The severity of H 2 S intoxication depends on the concentration and duration {{of exposure}} and the outcome may be fatal. We report the case of a 59 -year-old male patient who was acutely exposed to <b>sewers</b> <b>gases</b> following an accidental leak in a swine facility nearly eighteen hours before. He presented to the emergency room with respiratory complaints and chest pain, and rapidly developed a multi-organ dysfunction syndrome with severe cardio-respiratory failure. No methaemoglobinemia was detected and H 2 S was presumed to be the major implicated toxic substance. Treatment strategy relied mostly on supportive measures with a successful outcome. Approach to victims {{of exposure to}} <b>sewers</b> <b>gases</b> should recall the strong possibility of poisoning by H 2 S, a life-threatening condition. Since laboratorial dosing of sulfide compounds is not readily available, the initial approach is based on a high clinical suspicion. H 2 S direct toxicity and cellular hypoxic induction may rapidly lead to multi-organic dysfunction and death. Evidence from case reports suggests that early treatment with nitrites, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and hydroxocobalamin may be beneficial. To the present date, supportive treatment remains the mainstay of care...|$|R
