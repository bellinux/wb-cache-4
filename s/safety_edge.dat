50|$|A {{relatively}} inexpensive countermeasure is {{the placement of}} a <b>Safety</b> <b>Edge</b> — a 30° compacted taper {{on the edge of}} the pavement. This helps any driver that runs off the edge of the roadway to maintain control while trying to steer back onto the pavement. A vertical edge dropoff often results in overcorrection, leading to a head-on collision, rollover, or a run-off-road collision on the far side of the road. Pavement edge dropoffs are problematic on roads where the hard shoulder is narrow or nonexistent. The <b>safety</b> <b>edge</b> adds about 1% to the pavement costs while building or resurfacing a road.|$|E

Five models are produced for both straight, curved and external staircases, with all units run on a rail fitted to the stair tread and powered via a mains-charged battery. The lift is controlled by a control pod or a joystick attached to {{the arm of the}} seat (depending on the model), together with a remote controller. All models are fitted with a seatbelt and <b>safety</b> <b>edges,</b> which will stop the lift if an obstruction is encountered. The Solus and Sofia models are also fitted with a seat load sensor, which prevents movement of the lift unless the occupant is safely seated.|$|R

They had {{to reduce the}} workforce dramatically and discontinue or divest businesses. In 1994 FRABA launched the first opto-electronic <b>safety</b> <b>edge</b> (OSE). In {{the second half of}} the 1990s, FRABA focused on and invested in higher educated people. In 1998, the turnaround into a new business venture was completed. The firm was restructured into a group of independent companies combined by a common mission and guiding principles. Since 1997 the company is growing on average by 10% per annum with POSITAL (stands for POSItion digiTAL) industrial encoders and VITECTOR (stands for VITa protECTOR) door safety sensors. Over the years FRABA opened subsidiaries and relocated business. In August 2000 the first foreign subsidiary opened in Princeton, USA. In 2007 FRABA opened their manufacturing plant CONISTICS in Slubice, Poland. The first Asian subsidiary was opened in 2009 in Singapore. In 2011 the R&D department of FRABA, CENTITECH moved to Aachen, Germany and FRABA Holding office opened in Heerlen, The Netherlands. The workforce grew to 120 people. In 2015 the Shanghai office is opened by POSITAL FRABA.|$|E
5000|$|The AAA Foundation is also {{recognized}} {{as a leader in}} promoting the idea of Traffic Safety Culture; that is, a social climate in which traffic safety is highly valued and rigorously pursued. Since 2008, the AAA Foundation has published its annual Traffic Safety Culture Index in an effort to benchmark and track key indicators of the public's beliefs and attitudes toward highway safety. Information is collected through a nationally representative telephone survey that measures both attitudes and behaviors regarding, among other things, drinking and driving, cell phone use/texting behind the wheel, speeding, and seatbelt use. Additionally, the AAA Foundation partners with the Western Transportation Institute at Montana State University and other highway safety leaders to convene the annual National Summit for Rural Traffic Safety Culture. The Summit serves as a national gathering of transportation experts dedicated to improving safety on rural roadways, where fatality rates can be 2-3 times higher than they are on urban roads. [...] AAA Foundation projects have also been used to help strengthen laws, build public awareness of safety concerns and trends, and advise transportation agencies and highway departments on roadway improvement needs. For example, a 2006 report, Safety Impacts of Pavement Edge Drop-offs documented and analyzed the effects such drop-offs have on roadway departure crashes. The study was cited by the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Safety in its promotion of a cost-effective technology known as the <b>Safety</b> <b>Edge,</b> one of nine countermeasures FHWA considers proven to reduce motor vehicle crashes and improve safety. Other recent research includes a 2010 report, Parents, Teens and the Learner Stage of Graduated Driver Licensing, which found that despite the safety benefits seen as a result of implementing GDL laws, teen drivers may still not be getting sufficient supervised driving practice, and may not be getting enough experience driving under the range of conditions motorists face, such as during periods of inclement weather. The study received considerable news coverage, as did another 2010 report, Asleep at the Wheel: The Prevalence and Impact of Drowsy Driving, which found that drowsiness may be a bigger factor in crashes than previously believed. The study estimates that 16.5 percent of fatal crashes involve a drowsy driver.|$|E

40|$|Pavement edge {{drop-off}} is {{the vertical}} difference in elevation between the paved roadway and the adjacent ground. It {{is a serious}} safety concern for vehicles that goes off the track and encounters a drop-off. The errant vehicles, in order to restore their position back on the paved road, exert a greater amount of force which may result in loss of control for the driver. This may indicate {{an increase in the}} possibility of lane departure crashes, rollovers or head on collisions. According to an estimation by the Federal Highway Administration about 11, 000 people suffers from injuries and about 160 people lose their lives each year in crashes related to unsafe pavement edges in the United States. <b>Safety</b> <b>Edge,</b> on the other hand, is a design feature that creates a fillet {{along the edge of the}} pavement of the roadway that allows drivers, who drift off roadways, to return safely to the roads. This study intended to conduct a safety evaluation of road segments provided with <b>Safety</b> <b>Edge</b> in Iowa. Thus a before and after crash analysis was conducted to estimate any reduction in crashes in the after period of installation. This research also looked into the road and traffic characteristics that significantly affected the crashes on road segments provided with <b>Safety</b> <b>Edge.</b> A total length of 483 miles of roadway segments installed with <b>Safety</b> <b>Edge</b> was identified all over Iowa. Roadway, traffic, lane characteristics and crashes on the treatment segments for the study period of eleven years from 2004 to 2011 was obtained from Iowa Department of Transportation. A Preliminary before and after crash analysis for all types of crashes showed a 50 % reduction in all types of fatal crashes, 18. 5 % reduction in all types of property damage only (PDO) crashes and an overall decrease of 19 % for all types of total crashes. A preliminary before and after crash analysis for target crashes showed a 75 % reduction in Target fatal crashes, 1 % increase in target PDO crashes and overall 17 % reduction in total target crashes. The crash data which is a form of count data was analyzed using negative binomial regression. Positive safety impact of installation of Safety Edges was observed for almost all the statistical models (except for property damage only target crashes), as the crashes in the after period was observed to be less than that of the before period. Both scenarios of all types of crashes and target crashes were considered separately in the study. The variables that significantly affected the different crash models were average annual daily traffic (AADT), shoulder width, Rural/Urban indicator, and surface width. Negative Binomial Models for All types of KABCO crashes (all crash severity levels taken together) showed 21 % reduction in crashes in the after period. The percentage reduction of all types of injury (KABC) crashes was 20 %. For all types of PDO crashes the reduction was seen to be again 20 %. Negative Binomial Models for target crashes showed 16. 3 % reduction in target KABCO crashes and 2. 4 % increase in target PDO crashes, along with 21 % reduction in all types of KABCO crashes, and 20 % reduction in all types of PDO crashes. The results indicated that <b>Safety</b> <b>Edge</b> installation may also be able to reduce the severity of a crash...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{changing}} <b>edge</b> <b>safety</b> factor on the toroidal {{flow of the}} STOR-M plasma has been investigated during the application of both resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) and compact torus injection (CTI). The <b>edge</b> <b>safety</b> factor was varied by varying the plasma current while keeping the toroidal field constant. A Czyner-Turner spectrometer was used to collect the spectral data from which the velocity of specific impurity ions was diagnosed. Time resolved velocity measurements were inferred from the Doppler wavelength shift of the emission lines. Impurity emission lines at different ionization stages are located at different radial locations within the STOR-M plasma. Properties of these impurity ions {{are assumed to be}} closely related the hydrogen ion (main working gas) due to the strong interaction among the ion species. 	Changing the <b>edge</b> <b>safety</b> factor has a similar effect on the toroidal flow of STOR-M plasma during discharges with both RMP and CTI. A velocity shear was discovered for different impurity ions. The toroidal flow is enhanced for edge ions while a reversal of flow is observed for core ions. As the <b>edge</b> <b>safety</b> factor reduces, the emission location for the core ions is located with q= 2 surface and RMP has a significant impact on their toroidal flow velocity. It was also observed that CT injection has a significant effect on the toroidal velocity of the core ions compared to that of the edge ions. In addition, high plasma current (low safety factor) induced large change in the toroidal flow velocity of the STOR-M plasma...|$|R

40|$|When {{a vehicle}} leaves the {{traveled}} way and encounters a pavement-shoulder drop-off, {{it can be}} difficult for the driver to return safely to the roadway. As the driver attempts to steer back onto the pavement, the side of the tire may scrub along the drop-off, resisting the driver’s attempts. This resistance often leads the driver to overcorrect with more steering input. When the tire finally remounts the pavement, the larger steering angle may cause the vehicle to “slingshot” across the road. This can result in a head-on collision with other traffic or a loss of control and overturning of the vehicle on the roadway or roadside. The <b>safety</b> <b>edge</b> is an innovative treatment intended to minimize drop-off-related crashes. With this treatment, the pavement edge is sloped at a 30 -degree angle (see figure 1). This angle makes it easier for a driver to safely reenter the roadway after inadvertently driving onto the shoulder. Research conducted by Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) in the 1980 s found that drivers rated a 45 -degree wedge as a much safer pavement edge to remount than either the vertical or rounded edges normally found with portland cement concrete and asphalt pavements. (1) Because drivers in the study were instructed to drive off the pavement edge, the TTI research has been criticized as not being representative of naïve drivers. Prior to this research, neither an actual field evaluation of the <b>safety</b> <b>edge</b> nor a formal effectiveness evaluation had been completed.

40|$|Development of {{autonomous}} robots requires strict demands to safety, as robots {{are able to}} do severe damage. In order for the NMBU-developed mobile agricultural robot, Thorvald, to work autonomously on the fields, a safety system must be in place. This system must, above all, make sure the robot does not kill, or injure humans. In this thesis, a safety system for Thorvald is designed. Various sensor technologies, applicable controllers and safety systems applied in other robotic platforms are studied. A set of system requirements is formulated. The suggested system is layer-based, specifically consisting of four layers, working independently. Layer 1 uses both 2 D and 3 D-LIDARs for navigation and obstacle avoidance, while layer 2 stops the robot, if a separate 2 D-LIDAR senses an object within thirty centimeters of the front of the robot. In case of a collision while Thorvald is equipped with heavy or sharp tools, layer 3 stops the robot at impact, by the use of <b>safety</b> <b>edges.</b> Layer 4 gives humans the possibility to override the system with an emergency stop button. Furthermore, a case study is conducted, as a start of developing layer 2 of the safety system. The selected 2 D-LIDAR is connected to an Arduino. A C++ program is written and run on the Arduino. As a substitute for motor control, the Arduino gives commands to a LED light that lights up when an object is too close. Both the scanner and program worked as intended...|$|R
