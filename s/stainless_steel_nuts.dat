The measurements were obtained by dynamic SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) using a VG Isolab 54 ion microprobe. Plots of O- 18 /O- 16 against time, show large depletions of up to a factor of 2 compared to the O- 18 /O- 16 value at sea level. The O- 16 current decreases by 2 orders of magnitude in the interior of the metal, and the corresponding profile of anomalous O- 16 is strongly peaked in the outer few tens of nanometers of the surface. This depth scale is a tentative one based on estimated sputtering rates. Plots of O- 18 /O- 16 against 1 /O- 16 should be linear if two isotopically distinct components, one of variable concentration (orbital component) and one of fixed concentration (normal oxygen), are mixed. Data to be presented at the meeting show departures from linearity which result from variability in the concentration of normal oxygen, but may also arise from the implantation of oxygen with a range of fractionation due to the decaying orbit of the LDEF, sputtering of the surface by atomic oxygen, and the different momenta of the two isotopes due to their equal velocities. The potential for using this method as a means of identifying exposure to low-Earth orbit, de-convoluting the effects of space exposure from terrestrial contamination, and using the implanted anomolous oxygen as a means of studying the atomic oxygen density and upper atmosphere temperature height profile will be discussed at the meeting...|$|E
40|$|This report {{collects}} {{information on}} cathode contaminants we have {{gathered in the}} process of operating the LBNL DARHT cathode test stand. Information on contaminants is compiled from several sources. The attachment, ''Practical Aspects of Modern Dispenser Cathodes'', is from Heat Wave Corp. (TB- 134) and was originally published in Microwave Journal, September 1979. Cathode contamination depends on both material choices and residual gases. Table 1 of TB- 134 lists materials that can poison dispenser cathodes. These include reactive residual gases or vapors such as oxygen, water vapor, benzene, chlorine, fluorine, sulfur, silicon, and most metals other than molybdenum, rhenium, tungsten, and copper. The metals interact with the cathode surface through their vapor pressure. A paper by Nexsen and Turner, J. Appl. Phys. 68, 298 - 303 (1990) shows the threshold effects of some common residual gases or vapors on cathode performance. The book by Walter H. Kohl, Handbook of Materials and Techniques for Vacuum Devices, also contains useful information on cathodes and poisoning agents. A plot of the vapor pressures and poisoning effect of certain metals (from Kohl) is shown below. Note that the vapor pressure of zinc is 1. 1 x 10 {sup - 8 } Torr at 400 K = 127 C, and 2. 7 x 10 {sup - 5 } at 500 K = 227 C. By contrast iron reaches a vapor pressure 1 x 10 {sup - 8 } between 800 and 900 C. Therefore it is important to eliminate any brass parts that could exceed a temperature of 100 C. Many structural components of the cathode assembly contain steel. At 500 - 600 C in an oxygen atmosphere chromium oxide may outgas from the steel. [Cho, et. al., J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 19, p. 998 (2001) ]. Steel may also contain silicon, and sulfur at low concentrations. Therefore use of steel should be limited or avoided at high temperature near the cathode. Materials that should be avoided {{in the vicinity of the}} cathode include brass, silver, zinc, non-OFHC copper, silicates, and sulfur-containing lubricants such molybdenum disulfide. Macor is an aluminosilicate-based insulator that is not stable at high temperature. Macor near the cathode should be replaced by a high-temperature insulator such as alumina ceramic. Other insulating materials that contain silicates, such as fiber insulating sleeves, should be avoided. Copper that is not OFHC contains oxygen and other impurities and should be avoided. Lubricating screw coatings should be chosen carefully to have no sulfur content. Common sources of contamination that can cause low emission include water, saliva, silicates such as glass dust, etc. Cathodes should be handled in near clean-room conditions to minimize the amount of water vapor on the cathode surface from breathing, etc. Cathodes should also be stored in such as a way as to avoid contact with materials such as glass dust and water vapor. Attached are plots of SEM data for several test pieces that were taken from the LBNL test stand after activation of the 311 x scandate DARHT cathode. Several copper pieces in the anode region were tested, showing the presence of zinc. Two <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>nuts</b> coated with a contaminant were also tested. The SEM data indicates the presence of zinc and some sulfur. The zinc has been traced to a brass piece, and the sulfur to the possible use of molybdenum disulfide lubricant on a nut in the system. Finally a swipe of contaminant on the vacuum vessel wall analyzed by a commercial testing laboratory shows again the presence of zinc. In order to improve system cleanliness, we have implemented the following modifications to the test stand: replaced the brass piece with copper-tungsten; replaced Macor insulators with alumina ceramic; used boron nitride lubricant; replaced copper beam stop with OFHC copper; and replaced steel pieces near the cathode where possible with copper or copper-tungsten. A clean fire of high-temperature components and a high-current filament test have shown no evidence to date for contaminants since the modifications...|$|E
50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a nut plate, anchor nut or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> or nickel-plated <b>nuts</b> are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|R
