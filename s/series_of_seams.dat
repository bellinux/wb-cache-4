40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the analysis of the Russian coal mines experience in using the variant of the long-pillar development system with the abandonment of coal pillars in the mined out areas of longwall faces. In the Kuzbass mines, this option accounts for 90 - 95  % of the total volume of coal mined by the underground method. It is pointed out {{that it is necessary to}} take into account the negative influence of the pillars left in the worked out space on the geomechanical conditions of conducting mining operations in the overworked (underworked) seams. A significant negative effect of the pillars is shown in combination with selective extraction of the adjacent layers on reduction of the balance reserves.

25|$|There {{have been}} more downs than ups in post-war years. Though runs came {{regularly}} from Arnold Hamer and less consistently from the West Indian Laurie Johnson and captain Donald Carr, the batting remained the weak point {{right up to the}} beginning of covered pitches in the 1980s. However, a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> bowlers served England as well as Derbyshire. The list began with Copson and continued with Cliff Gladwin, Les Jackson, Harold Rhodes, Alan Ward, Mike Hendrick and, most recently, Devon Malcolm and Dominic Cork. Spin was in short supply apart from the steady work of Edwin Smith and the under-rated all-rounder Geoff Miller, the current national selector of the England team and noted after-dinner speaker. The signing of Eddie Barlow, the famous South African, in 1976 and the lengthy period under the captaincy of Kim Barnett, starting in 1983, meant the side were rarely uncompetitive.|$|R
25|$|Australia {{were left}} to chase 449 for the victory and made a strong start, {{reaching}} 139 by {{the close of the}} fourth day without losing a wicket, and went on to 208 before Fraser had Slater (103, 10 fours) caught by Tufnell. An hour later, after a rain-lengthened lunch break, Malcolm uprooted Taylor's off stump for 113 and the intent to chase was quelled. Boon batted for an hour and three-quarters for 17, but after his dismissal Fraser (5–73) made the most of the damp conditions, delivering a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>seaming</b> deliveries to the Australian middle order that saw Bevan, both Waugh brothers and Healy returned to the pavilion, Rhodes taking three catches. The fading light saw Hick, Tufnell and Gooch bowling at this critical time instead of Gough and Malcolm, with Warne and May batting out the last hour to save the draw, Malcolm spilled a catch from Warne off {{what appeared to be the}} final delivery of the match and the players walked off thinking the game was over, only to realise by the time they got to the pitch edge that there was still time for one more over.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{testing in}} a cylindrical, {{comparative}} cryostat at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory {{has focused on}} various seam concepts for multilayer insulation systems. Three main types <b>of</b> <b>seams</b> were investigated: straight overlap, fold-over, and roll wrapped. Each blanket was comprised of 40 layer pairs of reflector and spacer materials. The total thickness was approximately 12. 5 -mm, giving an average layer density of 32 layers per centimeter. The blankets were tested at high vacuum, soft vacuum, and no vacuum using liquid nitrogen to maintain the cold boundary temperature at 77 K. Test results show that all three seam concepts are all close in thermal performance; however the fold-over method provides the lowest heat flux. For the first <b>series</b> <b>of</b> tests, <b>seams</b> were located 120 degrees around the circumference of the cryostat from the previous seam. This technique appears to have lessened the degradation of the blanket due to the seams. In a follow-on test, a 20 layer blanket was tested in a roll wrapped configuration and then cut {{down the side of}} the cylinder, taped together, and re-tested. This test result shows the thermal performance impact <b>of</b> having the <b>seams</b> all in one location versus having the seams clocked around the vessel. This experimental investigation indicates that the method <b>of</b> joining the <b>seams</b> in multilayer insulation systems is not as critical as the quality of the installation process...|$|R

30|$|Figure  11 {{shows the}} result of the {{ultrasonic}} examination for determining the degree <b>of</b> filling <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> loop C. Influences due to a deviation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> loop position in the sensor can be excluded because of the good coupling. The red marked areas in coupling evaluation in the upper seam bond area b arises due to the larger active sensor area (6.5  mm) in contrast to the flange length <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> area b (6  mm). Consequently, the inner sheet is sounded in this area, whereby the echo resulting from the material transition is generated outside the gate for an OK coupling. A change in the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> bond loop <b>of</b> the sample within the sensor can be excluded as a further factor influencing the result. For this purpose, the straight edge of the laboratory sample has been investigated in this <b>series</b> <b>of</b> tests. Consequently, it can be ensured that the ultrasound results are solely related to the adhesive distribution and not to the geometrical shape <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> bond or the orientation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> loop. Further investigations must show the extent to which this can be ensured later in the series process.|$|R

40|$|Drape of {{the fabric}} {{is its ability to}} hang freely in graceful folds when some area of it is {{supported}} over a surface and the rest is unsupported. Drape is a unique property that allows a fabric to be bent in more than in one direction, When two-dimensional fabric are converted to three-dimensional garment form. In the present study, the effects of sewing <b>of</b> different <b>seam</b> were selected on different fabric and their behaviors were studied. In this study drape of ten fabrics are analyzed with three types <b>of</b> <b>seams</b> and three stitch densities. Sample without seam is a control sample and drape <b>of</b> <b>seamed</b> samples are compared with control sample to analyse the drape behavior <b>of</b> <b>seamed</b> fabrics. This paper presents a fundamental drape analysis <b>of</b> <b>seamed</b> fabrics using drape meter. Drape behavior is determined in terms of drape coefficient. The effect <b>of</b> <b>seams</b> on the drape coefficient and Drape profile has been made. Drape coefficients significantly differs between the fabrics and also between the seam stitch density combinations. Investigating drape on seamed fabrics can improve fabric end use application.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{automatically}} {{seam tracking}} system with structured light vision sensor in girth-welding of pipeline, {{there is a}} lot <b>of</b> noise in <b>seam</b> images. To extract seam information reliably, it is important to process the original images to eliminate influence of noise. A novel compounding process method is presented. Firstly, one dimension Laplacian of Gaussian filter was applied to transform noises whose width was larger than laser light stripe to isolated and small noise. Then the image was smoothed with neighborhood median filter. Due to gray distribution variety <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> image, binary image was created with maximal square difference adaptive threshold within selected section based on priori information. Acnode noise was cleared up by region labeling and selected threshold, consequently a binary image <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> is obtained. Finally, smooth and consecutive skeleton <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> is extracted with morphologic thinning method. Experiments indicate that this process method satisfies requirement <b>of</b> real-time <b>seam</b> tracking. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{sound field}} {{simulations}} can also demonstrate {{the relationship between}} the transmission measurement for the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> loop c and the degree of adhesive filling in seam areas a or b. The simulation results show that under identical excitation, detection and evaluation range the integral energy method within a gate G <b>of</b> a <b>seam</b> completely filled with air is 2.1 times greater than in the case <b>of</b> a <b>seam</b> bond completely filled with adhesive. This deviation between OK and not okay bonding is already reduced to 1.4 times if the defect area only extends to seam loop C. Subsequently, the selective evaluation <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> loop C by transmission measurement is only possible if this result is used in connection with the results of the pulse echo measurement <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> areas a or b. Consequently there are two conditions for the test of the adhesive filling <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> loop C. First the position in x and y direction <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> in the sensor must be within a certain range (±  1  mm). This is ensured by three impulse echo measurements of the arrays A, B and C. The second condition assumes a complete filling <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> areas a and b. This is checked by the ultrasonic system. Only if both conditions for a test position are fulfilled, the validation <b>of</b> the <b>seam</b> area c is possible. In the present case, a negative adhesive evaluation for areas a and b has been established by the pulse echo measurement of arrays A and B. Subsequently, because of {{the relationship between the}} transmission measurement and the degree of adhesive filling of areas a and b, no result of the transmission measurement for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> loop c can be indicated for this test position.|$|R

The sewing plays {{a very important role}} in shoe making, having an impact both in terms of functionality and outlook. One of the most important indicators of the sewed products quality is seam strength, which is influenced by a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> technological parameters such as: the shape of the needle’s top, the needle’s diameter, the seam thickness, the number <b>of</b> <b>seams,</b> the gauge <b>of</b> the thread, the type <b>of</b> <b>seam</b> and the material type. This paper studies the stitching strength of the full grain leather and full grain leather shiny surface used for footwear uppers, in order to improve productivity and seam quality. The experimental researches obtained for the stitching strength allow calculating the weakening coefficient of the material in the process of sewing (a= 0. 33 - 0. 48). The “a” coefficient is dependent on the stitch density, the shape of the needle’s top and the joined materials. In terms of stitching strength, the results indicate that the full grain leather obtains higher values than the full grain leather shiny surface. ...|$|R
