5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe <b>sepsis.</b> Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in human blood. PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that {{plays a role in}} the inflammation seen in <b>sepsis.</b> The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for <b>sepsis</b> showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for <b>sepsis</b> showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E
5|$|Acute pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease is highly unlikely when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic <b>sepsis</b> (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Hanson {{suffered}} from diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. He also had {{high blood pressure}} and heart problems. He was hospitalized in Columbia, South Carolina in October 2001 due to dementia and died from <b>Sepsis,</b> on February 19, 2002.|$|E
5|$|In the elderly, the {{presentation}} may be atypical; they may directly collapse due to <b>sepsis</b> without first showing typical features. Those with an indwelling stent in the bile duct (see below) may not develop jaundice.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died of <b>sepsis.</b> The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{died from}} <b>sepsis</b> on 14 June 1922, at the ancestral {{home of his}} wife at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, England. His obituarists {{ascribed}} this to an obscure form of blood poisoning brought on by gassing in the trenches during his war service. However, his ailments, including fatigue, heartdigestiveneurological disorders, appendicitis, cognitive problems, depression, anxiety — are today recognised as differential symptoms of malaria. Left untreated they sometimes lead to organ failure and death.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of <b>sepsis,</b> multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, <b>sepsis,</b> pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection; however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as <b>sepsis,</b> gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{symptoms}} are frequently {{lacking in the}} elderly. The presentations may be vague with incontinence, a change in mental status, or fatigue as the only symptoms, while some present to a health care provider with <b>sepsis,</b> an infection of the blood, as the first symptoms. Diagnosis can be {{complicated by the fact}} that many elderly people have preexisting incontinence or dementia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sepsis,</b> when {{microorganisms}} {{enter the}} bloodstream and {{the immune system}} responds. <b>Sepsis</b> often occurs with bacterial pneumonia, with streptococcus pneumoniae the most-common cause. Patients with <b>sepsis</b> require intensive care, with blood-pressure monitoring and support against hypotension. <b>Sepsis</b> can cause liver, kidney and heart damage.|$|E
25|$|Nosocomial {{infections are}} of {{variable}} importance. One {{of the most}} important is complicated <b>sepsis,</b> which was defined as <b>sepsis</b> with organ dysfunction. One variant of MC1R (MC1RR163Q, rs885479) was reported to be associated with lowered risk of developing complicated <b>sepsis</b> during hospitalization after trauma. Thus, if the association is confirmed, MC1R targeting may become a therapeutic option to prevent severe <b>sepsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin {{has been}} studied in <b>sepsis</b> to reduce diffuse {{intravascular}} coagulation and other outcomes. It has not been found to confer any benefit in critically ill people with <b>sepsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 60% of all ALF {{patients}} fulfil {{the criteria}} for systemic inflammatory syndrome irrespective of {{presence or absence of}} infection. This often contributes towards multi organ failure. Impaired host defence mechanism, due to impaired opsonization, chemotaxis and intracellular killing, substantially increases risk of <b>sepsis.</b> Bacterial <b>sepsis</b> mostly due to gram positive organisms and fungal <b>sepsis</b> are observed in up to 80% and 30% patients, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Variable {{degrees of}} {{hemolysis}} and intermittent episodes of vascular occlusion resulting in tissue ischemia and acute and chronic organ dysfunction; complications include anemia, jaundice, predisposition to aplastic crisis, <b>sepsis,</b> cholelithiasis, and delayed growth. Diagnosis suspected in infants or {{young children with}} painful swelling of the hands and feet, pallor, jaundice, pneumococcal <b>sepsis</b> or meningitis, severe anemia with splenic enlargement, or acute chest syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Xigris was {{designed}} to fight <b>sepsis,</b> a condition that kills more than 200,000 Americans annually. It was the only approved drug for <b>sepsis,</b> and it costs $8,000 to treat a single patient. Lilly {{hoped it would be}} a blockbuster, with sales of at least a billion dollars a year. But after five years on the market, sales were only $200 million.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} in {{pediatric}} patients with severe <b>sepsis</b> {{had to be}} discontinued (lack of positive results and severe side-effects).|$|E
25|$|This {{protocol}} {{results in}} treatment of 15–20% {{of pregnant women}} and prevention of 65–70% of cases of early onset GBS <b>sepsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{patients}} should be monitored for signs of complicated infection, continued <b>sepsis,</b> or septic emboli while antibiotic therapy is being administered.|$|E
25|$|T-cell {{exhaustion}} is {{the progressive}} loss of T-cell function. It can occur during <b>sepsis</b> and after other acute or chronic infections.|$|E
25|$|An early {{randomized}} controlled trial of imipenem 0.5nbsp&gram intravenously every eight hours {{for two weeks}} showed a reduction in from pancreatic <b>sepsis</b> from 30% to 12%.|$|E
25|$|Other {{authors have}} shown that {{cellular}} methane production also rises during <b>sepsis</b> or bacterial endotoxemia, including an experimental imitation of endotoxemia by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.|$|E
25|$|DIC is {{observed}} in approximately 1% of academic hospital admissions. DIC occurs {{at higher rates}} in patients with bacterial <b>sepsis</b> (83%), severe trauma (31%), and cancer (6.8%).|$|E
25|$|Before {{she could}} take this {{position}} she was hospitalized with <b>sepsis</b> caused by a serious tooth infection, and died after a short interval in Shanghai on 27 July 1936.|$|E
25|$|James W. von Brunn died {{in prison}} while {{awaiting}} trial on January 6, 2010. He was in poor health and suffered from {{congestive heart failure}} and <b>sepsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drotrecogin alfa {{does not}} improve {{mortality}} in severe <b>sepsis</b> or septic shock but does increase bleeding risks. Therefore, a 2011 Cochrane review recommended that clinicians and policymakers not recommend its use.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytopenia - {{typically}} multifactorial. Due to alcoholic marrow suppression, <b>sepsis,</b> lack of folate, platelet sequestering in the spleen {{as well as}} decreased thrombopoietin. However, this rarely {{results in}} a platelet count < 50 000/mL.|$|E
25|$|Immediate {{treatment}} {{is the most}} important factor in a favorable prognosis. A delay in treatment greater than six hours or the presence of peritonitis, <b>sepsis,</b> hypotension, or disseminated intravascular coagulation are negative prognostic indicators.|$|E
25|$|Recombinant human {{activated}} protein C {{was previously}} recommended {{in those with}} severe <b>sepsis</b> and DIC, but drotrecogin alfa {{has been shown to}} confer no benefit and was withdrawn from the market in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) is a {{syndrome}} that {{is similar}} to Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops within 6 hours during a plasma-product containing blood products transfusion. Fever, hypotension, shortness of breath, and tachycardia often occurs in this type of reaction. It occurs in 15% of the transfused patient with mortality rate of 5 to 10%. Recipient risk factors includes: end-stage liver disease, <b>sepsis,</b> haematological malignancies, <b>sepsis,</b> and ventilated patients. Human Neutrophil Antigen (HNA) has been associated with this type of transfusion reaction. Donor's antibodies would interact with recipient's neutrophils and monocytes, releasing inflammatory cytokines and causes pulmonary capillary leakage. The treatment is supportive.|$|E
25|$|The {{protease}} {{can contribute}} to infection symptoms, e.g. pain and edema through increased vascular permeability by activating kinin. De-regulation of neutrophil proteases through inactivation of α1-antitrypsin has been suggested as a potential cause of dysfunctional coagulation in <b>sepsis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Muzzey died of <b>sepsis</b> {{after three}} weeks of illness on 3 August 1910 in Cambridge. He was {{survived by his wife}} Sarah A. Muzzey (née Turner) and son Herbert Sprague Muzzey. He was buried at Stow.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sepsis</b> {{is caused}} by overwhleming {{response}} to an infection and leads to tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. The symptoms include: confusion, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, pain or discomfort, over-perspiration, fever, shivering, or feeling cold.|$|E
25|$|These are {{mediated}} by the HPA axis and the SNS. Common human diseases such as allergy, autoimmunity, chronic infections and <b>sepsis</b> are characterized by a dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory and T helper (Th1) versus (Th2) cytokine balance.|$|E
