5|$|In {{the south}} live <b>sedentary</b> {{people such as}} the Sara, the nation's main ethnic group, whose {{essential}} social unit is the lineage. In the Sahel <b>sedentary</b> peoples live side-by-side with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly Toubous.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian leaders {{decided that}} their {{traditional}} lifestyle, partly based on plundering raids against <b>sedentary</b> peoples, {{could not be}} continued. The defeats at the Lechfeld and Arkadiopolis accelerated the Hungarians' adoption of a <b>sedentary</b> way of life. This process culminated in the coronation {{of the head of}} the Hungarians, Stephen the first king of Hungary in 1000 and 1001.|$|E
5|$|The Fulbe and Mandé peoples intermixed to some extent, and {{the more}} <b>sedentary</b> of the Fulbe came to look down on their {{pastoral}} cousins.|$|E
5|$|The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, {{and fields}} {{surrounding}} Seattle were once {{rich enough to}} support one of the world's few <b>sedentary</b> hunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.|$|E
5|$|All male Upper Canadians between 18 and 60years of {{age were}} members of the <b>Sedentary</b> Militia, which was called into active duty during the Rebellions of 1837. Macdonald served as a private in the militia, patrolling the area around Kingston, but the town saw no real action and Macdonald was not called upon to fire on the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Australian kites may be <b>sedentary</b> or nomadic, and {{generally}} occur in open grasslands or valleys {{where there are}} scattered clumps of trees. In urban areas they are found {{on the edge of}} towns on wasteland, irregularly mown areas, or grassy roadside verges. They also hunt over coastal dunes, drier marshland, and farmland.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and <b>sedentary</b> populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are <b>sedentary</b> and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{are either}} {{directly}} caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing {{a common cause}} such as a poor diet or a <b>sedentary</b> lifestyle. The strength {{of the link between}} obesity and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link with type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women.|$|E
5|$|Khafaja was {{succeeded by}} his son Muhammad, elected by the Sicilian army and {{confirmed}} by the Aghlabid emir. In contrast to his previous energy, Muhammad was a <b>sedentary</b> governor, preferring to remain in his capital rather than campaign in person. His tenure was furthermore cut short when he was assassinated by his court eunuchs on 27 May 871.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a <b>sedentary</b> bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. It only perches in trees in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|Louis Stanislas lived a {{quiet and}} <b>sedentary</b> {{lifestyle}} at this point, {{not having a}} great deal to do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.|$|E
5|$|Pugs {{that live}} a mostly <b>sedentary</b> {{life can be}} prone to obesity, though this is avoidable with regular {{exercise}} and a healthy diet. The median life span of Pugs is 11 years, which {{is in line with}} other breeds of the same size.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{has great}} human and {{economic}} costs. It {{results in a}} decreased life expectancy by 10–25years. This is primarily because of its association with obesity, poor diet, <b>sedentary</b> lifestyles, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sedentary</b> {{nature of}} this species means that juveniles can only acquire a {{territory}} by finding a vacant area or replacing a dead adult. In Europe, young birds almost always move to unoccupied habitat, but in the larger territories of Siberia most live within the breeding range of an adult pair.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is considered}} <b>sedentary</b> {{and does not}} migrate, though its movements are not well known. Birds are present in some areas all year, though in northern Victoria they are thought to move into more open areas outside the breeding season. Some populations may be locally nomadic, following availability of water.|$|E
5|$|A <b>sedentary</b> ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
5|$|According to Martin Noth, {{a scholar}} of the Hebrew Bible, the {{narratives}} of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage {{than that of the}} West-Jordanian Jacob. At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet <b>sedentary.</b> In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").|$|E
5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor <b>sedentary</b> but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a <b>sedentary</b> (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and <b>sedentary,</b> the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|By 6000 BC, {{the early}} {{inhabitants}} of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, {{a process that}} {{eventually led to the}} establishment of <b>sedentary</b> agricultural societies. The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes. All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked. Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations {{are known to be}} nearly <b>sedentary,</b> so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E
5|$|Found in grasslands {{and open}} {{woodlands}} dominated by Eucalyptus and Callitris trees, the turquoise parrot feeds mainly on grasses and seeds and occasionally flowers, fruit and scale insects. It nests in hollows of gum trees. Much of its habitat has been altered and potential nesting sites lost. Predominantly <b>sedentary,</b> the turquoise parrot can be locally nomadic. Populations {{appear to be}} recovering from a crash in the early 20th century. The turquoise parrot has been kept in captivity since the 19th century, and several colour variants exist.|$|E
5|$|Found in open woodland, {{parks and}} gardens, the blue-faced honeyeater {{is common in}} {{northern}} and eastern Australia and southern New Guinea. It appears to be <b>sedentary</b> in parts of its range and locally nomadic in other parts; however, the species has been little studied. Its diet is mostly composed of invertebrates, supplemented with nectar and fruit. They often take over and renovate old babbler nests, in which the female lays and incubates two or rarely three eggs.|$|E
5|$|In a few {{northern}} areas, {{fish are}} also eaten. In studies performed at Amchitka Island in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at carrying capacity, 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish. The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and <b>sedentary</b> or sluggish forms, such as Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus and family Tetraodontidae. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, fish are a negligible or extremely minor {{part of the}} sea otter's diet. Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat starfish, and any kelp that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally <b>sedentary,</b> and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and <b>sedentary</b> habits of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Pterocles are mainly found in the drier parts of northern, eastern and {{southern}} Africa though the range of some species extends into the Middle East and western Asia. The Madagascar sandgrouse is restricted to Madagascar. The black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse also occur in Spain, Portugal and southern France. Most species are <b>sedentary</b> though some make local migrations, typically to lower altitudes in winter.|$|E
5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a <b>sedentary</b> species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
5|$|Most house sparrows do {{not move}} {{more than a few}} {{kilometres}} during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the birds in <b>sedentary</b> populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E
5|$|Most {{populations are}} <b>sedentary,</b> apart from some post-breeding {{dispersal}} of young birds, {{and there is}} a reluctance to cross even short stretches of open water. Northern and eastern breeders are dependent on the cones of the Siberian stone pine, and if the crop fails many birds of the S.e.asiatica subspecies may move west into northern Sweden and Finland in autumn, sometimes staying to breed. Siberian S.e.arctica may make more limited movements south and east in winter, and S.e.amurensis, from southeast Russia, is regular in winter in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a <b>sedentary</b> person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{northern}} storm petrel undertake migrations after the breeding season. Species undertake migrations of differing lengths; long ones, {{such as the}} Swinhoe's storm petrel, which breeds in the west Pacific and migrates to the west Indian Ocean; or shorter ones, such as the black storm petrel which nests in southern California and migrates down the coast of Central America {{as far south as}} Colombia. Some species, like the Tristram's storm petrel, are thought to be essentially <b>sedentary</b> and do not undertake any migrations away from their breeding islands.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{developed}} their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when {{this era of}} Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by <b>sedentary</b> communities {{and the introduction of}} pottery and fired clay figurines.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{describes}} a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans {{in search of}} food. However, this applies to only a few species. Most live far more social, <b>sedentary,</b> benthic lives, and appear likely {{to have their own}} distinct personalities. Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year. Shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds, with many sharks covering entire ocean basins.|$|E
