40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. Non tracking daylight systems, which redirect the light from <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> between 15 ° and 65 ° deep into rooms without causing glare effects, have been applied successfully in several office buildings recently. These systems are based on specially shaped polymer profiles which are inserted in double glass windows and which are commercialized under the label LUMITOP. Based on these macro structured systems, fixed in the upper area of windows above eyelevel, advanced solutions using micro structured components will be reported. Main objective of this new development is the reduction of material input (e. g. PMMA) and production costs. Additionally, the optical properties and redirection performance of the existing system should be improved. First, ray tracing calculations {{have been carried out}} to identify optimum solutions for micro structured components capable of redirecting daylight with high and almost homogeneous efficiency over the relevant angular range of <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> and not showing colour effects. The simulation results show, that by using a combination of micro lenses and micro prisms an almost homogeneous sunlight redirection of about 70 % is achieved in the angular range of <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> between 25 ° and 65 °. These results could be confirmed by prototypes fabricated in the highly transparent silicone polymer PDMS. Suitable industrial production processes for large area panels (1400 mm x 400 mm x 4 mm) are hot embossing in thermoplastic materials like PMMA and UV-embossing in special UV-curing resins. Both processes are under development and the status of the development will be reported. cf 201...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of clerestory window structures {{on the performance of}} daylighting lightshelves in terms of the interior illuminance level and uniformity distribution using the software TracePro 7. 0. Simulations were carried out for a window facing south at noon on both summer day and winter day. It is found that a meniscus glazing panel whose curved section is in a meniscus shape can change the light direction and affect daylighting performance. Further results show the best clerestory window structure for Hong Kong is the one whose meniscus section is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom with a curvature angle ranging from 44. 3 ° to 90 °. This improves the illuminance and uniformity of the interior space in the winter months (<b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> up to 60 °) and has a relatively steady effectiveness of around 1. 03 in comparison to a vertical clerestory glazing panel. For higher <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> in summer, this structure improves uniformity for the middle and rear room areas by reducing the illuminance in the front, while the effectiveness drops to around 0. 91. This is a good improvement which can promote confidence in the application. The proposed structure can be revised and applied in subtropical regions enabling lightshelves to be designed based on their specific requirements. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Light pipes offer {{a passive}} {{way to bring}} {{daylight}} inside deep buildings, such as agricultural buildings. However, the lack of reliable performance predictability methods for light pipes represents a major obstacle preventing their widespread use. This paper evaluates a simulation approach for performance prediction and identifies key light pipe design parameters affecting their daylight transmission performance. The study was carried out through continuous monitoring of daylight in two full-scale, identical pig stables fitted with two light pipe systems, Solatube® and Velux®. The experiment included three continuously measuring sensors in each stable and an outdoor sensor during 2013 and 2014. A forward raytracing tool, TracePro®, was used for illuminance prediction and parametric simulations. The simulation results for overcast skies indicated discrepancies between the simulated and average measurement results below 30 % in all cases. The discrepancies for clear skies were somewhat higher, i. e., below 30 % for 67 % of the cases. The higher discrepancies with clear skies were due to the overestimation of absolute sunlight levels and absence of an advanced and detailed optical characterization of the dome collector’s surface. The parametric results have shown that light pipes’ performance is better during summer time, in sunny climates, at low to mid-latitudes, which provides higher <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> than during winter and cloudy climates at high latitudes. Methods to improve the luminous transmittance for low <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> occurring in Scandinavia include: bending or tilting the pipe, increasing the aspect ratio, improving the pipe specular reflectance, tilting the collector to the south, and using optical redirecting system in the collector...|$|R

The {{refraction}} of almost parallel sunlight through what is essentially a 90-degree prism accounts for the wide color separation and the purity of color. The CZA can only form {{when the sun is}} at an altitude lower than 32.2°. The CZA is brightest when the sun is at 22° above the horizon, which causes sunlight to enter and exit the crystals at the minimum deviation angle; then it is also about 22° in radius, 3° in width. The CZA radius varies between 32.2° and 0° depending on the <b>solar</b> <b>altitude.</b> Towards either of the extremes it is vanishingly faint.

40|$|Capturing {{daylight}} into an unevenly lit {{lecture room}} with north-facing windows has been analyzed {{with the help}} of Photopia and Radiance. Two different daylighting systems, a light tube and a fiber-optic solar dish concentrator, are considered as means to lead light rays into an interior space with insufficient illumination from daylight. Photopia is used to photometrically model the daylighting systems as light travels through highly reflective light guiding elements of these systems. The candela power distribution curves (CDCs) generated by Photopia are imported by Radiance to produce photometric data and images of different locations in the lecture room. These results clearly reveal the functional benefits of each system when harvesting daylight for indoor illumination. For <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> of less than 50 °, more daylight can be harvested by the solar tracking dish concentrator system.

40|$|When a {{stationary}} solar concentrator is designed, the {{spatial distribution of}} the available irradiation is of vital interest. An irradiation distribution based only on solar geometry will look similar at different sites. The {{only difference is that}} the distribution of the incident irradiation is shifted to lower <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> when latitude is increased. However, real irradiation distribution will show strong asymmetry at high latitude sites, since the winter irradiation is reduced by absorption and scattering in the atmosphere, and by seasonal changes in the climate.

This means that the degree of concentration that is possible increases with latitude. In the paper examples of irradiation distribution from different sites in Europe from latitude 38 &# 176;N to 65 &# 176;N are shown.
