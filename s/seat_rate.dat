40|$|Background: Central {{obesity and}} poor {{physical}} fitness predict {{the development of}} type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality among Caucasian populations. We studied the independent and combined effect of abdominal obesity and <b>seated</b> resting heart <b>rate</b> used {{as an indicator of}} physical fitness, on the presence of type 2 diabetes among 30 519 older residents of Guangzhou, Southern China. Methods: Participants were stratified into four groups, based on the Asian criteria for abdominal obesity (≥ 90 /≥ 80 cm in men/women) and the 75 % cut-off point for <b>seated</b> resting heart <b>rate</b> (≥ 83 beats per min). The association with type 2 diabetes was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 3777 (12. 7 %) volunteers were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which was independently associated with <b>seated</b> resting heart <b>rate</b> and, in particular, increasing levels of abdominal obesity (p < 0. 001). An odds ratio of 3. 93 (95 % confidence interval = 3. 48 - 4. 43) was identified for type 2 diabetes in participants who were obese with a <b>seated</b> resting heart <b>rate</b> ≥ 83 beats per min after adjusting for potential confounders. +Conclusions: Higher <b>seated</b> resting heart <b>rate,</b> a marker of poor physical fitness, independently doubles the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Oct. 1, 2004 -Sept. 30, 2005 This study {{reports the}} results of a baseline survey of restraint use by 4 to 8 year old children in Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Sturgis, and Coldwater, Michigan. The study, conducted between June 19 and July 1, 2005, focused on low income areas of Grand Rapids and the Hispanic population of Sturgis. Two control cities were chosen to observe booster seat use in cities similar to the experimental cities. Kalamazoo was the control city for Grand Rapids, and Coldwater was the control city for Sturgis. A follow-up survey to be conducted next year will provide comparison data and will be discussed in a separate report. Together, these survey waves will provide an assessment of the booster seat promotion programs implemented in Grand Rapids and Sturgis, Michigan. In this study, 4 to 8 year old children were observed traveling in passenger cars, vans/minivans, sport-utility vehicles, and pickup trucks. Each city was analyzed separately to obtain a booster <b>seat</b> use <b>rate</b> for each sample area. Booster <b>seat</b> use <b>rates</b> were: Grand Rapids 19. 0 ± 10. 3 percent, Kalamazoo 9. 7 ± 11. 3 percent, Sturgis 9. 7 ± 5. 0 percent, and Coldwater 18. 2 ± 5. 2 percent...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This work aims at validating a new {{statistical}} index (Weighted Pressure Comfort Loss, WPCL) for seat comfort assessment. The validation {{is carried out}} by deepening the relationship between subjective comfort evaluations and objective measures of seat comfort and comparing, from an engineering standpoint, the new index with the pressure peak which is currently {{one of the most}} used indexes for seat comfort assessment. Method: In the experimental phase, 22 experimenters evaluated four office chairs, by using different evaluation scales and methods (rating, ranking, comfort degree). The subjective comfort perceptions were collected through questionnaires. At the same time, several objective parameters related to seat comfort were measured by using a capacitive mat. In order to select the objective comfort measures which are significantly associated to the perceived comfort, a logistic regression model was adopted. Result: The logistic regression model selected the peak pressure as a significant predictor of perceived comfort whereas, the hypothesis of absence of correlation between the perceived comfort and the WPCL index cannot be rejected. However, from an engineering standpoint, the final <b>seat</b> <b>rating</b> evidences substantial coherence of peak pressure and WPCL index, showing not redundant results useful to design team for seat comfort improvement. Since results were strongly influenced by experimental conditions and anthropometric variability of the experimenters, further investigations should be carried out. On the basis of the first experiments, a refinement of the index and new test conditions could be investigated...|$|R

Interviewers recorded the data using a multidimensional questionnaire including anthropometric indexes. Using seat belt in the case of sitting in the front seat of car (as a driver or passenger) of all samples was asked. SPSS 16. 0 software was used for statistical data analysis. Results: The <b>rate</b> of <b>seat</b> belt use in the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 71 %, 69. 8 %, 74. 5 and 86. 4 %, respectively.
