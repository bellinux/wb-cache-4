40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{correlation}} of abnormal trunk postures and reposition sense of subjects with forward head neck posture (FHP). Methods. In all, postures of 41 subjects were evaluated and the FHP and trunk posture including shoulder, scapular level, pelvic <b>side,</b> and anterior <b>tilting</b> degrees were analyzed. We used the head repositioning accuracy (HRA) test to evaluate neck position senses of neck flexion, neck extension, neck right and left side flexion, and neck right and left rotation and calculated the {{root mean square error}} in trials for each subject. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and regression analysis were used to assess the degree of correlation between the trunk posture and HRA value, and a significance level of α = 0. 05 was considered. Results. There were significant correlations between the HRA value of right side neck flexion and pelvic <b>side</b> <b>tilt</b> angle (p< 0. 05). If pelvic <b>side</b> <b>tilting</b> angle increases by 1 degree, right side neck flexion increased by 0. 76 degrees (p= 0. 026). However, there were no significant correlations between other neck motions and trunk postures. Conclusion. Verifying pelvic postures should be prioritized when movement is limited due to the vitiation of the proprioceptive sense of neck caused by FHP...|$|R

The effect of fish tilt angle is in this way removed, or deconvolved from the target strength distribution [...] The resulting fish maximum target strength distribution is further converted into fish length distribution using equivalent parameters for swimbladder morphology.

During the last years, {{development of the}} product made it heavier increasing the weight from 10 to 16 tonnes. The steering device, coupling the two bodies together, have been updated to withstand the weight increase. The steering device consists of four hydraulic cylinders and a rotational joint. These can turn and tilt the vehicle and allows for large differences between {{the angle of the}} front and rear bodies, thus increasing the accessibility of the vehicle. A semi-active suspension system was installed in BAE Systems other product the CV 90, a combat vehicle. Since then, installing a similar system on the BvS 10 has been {{in the interest of the}} company. The aim of the project is to analyse if an increase in size of the <b>tilt</b> <b>cylinders</b> would benefit a semi-active control of the flow to and from the cylinders. A proposed solenoid valve from Öhlins Racing AB will also be investigated, whether it suits to control the system and where is should be placed. Analysis show that a larger span of damping force would advantageous for the BvS 10, therefore increasing the size of the <b>tilt</b> <b>cylinders</b> is necessary to withstand the forces and increase the life-span. The analysed data and simulations show that the proposed solenoid valve is capable to handle both the flows and the pressure of the hydraulic system. However, the pressure is outside of the valve's optimal performance range, which is why the valve has to be tested in the environment to ensure it passes the requirement specification. The solenoid valve should be placed in the valve block on the steering device, providing the best accessibility and function. Validerat; 20140910 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

We investigate the interaction between an infinite cylinder and a free fluid-fluid interface governed only by its surface tension. We study the deformation of an initially flat interface when it is deformed {{by the presence of}} a cylindrical object, tilted at an arbitrary angle, that the interface 'totally wets'. Our simulations predict all significant quantities such as the interface shape, the position of the contact line, and the force exerted by the interface on the cylinder. These results are compared with an experimental study of the penetration of a soap film by a cylindrical liquid jet. This dynamic situation exhibits all the characteristics of a totally wetting interface. We show that whatever the inclination, the force is always perpendicular to the plane of the interface, and its amplitude diverges as the inclination angle increases. Such results should bring new insights in both fluid and solid mechanics, from animal locomotion to surface micro-processing. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{internal}} wave generation in a stratified fluid {{by means of}} an oscillating cylinder. We observe the consequences of boundary effects by the production of an out-of-plane velocity field as the cylinder span is decreased. Four cylinders are used. Stereoscopic PIV is utilized for flow visualization and velocity field quantification of the three-dimensional {{internal wave}} field evolution. This data is analyzed to determine a relationship between the generation source span as a function of out of plane velocity components in the resultant wave field. As the span of the cylinder is systematically decreased, we observe the evolution of the wave field towards three-dimensionality. To better understand the nature of these boundary effects, a horizontal cylinder is imaged at four location along its length. A <b>tilted</b> <b>cylinder</b> is imaged at its end for two forcing frequencies.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for solving the time-dependent extended-magnetohydrodynamic (X-MHD) equations in two dimensions that has significant advantages over other methods. The stream-function/potential {{representation of the}} velocity and magnetic field vectors, while fully general, allows accurate description of nearly incompressible fluid motions and manifestly satisfies the divergence condition on the magnetic field. Through analytic manipulation, the split semi-implicit method breaks the full matrix time advance into four sequential time advances, each involving smaller matrices. The use of a high order triangular element with continuous first derivatives (C 1 continuity) allows the Galerkin method to be applied without introduction of new auxiliary variables (such as the vorticity or the current density). These features, along with the manifestly compact nature of the fully node-based C 1 finite elements, lead to minimum size matrices for an unconditionally stable method with order of accuracy h 4. The resulting matrices are compatible with direct factorization using SuperLU_dist.

40|$|Perception of 2 -D ellipses on {{a picture}} surface is inaccurate-if the ellipses depict circles that are tilted in 3 -D, {{receding}} from the viewer (Hammad, Kennedy, Juricevic, & Rajani, 2008 a, Perception, 37, 504 - 510). Notably, the minor {{axis of the}} ellipse is seen as larger than is true. This illusory effect {{could be due to}} the simultaneous presence of optical information for the 2 -D ellipse and optical information for the 3 -D tilted circle. The optical information for the circle may bias vision's use of the optical information for the ellipse. This theory predicts that illusory effects should occur on the major axis as well as the minor axis; but, we argue, the major axis effect should be smaller than the minor axis effect. We confirm the prediction. Observers looked at target ellipses depicting tops of <b>tilted</b> <b>cylinders.</b> In one experiment observers chose a match for the target from choice sets of seven 2 -D ellipses.

The alignment process was followed with the block copolymer films in different initial states. Starting from a poorly ordered state, the cylindrical microdomain orientation was biased by the surface field that initially drove the cylindrical microdomains to be oriented {{parallel to the}} film surface. With further annealing, the cylinders were disrupted locally and formed ellipsoid-shaped microdomains that, with time, connected into cylindrical microdomains oriented in the field direction. Starting from an ordered state with cylinders parallel to the surface, the applied {{electric field}} enhanced fluctuations at the interfaces of the microdomains. The growth of the fluctuations continued until the cylindrical microdomains broke up into spherical microdomains, similar to that seen in the thermoreversible cylinder-to-sphere order-order transition.

The first part is focused on the case of a cylinder with a small tilt angle between the cylinder's axis and the vertical. The classical mode A well-known for a homogeneous fluid is still present. It is more unstable for moderate stratifications but it is stabilized by a strong stratification. The second part treats the case of a moderate tilt angle. For moderate stratifications, a new unstable mode appears, mode S, characterized by undulated layers of strong density gradients and axial flow. These structures correspond to Kelvin–Helmholtz billows created by the strong shear present in the critical layer of each tilted von Kármán vortex. The last two parts deal with the case of a strongly <b>tilted</b> <b>cylinder.</b> For a weak stratification, an instability (mode RT) appears far from the cylinder, due to the overturning of the isopycnals by the von Kármán vortices.
