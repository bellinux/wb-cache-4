2500|$|Rubber Soul was the group's first release not {{to feature}} their {{name on the}} cover, an {{uncommon}} tactic in 1965. The [...] "stretched" [...] effect of the cover photo came about after photographer Bob Freeman had taken some pictures of the group wearing suede leather jackets at Lennon's house. Freeman showed the photos by projecting them onto an album-sized piece of cardboard to simulate how they would appear on an album cover. The unusual Rubber Soul album cover came to be when the <b>slide</b> <b>card</b> fell slightly backwards, elongating the projected image of the photograph and stretching it. Excited by the effect, they shouted, [...] "Ah! Can we have that? Can you do it like that?", to which Freeman said he could. The distinctive lettering was created by photographer Charles Front, who recalled that his inspiration was the album's title: [...] "If you tap into a rubber tree then you get a sort of globule, so I started thinking of creating a shape that represented that, starting narrow and filling out." [...] The rounded letters used on the sleeve established a style that became ubiquitous in psychedelic designs and, according to The Guardian, [...] "a staple of poster art for the flower power generation".|$|E

50|$|The {{board is}} a 6x6 grid with grooves in the tiles to allow cars to <b>slide,</b> <b>card</b> tray {{to hold the}} cards, current active card holder and an exit hole. The game comes with 16 {{vehicles}} (12 cars, 4 trucks) which each are colored differently and 40 puzzle cards. Additionally the cars take up 2 squares each and the trucks take up 3 squares each. Also all vehicles can only be moved within a straight line along the grid and they cannot be rotated. Lastly, the puzzle card shows which colored cars and trucks get placed {{on the board and}} where they should be placed. In addition to that, each card has a different level number. The higher the level number, the more difficult the challenge is.|$|E

50|$|Card Warp {{starts out}} with the illusionist showing two cards. He then folds one card {{horizontally}} {{and the other one}} vertically. He <b>slides</b> the horizontal <b>card</b> into the vertical card so the horizontal card is inside of the vertical card. The illusionist then flips the cards over so that the vertical card is inside of the horizontal <b>card.</b> He <b>slides</b> the vertical <b>card</b> back and forth, and the card seemingly changes from front to back in the horizontal card. Both cards are then ripped down the middle and shown to be normal.|$|R

Another advantage relates to {{the speed at which}} users can access the system.

A disadvantage is that a new card costs $6. The cards expire after four years, and there is no charge for replacements.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{a set of}} experiments in which an upper-torso humanoid robot learned to <b>slide</b> a <b>card</b> through a card reader. The small size and {{the flexibility of the}} card presented a number of manipulation challenges for the robot. First, because most of the card is occluded by the card reader and the robot’s hand during the sliding process, visual feedback is useless for this task. Second, because the card bends easily, it is difficult to distinguish between bending and hitting an obstacle in order to correct the sliding trajectory. To solve these manipulation challenges this paper proposes a method for constraint detection that uses only proprioceptive data. The method uses dynamic joint torque thresholds that are calibrated using the robot’s movements in free space. The experimental results show that using this method, the robot can detect when the movement of the card is constrained and modify the sliding trajectory in real time, which makes solving this task possible.

40|$|Detection of {{drug-resistant}} tuberculosis {{is essential for}} the control of the disease but it is often hampered by the limitation of transport and storage of samples from remote locations to the reference laboratory. We performed a retrospective field study to evaluate the performance of four supports enabling the transport and storage of samples to be used for molecular detection of drug resistance using the GenoType MTBDRplus. Two hundred Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were selected and spotted on <b>slides,</b> FTA <b>cards,</b> GenoCards, and in ethanol. GenoType MTBDRplus was subsequently performed with the DNA extracted from these supports. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and compared to the results obtained by drug susceptibility testing. For all supports, the overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of resistance to RIF was between 95 % and 100 %, and for INH between 95 % and 98 %. The four transport and storage supports showed a good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of resistance to RIF and INH in M. tuberculosis strains using the GenoType MTBDRplus. These supports can be maintained at room temperature and could represent an important alternative cost-effective method useful for rapid molecular detection of drug-resistant TB in low-resource settings...|$|R
