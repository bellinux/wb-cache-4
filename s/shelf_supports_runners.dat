30|$|Although shelf acetabuloplasty {{leads to}} {{improved}} femoral head coverage, the available literature {{does not support}} the use of this procedure to prevent late osteoarthritis and improve function long term [17]. Recently, a new labral support technique has been reported. This shelf arthroplasty technique includes a minimal-incision variant of labral <b>support</b> <b>shelf</b> arthroplasty, arthroscopic visualization, and an allograft buttress on the <b>shelf</b> <b>support</b> that has been proposed to maintain containment. This minimal-incision technique yielded similar results to those obtained using a Petrie cast, a femoral varus osteotomy, or an innominate (Salter) osteotomy. The authors concluded that the labral <b>support</b> <b>shelf</b> arthroplasty technique is simple to perform and does not induce a permanent deformity in the proximal femur or acetabulum [6]. An advantage compared to femoral varus osteotomy is that there is additional lateral growth of the true acetabulum to generate more coverage following surgery. In this way, the labral support technique can stimulate lateral acetabular growth, restore the shelf after femoral epiphyseal reossification, and prevent subluxation [10].|$|R

5000|$|The Bach Ice Shelf (...) is an {{ice shelf}} which is {{irregular}} {{in shape and}} 45 mi in extent, occupying an embayment in the south part of Alexander Island entered between Berlioz Point and Rossini Point. The ice <b>shelf</b> <b>supports</b> the south face of the Beethoven Peninsula, along with some minor extensive peninsulas and small inlets (Weber Inlet, Boccherini Inlet etc.) Bach ice <b>shelf</b> also <b>supports</b> {{the north side of}} the Monteverdi Peninsula. A minor embayment in this position first appeared on the charts of the US Antarctic Service, which explored the south part of Alexander Island by air and from the ground in 1940. The ice shelf was delineated by Derek J.H. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960, from air photos obtained by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947 - 48. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after the German composer Johann Sebastian Bach.|$|R
50|$|Other {{marine life}} that thrives in the {{upwelling}} includes filter feeders like sponges, bryozoans, and corals. These animals feed predators such as seabirds, fishes, Australian fur seals, and penguins. The upwelling plays {{also an important}} role in the life cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), which accumulate in the eastern Great Australian Bight during the upwelling season and feed on sardines (Sardinops sagax) and anchovies (Engraulis australis). Furthermore, the many dead organisms that fall to the continental <b>shelf</b> <b>support</b> populations of southern rock lobster and giant crab.|$|R

An injury to Andrew Bishop prior to the second Test the following weekend saw Davies and Roberts renew their centre partnership, though this time Davies occupied the outside position.

The wan and meagre aspect of the family, the changed looks of the poor mother, the fevered child she held in her lap, the air of great despondency and little hope on everything, were plain to him, and made a deep impression on his mind. He saw it all as clearly and as quickly, as with his bodily eyes he saw the rough <b>shelves</b> <b>supported</b> by pegs driven between the logs, of which the house was made; the flour-cask in the corner, serving also for a table; the blankets, spades, and other articles against the walls; the damp that blotched the ground; or the crop of vegetable rottenness in every crevice of the hut.|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} Brazilian <b>shelf</b> <b>supports</b> {{the largest}} ﬁsh {{stocks in the}} country, and studies on physical–biological processes in the ecology of ichthyoplankton have been recommended to provide {{a better understanding of}} the variability of the recruitment of ﬁshing resources. This study is the ﬁrst to examine the inﬂuence of mesoscale physical processes on the distribution of early life stages of ﬁsh in this shelf-break region. Collections of ﬁsh eggs and larvae and measurements of temperature and salinity were made at 13 stations along cross-shelf transects in December 1997. Myctophidae, Bregmacerotidae, Clupeidae, Synodontidae and Engraulidae were the most abundant larvae in the northern region, while Engraulidae and Bregmacerotidae prevailed further south. In situ hydrographic data NOAA/AVHRR images and merged TOPEX/POSEIDON + ERS- 1 / 2 satellite altimetry taken during the cruise revealed an anticyclonic eddy dominating the shelf around 31 S. Larval ﬁsh abundance was lower at the centre of this feature, suggesting that the eddy advected poorer offshore waters of tropical origin towards the inner shelf-concentrating the larvae around the eddy...|$|R
40|$|The Newfoundland <b>Shelf</b> <b>supported</b> {{one of the}} world’s {{greatest}} fisheries {{until the}} main commercial species collapsed {{more than two decades}} ago. We calculated three ecological indices for individual populations and five for community from the data obtained in the research surveys conducted by Spain in NAFO Regulatory Area Divisions 3 NO between 2002 and 2013. We use data for 24 species to study the dynamics of major demersal fish assemblages (38 – 300, 301 – 600, and 601 – 1460 m depth) and evaluated how they have responded to different levels of exploitation. Trends and changes for individual populations (abundance and biomass, intrinsic population rate of growth, and mean length) and for all the community (ABC curves, indices of faunal diversity, proportion of non-commercial species, mean length in community and size spectra) were used to test ecological trends. Indices showed no homogeneous status and responded to different exploitation patterns, management, and environmental regimes in each assemblage. Our results show an improvement in the shallower and deeper assemblages and that fishing effort does not explain differences among each assemblage. Postprint 2, 277...|$|R
