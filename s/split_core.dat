40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the equal gain splitting rule and the <b>split</b> <b>core.</b> Both are solution concepts for sequencing situations and were introduced by Curiel, Pederzoli and Tijs (1989) and Hamers, Suijs, Tijs and Borm (1994) respectively. Our goal is a characterization of these solution concepts using consistency properties. However, to do this we need a more subtle look at the allocations assigned by both solution concepts. In the current definitions they assign aggregated allocations, i. e. only the total reward is assigned to each agent. To use consistency in sequencing situations, aggregated solution concepts do not provide sufficient information. What {{we need is a}} further specification of this total reward of an agent. Therefore we introduce so called non-aggregated solution concepts. A non-aggregated solution concept assigns a vector to each agent, in some way representing the specification of his total reward. Consequently, a non-aggregated solution concept assigns to each sequencing situation a matrix instead of a vector. In this paper we introduce the non-aggregated counter-parts of the equal gain splitting rule and the <b>split</b> <b>core</b> and characterize them using consistency. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe easy, {{hard and}} <b>split</b> <b>core</b> {{configurations}} of the screw dislocation {{and the energy}} pathways between them are studied in body-centered cubic (bcc) Fe and W using different density functional theory (DFT) approaches. All approaches indicate that in Fe, the hard core has a low relative energy, close to or even below that of the saddle configuration for a straight path between two easy cores. This surprising result is not {{a direct consequence of}} magnetism in bcc Fe. Moreover, the path followed by the dislocation core in the (111) plane between easy cores, identified here using two different methods to locate the dislocation position, is almost straight, while the energy landscape between the hard core position and the saddle configuration for a straight path is found to be very flat. These results in Fe are in contrast with predictions from empirical potentials as well as DFT calculations in W, where the hard core has an energy about twice that of the maximum energy along the Peierls barrier, and where the dislocation trajectory between easy cores is curved. Also, the <b>split</b> <b>core</b> configuration is found to be unstable in DFT and of high energy in both Fe and W, in contrast with predictions from most empirical potentials.

Journal of Quaternary Science, 25 (3), pp. 348 - 353 Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is widely used to date clastic deposits, including those collected by coring. X-ray scanning of cores has become popular because of the rapidly acquired, high-resolution information it gives about optical, radiographic and elemental variations.

The new Avaatech XRF Core Scanner, operational since 2002, covers theatomic mass range from A 1 to U.

Owing {{to the nature of}} the surface of <b>split</b> sediment <b>cores,</b> particu-larly effects resulting from sample inhomogeneity and surface roughness, results are semi-quantitative, yet provide reliable records of the relative variability in elemental composition downcore.
