25|$|One notable {{difference}} between a BBS or web forum and Usenet {{is the absence of}} a central server and dedicated administrator. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers that <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>forward</b> messages to one another in so-called news feeds. Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by a commercial usenet provider, their Internet service provider, university, employer, or their own server.|$|E
25|$|In this fashion, Rush's system {{implemented}} a <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>forward</b> public message system similar to Usenet, but based on, and hosted by, the FidoNet system. The first such echomail forum was one {{created by the}} Dallas area sysops to discuss business, known as SYSOP. Another called TECH soon followed. Several public echos soon followed, including GAYNET and CLANG. These spawned hundreds of new echos, {{and led to the}} creation of the Echomail Conference List (Echolist) by Thomas Kenny in January 1987. Echomail produced world-spanning shared forums, and its traffic volume quickly surpassed the original netmail system. By the early 1990s, echo mail was carrying over 8 MB of compressed message traffic a day, many times that when uncompressed.|$|E
50|$|All APRS {{messages}} are delivered live in real-time to online recipients. Messages are not <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarded,</b> but retried until timed out. The delivery of these messages is global, since the APRS-IS distributes all packets {{to all other}} IGates {{in the world and}} those that are messages will actually go back to RF via any IGate that is near the intended recipient.|$|R
50|$|Packet {{switching}} features {{delivery of}} {{variable bit rate}} data streams, realized as sequences of packets, over a computer network which allocates transmission resources as needed using statistical multiplexing or dynamic bandwidth allocation techniques. As they traverse network nodes, such as switches and routers, packets are received, buffered, queued, <b>and</b> transmitted (<b>stored</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarded),</b> resulting in variable latency and throughput depending on the link capacity and the traffic load on the network.|$|R

25|$|Whenever {{the laptop}} is powered on it can {{participate}} in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with each node operating in a peer-to-peer fashion with other laptops it can hear, forwarding packets across the cloud. If a computer in the cloud {{has access to the}} Internet—either directly or indirectly—then all computers in the cloud are able to share that access. The data rate across this network will not be high; however, similar networks, such as the <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>forward</b> Motoman project have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications (such as email) to communicate outside the cloud; interactive uses, such as web browsing, or high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming should be possible inside the cloud. The IP assignment for the meshed network is intended to be automatically configured, so no server administrator or an administration of IP addresses is needed.|$|E
25|$|As {{is it was}} prohibitively {{expensive}} for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>forward</b> network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with ARC or ZIP and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup Xmodem session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.|$|E

30|$|Much of the {{research}} work {{has been focused on}} developing protocols and methodologies to disseminate safety and road hazards using vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Vehicles are used as forwarder nodes for transmission of these messages to other vehicles approaching the danger zones. This pre-supposes that the vehicular traffic is sufficient to ensure transmission. V 2 V communication would not be possible in areas where vehicular traffic is light. However, the concepts of <b>store</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>and</b> selective <b>forwarding</b> are important <b>and</b> need to be considered while designing safety message dissemination protocols for highway scenarios with sparse population of vehicles. Hence in this section, we first discuss work related to protocols for safety message propagation. Since we propose the use of RSUs for our protocol, we also discuss related work that uses RSUs for disseminating safety related messages.|$|R
30|$|Traffic shaping in TBF {{implies that}} when the traffic exceeds its demand rate, excess traffic will not be dropped but instead will be stored in a buffer and {{transmitted}} later. This kind of traffic control might increase the heavy load to the wireless router for <b>storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> the packets into queues. To reduce loads on the access router, we consider utilizing both traffic shaping and traffic policing mechanisms. For traffic policing, the excess traffic will be immediately dropped, thus the wireless router no longer needs to use any memory resource for buffering excessive packets.|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} extreme, some {{wireless}} networks {{may not have}} continuous network connectivity due to the mobility and/or extreme conditions of the environment so that even the well-known ad hoc routing protocols such as AODV [75] and DSR [76] do not work well. Such networks in the literature are called delay-tolerant networks [53 – 57]. These networks range from terrestrial mobile networks and military ad hoc networks to deep space communications. The overall routing/path setup is based on store-and-forward routing so that the data is incrementally <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarded</b> over the network until it eventually reaches the intended destination.|$|R

30|$|The {{trend in}} remote sensing {{missions}} {{has always been}} towards using hardware devices with smaller size, lower cost, more flexibility, and higher computational power [18, 19]. On-board processing, as a solution, allows for a good reutilization of expensive hardware resources. Instead of <b>storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> all captured images, remote sensing data interpretation can be performed on orbit prior to downlink, resulting in a significant reduction of communication bandwidth as well as simpler and faster subsequent computations to be performed at ground stations. In this regard, FPGAs combine the flexibility of traditional microprocessors with the power and performance of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Therefore, FPGAs are a promising candidate for on-board remote sensing data processing.|$|R

On the one hand we describe architectural consideration addressing functional elements and their organization in the computing environment. On the other hand we incorporate a model for request-driven context gathering and a biologically-inspired approach for weighting, <b>storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> context data.
