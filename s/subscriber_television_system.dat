50|$|Cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> {{impose a}} monthly fee {{depending}} on the number and perceived quality of the channels offered. Cable <b>television</b> <b>subscribers</b> are offered various packages of channels one can subscribe to.

These fees cover the fees paid to individual cable channels for the right to carry their programming, as well as the cost of operating and maintaining the cable <b>television</b> <b>system</b> so that their signals can reach subscribers' homes. Additional cable television franchise fees and taxes are often tacked on by local, state, and federal governments.|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} several years, proponents of cable {{television}} have predicted {{dramatic changes in the}} telecommunications field with the advent of cable TV.

40|$|Cable {{television}} public limited partnerships are empirically {{examined for}} evidence of an incentive problem when managers purchase cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> from the partnerships and {{for evidence of}} earnings management in the partnerships preceding cable system sales. Results {{are consistent with the}} notions that managerial self-interest dominates a fiduciary duty to owners in this incentive setting and that managers manage earnings preceding their purchase of cable <b>television</b> <b>systems.</b> ^ Empirical evidence shows that cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> acquired by managers are at significantly lower prices than sales of cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> to unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> acquired by managers that are geographically proximate to systems already owned by managers are shown to command higher prices. Ownership votes preceding cable <b>television</b> <b>system</b> sales to managers are examined and found not to be significantly associated with cable <b>television</b> <b>system</b> sale prices. Potential alternative explanations for the empirical results are explored and rejected. ^ Earnings management through the use of discretionary accruals is examined, as well as, “real” earnings management through an examination of changes in investment and operating expenses, and pricing of cable television services to customers. Discretionary accruals are found to be negatively associated with the purchase of cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> by managers, while investment and operating expenses are found to be positively associated with the purchase of cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> by managers. Evidence of lower pricing of cable services to customers preceding management purchases of cable <b>television</b> <b>systems</b> is also presented. ...|$|R
