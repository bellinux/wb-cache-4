40|$|The {{process of}} <b>spin-off</b> firm {{formation}} exerts {{a profound impact}} on industry evolution. One important trigger for <b>spin-off</b> formation is the impact that adverse events such as corporate restructuring or bankruptcy have on organizations. We explore, {{in the context of the}} Irish biotechnology industry, the mechanisms by which adverse events lead to <b>spin-off</b> formation. We show that an adverse event may create unanticipated opportunities for those employees who are in a position to exploit them. We contend this manner of <b>spin-off</b> formation does not fit neatly into the existing opportunity/necessity conceptualisation of <b>spin-off</b> formation. Contributions include the extension of existing <b>spin-off</b> typologies to include what we define as “opportunistic spin-offs”; and the identification of instances of adverse events that might lead to “opportunistic spin-offs”...|$|R

Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as <b>spin-offs</b> of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.|$|E

40|$|The article {{explores the}} <b>spin-off</b> effect {{controversy}} surrounding {{the role of}} military spending in economic development by investigating its impact on output in six industries linked to the military.

The results suggest that military spending's direct impact on output in each industry is negative or insignificant depending on whether adjustments for trade in armaments are made. The results also fail to substantiate physical and human capital <b>spin-off</b> effects. Based on these results, the article concludes that the case for <b>spin-off</b> effects has been exaggerated.
