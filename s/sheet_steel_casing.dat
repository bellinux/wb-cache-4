40|$|The seismic {{design of}} bridges {{may require a}} large-diameter deep pile {{foundation}} such as a cast-in-steel-shell (CISS) pile where a reinforced concrete (RC) member is cast in a <b>steel</b> <b>casing.</b> In practice, the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> is not considered in the structural design and the pile {{is assumed to be}} an RC member. It is partially attributed to the difficulties in evaluation of composite action of a CISS pile. However, by considering benefits provided by composite action of the infilled concrete and the <b>steel</b> <b>casing,</b> both the cost and size of CISS pile can be reduced. In this study, the structural behavior of the RC pier and the CISS pile connection is simulated by using an advanced 3 D finite element (FE) method, where the interface between the steel and concrete is also modeled. Firstly, the FE model is verified. Then, the parametric study is conducted. The analysis results suggest that the embedment length and the friction coefficient between the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> and the infilled concrete affect the structural behavior of the RC pier. Finally, the minimum embedment length with reference to the AASHTO design guideline is suggested considering the composite action of the CISS pile...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{resistance}} tomography (ERT) {{using multiple}} electrodes installed in boreholes {{has been shown}} to be useful for both site characterization and process monitoring. In some cases, however, installing multiple downhole electrodes is too costly (e. g., deep targets) or risky (e. g., contaminated sites). For these cases we have examined the possibility of using the <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> of existing boreholes as electrodes. Several possibilities can be considered. The first case we investigated uses an array of <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> as electrodes. This results in very few data and thus requires additional constraints to limit the domain of possible inverse solutions. Simulations indicate that the spatial resolution and sensitivity are understandably low but it is possible to coarsely map the lateral extent of subsurface processes such as steam floods. The second case uses an array of traditional point borehole electrodes combined with long-conductor electrodes (<b>steel</b> <b>casings).</b> Although this arrangement provides more data, in many cases it results in poor reconstructions of test targets. Results indicate that this method may hold promise for low resolution imaging where <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> can be used as electrodes but the merits depend strongly on details of each application. Field tests using these configurations are currently being conducted...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Automobile body sheets mainly resist {{impact and}} pressure. However, the fatigue {{property}} {{is one of}} the main factors with regard to properties of <b>sheet</b> <b>steels.</b> Continuous vibration happens all over the <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> (especially chassis) while the vehicle is in motion. And the fatigue property becomes particularly important in the condition above. Fatigue tests are conducted to four kinds of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> for automobile in this paper. The fatigue lives of samples from <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> are obtained according to the various stresses. The inferior limits of fatigue life and the inferior limits of fatigue strength under the higher stresses are acquired by the computation of fatigue data. Furthermore, the test results show that there is a certain relationship among the tensile strength, yielding strength and inferior limit of fatigue strength for these <b>sheet</b> <b>steels.</b> This paper is of certain reference significance for other similar test...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} a new method for online {{analysis}} of the zinc coating of galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is presented. The coating is characterized {{with a series of}} single laser bursts irradiated on the traversing <b>sheet</b> <b>steel,</b> each on a different <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> position. To achieve an ablation depth in the range of the coating thickness of about 10 µm a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double pulse mode was used. The depth information is obtained by control of the ablation depth by adjusting the burst energy using an external electro-optical attenuator. Concepts for the determination of the coating thickness and the chemical composition are presented. The achieved thickness resolution is estimated to about 400 nm for coating thicknesses of electrolytic galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> in the range of 3. 2 to 11. 2 µm. In the case of hot-dip galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> information about the depth profile of aluminium can be gained by the new method...|$|R
40|$|During the {{production}} of galvanised <b>sheet</b> <b>steel,</b> key monitoring parameters are the thickness and chemical composition of the zinc coating. For this purpose a new method was developed for the online characterisation of galvanised <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and a transportable measuring unit was set up. Concepts for {{the determination of the}} coating thickness and the aluminium depth profile of hot-dip galvanised coatings were developed. To simulate the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> velocity in the plant of up to 2 m/s LIBS measurements are performed on rotating <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> discs mounted on a rotary stage. The depth resolution is determined by using well characterised industrially coated <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> with different coating thicknesses (4. 1 to 11. 2 µm) and aluminium depth profiles as reference samples. A thickness resolution of better than 150 nm is achieved. For a measuring system designed for an online application the measurement time for an aluminium depth profile will be 10 seconds and for the determination of the coating thickness 200 ms. The impact of the LIBS craters on the <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> quality is minimised by using burst energies below 3 mJ.
