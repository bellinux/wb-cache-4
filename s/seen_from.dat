5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round {{body like a}} cylinder illuminated and <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> above appears to have dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> above.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> the planet Earth) {{is a type}} of eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
