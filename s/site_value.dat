50|$|The other {{argument}} is that the prices of new dwellings should exclude that part reflecting {{the value of the}} land, since this is an irreproducible and permanent asset that cannot be said to be consumed. This would presumably mean deducting <b>site</b> <b>value</b> from the price of a dwelling, <b>site</b> <b>value</b> presumably being defined as the price the site would fetch at auction if the dwelling were not on it. How this is to be understood in the case of multiple dwellings remains unclear.|$|E

Section 26(1) of the Act required the Board of Inland Revenue to ascertain the <b>site</b> <b>value</b> of all land in the United Kingdom as on 30 April 1909. This value constituted the [...] "datum line" [...] for the purposes of increment value duty. Any subsequent sale or grant of a lease, or transfer of an interest in a piece of land, or the subsequent death of a land-owner, provided the occasion for a potential payment of increment value duty; the <b>site</b> <b>value</b> at that date had then to be determined.|$|E

50|$|Until 1918, both Stoke and Hanley {{had been}} {{represented}} by Liberal MPs. The Liberal Party {{in the area}} was heavily influenced by support for radical land reform policies such as <b>Site</b> <b>Value</b> Rating and the Single Tax policy. These policies were advocated by R.L. Outhwaite, the MP for Hanley and Josiah Wedgwood, the MP for neighbouring Newcastle-under-Lyne. After 1918, they both left the Liberal Party and joined the Labour Party. There they influenced Andrew MacLaren. who was for many years the standard-bearer for the Labour Party and an advocate of <b>Site</b> <b>Value</b> Rating. At the 1931 General Election, the supporters of land reform were split when MacLaren was opposed by a candidate who advocated a Single Tax policy. This split contributed to MacLaren's defeat. He returned to Parliament in 1935, but left the Labour Party in 1943 and sought re-election as an Independent.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the value}} of the {{commercial}} lot as vacant in [...] "House B" [...] exceeds {{the value of}} house as a residence as improved plus demolition costs, the overall highest and best use of this property would be the as vacant value of the commercial lot. For example, assume that [...] "House B" [...] has a value as a house of $200,000, and a <b>site</b> <b>value</b> as a commercial lot of $250,000 with a cost to demolish the house and prepare the site at $25,000. The highest and best use of the site is to demolish the house and sell the site as a commercial lot. The market value would be $225,000 ($250,000 <b>site</b> <b>value</b> minus $25,000 demolition cost). However, if the demolition costs rose to $55,000, the highest and best use would be the existing residential use, because the value as a commercial lot (now $195,000) would not exceed the existing value as a residence.|$|E

50|$|This {{approach}} {{estimates the}} construction {{cost of the}} improvements, as if new, and deducts factors for depreciation, disutility, and external obsolescence.

5000|$|In the United States, {{property}} tax {{on real estate}} is usually levied by local government, at the municipal or county level.

As of now there are 50+ franchisee hostels and YHAI regularly monitors all its hostels to establish if they are still viable and if necessary closes those that are no longer viable or have no prospects of becoming viable again in the future. However the network renewal project was on top of this regular review and was a proposal to increase the network to more than 100 by 2011. The aim of the exercise was to reduce borrowing and to provide funds for re-investment into the network.

5000|$|In {{his early}} years in Parliament, Royds was noted for his {{activism}} {{in opposition to the}} land tax valuation provisions which had been introduced in the 1909 [...] "People's budget" [...] by David Lloyd George. He {{was a member of the}} council of the Land Union, which had been founded in 1910 by Ernest Pretyman to unite [...] "for mutual protection all those whose property or businesses are based on land in any form". Royds was chairman of the Land Union's legal committee,and in the Commons he repeatedly challenged the valuation process. In June 1912 he sought to reduce the budget of the Land Valuation Office, claiming that its imposed a heavy burden on land-owners and was producing valuations which include improvements rather than, as required, reflect the <b>site</b> <b>value.</b> He pressed his points on motions for the adjournment and questioned where the government was seeking a true valuation of the land. In 1913 he claimed that the valuation process had restricted the availability of credit to land-owners, resulting in a reduction in the number of small houses and cottages built for labourers. He claimed that government figures showed the number of new houses having fallen from an average of 107,000 a year under the previous government to 80,000 after 1906, and only 10,000 in 1910-11, but the government responded that such falls were common after revaluations.|$|E

[...] However, the network renewal project {{was on top of}} this regular review and was a proposal to close and dispose of 32 hostels when it was announced. The aim of the exercise was to reduce borrowing and to provide funds for re-investment into the network. The closures were to take place over a three-year period, over and above the 13 others disposed of in the same period. The hostels involved were not necessarily poor performers but ones where the amount of investment required to bring them up to a desired standard was excessive e.g. Steps Bridge, or in some cases because the <b>site</b> <b>value</b> was very high, e.g. Stainforth. When the news broke, there was a storm of protest not only among the membership, but also in local communities [...] and local and regional government.Despite the protests, YHA proceeded with the plan.

40|$|BACKGROUND Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) and {{fibromyalgia syndrome}} (FMS) are common conditions with some AND AIM: similarities, but different perceptual responses to somatic and visceral stimuli. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess in a large group of IBS patients the somatic perception by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and its relation to the level of severity and presence of FMS. METHODS: In 99 patients grouped by the validated functional bowel disorder severity index (FBDSI) in mild, moderate, and severe IBS and in 33 healthy controls (HC), we studied discomfort thresholds and perception of somatic stimuli at control (hands and elbows) and active (trapezius) sites by TENS and by using a specific questionnaire. RESULTS: The use of TENS showed that IBS showed significant higher thresholds and lower perception cumulative score compared to HC. The severity of IBS is significantly associated with age and mean control <b>site</b> <b>values</b> for discomfort and borderline associated with gender in the ordinal model constructed for the ascending series protocol. The severity of IBS is also significantly associated with the active cumulative perception score in the long stimulus protocol. Due to limited sample size of IBS men with FMS, analyses of discomfort thresholds and cumulative perception score by FMS were done only for women. IBS women without FMS had significantly higher mean control <b>site</b> <b>values</b> for discomfort and significantly lower active cumulative perception score than HC. IBS women with FMS had significantly lower mean active <b>site</b> <b>values</b> for discomfort thresholds than IBS women without FMS (Dunn’s test p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: IBS patients showed somatic hypoalgesia to electrical stimuli. The severity of IBS and the presence of FMS influence the perception of somatic stimuli induced by TENS...|$|R
5000|$|As an {{extension}} of his research in spacial economics, Hotelling realized {{that it would be}} possible and socially optimal to finance investment in public goods through a Georgist land value tax and then provide such goods and services to the public at marginal cost (in many cases for free). This is an early expression of the Henry George theorem that Joseph Stiglitz and others expanded upon. Hotelling pointed out that when local public goods like roads and trains become congested, users create an additional marginal cost of excluding others. Hotelling became an early advocate of Georgist congestion pricing and stated that the purpose of this unique type of toll fee was in no way to recoup investment costs but was instead a way of changing behavior and compensating those who are excluded. Hotelling describes how human attention is also in limited supply at any given time and place, which produces a rental value; he concludes that billboards could be regulated or taxed on similar grounds as other scarcity rents. Hotelling reasoned that rent and taxation were analogous, the public and private versions of a similar thing. Therefore, the social optimum would be to put taxes directly on rent. Kenneth Arrow described this as 'market socialism', but Mason Gaffney points out that it is actually 'Georgism'. Hotelling added the following comment about the ethics of Georgist value capture: [...] "The proposition that there is no ethical objection to the confiscation of the <b>site</b> <b>value</b> of land by taxation, if and when the nonlandowning classes can get the power to do so, has been ably defended by Georgist H. G. Brown." ...|$|E
40|$|A major {{difficulty}} in implementing land/site value taxation is imputing the land value of built-on sites. The literature {{has focused on}} two alternatives. The first, residual <b>site</b> <b>value,</b> measures postdevelopment <b>site</b> <b>value</b> as property value less structure value, with structure value measured as depreciated construction costs. Residual <b>site</b> <b>value</b> would be relatively easy to estimate, but a residual <b>site</b> <b>value</b> tax system, which taxes land value before development and residual <b>site</b> <b>value</b> after development {{at the same rate}} is distortionary, discouraging density. The second, raw <b>site</b> <b>value,</b> measures postdevelopment <b>site</b> <b>value</b> as "what the land would be worth were there no building on the site (though in fact there is). " Raw <b>site</b> <b>value</b> taxation is neutral (does not distort the timing and density of development), but the estimation of postdevelopment raw <b>site</b> <b>value</b> would be complex so that assessment would likely be less fair and more arbitrary, contentious, and prone to abuse. This paper asks the question: Is it not possible to design a property tax system (taxation of predevelopment land value, postdevelopment structure value, and postdevelopment <b>site</b> <b>value</b> at possibly different rates) that employs the administratively simpler residual definition of postdevelopment <b>site</b> <b>value</b> and achieves neutrality? Under restrictive assumptions and subject to an important qualification, the paper provides an affirmative answer, and characterizes the tax rates that achieve neutrality.
