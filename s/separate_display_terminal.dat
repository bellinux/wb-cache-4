40|$|<b>Display</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{although}} {{faster than}} typewriter devices, do not implicitly create {{records of the}} user’s interactive sessions. Based {{on the premise that}} a <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> session facility that also has the record-keeping functions of typewriter terminals would increase productivity, a research project was undertaken that has resulted in the session manager discussed. Experience with the system is summarized. A time-sharing <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> session manager by J. M. McCrossin, R. P. O’Hara, and L. R. Koster <b>Display</b> <b>terminals</b> are tending to supplant typewriter terminals as the interactive computing terminal of choice. To many interactive users, <b>display</b> <b>terminals</b> offer special features that increase productivity, especially for programmers. Part of the increased productivity comes from the <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> itself (e. g., the capability of on-screen editing). To take full advantage of <b>display</b> <b>terminals,</b> however, the time-sharing system must provide support of a very different sort than that needed for typewriter terminals. Most time-sharing systems are line oriented because they have been designed to be accessed from typewriter terminals. In a lineoriented system, the user accomplishes work by typing command statements one line at a time on a keyboard. The system responds with one or more lines of messages or other output. Thus a terminal session is a conversation between the user and the system, and is recorded on the typewriter terminal sheet, which serves as a hard copy record. If a user wants to review a command or output from earlier in a session, he merely looks back on the <b>terminal</b> sheet. Although <b>display</b> <b>terminals</b> offer many advantages over type-writers, such as high-speed data display and quietness of opera-Copyright 1978 by International Business Machines Corporation.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Hughes CONOGRAPHIC- 12 Graphics <b>Display</b> <b>Terminal</b> in a computer graphics-aided aircraft information handling system. The approach taken in this study was to implement a realistic aircraft information handling system on a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP- 11 / 50 minicomputer within the conventions of the C programming language and the UNIX operating system at the Naval Postgraduate School Computer Laboratory. The study includes a description of previous efforts in the area, a description of the CONOGRAPHIC- 12 hardware and the software written to evaluate the <b>display</b> <b>terminal.</b> The study also includes an evaluation of the CONOGRAPHIC- 12 <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> as both a dynamic interactive <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> and a repeater-only terminal at six representative stations.

40|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} video <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> {{has been}} designed and implemented, {{and is now in}} commercial production. The terminal is a microcomputer system that shares a block of memory with some specialized video generation hardware. Data that is stored in the memory by the microcomputer is made to appear as characters on the video screen by the hardware. The primary function of the microcomputer is to accept ASCII characters from a host system and cause them to be displayed on the screen in the appropriate place. This function includes interpretation of control characters (e. g. carriage return, line feed) and maintenance of a cursor. A significant design difference between this terminal and most others is that the data is stored in the memory as pixels rather than as characters. This permits the terminal to function as both a standard 80 by 24 character <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> and as a medium resolution graphics <b>display</b> <b>terminal.</b> Secondary functions of the microcomputer include encoding characters typed on a keyboard and transmitting them to the host system, scrolling the alphanumeric display, and generating vectors that are specified by their endpoints.
