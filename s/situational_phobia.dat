50|$|A Swedish {{study found}} that females have a higher {{incidence}} than males (26.5 percent for females and 12.4 percent for males). Among adults, 21.2 percent of women and 10.9 percent of men have a single specific phobia, while multiple phobias occur in 5.4 percent of females and 1.5 percent of males. Women are nearly four times as likely as men to have a fear of animals (12.1 percent in women and 3.3 percent in men) â€” a higher dimorphic than with all specific or generalized phobias or social phobias. Social phobias are more common in girls than in boys, while <b>situational</b> <b>phobia</b> occurs in 17.4 percent of women and 8.5 percent of men.|$|E
40|$|Background: Fear {{reactions}} in phobic patients can be activated by specific perceptual cues (C) or by conceptual fear-related information (I). An earlier study with spider phobic participants documented that perceptual stimuli are particularly potent to trigger fear responses. Because fear of spiders is activated by very circumscribed stimuli, {{we set out}} to investigate whether another phobia with more contextual fear-elicitation (i. e., a <b>situational</b> <b>phobia)</b> would yield similar patterns. Thus, we investigate the two paths of fear activation (cues vs. information) and fear reduction during exposure in claustrophobic patients. Method: Forty-eight claustrophobic patients and 48 healthy control participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three virtual reality exposure conditions: C, I, or a combination of both (CI). Exposure lasted 5 min and was repeated 4 times. Self-report and physiological reactions were assessed. Results: Claustrophobic patients experienced more initial self-reported fear when confronted with fear-relevant perceptual cues than conceptual information, when the perceptual cues were combined with conceptual information there was no significant enhancement. Furthermore, fear habituated more in the perceptual condition. For the physiological parameters, groups differed and in claustrophobic patients heart rate decreased differently in the conditions. Limitations: Longer exposure duration and long-term effects of the manipulation were not investigated. Conclusion: We found similar patterns in a <b>situational</b> <b>phobia</b> as compared to a specific-cue related phobia (animal type). Thus, once more this highlights the central role of visual cues in phobic fear and the potential of virtual reality for conducting exposure therapy...|$|E
40|$|Although {{simple phobia}} is a {{residual}} category in DSM-III, clinical experience suggests {{at least four}} subtypes of this group. To test {{the validity of the}} subtypes, the authors compared patients with one of four simple phobias subtypes (n: ANIMAL-INSECT = 25, BLOOD-INJURY = 9, SITUATIONAL = 46, CHOKING-VOMIT = 8). Significant sex differences were observed; all animal and insect phobics and seven of eight choking-vomit phobics were female, while the other two groups showed approximately equal numbers of males and females. Mean age of onset was significantly older for situational phobics than animal-insect or blood-injury phobics; choking-vomit probands were intermediate. Frequency of <b>situational</b> <b>phobias</b> differed significantly among relatives of the four proband groups, with highest frequency being found among situational probands. Thus, these clinical and epidemiological variables support the separation of simple phobia into at least these four diagnostic groups...|$|R
40|$|George, a 23 -year-old Greek student, was {{referred}} by a psychiatrist for treatment to a University Counseling Centre in Athens. He {{was diagnosed with}} social anxiety disorder and specific <b>phobia</b> <b>situational</b> type. He was complaining of panic attacks and severe symptoms of anxiety. These symptoms were triggered when in certain social situations and also when travelling by plane, driving a car and visiting tall buildings or high places. His symptoms lead him to avoid finding himself in such situations, {{to the point that}} it had affected his daily life. George was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and with specific <b>phobia,</b> <b>situational</b> type (in this case acrophobia) and was given 20 individual sessions of cognitive-behavior therapy. Following therapy, and follow-up occurring one month post treatment, George no longer met the criteria for social phobia and symptoms leading to acrophobia were reduced. He demonstrated improvements in many areas including driving a car in and out of Athens and visiting tall buildings...|$|R
40|$|The Youth Anxiety Measure for DSM- 5 (YAM- 5) {{is a new}} self- and parent-report {{questionnaire}} to assess anxiety disorder symptoms {{in children and adolescents}} in terms of the contemporary classification system. International panels of childhood anxiety researchers and clinicians were used to construct a scale consisting of two parts: part one consists of 28 items and measures the major anxiety disorders including separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder, whereas part two contains 22 items that focus on specific phobias and (given its overlap with <b>situational</b> <b>phobias)</b> agoraphobia. In general, the face validity of the new scale was good; most of its items were successfully linked to the intended anxiety disorders. Notable exceptions were the selective mutism items, which were frequently considered as symptoms of social anxiety disorder, and some specific phobia items especially of the natural environment, situational and other type, that were regularly assigned to an incorrect category. A preliminary investigation of the YAM- 5 in non-clinical (N = 132) and clinically referred (N = 64) children and adolescents indicated that the measure was easy to complete by youngsters. In addition, support was found for the psychometric qualities of the measure: that is, the internal consistency was good for both parts, as well as for most of the subscales, the parent-child agreement appeared satisfactory, and there was also evidence for the validity of the scale. The YAM- 5 holds promise as a tool for assessing anxiety disorder symptoms in children and adolescents...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} assessment of fear or anxiety requires measurement of both self-report and physiological responses. Respiratory abnormalities have been rarely examined during real-life exposure, {{although they are}} an integral part of fear. Twenty-one women with a specific driving phobia and 17 nonphobic women were psychophysiologically monitored during 2 highway-driving sessions; phobic women completed an additional session. Respiratory movements, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, an electrocardiogram, skin conductance, and skin temperature were recorded. Phobic patients differed from control participants both physiologically and experientially before, during, and after exposure. Effect size during exposure was large for the authors' measure of hyperventilation. Discriminant analysis indicated that multiple physiological measures contributed nonredundant information and correctly classified 95 % of phobic and control participants. Thus, selected respiratory and autonomic measures are valid diagnostic and therapeutic outcome criteria for this <b>situational</b> <b>phobia...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ablutophobia (from Latin ablutere 'to wash off") is the persistent, {{abnormal}} and unwarranted fear of bathing, washing, or cleaning. This <b>phobia</b> is a <b>situational</b> specific <b>phobia.</b> Ablutophobia {{tends to}} be more common in children and females than in males. However, the fear generally dissipates in children as they learn that bathing is not something to be feared. Ablutophobia is more common in European nations as well as people of European descendants in other countries, it is because bathing was not a common practice {{for a long time in}} most part of Europe until modern age. Scientists say that in 16th century, almost all people of English, French and other European countries had symptoms of ablutophobia. Elizabeth the first of England is known as one of the most [...] "clean" [...] person of Europe from that period of time, for washing her body once a month. However, back then that was considered to be too much of washing and unhealthy. A research shows that the symptoms of ablutophobia led to a major contribution of the development of fragrance.|$|R
40|$|Negative mental imagery {{has been}} shown to be {{involved}} in the onset and maintenance of numerous clinical disorders and as a result there has been growing scientific study of the therapeutic role of positive mental imagery, with studies reporting favourable results. However, with regard to social anxiety (SA) disorder the conventional approach to induce positive mental imagery has been suggested to be too demanding due to impairment in the retrieval of such episodes. Therefore, researchers have called for controlled studies to explore alternative inducement techniques with specific focus upon future orientated methods (a method more suitable for patients with SA). In the current study, we compare the conventional inducement technique (past) to a future orientated inducement technique (future) and a control condition (no imagery) and measure the impact upon self-reported levels of anxiety in a non-clinical population. Seventy-Eight younger students were randomly allocated to one of the two imagery inducement techniques or the control condition (and completed anxiety scales before and after imagery inducement or control task). To capture <b>situational</b> anxiety, <b>phobia</b> and broader short and long term (state versus trait) dysfunction the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were the chosen measures. Results confirmed that positive mental imagery reduces feelings of anxiety and demonstrated, for the first time, the effectiveness of a hypothetical future orientated technique to induce positive mental imagery. These data will provide the groundwork for intervention development in clinical populations with known difficulties capitalising on past based mental imagery...|$|R
5000|$|The present {{case series}} with two {{patients}} explored whether virtual reality (VR) distraction could reduce claustrophobia symptoms during a mock {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) brain scan. Two patients who met DSM-IV criteria for specific <b>phobia,</b> <b>situational</b> type (i.e., claustrophobia) reported high levels of anxiety during a mock 10-min MRI procedure with no VR, and asked to terminate the scan early. The patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either VR or music distraction for their second scan attempt. When immersed in an illusory three-dimensional (3D) virtual world named SnowWorld, patient 1 was able to complete a 10-min mock scan with low anxiety and reported an increase in self-efficacy afterwards. Patient 2 received [...] "music only" [...] distraction during her second scan but was still not able to complete a 10-min scan and asked to terminate her second scan early. These results suggest that immersive VR may prove effective at temporarily reducing claustrophobia symptoms during MRI scans and music may prove less effective.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The {{essential}} {{feature of}} specific phobia is a persistent fear of clearly discernable, circumscribed objects or situations. The DSM-IV distinguishes four subtypes: animal, natural environment, blood-injection-injury, and <b>situational.</b> Specific <b>phobias</b> frequently co-occur. Specific phobia {{is one of}} the most common psychiatric disorders with a lifetime prevalence of 12. 5 % and is about twice as common in women as in men. Most phobias have a childhood onset except for the situational subtype which usually occurs during patients' twenties. It is well known that childhood anxiety increases the risk of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety in later life, as well as the risk of suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalization. Nonetheless, there are few studies on the psychobiology and pharmacotherapy of specific phobias. Neuroimaging studies have shown that specific phobia seems to be associated with amygdala (more specifically the right amygdala) and anterior cingulate cortex hyperactivation that is reduced after exposure therapy. The aim of this study is to propose the first systematic review of specific phobia treatment among children. METHOD: The review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Two databases (Medline and Web of Science) were searched combining the search terms: specific phobia and treatment. English and French language were imposed. There were no publication date or publication status limitations. Seventy-four studies met the inclusion criteria and 36 were included. RESULTS: The goal of treatment is to achieve habituation and eventual extinction of the phobic reaction. Treatments for children's anxiety have been suggested to work through diverse processes such as counter-conditioning, extinction, habituation, change in catastrophic cognitions, development of coping skills, increased self-efficacy, emotional processing, and changes in expectancies and perceptions of dangerousness. Most phobias respond robustly to in vivo exposure, but this approach is associated with high dropout rates and low treatment acceptance. One Session Treatment, a variant of cognitive-behavioral therapy, combines graduated in vivo exposure, participant modeling, reinforcement, psychoeducation, cognitive challenges, and skills training in an intensive treatment model. The limited data available on medication shows little promise. Finally, relapse is a common phenomenon, and little is known on the long-term outcome of the illness...|$|R
