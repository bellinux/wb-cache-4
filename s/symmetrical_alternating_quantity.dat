40|$|The electrophoretic {{deposition}} of glucose oxidase from water using asymmetrical alternating voltages is investigated. Using asymmetric voltages, glucose oxidase layers with a thickness of 7 mu m could be deposited on a platinum electrode in 20 min time as verified with a microbalance, carbon analysis and scanning electron microscopy. In contrast, if a <b>symmetrical</b> <b>alternating</b> signal is used {{under the same}} conditions, a layer of 0. 5 mu m is formed. We believe the deposition is due to two effects: the electrophoretic migration of the enzyme towards the deposition electrode and the pH induced precipitation of the enzyme near the deposition electrode. The electrophoretic migration {{is due to the}} non-linear dependence of the electrophoretic mobility on the electric field caused by the asymmetry of the applied alternating current signal. In addition, pH changes near the deposition electrode drive the enzyme towards its point of zero charge (PZC), perhaps causing the precipitation of GOx on the substrate. The effect of amplitude, frequency, deposition time and GOx concentration on the deposition rate was studied.

40|$|International audienceFor many years, {{pavement}} engineers use mechanistic design {{methods that}} are based on algorithms to compute stresses, strains and displacements in a flexible pavement structure, or in a multi-layered structure in general. Most of these methods assume, to ease the modelling of the structure and the computation process, that the layers are fully bonded or completely unbounded to each other. Moreover, determining the effectiveness of the bonding between two layers is difficult since there is no standard test procedure to assess it. Hence, proper modelling of the interface bonding condition will represent an important finding in understanding the real behaviour of road structures, and will lead to reduce maintenance and rehabilitation costs. Asphalt emulsion is commonly used, as tack coat, to ensure the bond between two pavement layers. This study deals with an experimental characterization of interfaces shear fatigue behaviour through laboratory tests. A testing device for determining the shear fatigue behaviour is described in this paper. Shear fatigue tests, at a temperature of 5 Â°C and a frequency of 1 Hz, were performed on asphalt concrete mix layers interface with tack coat. Samples were subjected to a cyclic <b>symmetrical</b> <b>alternate</b> shearing load at the interfaces, aiming interfaces failures within the range of 104 to 105 cycles of loading. Within this range of number of cycles, the fatigue results indicate a linear evolution of the initial shear stress half-amplitude with the decimal logarithm of the number of cycles to failure. These results are used to derive a linear fatigue law, which will serve to model the real behaviour of the interface with tack coat studied in this research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this work, {{corrosion}} inhibition {{in steel}} water pipes, used in Shengli oilfieldis studied in different corrosive media by adsorption of dithiocarbamate (DTC) {{on the surface}} of the pipes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear polarization resistance (LPR) and potentiodynamic was applied to determine the effection of this dithiocarbamate. And the result shows that this dithiocarbamate has high corrosion inhibition up to 90 %. Experimental principle and method Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an transient electrochemical technique. The characteristics as follows, each half cycle duration is very short and can not cause serious concentration polarization and surface state change while the frequency is high enough because of using the small amplitude <b>symmetrical</b> <b>alternating</b> current(< 10 mV) for polarization of electrode. The process of cathode and anode alternate on the electrode without causing the accumulation of polarized development, which can avoid excessive impact on system. Secondly, it can be measured in wide frequency range to get impedance spectroscopy. Therefore, EIS can get more electrode kinetics information and electrode interface structure information than other conventional electrochemical methods. In this experiment, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test were performed using the classic three-electrode system. All electrochemical experiments were carried out by using an PARSTAT 2273 (AMETEK, USA). Working electrodes with a surface area of 1 cm 2 are carbon steel material, and non-working surface sealed with epoxy resin, and the surface of the electrode were polished by DTC metallographic sandpaper, and washed with water, and then degreased with alcohol and washed with deionized water to soak in the solution. The reference electrode is a saturated calomel electrode and the counter electrode is a platinum electrode. The EIS measurements were carried out over a frequency range from 0. 05 Hz to 100 kHz with sinusoidal potential perturbation 5 mV in amplitude.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Four {{different}} control {{strategies for}} {{the control of the}} inverter currents of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system are analysed and evaluated by means of simulation using Matlab/Simulink. Special attention is paid to the behaviour of the generator during asymmetrical grid voltage dips. Different control schemes are employed to reduce torque and DC-link voltage oscillations and the resulting additional loads on the system during such dips. The field-oriented control (FOC) scheme is the one usually deployed for the control of DFIGs in wind power plants and is used as the reference system within this study. The inverter currents are regulated by proportional-integral controllers (PI) in a rotating coordinate system in which they are represented by dq-components. These components are direct quantities. A positive-negative-sequence current control (PNC) strategy is used to control the positive-sequence currents and the negative-sequence currents separately in two contra-rotating coordinate systems using PI-controllers. In contrast to the first two control strategies, frequency-selective current controllers (FSC) serve to regulate the currents in a static coordinate system. In this case the currents are represented by two components which are <b>alternating</b> <b>quantities.</b> Combining the FSC and PNC strategies will produce frequency-selective positive-negative-sequence current controllers (FSC(PN)). These control the currents in a static coordinate system. The currents are represented by alternating components as in frequency-selective control but separate reference values for the negative-sequence currents are provided as in positive-negative-sequence control. Theoretical reasoning suggests and simulations prove that the three proposed alternative control strategies can improve the behaviour of DFIG-systems during slight asymmetries in the grid voltage. During severe dips the effect is limited by several constraints, namely by the inverter rating (limited inverter voltages and currents), by time delays introduced by the component calculation for PNC and FSC(PN) and by the nonlinear behaviour of the DFIG-system (saturation of mutual inductance). Nevertheless, the proposed novel control strategies could be applied beneficially to other systems, such as photovoltaic inverters or full-scale inverters for wind power plants...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a study on the mechanical behavior of three Algerian sands through cyclic triaxial tests with focus on the effect of the fines content. The particularity of this study is to keep the amount of the sand material matrix as a constant parameter for the entire range of fines content. This choice was considered due to the difficulty to determine experimentally the maximum and minimum void ratios of soil mixtures for fines content exceeding 15 %. The materials used in this investigation are originated from two different regions (Chlef and Boumerdes) in northern Algeria and are known for their higher seismicity levels. By varying the cyclic stress ratios and the proportion of fines contained naturally in the sand, a series of cyclic triaxial tests were carried out on reconstituted samples with a density index of 0. 5 and an initial confining pressure of 100 kPa, on a servo-controlled dynamic machine with a sinusoidal frequency signal of 0. 05 Hz and <b>alternated</b> <b>symmetrical</b> cycles. Comparing the clean and natural sands, the test results indicate that the presence of fines influences significantly the liquefaction resistance. Indeed, the fines content increases the liquefaction resistance for Zemmouri sand, decreases or stabilizes it for the Rass and Chlef sands, respectively. The effect of fines on the Chlef and Rass sands is in good agreement with the published literature, where the liquefaction resistance decreases to a threshold value and then increases with the increase of the fines content.

40|$|The term Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) {{refers to}} the {{technology}} that enables a bidirectional power exchange between the electric grid and the batteries of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV). V 2 G technology can be {{a key element of}} the intelligent network, which may use the batteries of the vehicle as a system of local storage. The vehicle battery may contribute to the stability of the grid and to meeting the energy demand, especially in peak hours. A PEV needs a bidirectional charger to implement V 2 G, and, consequently, the studies regarding their design, functionality and efficiency are of the utmost interest. This thesis describes the state of art of these chargers and discusses some aspects of a bi-directional converter and some case studies related to this topic. The main objective of this work is to develop the design and the control algorithms of a bidirectional battery charger with capability to charge the battery of a PEV and simultaneously to act as an active filter for the supply line. After the first introductory chapter, the second chapter reports the terminology used in this field of research. Several smart strategies for charging, approaches for the implementation of the battery chargers for PEVs and the recharging standards are briefly described. The analysis of different types of charger is detailed in chapter three. The conventional battery chargers (CBC) with front-end formed by a diode rectifier, battery chargers with power factor correction (PFC), bi-directional battery chargers (BBC), and integral battery chargers (IBC) are considered. In chapter four, definitions are given of the electrical power in non-sinusoidal conditions, together with some examples of the inadequacies of the classical power theory in describing non-linear phenomena that occur during the operation of a power system. The fifth chapter presents the basic concepts of the theory of instantaneous active and reactive power (also known as p-q theory) applied to the compensation of non-sinusoidal systems. Definition of real, imaginary and zero sequence power are introduced and it is shown how this theory makes it easier to understand the phenomena caused by non-sinusoidal voltages or currents. The theory is particularly suitable for the design of a battery charger when it is seen as a power conditioner. Chapter six is devoted to the basic concepts of shunt active filters. They can perform different types of functions, such as the compensation of current harmonics generated by nonlinear loads to prevent their propagation in the network. The compensation algorithm based on powers defined in reference ï¡ï¢ is very flexible and therefore the theory of instantaneous power has been considered {{as the basis for the}} development of the control system of active filters. Some examples of compensation described in the previous chapter were simulated and the results have been included. In chapter seven, sizing of the power devices that constitute the battery charger is considered in relation to the various auxiliary services that it can provide. The power electronic switches, the coupling inductors and the other passive components have been sized in voltage and current. In chapter eight it is considered a charger that supplies its load and simultaneously compensates for non-linear loads connected nearby. These additional features in terms of power conditioning were quantified in order to determine the capacity of a battery charger that is formed by given active and passive components to support the network acting as an active filter. In the ninth chapter the filter inductances of a battery charger are sized for a specific case study in which it is required the capability to recharge the battery and to inject active power in the network, both in the case of single-phase and three-phase connection. Evaluation of the ripple current is an important requirement for the design of inductors. Therefore a precise calculation was made of this magnitude both in the case of a battery charger connected to the single phase grid and operating according to the PWM technique, and, in the case of connection to the three-phase grid, operating according to the technique SVM. In chapter ten a case study is considered regarding the design of an LCL filter. Chapter eleven contains a theoretical study of resonant controllers. They solve the problem posed by the conventional PI controllers that, when used for the control of <b>alternate</b> <b>quantities</b> as it occurs for the currents of a DC/AC converter, are not able to cancel the steady state error due to the finite gain at the operating frequency. Instead, a resonant controller has a gain ideally infinite at the operating frequency and thus ensures a zero steady-state error. The effectiveness of the resonant regulators has been verified by means of simulations. Chapter twelve deals with the regulations regarding connectors, charging modes and ways of connecting the PEV chargers to the grid. They are intended to define a charging procedure common to all the PEVs and to all the charging infrastructures, whether public or private. ...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{approach}} and aims. Families change throughout their life course according to both internal changes and transformations {{that occur in}} relation to the broader context they are connected with. In particular, changes of any one family member, dyad, or triad may trigger dis-equilibration and re-organization of the whole family system (Cowan, 1991). Thus, how do such processes of change occur? Starting from this question I have developed a research project that put great effort in devising methodological procedures and theoretical advances intended to explore how families change in their life course. The literature examination has pointed out the lack of models and methods that can account for the processes of change in complex systems such as families. Recent reviews (Kerig & Lindhal, 2001; Kreppner, 2005) underline the relevance of considering the whole family as the unit of analysis in order to grasp developmental processes, and to carry out research based on observation as privileged method (OâBrian, 2005). The definition of the notion of developmental processes requires also further specifications. Among the disciplines that from different research fields focused on this issue (developmental and social psychology, and family therapy) I found illuminating some suggestions from the works of Breunlin (1988). In particular, the author shed light on the notion of microtransitions to stress that families develop through a continuous process of negotiation that take place in the everyday interactions. Family development is then a continuous process in which all family members participate; however, there are periods in which mircotransitions are clustered at a given time, {{and one of them is}} adolescence. Adolescence is a period of dramatic and intense changes for all family members, thus it is a privileged âwindowâ through which observe how parents and children re-organize and regulate their relations. Methods. This research project involved 32 Italian families with at least an adolescent child (age range: 13 - 16). They were all Caucasian and belonged to the upper or middle class. Families were recruited through high schools and youth associations. Three different studies characterize this research project, and each of them has specific goals. Study 1. The goal of this study was to build the methodological âfoundationsâ of the entire research project. Innovative methodological procedures, based on observation, have been devised for the data collection and analysis: a) specific setting (both laboratory of observation and familiesâ homes), b) peculiar instruments which allowed all family members to participate (videotaped family interviews) and c) analytical procedure based on frame analysis. The two constructs, which define microtransitions were then operationalized: oscillation and coordination. Study 2. In this study four specific patterns of family interaction, which emerged from the interlocking of coordination and oscillation, are presented: quiet pattern, drifting pattern, stormy pattern, and critical pattern. Study 3. In this study further methodological procedures were developed in order to outline the specific forms of sequential interactions (homeostatic, negotiation, stable and <b>symmetrical,</b> and <b>alternated),</b> which characterize the four family patterns. In particular, the videotaped material was analyzed focusing on the specific stancetaking process displayed by family members in the course of the interviews. Furthermore, it was possible to observe how individual positions (the adolescentâs one was focused) co-emerged as the result of a situated interactive process, which account for the negotiation of power in the families.

40|$|The Forest Service {{controls}} {{vast quantities}} of natural resources including timber, wildlife, watersheds, air sheds, and ecosystems. For many of these resources, recreation {{is one of the}} primary uses of the natural asset. Recreation visits taken to National Forests are not "purchased" in the same type of market as other goods (e. g., timber, grazing, or housing). The price of, and ultimately benefit received from, recreation to National Forests cannot be estimated via traditional market prices and <b>quantities.</b> <b>Alternate</b> methods must be employed to estimate the value of recreation access. We use on-site survey data from the Forest Service's National Visitor Use Monitoring database (2000 - 2003) and stated preference demand estimation methods to model annual recreation trip-taking behavior to National Forests. We then use these models to derive estimates of per-visit net economic benefits across regions and activities. In 2000, the FS began conducting systematic research into recreation visitation levels on National Forest lands under the National Visitor Use Monitoring Project (NVUM). From 2000 to 2003 NVUM has collected data from 120 National Forests providing information on the number of annual visits, primary activity, local area expenditures, satisfaction with facilities, and limited demographic information. These data were collected using an on-site stratified random sampling scheme resulting in over 90, 000 completed surveys. Using the NVUM data we estimate the net economic value (NEV) of recreation on National Forest lands. The dataset used to estimate these values contains 73, 655 observations. Using a truncated negative binomial estimator, weighted by a composite factor that adjusts for the stratified, on-site nature of the data, we have estimated a series of pooled, multi-site recreation demand models and calculated net economic values for recreational visits to the National Forests for each of fourteen activities and four RPA regions (Pacific, Rocky Mountain, Northern, and Southern) on a per visit per individual value and for a per activity day per individual basis. Our results indicate that for most models and specifications, adjusting for the choice based sampling frame by using a truncated, weighted, stratified, negative binomial estimator, as well as accounting for regional and activity differences, reduces the estimate of the average per day and per activity day values. Forest managers and others involved in managing, planning, and administering resources used for recreation often need an estimate of the economic value of the resource. For many of these resources non-market analysis must be used to generate this information. For forest recreation, many of the values currently available come from secondary sources or from small samples. The values estimated using NVUM represent an improvement over many of the currently available forest recreation values because of the unique nature of the large-scale, stratified random sample.
