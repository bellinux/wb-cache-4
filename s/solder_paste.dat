25|$|Ramp {{is defined}} as the rate of change in {{temperature}} over time, expressed in degrees per second. The most commonly used process limit is 4°C/s, though many component and <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> manufacturers specify the value as 2°C/s. Many components have a specification where the rise in temperature should not exceed a specified temperature per second, such as 2°C/s. Rapid evaporation of the flux contained in the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> can lead to defects, such as lead lift, tombstoning, and solder balls. Additionally, rapid heat can lead to steam generation within the component if the moisture content is high, resulting in the formation of microcracks.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to use solder compatible with both the PCB and the parts used. An example is ball grid array (BGA) using tin-lead solder balls for connections losing their balls on bare copper traces or using lead-free <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB {{fabrication}} data. PCBs {{are designed}} on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|E

5000|$|Viscosity - {{especially}} important for <b>solder</b> <b>pastes,</b> which have {{to be easy to}} apply but also thick enough to stay in place without spreading to undesired locations. <b>Solder</b> <b>pastes</b> may also function as a temporary adhesive for keeping electronic parts in place before and during soldering. Fluxes applied by e.g. foam require low viscosity.|$|R
40|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{have been}} used for {{cleaning}} circuit boards after the soldering process in electronics manufacturing. The R and D-project aimed at the elimination of CFC-cleaning processes in electronics manufacturing. Therefore the development of new fluxes with low solid content was necessary which can remain on the boards after soldering because of their low residues. Basic research was performed on water-soluble <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> and on <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> for protective atmosphere soldering. Several new fluxes and <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> arised from the project. They are available on the marked or marked introduction is prepared. By using these new developed products the CFC-cleaning processes after soldering are no longer necessary. A method for testing and selecting <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> for reflow <b>soldering</b> of SMD-circuits has been developed and is available for industrial application.

2500|$|In the soak {{segment of}} the profile, the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> {{approaches}} a phase change. The amount of energy introduced to both the component and the PCB approaches equilibrium. [...] In this stage, most of the flux evaporates out of the <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b> The duration of the soak varies for different pastes. The mass of the PCB is another factor that must be considered for the soak duration. An over-rapid heat transfer can cause solder splattering {{and the production of}} solder balls, bridging and other defects. If the heat transfer is too slow, the flux concentration may remain high and [...] result in cold solder joints, voids and incomplete reflow.|$|E
2500|$|In soldering, {{a thermal}} profile {{is a complex}} set of time-temperature values for a variety of process {{dimensions}} such as slope, soak, TAL, and peak. <b>Solder</b> <b>paste</b> contains a mix of metal, flux, and solvents that aid in the phase change of the paste from semi-solid, to liquid to vapor; and the metal from solid to liquid. For an effective soldering process, soldering must be carried out under carefully calibrated conditions in a reflow oven.|$|E
2500|$|Before recent {{requirements}} for lead-free products, electronic components on printed circuit (printed wiring) boards (PCBs) {{were connected to}} the etched-copper-foil circuit, and hence to other components, by soldered joints created either by hand with a soldering iron using flux-core eutectic or near-eutectic (60/40) wire solder, or by a wave soldering machine which applies a flux beforehand. [...] However, boards using the finest-pitch surface mount technology usually use <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> applied to each location to be soldered before the component {{is placed on the}} board.|$|E
50|$|Recently, new <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} that remain stable at 26.5°C for one year and at 40°C for one month.|$|R
5000|$|According to IPC {{standard}} J-STD-004 [...] "Requirements for <b>Soldering</b> Fluxes", <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> {{are classified}} into three types {{based on the}} flux types: ...|$|R
5000|$|In most countries, [...] "no-clean" [...] <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> are {{the most}} common; in the United States, {{water-soluble}} pastes (which have compulsory cleaning requirements) are common.|$|R
2500|$|In {{assembly}} {{the bare}} board is populated (or [...] "stuffed") with electronic components {{to form a}} functional printed circuit assembly (PCA), [...] sometimes called a [...] "printed circuit board assembly" [...] (PCBA). In through-hole technology, the component leads are inserted in holes surrounded by conductive pads; the holes keep the components in place. In surface-mount technology (SMT), the component {{is placed on the}} PCB so that the pins line up with the conductive pads or lands on the surfaces of the PCB; <b>solder</b> <b>paste,</b> which was previously applied to the pads, holds the components in place; if surface-mount components are applied to both sides of the board, the bottom-side components are glued to the board. In both through hole and surface mount, the components are then soldered.|$|E
2500|$|The Ramp to Spike (RTS) {{profile is}} almost a linear graph, {{starting}} {{at the entrance of}} the process and ending at the peak segment, with a greater Δt (change in temperature) in the cooling segment. While the Ramp-Soak-Spike (RSS) allows for about 4°C/s, the requirements of the RTS is about 12°C/s. These values [...] depend on the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> specifications. The RTS soak period is part of the ramp and is not as easily distinguishable as in RSS. The soak is controlled primarily by the conveyor speed. The peak of the RTS profile is the endpoint of the linear ramp to the peak segment of the profile. The same considerations about defects in an RSS profile also apply to an RTS profile.|$|E
50|$|Insufficient <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> {{may cause}} poor bonds and contact between {{components}} and the board. The common causes of insufficient <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> are poor gasketing, clogged stencil apertures, insufficient <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> bead size, paste/stencil being used beyond recommended life span, stencil not wiped clean, or low squeegee pressure.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a new {{alloying}} method for solders by using a metal organic modified flux in <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the impact of six metal organic compounds (Co, Fe, Al; stearate, oxalate, citrate) on the melting and solidification behaviour in comparison to the revealed microstructure.

For the SAC solder joints with nano-Ag particles it was also observed that specific Ag 3 Sn crystallites. We supposed that the Ag 3 Sn crystals, which created "internal net" and nano-sized grains with uniform distribution must influence the mechanical properties of the solder joints. The results of shear strength measurements of solder joints confirmed the significantly higher shear strength of bimodal solder joints in comparison to reference solder joints without nano-additives...|$|R

50|$|In using <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> for circuit assemblies, {{one needs}} to test and {{understand}} the various rheological properties of a <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ideally, a <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> should have, at minimum, a 4-hour stencil life. The stencil life {{is defined}} as a time period in which there will be no {{significant}} change in the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> material characteristics. A <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> with a longer stencil life will be more robust in the printing process. Actual stencil life for a paste should be determined from the manufacturers' specifications and on-site verification.|$|E
5000|$|The {{core of a}} well printed PWB lies in the fill {{and release}} of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> into the {{aperture}}. When the stencil is {{in contact with the}} PWB, <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> is applied over the top surface of the stencil using a squeegee. This causes the aperture to fill with <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b> The PWB is then lowered from the stencil. The amount of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> which is released from the stencil apertures and transferred to the PWB pads, determines whether or not the print is good. Ideally, all volumes of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> should be equal to the volume of the corresponding stencil aperture. In reality however, this is never the case. Hence, a print is considered to be good if a certain fraction of the paste is released. One way of quantifying print performance is to calculate the Transfer Efficiency. This is mathematically stated as: ...|$|E

5000|$|Additives - {{numerous}} other chemicals modifying the flux properties. Additives can be surfactants (especially nonionic), corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers and antioxidants, tackifiers, thickeners and other rheological modifiers (especially for <b>solder</b> <b>pastes),</b> plasticizers (especially for flux-cored solders), and dyes.|$|R
50|$|Tack:Tack is the {{property}} of a <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> to hold a component after the component had been placed by the placement machine. Hence, tack life is the critical property of solder pastes. It {{is defined as the}} length of time that <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> can remain exposed to the atmosphere without a significant change in tack properties. A <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> with long tack life is more likely to provide the user with a consistent and robust printing process.|$|E
50|$|Stencil {{printing}} is {{the process}} of depositing <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> on the printed wiring boards (PWBs) to establish electrical connections. It is immediately followed by the component placement stage. The equipment and materials used in this stage are stencil, <b>solder</b> <b>paste,</b> and a printer.|$|E
50|$|For a good {{soldered}} joint, {{the proper}} amount of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> must be used. Too much paste {{may result in}} a short-circuit, too little may result in poor electrical connection or physical strength. Although <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> typically contains around 90% metal in solids by weight, the volume of the soldered joint is only about half that of the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> applied. This is due to the presence of flux and other non-metallic agents in the paste, and the lower density of the metal particles when suspended in the paste as compared to the final, solid alloy.|$|E
