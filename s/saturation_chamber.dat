40|$|Carbon dioxide {{sequestration}} {{is considered}} to be an efficient method of curbing the release of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and to mitigating corresponding effects on climate change. In this regard, basaltic rocks are among the potential repositories due to their ability to trap carbon dioxide in form of carbonate minerals. A series of laboratory-scale saturation experiments was conducted on three types of basalts that were collected from different horizons of the Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP), India. The basalt cores were treated in a <b>saturation</b> <b>chamber</b> for different exposure periods under low-pressure and room-temperature conditions. A set of key mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of the pre- and post-treated samples were analyzed to identify saturation-related changes. The results show that exposure of the basalts to carbon dioxide has a strong effect on their strength. However, the extent of the effect is different for different types of basalts and is strongly controlled by the exposure time, the mineralogical composition, and rock texture. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show that saturation leads to dissolution of the mafic minerals, and precipitation of new carbonate minerals in the cracks and vesicles of the host rock. These changes in the mineralogical content and the development of micro-cracks in the samples are interpreted as being the primary factors that affect the loss of integrity in the rock...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{technique}} is described whereby avian egg contents {{removed from the}} shell after 72 hours of normal incubation may be successfully cultured for {{extended periods of time}} (81 % for 15. 5 days), many of the embryos reaching Hamilton-Hamburger Stage 40 - 41 (14 - 15 days).

Culture vessels are lowered into Kerr wide mouth quart mason jar <b>saturation</b> humidity <b>chambers</b> which have been attached to aquarium lines inside of a modified Forma model 329 C 0 2 incubator. Use of a 5 - 8 % C 0 2 atmosphere substantially improved embryonic survivability. POULTRY SCIENCE 53 : 409 - 412, 1974 SHELL-LESS culture of the avian embryo has interested many embryologists whose techniques are reviewed by Ramsey and Boone (1972). The present technique incor-porates commercial plastic wrap in which to suspend egg contents (Schlesinger, 1966) in a culture vessel placed in a <b>saturation</b> humidi-ty <b>chamber</b> (Vollmar, 1935) to prevent evapo-ration from the cultured egg contents. Criley (1971) found that maximum embryonic sur-vival could be obtained using eggs incubated for 72 hours prior to culture and that periodic gas exchange enhances survivability. Mo-scona and Carneckas (1959) concluded that a 5 - 8 % C 0 2 atmosphere applied to normal eggs fenestrated on the eighth day of incuba-tion prevents the onset of keratogenic meta-plasia in the chick chorion and it is "not unlikely that in normal development, C 0 2 promotes the respiratory differentiation of the chorion [...] .

The tests varying dosage of coagulant and polymer (anionic polymer and cationic polymer) were performed on a laboratory scale, using the equipment flotatest. In all the tests were fixed the values of rapid mix (500 s- 1), the rapid mix time (60 s), saturation pressure (5 bar) and the time of air saturation in the <b>saturation</b> <b>chamber</b> (15 mim), the other parameters were investigated and adopted during the research. The tests were divided in three steps: The objective of step 1 was to evaluate the response of the flotation system without the use of polymers and only coagulant (stage 1), with the use of anionic polymer (stage 2) and cationic polymer (stage 3). In step 2 were performed tests of crossflow microfiltration and analysis of the permeate flux with the effluent of the best configuration of flotation. In step 3, we assessed the removal of lignin and halogenic organic compounds of the best flotation results.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Occupational {{saturation}} divers have various skin disorders, {{of which}} skin infections {{are the most}} serious and frequent. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the microbe most often isolated from skin infections in divers. The {{purpose of the present}} work was (a) to report the occurrence of P aeruginosa in skin infections in operational saturation diving in the North Sea from 1987 to 1995; (b) to report the environmental occurrence of P aeruginosa in saturation diving systems, and finally (c) to identify possible relations between infection related to strains of P aeruginosa and environmental isolates of the microbe. RESULTS: During the period 1987 - 95, P aeruginosa was isolated from 257 skin infections in operational saturation divers. Most of the isolates related to infection by P aeruginosa show a unique growth inhibition pattern towards the normal skin flora, and the serotype pattern of P aeruginosa from skin infections is limited compared with similar infections in non-divers. In a mini-epidemiological study on board one diving vessel during one operational diving period, five significantly different DNA fragment profiles were found among the 12 isolates related to infection by P aeruginosa obtained from the saturation system. In two cases the infectious genotypes were detected in the fresh water for the <b>saturation</b> <b>chambers</b> weeks before the arrival of the infected diver. CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly used epidemiological marker for P aeruginosa world wide, also used in earlier studies, is serotyping, but with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) miniepidemiology it was shown to be insufficient for epidemiological purposes in saturation environments. PFGE analyses were shown to be superior both to antibacterial factor and to serotyping in epidemiological analyses of P aeruginosa infections in saturation diving...|$|R
40|$|Objective : Skin and ear infections, {{primarily}} {{caused by}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), are recurrent problems for saturation divers, whereas infections caused by P. aeruginosa are seldom observed in healthy people outside <b>saturation</b> <b>chambers.</b> Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients suffer from pulmonary infections by P. aeruginosa, {{and it has}} been demonstrated that CF patients have high levels of autoantibodies against Heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60) compared to controls, probably due to cross-reacting antibodies induced by P. aeruginosa. The present study investigated whether rats immunised with P. aeruginosa produced autoantibodies against their own HSP 60 and whether diving influenced the level of circulating anti-HSP 60 antibodies. Methods : A total of 24 rats were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups (&#x 2018;immunised&#x 2019;, &#x 2018;dived&#x 2019; and &#x 2018;immunised and dived&#x 2019;). The rats in group 1 and 3 were immunised with the bacteria P. aeruginosa, every other week. Groups 2 and 3 were exposed to simulated air dives to 400 kPa (4 ata) with 45 min bottom time, every week for 7 weeks. Immediately after surfacing, the rats were anaesthetised and blood was collected from the saphenous vein. The amount of anti-HSP 60 rat antibodies in the serum was analysed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results : The immunised rats (group 1) showed a significant increase in the level of autoantibodies against HSP 60, whereas no autoantibodies were detected in the dived rats (group 2). The rats both immunised and dived (group 3) show no significant increase in circulating autoantibodies against HSP 60. A possible explanation may be that HSP 60 is expressed during diving and that cross-reacting antibodies are bound...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this field study is to report and {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of a}} health surveillance program we developed to monitor the microbiological load for saturation divers, including preventive and therapeutic interventions. We extended the DMAC protocol for <b>Saturation</b> Diving <b>Chamber</b> Hygiene and added some components: ear inspections, swabs and environmental swabs every third day. The implementation was evaluated by analyzing the results of the activities. In a pre-saturation dive check we examined a total of 17 divers.

Amongst all four factors, volume of methanol in mobile phase appeared to have a possibly significant effect on retention factor of miconazole nitrate compared with the other two drugs nadifloxacin and mometasone furoate, and therefore it was important to be carefully controlled. In summary, a novel, simple, accurate, reproducible, and robust high-performance thin-layer chromatographic method was developed, which would be of use in quality control of these cream formulations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Hawthorn {{tincture}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} used herbal drugs at the domestic pharmaceutical market. According to the State register of drugs at the pharmaceutical market of Ukraine, there are 13 commercial offers of Hawthorn tincture from home-produced manufactures. The initial herbal raw materials for Hawthorn tincture are Hawthorn fruits, which are widespread at the territory of Ukraine. These are pharmacopoeial herbal raw material. Thus, 12 different species of Hawthorn fruits are included into monograph of Ukrainian State Pharmacopoeia (SPhU) and State Pharmacopoeia of USSR XI ed. On the territory of Ukraine there are near 30 different species of Hawthorn, and the quantity of species is much arises due to its forms and hybrids. The ‘natural variability’ of bioactive substances of Hawthorn fruits of the same species and possibility of usage of many different species during manufacturing process of herbal drugs lead to the pitfalls in standardization of herbal drugs in general, and Hawthorn tincture particularly, and should be taken in mind while development of its quality control methods. For development of specific and reproducible identification method, it is necessary to ensure the number of parameters: usage of method and equipment that give reproducible results; big selections of different samples; rigorously observation of method’s procedure of implementation. The modern, automated HPTLC method of analysis was chosen for identification purpose. If standardize procedure and suitable equipment are used, the reproducible results of the method have to be obtained. The aim of this paper was development of HPTLC method for identification of Hawthorn tincture, which could be appropriated for stability study and establishment of its expire date. Materials and Methods. In research 13 samples of Hawthorn tinctures from 8 manufactures from Ukraine and Russia were analyzed. These samples were manufactured in 2010, 2014, 2015 years. The research was conducted on the base of CAMAG laboratory, Muttenz, Switzerland. Plates used: HPTLC glass 20 x 10 cm, Si 60 F 254, Merck, Lot: 1. 05642. 0001. Material used: Automatic TLC Sampler 4, CAMAG; Twin Trough Chamber 20 x 10 cm, CAMAG; Chromatogram Immersion Device III, CAMAG; TLC Plate Heater III, CAMAG; Automatic Development Chamber ADC 2, CAMAG; Visualizer, CAMAG; TLC Scanner, CAMAG; Filter paper for <b>chamber</b> <b>saturation,</b> CAMAG; Centrifuge EBA 21, Hettich; Ultrasonic Bath SW 3 H, Sono Swiss; Analytical Balance MS 205 DU, Mettler-Toledo. Chemicals used were pharmacopoeial quality. Reference substances used: hyperoside, USP, batch: 33520 F; rutin, EDQM, batch: A 0299493; chlorogenic acid, EDQM, batch: A 0290470. For identification of Hawthorn tincture by HPTLC the flavonoids were chosen as a group of bioactive substances. The method was developed using format and style of description, which are used for TLC Identification method for Crataegi fructus in European Pharmacopoeia and SPhU. For new identification method of Hawthorn tincture preparation of test solution, reference solutions, system suitability solution (SST), intensity marker, its application, development and results were proposed. For specificity study HPTLC-fingerprints of 13 samples of Hawthorn tinctures, which were produced by manufactures, were compared with HPTLC-fingerprints of laboratory sample of Hawthorn tincture, prepared from properly authentificated herbal raw material of C. laevigata (C. oxyacantha) fructus (solvent – 70 % ethanol, ratio – 1 : 10) and HPTLC-fingerprints of C. laevigata (C. oxyacantha) fructus (solvent – methanol, ratio – 1 : 10). For reproducible results the research was conducted according to standardized procedure USP High-performance thin-layer chromatography procedure for identification of articles of botanical origin. Visual evaluation of chromatogram of test solutions was conducted with respect to zone position and colour of reference solutions, intensity was evaluated respect to intensity marker of reference solution. Results and Discussion. According to the proposed identification method by HPTLC, the fingerprints of 13 different samples of Hawthorn tincture are quite consistent respect to zone position, color and intensity. All analyzed samples of tinctures are met the requirements of proposed HPTLC-test. Comparison of HPTLC-fingerprints of 13 samples of Hawthorn tincture with the test solutions of laboratory samples of Hawthorn tincture and Crataegi fructus has shown quite similar fingerprints respect to zones position and color. This, prove the specificity of the method. Description of results for developed HPTLC method was given. The tolerance range in fingerprints was specified. Despite of the storage period of Hawthorn tincture is 3 years, the old samples of tincture, which were manufactured in 2010 year are quite similar to new one and would passed proposed HPTLC test. This shows the chemical stability of marker substances of tincture during its storage period. Other investigation in this area is necessary. Conclusion. The specific and reproducible HPTLC identification method of Hawthorn tincture was developed. This could be used as optional/alternative method for conventional TLC. Image on chromatogram of Hawthorn tinctures could be used as a reference image of HPTLC method for Hawthorn tincture and to be included in Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine or any other HPTLC Atlas/Reference book. Developed HPTLC identification method of Hawthorn tincture shown the stability of marker group of bioactive substances (flavonoids) during the expiration period of tincture...|$|R
