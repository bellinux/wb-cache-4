30|$|More recently, Lafleur et al. (2016) {{also showed}} that in paludified sites, {{disturbance}} type could significantly affect the relative abundance of understory vascular plants and bryophytes. For instance, they observed that the ground cover of the ericaceous species R. groenlandicum (an important competitor of black spruce) was significantly lower in <b>sites</b> <b>where</b> soils were severely burned or severely mechanically disturbed by clearcutting relative to <b>sites</b> <b>where</b> soils were only superficially burned (i.e. low severity fires). Likewise, the ground cover of Sphagnum spp. was significantly lower in <b>sites</b> <b>where</b> soils were severely burned or severely mechanically disturbed by clearcutting relative to <b>sites</b> <b>where</b> soils were protected by the application of careful logging around advanced growth.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, an {{alternative}} transferase mechanism has been evolved by amidophosphoribosyltransferases, which has two active sites. In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a glutamine substrate to release free ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses though an internal tunnel in the enzyme {{to the second}} active <b>site,</b> <b>where</b> it is transferred to a second substrate.|$|E

5|$|Its {{nesting site}} is more {{important}} than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the habitat of the black-throated blue warbler. The black-throated blue warbler is an open-nesting species, that nests very close to the ground so it has to choose a protected nesting <b>site</b> <b>where</b> the risk of predation is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Management of {{the site}} passed to EG in 1990, which did not reapply for the {{contract}} in 1994. Management {{of the site}} then passed to the Kaiser-Hill Company as of July 1, 1995.
