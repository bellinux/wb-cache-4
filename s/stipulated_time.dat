Despite {{disclaim}} of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, with the condition that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel at the <b>stipulated</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

The link opened on 27 September 1997. In 2000, a public meeting was held in which it was proposed to reduce the rates and instead prolong the collection time, but this was rejected. In 1999, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration reported that the Bjorøy Tunnel had the cheapest administration costs per passing, at , of all small toll companies.

25|$|When {{either of}} the two Houses of the Parliament of India is not in session, and if the {{government}} feels the need for an immediate procedure, the President can promulgate ordinances which have the same force and effect as an act passed by Parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid for no more than six weeks from the date the Parliament is convened unless approved by it earlier. Under , the President as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that immediate action is mandatory as advised by the union cabinet and he is confident that the government commands majority support in the Parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and Parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of Parliament when in force and {{it is the responsibility of}} the President to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for promulgation of the ordinance are no longer applicable. Bringing laws in the form of ordinances has become a routine matter by the government and President, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of ordinances after failing to get approval within the <b>stipulated</b> <b>time</b> of both houses of parliament is an unconstitutional act by the President. President should not incorporate any matter in an ordinance which is violating the constitution or needs amendment to the constitution. The President should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the Parliament or violating the constitution.|$|E

As soon as the marchers reached Tanjore, Rajaji avoided the usual route to Vedaranyam, and instead chose a [...] "circuitous" [...] route via Kumbakonam, Valangaiman, Semmangudi, Needamangalam and Thiruthuraipoondi as he hoped that the marchers would receive hospitality in these places. He had organised fifteen sub committees to ensure a smooth functioning of the march. The idea was to gather enough support among the people by drawing their attention.

Therefore the analysis procedure itself does not impose a lower limit to the time scale on which variability can be detected.
