In {{the course of}} this work, much emphasis was placed on how the lengths of <b>stiffened</b> joints could influence the dynamic response of the frames under self-excitation. Consequent upon, the <b>stiffened</b> length ratio, (i. e. the ratio of <b>stiffened</b> length to unstiffened length) of the structural members are varied and at each condition the associated frequency spectrum of the simulated frame was evaluated; and a comparative analysis was made on the fundamental period of the <b>stiffened</b> joints model with that of its equivalent shear building model. It was found that at about eleven percent (11 %) <b>stiffened</b> length ratio, a 3 -floor dual-bay r. c. frame with <b>stiffened</b> joints model exhibited dynamic response equal to that of its equivalent shear building model. Similarly, similar responses were attained at thirteen percent (13 %) and sixteen percent (16 %) <b>stiffened</b> length ratios respectively for a 5 -floor dual-bay frame and a 9 -floor dual-bay frame with <b>stiffened</b> joints models when compared with that of their equivalent shear building models. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

As it’s difficult to analysis buckling character of the <b>stiffened</b> plate with local imperfections by using elastic plate theory, this paper used finite element method (FEM) to model 30 different cases of local imperfections in <b>stiffened</b> plate, and analysed how the size, depth and direction of local imperfections affect the critical buckling coefficient of the <b>stiffened</b> plate. Results shown that, the size, depth and direction of local imperfections are have significant impact to the buckling behavior of <b>stiffened</b> plate, the largest decrease of critical buckling coefficient due to the local imperfection reaches 30 % in this paper, and the critical buckling coefficient of <b>stiffened</b> plate with smaller stiffness ratio is more susceptible to the local imperfections...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of failure of <b>stiffened</b> curved plates and shells is presented. Panel instability in <b>stiffened</b> curved plates and general instability of <b>stiffened</b> cylinders are discussed. The loadings considered for the plates are axial, shear, and {{the combination of the}} two. For the cylinders, bending, external pressure, torsion, transverse shear, and combinations of these loads are considered. When possible, test data and theory were correlated. General instability in <b>stiffened</b> cylinders was investigated. For bending and torsion loads, test data and theory were correlated. For external pressure several existing theories were compared. As a result of this investigation a unified theoretical approach to analysis of general instability in <b>stiffened</b> cylinders was developed. (author) ...|$|R

During her sea trials the following month, her sister Courageous sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough head sea and had the damaged areas stiffened shortly afterwards to prevent a recurrence.

5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} <b>stiffening</b> for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E

The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer <b>stiffening</b> veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts.

5|$|While {{historically}} {{thought of}} as simple leathery structures composed of skin, research has since shown that the wing membranes of pterosaurs were highly complex dynamic structures suited to an active style of flight. The outer wings (from the tip to the elbow) were strengthened by closely spaced fibers called actinofibrils. The actinofibrils themselves consisted of three distinct layers in the wing, forming a crisscross pattern when superimposed on one another. The function of the actinofibrils is unknown, as is the exact material from which they were made. Depending on their exact composition (keratin, muscle, elastic structures, etc.), {{they may have been}} <b>stiffening</b> or strengthening agents in the outer part of the wing. The wing membranes also contained a thin layer of muscle, fibrous tissue, and a unique, complex circulatory system of looping blood vessels.|$|E

Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly <b>stiffening</b> enemy resistance. On 25 October the first Chinese prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops.

5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{the identity of}} the filaments preserved in the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were <b>stiffening</b> structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over {{the identity of the}} structures.|$|E

Typical mode shapes are also presented for clamped square eccentrically <b>stiffened</b> plates. Finally, design charts with non-dimensional parameters are proposed to determine the fundamental frequency of commonly adopted clamped <b>stiffened</b> plates in construction.

Firstly, the buckling mode of the <b>stiffened</b> panel is obtained using the linear buckling eigenvalue method. Then, the collapsing strength of the <b>stiffened</b> panel is calculated using the ultimate strength method based on large deflection orthotropic plate theory. In addition, nonlinear finite element analysis is performed to predict the post-buckling {{behavior of}} the <b>stiffened</b> panel. By comparing the model prediction and the analytical results of ultimate strength, it is shown that good accuracy can be achieved, especially for the method referring to membrane stress in mid-thickness of equivalent orthotropic plate. It suggests that the proposed method can predict the ultimate strength of whole <b>stiffened</b> panel accurately and effectively...|$|R

5|$|Following a preparatory {{artillery}} barrage {{which began}} on 3 June, the battle commenced {{in the early}} hours of 7 June with the explosion of several mines which had been dug under the German lines. Over a million pounds of explosive were used, and the tremors were felt as far away as London. The New Zealanders were in the centre of the II ANZAC front, flanked by the British 25th Division and the 3rd Australian Division. This marked the first time the Australians and New Zealanders had fought alongside each other in a major engagement on the Western Front. The 2nd and Rifle Brigades quickly moved forward; the surviving German soldiers encountered initially were still dazed from the detonation of the mines and were quickly subdued and made prisoners of war. They continued to advance into <b>stiffening</b> resistance, but these opponents, soldiers of the 40th (Saxon) and 3rd (Bavarian) Divisions, were soon dealt with and the outskirts of Messines village were within sight. The Rifle Brigade's 3rd Battalion was attacking the village when it was slowed by two machine gun posts. Corporal Samuel Frickleton led his section on a successful foray to deal with them for which he was later awarded the VC.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a <b>stiffening</b> rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} free vibration analysis of <b>stiffened</b> circular cylindrical and conical shells. The study was carried out with a view to improving the accuracy and efficieny of various modelling techniques for the prediction of the <b>stiffened</b> shells natural frequencies and mode shapes. A review of the existing literature covering various aspects of the shell vibrations problem and modelling techniques has been given {{at the beginning of each}} chapter with a critical appraisal of the assumptions made and results obtained. Initially the continuum energy approach was used for the analysis. The developed method allows for discrete consideration of stiffeners having arbitrary location and properties. Energy of bending in two planes and rotary inertia have been included in the analysis. Various types of <b>stiffened</b> shells with shear diaphragm ends condition were analysed using this method for the prediction of their natural frequencies. The predicted results have been compared with published experimental results. The finite element technique was also used for the prediction of natural frequencies and mode shapes of <b>stiffened</b> shells. Axisymmetric shell of revolution element, Facet shell element, semi- 100 f element and various types of beam elements, which are available within the PAFEC 75 suite of programs, were used for these studies. An efficient modelling technique has been introduced for ring <b>stiffened</b> cylindrical and conical shells by the use of the shell of revolution element. For improved accuracy of the predicted frequencies and a more economical model, shell symmetry was utilized for the free vibration analysis of unstiffened and <b>stiffened</b> shells. Half, quarter and one eighth models were studied by developing the appropriate boundary conditions and are discussed here. The free vibration characteristics of orthogonally <b>stiffened</b> cylindrical shells and an orthogonally <b>stiffened</b> cylindrical panel have been studied. An eight noded <b>stiffened</b> super shell element was developed for this study. This element was used for modelling various other types of <b>stiffened</b> shells and the predicted natural frequencies have been compared with known published experimental and theoretical results. Experimental verification of theoretical predictions of natural frequencies and mode shapes of an orthogonally <b>stiffened</b> cylindrical panel was carried out and is reported here...|$|R
