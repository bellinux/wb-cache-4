40|$|Arc brazing has, in {{comparison}} to arc welding, the advantage of less heat input while joining galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> The evaporation of zinc is reduced in the areas adjacent to the joint and improved corrosion protection is achieved. In the automotive industry, lightweight design is a key technology {{against the background of}} the weight and environment protection. Structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> have higher stiffness compared to typical automobile <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> and therefore they can {{play an important role in}} lightweight structures. In the present paper, three arc brazing variants of galvanized structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> were validated in terms of the corrosion behavior. The standard gas metal arc brazing, the pulsed arc brazing, and the cold metal transfer (CMT®) in combination with a pulsed cycle were investigated. In experimental climate change tests, the influence of the brazing processes on the corrosion behavior of galvanized structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> was investigated. After that, the corrosion behavior of brazed structured and flat <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> was compared. Because of the selected lap joint, the valuation of damage between <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> was conducted. The pulsed CMT brazing has been derived from the results as the best brazing method for the joining process of galvanized structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} {{structured}} <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> were investigated using electrochemical measurement techniques. The main purpose is obtaining fundamental {{information about the}} corrosion resistance of structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> in comparison to smooth <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> as well determination {{of the influence of}} the structuring process on the corrosion properties. The corrosion resistance of structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> is affected by manufacturing process. One of the main influence factors is the change of the surface roughness. In this study the low carbon steel DC 04 and the stainless steel 304 (X 5 CrNi 18 - 10) were investigated. The electrochemical tests were carried out in 3 %-NaCl solution. Potentiodynamic linear polarization was used to determine such electrochemical characteristics as the free corrosion potential, the corrosion current, the pitting and protection potential. Furthermore, the corrosion rate was calculated for smooth and structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> of the low carbon steel DC 04. For the stainless steel 304 the pitting density was estimated. The surface roughness was measured for both materials. The electrochemical corrosion tests show a small difference in the corrosion behaviour of structured and smooth <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> Structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> have a lower corrosion resistance than smooth <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> The steel DC 04 shows the worst corrosion properties at the structure location “negative ” in comparison to the structure location “positive”. The corrosion resistance of the stainless steel 304 is better at the structure location “negative ” than at the structure location “positive”. Moreover, the results show the correlation between the surface roughness and the corrosion resistance for structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{corrosion}} properties of structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> were investigated. The aim of this work is to determinate {{the influence of the}} structuring process on the corrosion resistance of <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> For this purpose, these sheets were examined by accelerated tests in corrosion chamber. The investigation was carried out using salt spray test. The experiment was conducted for the low carbon steel DC 04 in 5 % NaCl environment. As a measure of corrosion damage, the weight loss was taken. The experiments point out that the steel weight loss is increasing appreciably with duration of the corrosive environment exposure. The results are presented for structured and smooth <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> as reference. A clear effect of the structuring process on the corrosion behaviour was observed. The results of the salt spray test show that structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> have a higher corrosion rate than smooth <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> Structured <b>sheets</b> at the structure location “positive” have a lower corrosion rate than at the structure location “negative”. The difference of corrosion properties between structured and smooth <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> is becoming increasingly apparent with advancing corrosion process. The regression models were developed for the weight loss rate as function of exposure time. Furthermore, the thickness reduction of structured and smooth <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> was calculated...|$|R

A formula was developed to calculate the theoretical limit pressure of rupture discs, and the theoretical predictions were compared with the measured data. It is found that the strain-hardening exponent of <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> has no influence on the limit pressure, whereas the limit pressure is {{in direct proportion to}} the strength coefficient of <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> It is important to realize that the strength coefficient of <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> can be acquired easily from the limit pressure.

40|$|Structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> {{with regular}} bumps offer higher {{stiffness}} compared to smooth <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> They {{can be produced}} by a hydroforming process. The application of the structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals,</b> however, is inhibited {{by the lack of}} knowledge for the subsequent processing steps. In this paper, the force and power requirements for air bending of structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> are calculated with a Finite Element Simulation (FE) and an analytical approach. In the first step, the hydroforming manufacturing process of the structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> is simulated in order to predict the exact geometry and the change in the material properties. Following, air bending simulations have been done taking into account the results of the hydroforming simulation. The FE-Simulations have been carried out with the software package LS-DYNA.

For the analytical calculation the model based on the bending theory is adapted by simplifying the cross section of the structured <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> The results of the FE-Simulation, the analytic calculation and the experiments are compared.

40|$|Abstract. Aluminum alloy <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> {{have been}} widely {{utilized}} for a light weight construction of automobile. However, Aluminum <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> still remain one of the difficult materials to predict the accurate final shapes after press forming processes, because of several mechanical weak features such as lower Young’s modulus, strong plastic anisotropy of yield stress, Lankford values, and so on. In order to solve the problems, the present author has developed a new constitutive model called “Modified Yoshida-Uemori model”. The present model can describe accurate non-proportional hardening behaviors of Aluminum alloy <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> In the present research, several experimental procedures were carried out to reveal the mechanical properties of Aluminum alloy <b>sheet</b> <b>metals.</b> From the comparison between experimental data and the corresponding calculated results by our constitutive model, the performance of our model was evaluated.

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E

5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
