40|$|Over 40 {{years ago}} I read a small grey book with metaphysics {{in the title}} which began with the words “Metaphysics is dead. Wittgenstein has killed it. ” I am one of many who agree but sadly {{the rest of the}} world has not gotten the message. Shoemaker’s work is {{nonsense}} on stilts but is unusual only in that it never deviates into sense from the first paragraph to the last. At least with Dennett, Carruthers, Churchland etc one gets a breath of fresh air when they discuss cognitive science (imagining they are still doing philosophy). As W showed so beautifully, the confusions that lead to metaphysics are universal and nearly inescapable aspects of our psychology. They occur not only in all thinking on behavior but throughout science as well. It’s easy to find examples in Hawking, Weinberg, Penrose, Green, who of course have no idea they have left science and entered metaphysics, that the statement they just made is not a matter of fact at all but a matter of conceptual (linguistic) confusion. “Law, event, space, time, force, matter, proof, connection, cause, follows, physical”, etc., all have clear uses in certain technical contexts, but these blend insensibly into quite different uses that have little in common but the spelling. Since it is pointless to waste time deconstructing <b>Shoemaker</b> <b>line</b> by line, showing the same errors over and over, I will describe some facts about how our psychology (language) works and with this outline and the references I give it is quite straightforward to give a meaningful description of the world in place of the metaphysical fantasies. If I were to debate Shoemaker we would never get beyond the title. Those wishing a comprehensive up to date account of Wittgenstein, Searle and their analysis of behavior from the modern two systems view may consult my article The Logical Structure of Philosophy, Psychology, Mind and Language as Revealed in Wittgenstein and Searle (2016). Those interested in all my writings in their most recent versions may download from this site my e-book ‘Philosophy, Human Nature and the Collapse of Civilization Michael Starks (2016) - Articles and Reviews 2006 - 2016 ’ by Michael Starks First Ed. 662 p (2016). All of my papers and books have now been published in revised versions both in ebooks and in printed books.

3000|$|We use average {{non-response}} {{rates in}} the background questionnaire that accompanies the PIAAC test {{as a measure of}} non-cognitive skills. PIAAC distinguishes between two different categories of survey non-response: “Don’t know” and “Refused to answer”. We compute the proportion of these two categories of answers in the questionnaire. Based on questions on individual finances, Riphahn and Serfling (2005) show that the observable characteristics of “don’t know” answerers differ substantially from those of individuals providing either valid responses or refusals. This indicates that the two types of non-response might be motivated by different reasons. In a similar <b>line,</b> <b>Shoemaker</b> et al. (2002) claim that the two types of non-response should be treated differently. In particular, they show that more sensitive questions get more refusals. In contrast, the two types of non-responses appear more often for questions that require more cognitive effort to be answered. However, this association is stronger for “don’t know” answers. 5 [...]...|$|R
