Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything {{to get excited about}} yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know.

2500|$|Catholic {{teaching}} describes {{truth as}} uprightness in human action and speech {{and is the}} virtue which consists of showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in words, and in guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy. [...] The person of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness balances {{what ought to be}} expressed and what ought to be kept secret: it entails both honesty and discretion. In justice, one man owes it to another to manifest the truth. The disciple of Christ consents to [...] "live in the truth," [...] that is, in the simplicity of a life in conformity with the Lord's example, abiding in his truth.

2500|$|At {{the grand}} jury hearing on the next day, Nye County Judge Mark R. Averill denied bail, as Mircovich's case {{involved}} capital murder. George B. Thatcher was Mircovich's court-appointed attorney, but had to leave town on June 1, 1912 for the Democratic State Convention in Fallon. Averill then appointed Patrick M. Bowler on behalf of Mircovich until Thatcher returned on June 5. The case was prosecuted by District Attorney Sanders. Witnesses testified that Mircovich had made threats against Gregovich's life, and was once thrown out of Gregovich's business premises. In his closing statement Sanders challenged the all-male jury to have the [...] "manhood" [...] to [...] "defend the law of my country and its liberty-loving people" [...] or else [...] "we {{might just as well}} dynamite this old courthouse.

2500|$|Maimonides {{noted that}} the {{scapegoat}} that was sent into the wilderness in [...] served as an atonement for all serious transgressions {{more than any other}} sin-offering of the congregation. Maimonides explained that as it thus seemed to carry off all sins, the scapegoat was not accepted as an ordinary sacrifice to be slaughtered, burned, or even brought near the Sanctuary. Rather, it was removed as far as possible from the community. Maimonides wrote that {{there is no doubt that}} sins cannot actually be carried like a burden, and taken off the shoulder of one being to be laid on that of another being. But the ceremonies of the scapegoat were symbolic, and serve to impress upon people the need to repent, as if to <b>say,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> freed ourselves of our previous deeds, have cast them behind us, and removed them as far as possible.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 August the Guerriere made contact with the Constitution. Dacres prepared to fight and the two ships closed and exchanged broadsides for some time. The range eventually decreased and after a brief close exchange the Guerrieres mizzenmast was shot away, allowing the Constitution to rake her several times, causing considerable damage, before the two ships became entangled. Shortly after this Guerriere lost both her main and foremasts, leaving her largely un-manoeuvrable. During the engagement Dacres had been wounded by a musket-ball in the back while on the starboard forecastle, but had refused to leave the deck. Constitution then drew away to repair some damage, while Dacres attempted to set a jury rig. The attempt failed, and on Constitutions returning, Dacres fired {{a shot in the}} opposite direction to the Constitution. Sensing that this was an attempt to signal surrender, Hull ordered a boat to take a lieutenant over to the British ship. When the lieutenant walked onto the Guerriere and asked if Guerriere was prepared to surrender, Captain Dacres responded [...] "Well, Sir, I don't know. Our mizzen mast is gone, our fore and main masts are gone-I think on the whole you might <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> struck our flag." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Field Marshal Göring's {{threat that}} in certain {{circumstances}} Germany might, presumably after denouncing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, proceed to build up to 100% of the British fleet is clearly bluff [...] In view of the great existing disparities {{in the size of}} the two navies this threat could only be executed if British construction were to remain stationary over a considerable period of years whilst German tonnage was built up to it. This would not occur. Although Germany is doubtless capable of realizing the 35% figure by 1942 if she so desires, or even appreciably earlier, it seems unlikely (considering her difficulties in connection with raw material, foreign exchange and the necessity of giving priority to her vast rearmament on land and in the air, and considering our own big programme) that she would appreciably exceed that figure during the next few years. This is not to <b>say</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not every interest in avoiding a denunciation of the Anglo-German Agreement of 1935, which would create a present state of uncertainty as to Germany's intentions and the ultimate threat of an attempt at parity with our Navy, which must be regarded as potentially dangerous given that Germany has been credited with a capacity for naval construction little inferior to our own. Indeed, so important is the Naval Agreement to His Majesty's Government that it is difficult to conceive that any general understanding between Great Britain and Germany, such as General Göring is believed to desire, would any longer be possible were the German Government to denounce the Naval Agreement. In fact, a reaffirmation of the latter in all probability have to figure as part of such a general understanding.|$|E
