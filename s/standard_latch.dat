40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the effects of}} {{transient}} faults (TFs) affecting the internal nodes of conventional latch structures and we propose a new latch design which allows to tolerate such faults. In particular, we show that <b>standard</b> <b>latches</b> using back-to-back inverters for their positive feedback are very susceptible to glitches on their internal nodes. We propose a new latch that is hardened with respect to transient faults on the internal nodes and that provides lower power-delay product than classical implementations and alternate hardened solutions, while featuring a comparable or lower area overhead. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effects of aging {{mechanisms}} on the soft error susceptibility of both <b>standard</b> and robust <b>latches.</b> Particularly, we consider Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) affecting both nMOS (positive BTI) and pMOS (negative BTI), which is considered the most critical aging mechanism threatening the reliability of ICs. Our analyses show that, as an IC ages, BTI increases significantly the susceptibility of both <b>standard</b> <b>latches</b> and low-cost robust latches, whose robustness {{is based on the}} increase in the critical charge of their most susceptible node(s). Instead, we will show that BTI minimally affects the soft error susceptibility of more costly robust latches that avoid the generation of soft errors by design. Consequently, our analysis highlights the fact that, in applications mandating the use of low-cost robust latches, designers will have to face the problem of their robustness degradation during IC lifetime. Therefore, for these applications, designers will have to develop proper low-cost solutions to guarantee the minimal required level of robustness during the whole IC lifetime...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{conditions}} making transient faults (TFs) affecting the nodes of conventional latch structures generate output soft errors (SEs). We investigate the susceptibility to TFs of all latch nodes {{and identify the}} most critical one(s). We show that, for <b>standard</b> <b>latches</b> using back-to-back inverters for their positive feedback, the internal nodes within their feedback path are the most critical. Such nodes will be hereafter referred to as internal feedback nodes. Based on this analysis, we first propose a low-cost hardened latch that, compared to alternative hardened solutions, is able to completely filter out TFs affecting its internal feedback nodes while presenting a lower susceptibility to TFs on the other internal nodes. This is achieved {{at the cost of}} a reduced robustness to TFs affecting the output node. To overcome this possible limitation (especially for systems for high-reliability applications), we propose another version of our latch that, at the cost of a small area and power consumption increase compared to our first solution, also improves the robustness of the output node, which can be higher than that of alternative hardened solutions. Additionally, both proposed latches present a comparable or higher robustness of the input node than alternative solutions and provide a lower or comparable power-delay product and area overhead than classical implementations and alternative hardened solutions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the performance of three rear-facing and two forward-facing child restraints (CRS) with three anchorage systems: <b>standard</b> seatbelt, <b>LATCH</b> (flexible) and ISOFIX (rigid). Frontal (64 km/h) and side impact (15 km/h) HyGe sled tests were conducted using a sedan buck. Overall, the preliminary findings suggested superior performance of rigid over seatbelt and flexible anchorages, particularly in side impacts. The results also suggest a need for design improvement for CRS with flexible anchorages to increase stability in side impacts. The findings {{have important implications for}} the proposed introduction of changes to Australian Standards for CRS to permit both flexible and rigid systems to coexist with conventional seatbelt anchorage systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{detection of}} the coincidence of two events {{is still a}} key ingredient for high-performance applications, such as Positron Emission Tomography and Quantum Optics. Such applications are demanding, since the precision of their calculations and thus their conclusions directly depend on {{the duration of the}} interval in which two events are considered coincidental. This paper proposes a new circuitry, called coincidence detector latch (CDL), which is derived from <b>standard</b> RS <b>latches.</b> The CDL has the following advantages: low complexity, fully synthesizable, and high scalability. Even in its simple implementation, it achieves a coincidence window width as short as 115 ps, which is more than 10 times better than that reported by recent research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{asynchronous}} pipeline {{style is}} introduced for highspeed applications, called MOUSETRAP. The pipeline uses <b>standard</b> transparent <b>latches</b> and static logic in its datapath, and small latch controllers consisting {{of only a}} single gate per pipeline stage. This simple structure is combined with an efficient and highly-concurrent event-driven protocol between adjacent stages. Post-layout SPICE simulations of a ten-stage pipeline with a 4 -bit wide datapath indicate throughputs of 2. 1 – 2. 4 GHz in a 0. 18 - m TSMC CMOS process. Similar results were obtained when the datapath width was extended to 16 bits. This performance is competitive even with that of wave pipelines [40], [19], without the accompanying problems of complex timing and much design effort. Additionally, the new pipeline gracefully and robustly adapts to variable speed environments. The pipeline stages are extended to fork and join structures, to handle more complex system architectures.

40|$|A new sense-amplifier-based {{flip-flop}} is presented. The {{output latch}} {{of the proposed}} circuit {{can be considered as}} an hybrid solution between the <b>standard</b> NAND-based set/reset <b>latch</b> and the NC- 2 MOS approach. The proposed flip-flop provides ratioless design, reduced short-circuit power dissipation, and glitch-free operation. The simulation results, obtained for a 0. 25 - m technology, show improvements in the clock-to-output delay and the power dissipation with respect to the recently proposed high-speed flip-flops. The new circuit has been successfully employed in a high-speed direct digital frequency synthesizer chip, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed flip-flop in high-speed standard cell-based applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Now a days, an Electronic {{circuits}} {{are designed}} by using EDA tools. This {{can be implemented}} in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). In FPGA, the pulsed latches are replaced by flip-flops for timing optimization. Pulsed latches are transparent latches driven by a clock with a non <b>standard</b> duty cycle. <b>Latches</b> are used for timing optimization and it can avoid the power and area utilization. This {{can be achieved by}} using Common Clock Method to reduce the power and timing constraints in different flip flops. In level triggering, certain flip-flops are replaced with latches for performance gain, but it will increasing the delay in short paths. Comparing with level triggering, the edge triggering perform faster in well defined moment in time.
