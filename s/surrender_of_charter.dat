6000|$|P. 527. Burnet, {{speaking}} <b>of</b> the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charters</b> in 1682:--It was said, {{that those}} {{who were in the}} government in corporations, and had their charters and seals trusted to their keeping, were not the proprietors nor masters of those rights. They could not extinguish those corporations, nor part with any of their privileges. Others said, that whatever might be objected to the reason and equity of the thing, yet, when the seal of a corporation was put to any deed, such a deed was good in law. The matter goes beyond my skill in law to determine it.--Swift. What does he think <b>of</b> the <b>surrenders</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charters</b> <b>of</b> abbeys? ...|$|R
5|$|Since Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter {{not long after}} his arrival in Boston. Unlike Rhode Island, whose officials readily acceded to the dominion, Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, but did little to assist him. They continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The more {{powerful}} engines greatly improved performance, but {{by this time}} the Fairchild Company was in financial difficulties. The company also found the number of surplus Noorduyn Norseman bush planes available at reasonable prices as well as the onset of the Beaver made it particularly difficult to market a new bush plane. With only 12 Huskies completed, Fairchild Industries went bankrupt, forcing the eventual demise of the parent company in 1948 and the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> its <b>charter</b> in 1950.|$|R
50|$|Less {{than half}} the arable land in the West was ever to open to farmers for homesteading under the Dominion Lands Act. The Canadian Pacific Railway owned most of the rest, as part <b>of</b> its <b>charter</b> for {{building}} the transcontinental railway. The Hudson's Bay Company, which had once owned the entire prairies, had kept 5 per cent of the land {{as part of the}} terms <b>of</b> its <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> its <b>charter.</b> These two companies sold land to land companies and to farmers on the open market. Additional areas were set aside for schools and government buildings.|$|R
50|$|For {{one brief}} period in Connecticut history, neither the {{authority}} of the Fundamental Orders nor the Charter nor a constitution governed the state. Edmund Andros was appointed governor of New York in 1675, and promptly demanded that Connecticut surrender its charter and fall under his authority. Connecticut refused to submit and Andros lay dormant until 1686, when he served a writ on the governor, again demanding the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charter.</b> By October 31, 1687, Andros decided to take matters into his own hands, arriving in Hartford with a band of soldiers.|$|R
50|$|The Concessions and Agreements {{provided}} for {{the election of a}} General Free Assembly; each tenth was a multi-member constituency electing a potential of ten members, although in practice this was limited to the settled and organized tenths. This was further codified by legislation approved in May 1682. This apportionment would remain, in modified form, after the establishment of counties and up until the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the proprietary <b>charter</b> in 1702.|$|R
50|$|The {{transaction}} was three-cornered. On November 19, 1869, {{the company}} surrendered its charter under its letters patent to the British Crown, which was authorized {{to accept the}} surrender by the Rupert's Land Act. By order-in-council dated June 23, 1870, the British government admitted the territory to Canada, under s. 146 of the Constitution Act, 1867, effective July 15, 1870, subject to the making of treaties with the sovereign indigenous nations to provide their consent to the Imperial Crown to exercise its sovereignty pursuant to the limitations and conditions of the Rupert's Land documents and the treaties. Lastly, the Government of Canada compensated the Hudson's Bay Company £300,000 ($1.5 million) for the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> its <b>charter</b> on the terms {{set out in the}} order-in-council.|$|R
50|$|On {{the death}} of his father in 1668 Wright {{inherited}} enough to enable him to marry early, and have a standing in his native county. The recordership of Leicester, to which he was elected in 1680, he lost on the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> the borough in 1684, but was reinstated in office on its restoration in 1688. In the same year he was elected deputy-recorder of Nottingham, and was junior counsel for the crown in the case of the seven bishops (29 June). On 11 April 1692 he was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law. On 16 December 1696 he made his reputation with his speech as counsel for the Crown in the proceedings against Sir John Fenwick in the House of Lords; and shortly before the commencement of Hilary term 1696-7 he was made king's serjeant and knighted.|$|R
50|$|Andros' {{commission}} included Connecticut, and {{he asked}} Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter not long after his arrival in Boston. Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros' authority, unlike Rhode Island, whose officials acceded to the dominion but in fact did little to assist him. Connecticut continued to run their government according to the charter, holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony-wide officials, while Treat and Andros negotiated over the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charter.</b> In October 1687, Andros finally decided to travel to Connecticut to personally see to the matter. He arrived in Hartford on October 31, accompanied by an honor guard, and met that evening with the colonial leadership. According to legend, the charter was {{laid out on the}} table for all to see during this meeting. The lights in the room unexpectedly went out and, when they were relit, the charter had disappeared. It was said to have been hidden in a nearby oak tree (referred to afterward as the Charter Oak) so that a search of nearby buildings could not locate the document.|$|R
50|$|With the end {{of wartime}} contracts, Fairchild ventured back into {{familiar}} territory with the design and manufactures of a modern bush plane, the F-11 Husky. Under the new Fairchild Industries Ltd. banner (the subsidiary company was created in spring 1945), the Husky emerged as an interesting concept {{but a number of}} factors combined to doom the project. The Fairchild Husky was a rugged, mainly metal (wing surfaces were fabric covered aft of the front spar) transport able to haul up to eight passengers and cargo. Innovative features included a high aspect ratio wing and slotted flaps for STOL performance and a unique upswept rear fuselage with a door/ramp allowing large loads to be fitted into the fuselage. Considered underpowered, Fairchild attempted to re-engine the Husky replacing the original 450 hp Pratt & Whitney Wasp Jr with more powerful engines including a 625 hp Alvis Leonides. The company also found the number of surplus Noorduyn Norseman bush planes available at reasonable prices as well as the onset of the de Havilland Beaver made it particularly difficult to market a new bush plane. With only 12 Huskies completed, Fairchild Industries went bankrupt, forcing the eventual demise of the parent company in 1948 and the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> its <b>charter</b> in 1950.|$|R
5000|$|The {{allegations}} in Sacheverell's {{report on the}} examination of Coleman prompted the country party to demand the exclusion of James, Duke of York, from the succession to the throne, the first suggestion of the famous Exclusion Bill being made by Sacheverell on 4 November 1678 in a debate--"the greatest that ever was in Parliament," [...] as it was pronounced by contemporaries—raised by Lord Russell with the object of removing the duke from the King's Council. He vigorously promoted the bill in the House of Commons and opposed granting supplies until it should pass. When Charles offered an alternative scheme (1679) for limiting the powers of a Catholic sovereign, Sacheverell made a great speech in which he pointed out the insufficiency of the king's terms for securing the object desired by the Whigs. In {{the conflict between the}} Petitioners and the Abhorrers he supported the former, and on 27 October 1680 brought forward a motion asserting the right of petitioning the king to summon parliament, and proposed the impeachment of Chief Justice North as the author of the proclamation against tumultuous petitioning. Sacheverell was one of the managers on behalf of the Commons at the trial of Lord Stafford in Westminster Hall; but took no further part in public affairs till after the elections of March 1681, when he was returned unopposed for Derbyshire. He was prosecuted for riot in connection with the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> Nottingham in 1682, and tried before George Jeffreys, who fined him 500 marks.|$|R
500|$|In 1682, Massachusetts sent Dudley and John Richards to London {{as agents}} to {{represent}} its {{case to the}} Lords of Trade. [...] Dudley brought with him a letter of introduction from Plymouth Governor Thomas Hinckley to colonial secretary William Blathwayt. [...] The favorable relationship that he established with Blathwayt contributed to his future success as a colonial administrator, but it also raised suspicions in the colony about his motives and ability to represent the colony's interests. [...] The authority of the agents was limited, and the Lords of Trade insisted to the colonial administration that their agents be authorized to negotiate modifications to the colonial charter. [...] The legislature was dominated by hardliners and refused this demand, which led directly to the issuance of a quo warranto writ demanding the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the colonial <b>charter.</b> [...] Dudley brought this news to Boston {{at the end of}} 1683, igniting a heated debate in the legislature—with the hardline party again prevailing. [...] The leadership of the hardliners included the influential Reverend Increase Mather, and they began to view moderates as enemies of the colony, including Dudley and Bradstreet. [...] Richards sided with the hardliners, and Dudley was removed from the council of assistants in the 1684 election.|$|R
2500|$|On {{or about}} Wednesday, March 5, 1919, Amoo Caldron No. 2 seceded from the “Supreme Caldron,” which was mostly being {{operated}} out of Chicago. The ladies in Rock Island promptly declared themselves the new Supreme Caldron and Amoo Caldron became No. 1. On November 18, 1920, Mrs. Vashti H. Bollman, acting Supreme Enchantress of the [...] "new" [...] Supreme Caldron notes that Mrs. Josephine Mace, Mysterious Enchantress of Amoo No. 2, withdrew Amoo from the parent organization in Chicago. It is {{reported that she}} was brought up on fraternal charges, to which she pled guilty, <b>surrendering</b> the <b>charter</b> <b>of</b> Amoo No. 2 in the process. However, she {{refused to give up}} the name “Amoo Caldron” and used it to “usurp the name Supreme Caldron from the parent organization.” [...] The Amoo group began opening new Caldrons, getting up to at least five with the institution of Hapac Caldron No. 5 in 1920.|$|R
50|$|A {{marriage}} of Rich and Wroth families reinforced their interconnected histories of Protestant sympathy and Puritan patronage. Wroth {{had been a}} subscriber to the Virginia Company in 1609. His brother-in-law, Margaret's brother, was the colonial pioneer Sir Nathaniel Rich, and like Robert Sidney a most active figure in the Virginia Company. Wroth fully associated himself with them in colonial enterprise. In 1620 he {{became a member of}} the Company of the Somers Isles (Bermuda Company), and on 3 November 1620 joined the Plymouth Council for New England, being named in the New England Charter. He {{became a member of the}} Virginia Company in 1621, and from 1621 to 1624 was particularly associated with Nathaniel Rich and Robert Sidney in the Warwick party of the Company, when they came into opposition to Sir Edwin Sandys. He voted in favour <b>of</b> the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the original <b>charter</b> in October 1623, and was one of those included in James I's new grant of 15 July 1624. He was also a member of the Eastland Company. Wroth was a J.P. for Somerset from 1624 to 1625. In domestic politics he joined the opposition to King Charles I: in 1628 he was elected Member of Parliament for Bridgwater and sat until 1629, when Charles began to rule without parliament for eleven years.|$|R

60|$|After {{the kings}} of Great Britain had assumed the right of {{appointing}} the colonial governors, the measures of the latter seldom met with the ready and generous approbation which had been paid to those of their predecessors, under the original charters. The people looked with most jealous scrutiny to the exercise of power which did not emanate from themselves, and they usually rewarded their rulers with slender gratitude for the compliances by which, in softening their instructions from beyond the sea, they had incurred the reprehension of those who gave them. The annals of Massachusetts Bay will inform us, that of six governors {{in the space of}} about forty years from the <b>surrender</b> <b>of</b> the old <b>charter,</b> under James II, two were imprisoned by a popular insurrection; a third, as Hutchinson inclines to believe, was driven from the province by the whizzing of a musket-ball; a fourth, in the opinion of the same historian, was hastened to his grave by continual bickerings with the House of Representatives; and the remaining two, as well as their successors, till the Revolution, were favored with few and brief intervals of peaceful sway. The inferior members of the court party, in times of high political excitement, led scarcely a more desirable life. These remarks may serve as a preface to the following adventures, which chanced upon a summer night, not far from a hundred years ago. The reader, in order to avoid a long and dry detail of colonial affairs, is requested to dispense with an account of the train of circumstances that had caused much temporary inflammation of the popular mind.|$|R
