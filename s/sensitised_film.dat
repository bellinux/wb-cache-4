40|$|Optical {{techniques}} {{are at the}} forefront of modern analytical methods due to their inherent high specificity. From {{the point of view of}} sensor technology, the transfer of chemical information into a measurable signal is of utmost importance. In this respect, planar optical waveguides show great promise for realising novel chemical and biological sensors which use evanescent fields to probe specifically <b>sensitised</b> <b>films</b> on the waveguide surface. Such sensors may detect changes in the refractive index of films using, for example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [1], light emission from the binding of proteins labelled with fluorophores [2], or the change in absorption spectrum of a film caused by a chemical reaction [3]. The use of photolithography in integrated optics technology allows mass production of complex multisensors on small and robust substrates. Electrochemical methods allow electrical resetting of reactions, or improved sensitivity through phase-sensitive detection...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a straightforward {{route to the}} fabrication of metal sulfide semiconductor (e. g. CdS, Sb 2 S 3, Bi 2 S 3) <b>sensitised</b> TiO 2 <b>films.</b> Our approach {{is based upon the}} controllable thermal decomposition of a single-source metal xanthate precursor on a mesoporous metal oxide film. The growth of the metal sulfide deposit is confirmed by Raman and UV-Vis steady-state absorption measurements. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements provide evidence for charge separation across the metal sulfide/TiO 2 interface. Moreover, a high yield of long-lived photogenerated charges is observed in a three-component TiO 2 /metal sulfide/spiro-OMeTAD film, thus demonstrating the potential of such multicomponent films for solar energy conversion devices...|$|R
40|$|Kinetic {{studies at}} Ti 01 /bithiophene/electrolyte {{interfaces}} were conducted, and their parameters to the solar cell functions were related. The solar cell {{based upon the}} bithiophene <b>sensitised</b> Ti 02 <b>films</b> resulted in the maximum IPCE of approximately 25 % at 400 nm. Comparison of emission studies between the bithiophene adsorbed Ti 01 and Ah 03 revealed the electron injection from the excited bithiophene into the Ti 02 with the efficiency of nearly I 00 %. The charge recombination between the bithiophene cation and the electron in the Ti 02 appeared to be fast with a half decay time of 70 J. lS {{in comparison to the}} ruthenium dye sensitized Ti 02 film (- 1 ms). The bithiophene regeneration rate with the half time of 20 J. lS was slightly faster, clarifying the inferior photocurrent performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of hydrogen gas {{is essential in}} ensuring the safety of nuclear plants. However, events at Fukushima Daiichi NPP highlighted the vulnerability of conventional detection systems to extreme events, where power may be lost. Herein, chemochromic hydrogen sensors have been fabricated using transition metal oxide thin <b>films,</b> <b>sensitised</b> with a palladium catalyst, to provide passive hydrogen detection systems that would be resilient to any plant power failures. To assess their viability for nuclear safety applications, these sensors have been gamma-irradiated to four total doses (0, 5, 20, 50 kGy) using a Co- 60 gamma radioisotope. Optical properties of both un-irradiated and irradiated samples were investigated to compare the effect of increased radiation dose on the sensors resultant colour change. The results suggest that gamma irradiation, at the levels examined (> 5 kGy), has {{a significant effect on}} the initial colour of the thin films and has a negative effect on the hydrogen sensing abilities...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} the binding coefficients of iodine to three dyes used in Dye Sensitised Solar Cells (DSSCs). Binding coefficients are quantified via {{the effect of}} iodine binding on the UV-vis spectrum of the dye. From iodine titration curves of dye <b>sensitised</b> TiO 2 <b>films</b> {{we find that the}} binding coefficients of iodine to the dyes C 101, N 719 and AR 24 (vide infra) are in the range of 2000 – 4000 M− 1. From FTIR results and molecular modelling we show the iodine binds to the thiocyanate group in all these dyes. For the AR 24 dye we present evidence that iodine also binds to the amine moiety on this dye. With these binding coefficients we show that the dye–iodine complex will be present at much higher concentrations than free iodine in the pore structure of a DSSC. As we have recently shown that iodine (rather than tri-iodide) is the dominant acceptor in electron recombination, the concentration dye–iodine complexes could influence recombination rates and thus Voc. By comparison of recombination data on full cells, we show that AR 24 accelerates recombination by a factor of 7 over N 719, presumably due to the iodine binding to the amine group. We leave open the question why iodine binding to the amine group seems to have a stronger effect on the recombination than does binding to the thiocyanate...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of interfacial electron transfer in dye-sensitised titanium dioxide (TiO_ 2) nanocrystalline films {{has been studied}} {{by means of the}} femtosecond to millisecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The project required the construction of a nanosecond transient absorption spectrometer, {{and the development of a}} femtosecond optical parametric amplifier to provide a tuneable excitation source and a pump-probe system for ultrafast transient absorption measurements. The construction and operation of the laser apparatuses are described in detail. Interfacial electron transfer kinetics have been studied for the sensitiser dye cis-ruthenium"I"I(2, 2 '-bipyridyl- 4, 4 '-dicarboxylate) _ 2 (NCS) _ 2 (Ru(dcbpy) _ 2 (NCS) _ 2) adsorbed onto the surface of nanocrystalline TiO_ 2 films. This system was chosen as it is attracting considerable attention for application in photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion. A method to assign the kinetics of electron transfer reactions at the dye / semiconductor interface has been established. It has been found that the electron injection is multi-exponential on femtosecond / picosecond timescales. In contrast, the charge recombination completes on microsecond-millisecond timescales. The parameters influencing the electron injection kinetics in Ru(dcbpy) _ 2 (NCS) _ 2 sensitised nanocrystalline TiO_ 2 films have been studied. Ru(dcbpy) _ 2 (NCS) _ 2 is compared with other sensitiser dyes in order to address the origin of the high efficiency achieved with this dye. Different experimental conditions were employed in order to compare the injection kinetics in Ru(dcbpy) _ 2 (NCS) _ 2 <b>sensitised</b> TiO_ 2 <b>films,</b> including excitation wavelengths, solvent environment, electrolyte composition and application of external voltages. The results of these experiments are discussed in terms of heterogeneous electron transfer theory. The relevance of these results to the function of dye sensitised semiconductor photoelectrochemical solar cells is also discussed, relating in particular to the energy conversion efficiency and the long-term stability of the cell.

40|$|The finite {{nature of}} fossil fuels and their effect on the global climate, raised the need to find an {{alternative}} source of energy. This source should be environment compatible, cheap and abundant. The light coming from the Sun is a promising alternative. To be fruitful, the solar energy needs to be transformed in storable and transportable energy forms like electricityor fuels. Amongst the most studied techniques dye sensitised devices offer the possibility to be designed for both the scopes: solar-to-electricity and solar-to-fuel conversions. In these applications a photocathode and a photoanode, constructed by mesoporous semisconductor <b>films</b> <b>sensitised</b> with dyes, are placed in series with one another. It follows that the photocurrent generated by one electrode should be sustained by the photocurrent produced by the other electrode. At the moment {{there is a substantial}} difference between the conversion efficiencies and the photocurrent produced by photoanodes and photocathodes. In this thesis the reasons for this discrepancy are investigated. The main responsible of the bad performance is identified in the semiconductor normally used in photocathodes, Nickel Oxide (NiO). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to elucidate the electrical properties of mesoporous NiO films. The study revealed that NiO films are able to carry a large enough current to establish that conductivity is not a limiting factor. The recombination reactions were then accused as the cause of the power losses. A time resolved spectroscopic study revealed that NiO can host two kinds of holes. One of these holes is responsible for a fast dye-NiO recombination (100 ns) and the other one for a slow recombination (10 ms). A cell featuring only the slow dye-NiO recombination would possibly reach high efficiency. The characterisation of the species associated with these two holes was performed by density-of-state assisted spectroelectrochemistry. The holes were found to be trapped by Ni 2 + and Ni 3 + sites located on the NiO surface forming respectively Ni 3 + and Ni 4 + states. A study by fs and ns transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that Ni 3 + sites can trap a hole in subpicosecond time scale and this hole relaxes into a Ni 2 + trap in ns timescale. The control of the Ni 2 +/Ni 3 +ratio on the NiO surface was found  to be crucial for a high cell photovoltage. In the thesis these results are discussed and used to propose an explanation and some solutions to the poor performance of NiO-based dye sensitised cells...|$|R
40|$|Nanocrystalline {{inorganic}} semiconductors {{have emerged}} as attractive alternatives to molecular dyes as photosensitisers for mesoporous metal oxide-based semiconductor-sensitised solar cells (SSSCs). In this configuration, Sb 2 S 3 has shown particular promise, yielding impressive power conversion efficiencies. At the operational heart of these devices, there {{are a series of}} interfacial electron transfer reactions that act to separate photogenerated charges. The delicate balance between charge separation and recombination plays an important part in defining device efficiency, but the mechanism by which charge separation occurs in Sb 2 S 3 -based systems has been relatively poorly understood. In {{the first part of this}} work, transient absorption spectroscopy is used to probe interfacial electron and hole transfer in mesoporous TiO 2 /Sb 2 S 3 -based photovoltaic assemblies. The reported observations point to the importance of the hole transfer reaction not simply as a means of regenerating the sensitiser, but rather as an integral part of the charge separation process. Inspired by these results, a novel device architecture and processing route is developed in which the structural, optical and electrical properties of the <b>sensitised</b> TiO 2 <b>film</b> are encompassed in a single component; namely a mesoporous Sb 2 S 3 photoanode. The resulting high surface area is shown to allow for efficient charge transfer to a polymeric hole acceptor, whilst electron transport through the Sb 2 S 3 layer is demonstrated by the fabrication of functioning photovoltaic devices. In order to consider the role of mesostructure in Sb 2 S 3 -based solar cells, devices based on a flat Sb 2 S 3 /hole transport material (HTM) interface are developed and compared to SSSC analogues. It is found that although these two classes of device are structurally very different, overall performance is remarkably similar. This highlights the impressive performance of the thin-film assembly, but also draws into question the importance of meso-scale morphological control. Through a combination of transient absorption spectroscopy and transient photovoltage measurements, it is determined that structural limitations to interfacial charge separation can be overcome in these systems by the action of an electric field. Understanding the role of mesostructure is a particularly pertinent challenge in the context of organic lead halide perovskite absorbers, with which very high efficiencies have been achieved in a range of structured and non-structured device architectures. Here, it is shown that the presence of a mesostructured electron acceptor to rapidly quench the perovskite excited state enhances the stability of interfacial charge separation and significantly increases innate tolerance to environmental processing conditions. This work highlights a significant advantage of retaining mesoscale morphological control in the preparation of efficient, low cost and stable hybrid photovoltaics. Open Acces...|$|R
