5|$|Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen {{created his}} own version of the TV <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> collie named Bessy in 1954. Apart from the fact that his comic strip starred the same dog breed with a similar name it {{had little to do with}} the series overall, since the comic was a western comic.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 2010, Doro celebrated her 2500th live <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special {{concert in}} Düsseldorf with guests Krypteria, Luke Gasser, Marc Storace, Schmier (from the band Destruction), Sabina and Andy Classen. Always in 2010, Doro, Schmier, Mille Petrozza (Kreator) and Alf Ator (Knorkator) lent their voices to the German version of Metalocalypse, the US {{animated}} show about Dethklok, the world's most popular death metal band.|$|E

5|$|World of Wonder's next reality {{television}} <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> transgender {{theme was}} Sex Change Hospital in 2007, followed by Transamerican Love Story in 2008.

5|$|Donna Whitbread is a {{stage and}} festival performer. In 2014, {{she joined the}} cast of cabaret act Ladyboys of London—a company of three trans women plus four male dancers, with choreography by Kamilah Beckles. They debuted at the Hippodrome Casino in London's West End on the 29th of December, and Donna opened the <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fire {{breathing}} act. One year later she announced {{that she had a}} role in John Cameron Mitchell's film How to Talk to Girls at Parties (2017). In 2017 BBC News videotaped her for Gay Britannia, television programming that marked the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act 1967. She answered questions written by cisgender people about trans women.|$|E
5|$|Hard Justice was {{announced}} in early March 2005 as taking place on May 15 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. A section covering the event was created on TNA's official website prior to the show. TNA released a poster promoting the event featuring Jeff Jarrett at some point beforehand. TNA planned a thirty-minute pre-show prior to the event, featuring Shark Boy versus David Young for {{a spot in the}} Twenty-Man Gauntlet for the Gold to take place during the telecast. TNA opened the <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ten-bell salute to TNA wrestler Chris Candido, who died on April 28, 2005 due to a blood clot from surgery to fix an injury sustained at TNA's previous PPV event Lockdown on April 24, 2005.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{then held}} an impromptu Ten-Man Gauntlet match to {{determine}} Kevin Nash's replacement {{in the main}} event. This was the ninth match of the <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> duration of 14 minutes and 12 seconds. The participants for the match were Abyss, A.J. Styles, Jeff Hardy, Kip James, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Rhino, Ron Killings, Sabu, and Samoa Joe. The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows: two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals. The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope {{and down to the}} floor. The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest. The last two wrestlers were Abyss and Rhino. Rhino won the match after lifting Abyss over the top rope and down to the floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Samson, the diminutive co-manager of the carnival, sets up each {{season with a}} monologue, giving glimpses of the show's complex story and good-versus-evil mythology. By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match {{of the night}} was between the World Heavyweight Champion Jack Swagger and his challenger, Big Show. Big Show {{dominated}} the match, with Swagger getting very little offense. As a result, Swagger got frustrated and hit Big Show with the World Heavyweight Championship title belt, and was disqualified. After the match, Swagger attacked Big <b>Show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steel chair, but Big Show was able to stop him with a chokeslam. Big Show then performed his knockout punch on Swagger, before leaving the area.|$|E

5|$|The first {{teaser trailer}} was shown at E3 2005, {{depicting}} Dante traveling through a snow-covered environment. A more substantial trailer was released at that year's Tokyo Game <b>Show,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more rugged and older Dante in a city-like setting. Both teasers show very little {{detail of the}} game itself. At the 2006 Tokyo Game Show, a more complete trailer debuted, along with a playable demo, featuring the character Nero.|$|E
5|$|Thirty {{episodes of}} Strangers with Candy were made, which aired on Comedy Central in 1999 and 2000. Though its ratings were not {{remarkable}} during its initial run, {{it has been}} characterized as a cult <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small but dedicated audience. Colbert reprised his role for a film adaptation, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006. The film received mixed reviews. Colbert also co-wrote the screenplay with Sedaris and Dinello.|$|E
5|$|Tired of his high-priced {{imported}} livestock {{losing in}} local shows, Glure concocts a dog <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special gold cup event that {{is limited to}} collies that are both American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheep dog trial. Initially, {{it seems like the}} only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E

5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E
5|$|In early 2007, {{the band}} {{announced}} a new World Tour, their first {{for nearly a decade}} to include dates outside North America or Japan. The band performed at London's Hard Rock Cafe in February 2007 to promote their European tour which included a night in Hyde Park as part of the Hyde Park Calling festival sponsored by Hard Rock Cafe. In the spring, the band toured Latin America to sold-out stadium crowds. In the summer, the band toured Europe, performing at several major rock festivals and visiting some countries they had never played before. Additionally, the band played in Middle East countries such as the United Arab Emirates and India for the first time. The band also played a few select dates in California and Canada in late July. The July 21 concert in Prince Edward Island, was the largest in that province's history. In September, the band performed eight dates in major markets in Northeastern North America. These shows were opened by Joan Jett. The band also played a private gig in Hawaii. A public show in Maui was canceled for logistical reasons, which spurred a class action lawsuit against the band. In April 2009, Aerosmith agreed to compensate all ticket buyers of the canceled <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> free ticket to a rescheduled Maui show to be held on October 20, 2009, along with reimbursements of all out-of-pocket expenses related to the show.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, King Stewart {{learns that}} Redbush {{is gone and}} {{he makes his way}} to Quahog to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson. King Stewart's army arrives in Quahog where they terrorize the colony (similar to a scene from Blazing Saddles). King Stewart orders Cockney First Lieutenant (Chris) to search every house for them. Upon being {{discovered}} by the First Lieutenant, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart. Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer, while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush. After exchanging threats without getting anywhere, Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a talent show, with the winner winning Lady Redbush's hand in marriage, and ownership of the town of Quahog. For his act, King Stewart steals his jester's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda. However, Griffin, Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mort, and Seamus effectively steal the <b>show</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> techno-rock number from Revenge of the Nerds. This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show. After King Stewart and his army leaves, Griffin and Redbush remain in Quahog to live happily ever after.|$|E
