He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in physics in 1924, {{the first year}} in which Caltech awarded this degree, for his thesis on [...] "the absorption coefficient for <b>slow</b> <b>electrons</b> in gases". He showed that molecules with similar arrangements of their external electrons have similar cross sections for collisions with <b>slow</b> <b>electrons.</b> These results could not be readily explained with classical physics, and their importance would not be realised until 1966.|$|R

50|$|Many {{metal oxides}} {{have been found}} to have water {{oxidation}} catalytic activity, including ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2), iridium(IV) oxide (IrO2), cobalt oxides (including nickel-doped Co3O4), manganese oxide (including layered MnO2 (birnessite), Mn2O3), and a mix of Mn2O3 with CaMn2O4. Oxides are easier to obtain than molecular catalysts, especially those from relatively abundant transition metals (cobalt and manganese), but suffer from low turnover frequency and <b>slow</b> <b>electron</b> transfer properties, and their mechanism of action is hard to decipher and, therefore, to adjust.|$|E
5000|$|The RRDE setup {{allows for}} many {{additional}} experiments {{well beyond the}} capacity of a RDE. For example, while one electrode conducts linear sweep voltammetry the other can be kept at a constant potential or also swept in a controlled manner. Step experiments with each electrode acting independently can be conducted. These {{as well as many}} other extremely elegant experiments are possible, including those tailored to the needs of a given system. Such experiments are useful in studying multi-electrons processes, the kinetics of a <b>slow</b> <b>electron</b> transfer, adsorption/desorption steps, and electrochemical reaction mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|The main {{topic of}} Jiří Horáček's {{scientific}} {{work is the}} application of quantum scattering theory to nuclear, atomic, and molecular physics. His work mainly focused {{on the development of}} efficient methods facilitating numerical solutions of integral equations appearing in the scattering theory, particularly the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. His application of the method of continued fractions developed together with Tatuya Sasakawa during Jiří's fellowship at Tohoku University is still used in nuclear, atomic, and molecular physics. In 1991 he modified the method together with Lorenz S. Cederbaum and Hans-Dieter Meyer from Heidelberg University and they developed the Schwinger-Lanczos method,which Jiří applied to calculations of electron-molecule collisions and ion-atom collisions together with his students and with Professor Wolfgang Domcke from Technische Universität München. They calculated the scattering cross-sections for the processes of vibrational excitation, dissociative attachment, and associative detachment in <b>slow</b> <b>electron</b> collisions with various diatomic molecules. Additionally, Jiří Horáček developed methods of calculating scattering phase shifts, resonance parameters, low-energy expansions in the scattering theory, and solutions of the inverse scattering problem.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} results of {{computational}} {{studies of the}} interaction of <b>slow</b> <b>electrons</b> with the purine and pyrimidine bases of DNA, {{as well as with}} their associated nucleosides and nucleotides. The calculations focus on characterisation of the π* resonances associated with the bases and also provide general information on the scattering of <b>slow</b> <b>electrons</b> by these targets. High-level studies of the π* resonances in pyrazine, a close analogue of the pyrimidine bases, indicate that the higher-energy π* resonances in these bases may in fact contain large admixtures of core-excited character built on low-lying triplet states. Decay into such triplet states may provide a mechanism for damage to DNA...|$|R
50|$|The {{ionization}} in the cathode dark space {{result in}} a high <b>electron</b> density, but <b>slower</b> <b>electrons,</b> {{making it easier for}} the electrons to recombine with positive ions, leading to intense light, through a process called bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the maximum of the electron mobility in liquids with a high atomic polarizability at the density Nm is explained by the suggestion of weakness of the s-wave scattering at this density. The model of the electron scattering by short-range potentials limited within the Wigner-Seitz cells is used. This model describes the change of the scattering length and predicts a zero value of the scattering length at the density Nm. The s- and p-wave phase shifts are calculated for this density. It is found that the {{cross section of the}} Wigner-Seitz cell is proportional to the electron energy squared and is negligible for <b>slow</b> <b>electrons.</b> Fluctuations of the liquid density result in fluctuations of the Wigner-Seitz cell radius. The s- and p-wave phase shifts and the mean cross section for the electron scattering by fluctuations are calculated. The phase shifts for an isolated atom are used as initial parameters. The mean cross section has a small but finite value for <b>slow</b> <b>electrons</b> and it decreases with the growth of the electron energy. It is shown that <b>slow</b> <b>electrons</b> are scattered by the fluctuations of the liquid density, and fast electrons are scattered by the Wigner-Seitz cells...|$|R
40|$|The radical cations of the permethylated dithia[6]radialene 1 and the tetraselena[8]radialene 2 {{have been}} {{investigated}} by ESR− and ENDOR−spectroscopy. It is shown that in the radical cation of 1 the unpaired electron is delocalized only in {{one half of the}} molecule. The magnitude of the 33 S coupling constant suggests a restricted localization within the 2, 3 −dithiatetramethyl−butadiene unit. We ascribe the <b>slow</b> <b>electron</b> transfer from one part of the molecule to the other to steric effects. The analysis of the ESR spectrum of 2 + shows that only two of the four selenium atoms are involved. The delocalization of the unpaired electron is restricted to only one of the divinyl diselenide moieties with a <b>slow</b> <b>electron</b> transfer rate to the other on...|$|E

40|$|Processes {{induced by}} the {{attachment}} of <b>slow</b> <b>electrons</b> to formic acid and its hydrogen-bonded dimer were studied. The elastic cross section and the cross section for the excitation of low quanta of discrete vibrations {{were found to be}} of a similar magnitude for both targets. A dramatic difference was found in the excitation of a vibrational quasicontinuum in the 1 – 2 eV range with the ejection of very <b>slow</b> <b>electrons</b> (E< 0. 1 eV), which was about 20 × more intense in the dimer. The association of two formic acid molecules to form a dimer thus dramatically increases the power to quasithermalize electrons arriving with energies in the 1 – 2 eV energy range.

40|$|The {{effective}} electrode {{area and}} charge density of iridium metal and anodically activated iridium has been measured by optical and electrochemical techniques. The degree of electrode activation could be assessed {{by changes in}} electrode colour. The reduction charge, activation charge, number of activation pulses and charge density were all strongly correlated. Activated iridium showed <b>slow</b> <b>electron</b> transfer kinetics for reduction of a dissolved redox species. At fast voltammetric scan rates the linear diffusion electroactive area was unaffected by iridium activation. At slow voltammetric scan rates, the steady state diffusion electroactive area was reduced by iridium activation. The steady state current was consistent with a ring electrode geometry, with lateral resistance reducing the electrode area. <b>Slow</b> <b>electron</b> transfer on activated iridium would require a larger overpotential to reduce or oxidise dissolved species in tissue, limiting the electrodes charge capacity but also reducing the likelihood of generating toxic species in vivo...|$|E
