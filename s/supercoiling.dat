5|$|DNA {{exists in}} many {{possible}} conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts {{depends on the}} hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of <b>supercoiling,</b> chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, {{and the presence of}} polyamines in solution.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases {{introduce}} both single- and double-strand {{breaks in}} the course of changing the DNA's state of <b>supercoiling,</b> which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes that created them.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the nucleus}} {{is the site}} of transcription, it also {{contains}} a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of <b>supercoiling</b> in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.|$|E
5000|$|Using gel {{mobility}} and analytical ultracentrifugation, {{it was shown}} that Netropsin binding to DNA increases the twist per base by similar to 9˚ per molecule bound. [...] Thus, it removes <b>supercoils</b> when interacting with positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA and introduces (additional) negative <b>supercoils</b> when binding to relaxed or negatively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA. Netropsin's effect on <b>supercoiled</b> DNA was observed in detail on single molecules using a magnetic tweezers.|$|R
40|$|Positive <b>supercoils</b> are {{introduced}} in cellular DNA {{in front of}} and negative <b>supercoils</b> behind tracking polymerases. Since DNA purified from cells is normally under-wound, most studies addressing the relaxation activity of topoisomerase I have utilized negatively <b>supercoiled</b> plasmids. The present report compares the relaxation activity of human topoisomerase I variants on plasmids containing equal numbers of superhelical twists with opposite handedness. We demonstrate that the wild-type enzyme and mutants lacking amino acids 1 – 206 or 191 – 206, or having tryptophane- 205 replaced with a glycine relax positive <b>supercoils</b> faster than negative <b>supercoils</b> under both processive and distributive conditions. In contrast to wild-type topoisomerase I, which exhibited camptothecin sensitivity during relaxation of both negative and positive <b>supercoils,</b> the investigated N-terminally mutated variants were sensitive to camptothecin only during removal of positive <b>supercoils.</b> These data suggest different mechanisms of action during removal of <b>supercoils</b> of opposite handedness and are consistent with a recently published simulation study [Sari and Andricioaei (2005) Nucleic Acids Res., 33, 6621 – 6634] suggesting flexibility in distinct parts of the enzyme during clockwise or counterclockwise strand rotation...|$|R
5000|$|The unique {{ability of}} gyrase to {{introduce}} negative <b>supercoils</b> into DNA {{at the expense}} of ATP hydrolysis [...] is what allows bacterial DNA to have free negative <b>supercoils.</b> The ability of gyrase to relax positive <b>supercoils</b> comes into play during DNA replication and prokaryotic transcription. The right-handed nature of the DNA double helix causes positive <b>supercoils</b> to accumulate ahead of a translocating enzyme, in the case of DNA replication, a DNA polymerase. The ability of gyrase (and topoisomerase IV) to relax positive <b>supercoils</b> allows superhelical tension ahead of the polymerase to be released so that replication can continue.|$|R
5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} {{nuclease}} and ligase activity. These proteins change {{the amount of}} <b>supercoiling</b> in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E
25|$|Molecules {{other than}} {{proteins}} can be separated by 2D electrophoresis. In <b>supercoiling</b> assays, coiled DNA is separated {{in the first}} dimension and denatured by a DNA intercalator (such as ethidium bromide or the less carcinogenic chloroquine) in the second. This {{is comparable to the}} combination of native PAGE /SDS-PAGE in protein separation.|$|E
25|$|While no {{definitive}} biological significance of Z-DNA has been found, {{it is commonly}} believed to provide torsional strain relief (<b>supercoiling)</b> while DNA transcription occurs. The potential to form a Z-DNA structure also correlates with regions of active transcription. A comparison of regions with a high sequence-dependent, predicted propensity to form Z-DNA in human chromosome 22 with a selected set of known gene transcription sites suggests there is a correlation.|$|E
40|$|A transcribing RNA {{polymerase}} {{is thought}} to generate positive <b>supercoils</b> {{in front of the}} advancing transcription complex and negative <b>supercoils</b> behind. We have examined the possibility that positive <b>supercoils</b> might destabilize nucleosomes, facilitating transcription. We show that histone octamers bind to positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA, and that after the complex is relaxed, 'classical' nucleosomes are present. We tested the possibility that nucleosomes on positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA are in an altered (presumably more open) conformation, but revert to the classical structure only on release of this stress. However, circular dichroic spectra, and chemical cross-linking and modification of core histones, all suggest that the complexes initially formed on positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA are classical nucleosomes. Although such structures are stable, their formation requires the plasmid to become more positively <b>supercoiled,</b> resulting in greater superhelical stress. In contrast, formation of nucleosomes on negatively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA relieves superhelical stress. In an exchange experiment in which equilibrium is achieved, nucleosomes transfer from positively to negatively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA, as predicted from the super-coiling free energies of the reactions. This suggests a mechanism for transcription of a gene assembled into chromatin, in which octamers are sequentially transferred from the region in front of the polymerase to the region behind...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{positively}} <b>supercoiled</b> [(+) SC] DNA {{is the preferred}} substrate for Escherichia coli topoisomerase IV (topo IV). We measured topo IV relaxation of (−) and (+) <b>supercoils</b> in real time on single, tethered DNA molecules to complement ensemble experiments. We find that the preference for (+) SC DNA is complete at low enzyme concentration. Otherwise, topo IV relaxed (+) <b>supercoils</b> at a 20 -fold faster rate than (−) <b>supercoils,</b> due primarily to about a 10 -fold increase in processivity with (+) SC DNA. The preferential cleavage of (+) SC DNA in a competition experiment showed that substrate discrimination can take place prior to strand passage in {{the presence or absence}} of ATP. We propose that topo IV discriminates between (−) and (+) <b>supercoiled</b> DNA by recognition of the geometry of (+) SC DNA. Our results explain how topo IV can rapidly remove (+) <b>supercoils</b> to support DNA replication without relaxing the essential (−) <b>supercoils</b> of the chromosome. They also show that the rate of <b>supercoil</b> relaxation by topo IV is several orders of magnitude faster than hitherto appreciated, so that a single enzyme may suffice at each replication fork...|$|R
5000|$|Topoisomerase IV's second {{function}} in the cell is to relax positive <b>supercoils.</b> It shares this role with DNA gyrase, which is also able to relax positive <b>supercoils.</b> Together, gyrase and topoisomerase IV remove the positive <b>supercoils</b> that accumulate ahead of a translocating DNA polymerase, allowing DNA replication to continue unhindered by topological strain.|$|R
25|$|Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} that {{is active}} against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all quinolones, it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV {{is necessary to}} separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for <b>supercoiling</b> the DNA, {{so that it will}} fit in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. Levofloxacin acts as a bactericide.|$|E
500|$|DNA can be twisted like a rope in {{a process}} called DNA <b>supercoiling.</b> With DNA in its [...] "relaxed" [...] state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound. If the DNA is twisted in the {{direction}} of the helix, this is positive <b>supercoiling,</b> and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative <b>supercoiling,</b> and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative <b>supercoiling</b> that is introduced by enzymes called topoisomerases. These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{was found}} {{recently}} that DNA catenanes, formed during replication of circular plasmids, become positively (+) <b>supercoiled,</b> and the unlinking of such catenanes by type IIA topoisomerases proceeds much {{more efficiently than}} the unlinking of negatively (−) <b>supercoiled</b> catenanes. In an attempt to explain this striking finding we studied, by computer simulation, conformational properties of <b>supercoiled</b> DNA catenanes. Although the simulation showed that conformational properties of (+) and (−) <b>supercoiled</b> replication catenanes are very different, these properties per se do not give any advantage to (+) <b>supercoiled</b> over (−) <b>supercoiled</b> DNA catenanes for unlinking. An advantage became evident, however, when we took into account the established features of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the topoisomerases. The enzymes create a sharp DNA bend in the first bound DNA segment and allow for the transport of the second segment only from inside the bend to its outside. We showed that in (−) <b>supercoiled</b> DNA catenanes this protein-bound bent segment becomes nearly inaccessible for segments of the other linked DNA molecule, inhibiting the unlinking...|$|R

40|$|Human topoisomerase I {{plays an}} {{important}} role in removing positive DNA <b>supercoils</b> that accumulate ahead of replication forks. It also is the target for camptothecin-based anticancer drugs that act by increasing levels of topoisomerase I-mediated DNA scission. Evidence suggests that cleavage events most likely to generate permanent genomic damage are those that occur ahead of DNA tracking systems. Therefore, it is important to characterize the ability of topoisomerase I to cleave positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA. Results confirm that the human enzyme maintains higher levels of cleavage with positively as opposed to negatively <b>supercoiled</b> substrates in the absence or presence of anticancer drugs. Enhanced drug efficacy on positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA is due primarily to an increase in baseline levels of cleavage. Sites of topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage do not appear to be affected by <b>supercoil</b> geometry. However, rates of ligation are slower with positively <b>supercoiled</b> substrates. Finally, intercalators enhance topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage of negatively <b>supercoiled</b> substrates but not positively <b>supercoiled</b> or linear DNA. We suggest that these compounds act by altering the perceived topological state of the double helix, making underwound DNA appear to be overwound to the enzyme, and propose that these compounds be referred to as ‘topological poisons of topoisomerase I’...|$|R

2500|$|After binding to the DNA, the RNA {{polymerase}} switches from {{a closed}} complex {{to an open}} complex.

2500|$|Z-DNA {{is quite}} {{different}} from the right-handed forms. In fact, Z-DNA is often compared against B-DNA in order to illustrate the major differences. The Z-DNA helix is left-handed and has a structure that repeats every 2 base pairs. The major and minor grooves, unlike A- and B-DNA, show little difference in width. Formation of this structure is generally unfavourable, although certain conditions can promote it; such as alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence (especially poly(dGC)2), negative DNA <b>supercoiling</b> or high salt and some cations (all at physiological temperature, 37°C, and pH 7.3-7.4). Z-DNA can form a junction with B-DNA (called a [...] "B-to-Z junction box") in a structure which involves the extrusion of a base pair. The Z-DNA conformation has been difficult to study because it does not exist as a stable feature of the double helix. Instead, it is a transient structure that is occasionally induced by biological activity and then quickly disappears.|$|E
40|$|<b>Supercoiled</b> DNA is the {{relevant}} substrate {{for a large}} number of DNA transactions and has additionally been found to be a favorable form for delivering DNA and protein-DNA complexes to cells. We report here a facile method for stoichiometrically incorporating several different modifications at multiple, specific, and widely spaced sites in <b>supercoiled</b> DNA. The method is based upon generating an appropriately gapped circular DNA, starting from single-strand circular DNA from two phagemids with oppositely oriented origins of replication. The gapped circular DNA is annealed with labeled and unlabeled synthetic oligonucleotides to make a multiply nicked circle, which is covalently sealed and <b>supercoiled.</b> The method is efficient, robust and can be readily scaled up to produce large quantities of labeled <b>supercoiled</b> DNA for biochemical and structural studies. We have applied this method to generate dye-labeled <b>supercoiled</b> DNA with heteroduplex bubbles for a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of <b>supercoiled</b> Holliday junction intermediates in the λ integrative recombination reaction. We found that a higher-order structure revealed by FRET in the <b>supercoiled</b> Holliday junction intermediate is preserved in the linear recombination product.

40|$|Cinnamomin {{is a type}} II {{ribosome-inactivating protein}} and its A-chain {{exhibits}} RNA N-glycosidase activity to remove an adenine in the conserved sarcin/ricin loop of the largest RNA in ribosome, arresting protein synthesis at the elongation step. In this report, deadenylation of both rRNA and <b>supercoiled</b> DNA by native and recombinant cinnamomin A-chain expressed in Escherichia coli was demonstrated. However, the mutants of cinnamomin A-chain devoid of N-terminal 52 or/and C-terminal 51 amino acid residues lost both the activity of RNA N-glycosidase {{and the ability to}} release adenines from <b>supercoiled</b> DNA. Additionally, <b>supercoiled</b> DNA could not be cleaved into nicked and linear forms by these mutants. These results indicate that both N- and C-terminal regions are essential for the cinnamomin A-chain to deadenylate rRNA and <b>supercoiled</b> DNA.

2500|$|An old {{standing}} dynamic {{problem is}} how DNA [...] "self-replication" [...] {{takes place in}} living cells that should involve transient uncoiling of supercoiled DNA fibers. Although DNA consists of relatively rigid, very large elongated biopolymer molecules called fibers or chains (that are made of repeating nucleotide units of four basic types, attached to deoxyribose and phosphate groups), its molecular structure in vivo undergoes dynamic configuration changes that involve dynamically attached water molecules and ions. <b>Supercoiling,</b> packing with histones in chromosome structures, and other such supramolecular aspects also involve [...] in vivo DNA topology which is even more complex than DNA molecular geometry, thus turning molecular modeling of DNA into an especially challenging problem for both molecular biologists and biotechnologists.

50|$|DNA <b>supercoiling</b> is {{important}} for DNA packaging within all cells. Because the length of DNA can be thousands of times that of a cell, packaging this genetic material into the cell or nucleus (in eukaryotes) is a difficult feat. <b>Supercoiling</b> of DNA reduces the space and allows for DNA to be packaged. In prokaryotes, plectonemic supercoils are predominant, because of the circular chromosome and relatively small amount of genetic material. In eukaryotes, DNA <b>supercoiling</b> exists on many levels of both plectonemic and solenoidal supercoils, with the solenoidal <b>supercoiling</b> proving most effective in compacting the DNA.

Using DNA binding assays and a single-molecule DNA braiding system, we show that Topo IV recognizes the chiral crossings imposed by the left-handed superhelix of a (+) <b>supercoiled</b> DNA, rather than global topology, twist deformation, or local writhe. Monte Carlo simulations of braid, <b>supercoil,</b> and catenane configurations demonstrate how a preference for a single-crossing geometry during strand passage can allow Topo IV to perform its physiological functions.

The twist is the number of helical turns in the DNA and the writhe is the number of times the double helix crosses over on itself (these are the supercoils). Extra helical twists are positive and lead to positive <b>supercoiling,</b> while subtractive twisting causes negative <b>supercoiling.</b> Many topoisomerase enzymes sense <b>supercoiling</b> and either generate or dissipate it as they change DNA topology.

Experiments have demonstrated that positive <b>supercoiled</b> DNA provides a sharp DNA bend in the first bound DNA segment, which allows the topoisomerase to bind successfully and therefore carry on its enzymatic reaction to the following segment in an specific inside-to-outside matter.
