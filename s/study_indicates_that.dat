5|$|A recent {{molecular}} <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> {{the song}} thrush's closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) and Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis); these three species are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified and {{spread across the}} globe, and hence are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (T. merula).|$|E

Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E
5|$|The {{accentors}} are {{a family}} of small ground-living insectivorous birds, {{most of which are}} found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Maastrichtian, albertosaurines {{appear to have}} gone extinct, while the tyrannosaurine Tyrannosaurus roamed from Saskatchewan to Texas. This pattern is {{mirrored}} in other North American dinosaur taxa. During the Campanian and early Maastrichtian, lambeosaurine hadrosaurs and centrosaurine ceratopsians are common in the northwest, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were more common to the south. By {{the end of the}} Cretaceous, centrosaurines are unknown and lambeosaurines are rare, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were common throughout the Western Interior. A study published in the journal Scientific Reports on February 2, 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al. indicates that during the later Maastrichtian, Tyrannosaurus itself might have been partially responsible for the extinction of the other tyrannosaurids in most of western North America. The <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> Tyrannosaurus might have been an immigrant from Asia as opposed to having evolved in North America (possibly a descendent of the closely related Tarbosaurus) that supplanted and outcompeted other tyrannosaurids. This theory is further supported by the fact that few to no other types of tyrannosaurid are found within Tyrannosaurus known range.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea is {{the only}} Hawaiian volcano with {{distinct}} evidence of glaciation. Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa, but have been covered by later lava flows. Despite Hawaii's tropical location, during several past ice ages a drop of only a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the mountain's summit through summer, triggering {{the formation of an}} ice cap. There are three episodes of glaciation that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years: the Pōhakuloa (180–130ka), Wāihu (80–60ka) and Mākanaka (40–13ka) series. These have extensively sculpted the summit, depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the mountain's upper flanks. Subglacial eruptions built cinder cones during the Mākanaka glaciation, most of which were heavily gouged by glacial action. The most recent cones were built between 9000 and 4500 years ago, atop the glacial deposits, although one <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the last eruption may have been around 3600 years ago.|$|E

25|$|In an {{experiment}} by Hanson et al. {{that was published}} in 2006, the amount of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured in untreated and in sunscreen treated skin. In the first 20 minutes, the film of sunscreen had a protective effect {{and the number of}} ROS species was smaller. After 60 minutes, however, the amount of absorbed sunscreen was so high that the amount of ROS was higher in the sunscreen-treated skin than in the untreated skin. The <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> sunscreen must be reapplied within 2 hours in order to prevent UV light from penetrating to sunscreen-infused live skin cells.|$|E
25|$|One study {{demonstrated}} that cross-modal visual and auditory integration is present from within 1 year of life. This study measured response time for orientating towards a source.

Younger infants, however, showed no such change in response times to these different conditions. Indeed, {{the results of the}} <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> children potentially have the capacity to integrate sensory sources at any age. However, in certain cases, for example visual cues, intermodal integration is avoided.|$|E

25|$|Changes in the RNA {{processing}} machinery {{may lead to}} mis-splicing of multiple transcripts, while single-nucleotide alterations in splice sites or cis-acting splicing regulatory sites may lead to differences in splicing of a single gene, and thus in the mRNA produced from a mutant gene's transcripts. A study in 2005 involving probabilistic analyses indicated that greater than 60% of human disease-causing mutations affect splicing rather than directly affecting coding sequences. A more recent <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> one-third of all hereditary diseases {{are likely to have}} a splicing component. Regardless of exact percentage, a number of splicing-related diseases do exist. As described below, a prominent example of splicing-related diseases is cancer.|$|E
25|$|The taxonomic {{division}} of Streptococcus dysgalactiae into its two subspecies {{has been the}} origin of much confusion, and a matter of ongoing debate. Although no official taxonomic gold standard exists, the most current and widely supported definition was published by Vieira et al. in 1998. It defines S.dysgalactiae subspecies dysgalactiae solely as the alpha-haemolytic phenotype harbouring the Lancefield group C antigen. The rest are classified as S.dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis, are (mostly) beta-haemolytic and can harbour carbohydrate antigens of Lancefield group A, C, G or L. However, a recent <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the SDSE strains of animal and human origin are genetically divergent, and future taxonomic reclassifications are conceivable.|$|E
25|$|A German fMRT-study {{conducted}} by researchers of the Central Institute of Mental Health points towards impairments in social, {{emotional and physical}} aspects of the self-concept and a higher degree in avatar identification in addicted MMORPG players, compared to non-addicted and naive (nonexperienced) people. These findings generally support Davis' cognitive behavioral model of Internet addiction, which postulates that dysfunctional self-related cognitions represent central factors contributing towards the development and maintenance of MMORPG addiction. The high degree of avatar identification found by Leménager et al. in the addicted group of this <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> MMORPG playing may represent an attempt to compensate for impairments in self-concept. Psychotherapeutic interventions should therefore focus {{on the development of}} coping strategies for real-life situations in which addicted players tend to experience themselves as incompetent and inferior.|$|E

25|$|In a 2001 study, the {{movements}} of Atlantic bluefin tuna from an area off North Carolina were studied {{with the help of}} special popup tags. When attached to a tuna, these tags monitored {{the movements}} of the tuna for about a year, then freed themselves, and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite. The study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns. One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year. Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic, but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning. A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again. The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning. The <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that,</b> while there is some differentiation by spawning areas, there is essentially only one population of Atlantic bluefin tuna, intermixing groups that between them use all of the north Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} precaution {{is to remove}} and reduce trash and rubbish from your property, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cans—especially if they are stored {{right next to the}} house. With attached garages, block off house access by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under it. This minimizes chances that any spider can crawl onto the bed. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally worn should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. However, spiders' perched legs allow them to walk over most pesticides, making the use of chemicals to eradicate the spiders impractical and unnecessarily toxic. A 2014 <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> fumigation may be more effective than previously believed. Sticky traps placed along floor boards offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure.|$|E
500|$|An {{accepted}} sign of domestication is {{the presence}} of tooth crowding, in which the orientation and alignment of the teeth are described as touching, overlapping or being rotated. A 2017 study found that 18% of Beringian wolf specimens exhibit tooth crowding compared with 9% for modern wolves and 5% for domestic dogs. These specimens predate the arrival of humans and therefore there is no possibility of cross-breeding with dogs. The <b>study</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> tooth crowding can be a natural occurrence in some wolf ecomorphs and cannot be used to differentiate ancient wolves from early dogs.|$|E
