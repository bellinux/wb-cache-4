2500|$|At {{the time}} of release, {{professional}} reviews were overall mixed. Record Mirror stated: [...] "Assuming that the title {{should be taken to}} mean that the group are trying to visit the territorial war grounds of their golden years in the singles charts I reckon they are in for a shock. I expect a little more than references to Big Brother, Stereo, Radio etc, in the otherwise catchy [...] "Sign of the Times" [...] and the reflection of [...] "Born to Run" [...] in [...] "Wheels Ain't Coming Down". On [...] "Nuts Bolts & Screws" [...] and [...] "My Baby's Got It" [...] Slade start to rock, but there's nothing here to distinguish them from any other rocking combo. I wasn't expecting another [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "My Friend Stan" [...] but just something a little more inspired. From a new band this would be a fairly good debut, from Slade I want more." [...] Sounds were similar in their reception, writing: [...] "Slade have managed to pull a fair to impressive performance out of the bag with this one. Sure to new wave lugs it sounds dated, but Return to Base still rocks like a good un', utilising standard rock 'n' roll/hard rock foundations for commendable displays of tightness and old time rock bite. Noddy's got one of the all time classic rock voices as he belts through ten steamy originals and one Chuck Berry cover. Slade may have stood still, but their own brand of rock shout clout still <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> these biased ears." ...|$|E

Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal suggested the song made Hale's future in country music look [...] "promising", awarding the song a 4.5-star (out of 5) rating. Sam Lansky of Idolator similarly complimented the song as a strong debut that [...] "bodes very well" [...] for the associated album, and proposed {{that it could be}} a hit at country radio, owing to its [...] "attitude" [...] and [...] "big singalong chorus". Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave a glowing review, describing [...] "You <b>Sound</b> <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> Me" [...] as well written and strongly performed, while also highlighting Hale's [...] "powerful" [...] voice. [...] "She's not another confection of some machine, Bjorke concludes, [...] "She’s sic genuinely talented and “You <b>Sound</b> <b>Good</b> <b>To</b> Me” proves it."
