40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a textural and mineral chemical study of a previously undescribed type of hydrothermal alteration of chevkinite-(Ce) which occurs in a <b>syenitic</b> <b>pegmatite</b> from the Vishnevye Mountains, Urals Region, Russia. The progressive alteration of the chevkinite to a bastnäsite-(Ce) -ilmenite-columbite-(Fe) assemblage {{through a series of}} texturally complex intermediate stages is described and electron microprobe analyses are given of all the major phases. Unusual Nb ± Th-rich phases formed late in the alteration sequence provide evidence of local Nb mobility. The main compositional fluxes are traced, especially of the REE, HFSE, Th and U. It appears that almost all elements, with the exception of La, released from the chevkinite-(Ce) were reincorporated into later phases, such that they did not leave the alteration crust in significant amounts. The hydrothermal fluids are inferred to have been F- and CO 2 -rich, with variable levels of Ca activity, and with fO 2 mainly between the nickel-nickel oxide and magnetite-hematite buffers. This occurrence represents a new paragenesis for a columbite-group mineral...|$|E
5000|$|Vlasovite is a late {{phase in}} {{nepheline}} syenite and <b>syenitic</b> <b>pegmatites.</b> At Ascension Island {{it is found}} in miarolitic cavities in ejected blocks of peralkaline granite (Peralkaline rocks are deficient in aluminium but have sodium and potassium {{in excess of the}} amount needed to form feldspar). [...] At the Lovozero Massif in Russia it is formed in areas of rock rich in microcline and albite in the contact zone between pegmatites and fenites (metasomatic rocks composed of alkaline feldspar, sodic pyroxene and alkaline amphibole), by the replacement of eudialyte. Associated minerals include arfvedsonite, aegirine, apatite and fluorite, in addition to microcline, albite and eudialyte.|$|R
