40|$|Infrastructure and {{especially}} mass transit {{play a major}} role in urban economics and are the centre of many research questions. Probably due to simultaneous determination of infrastructure supply and demand most research is only carried out on the supply <b>side</b> <b>driven</b> relationship explaining how transport leads to urban development. The intention of the paper is to provide a new and purely empirical perspective on the chicken-and-egg-problem. We propose a panel VAR approach employing a unique data set for historic Berlin between 1870 and 1936. We argue that it is of a planner?s interest to not only incorporate the supply <b>side</b> <b>driven</b> relationship but also the demand sided one. We turn the simultaneity problem into a purely empirical question since in practice it becomes difficult to derive theoretical implications from a comprehensive model that fully reflects all mutual interactions. Our analysis follows a twofold approach: Firstly, we estimate the interaction between population and transport. We then secondly extend the analysis by looking into the relation between land values and transport. Our estimates suggest a supply <b>side</b> <b>driven</b> relationship between transport and population and a positive reciprocal one between transport and land values. We conclude that new lines are not built entirely into undeveloped land but need to be connected to areas characterised by high land values to serve as a commuting mode...|$|R

50|$|A left <b>side</b> <b>drive</b> crank arm. Although {{you could}} simply reverse a normal set of crank arms, {{the left side}} and right side {{specific}} pedal bosses would be reversed, causing them to tend to come loose and spin out with normal riding. Also, directional pedals would look backwards unless the pedal spindles were also reversed. Many companies now provide cranksets in which both arms {{are designed to be}} drive arms with the appropriate sprocket drive bosses. While this application to BMX is new, {{this is not a new}} idea. For decades, tandem bicycles have used left <b>side</b> <b>drive</b> cranks to drive the timing chain.|$|E

One side of the hub allows the use of normal right hand freewheels, while the other side is threaded with left hand threads (1.375" [...] x 24L tpi) and accepts the new left hand drive freewheels. The first/most common was the ACS South Paw Claw model, available in 16T. Later, a version of this hub was made with small metric BMX (30 mm x 1 mm) threads, left hand on one side and right hand on the other side. These hubs accepted either Left or right <b>side</b> <b>drive</b> freewheels in the smaller 13T-15T sizes.|$|E

50|$|Dead pedals {{have never}} been a {{required}} addition to standard automobile pedal sets. This is because the advantages of having a dead pedal are most commonly associated with manual transmission cars. Furthermore, cars with left <b>side</b> <b>drive</b> often have a natural footrest because of the wheel well so it is more common to find right <b>side</b> <b>drive</b> cars with dead pedals. However, the dead pedal promotes safe driving habits by serving as a place for drivers to place their foot and prevent accidental left foot braking. It is not recommended to brake with the left foot because it is less confusing when switching between automatic and manual transmission cars. Resting one's foot on the brake pedal may also accidentally light up the brake lights when the vehicle is not decelerating.|$|E
