40|$|A solar {{simulator}} utilizing nine 30 -kW xenon arc lamps {{was built to}} provide radiant power for testing a solar dynamic space power system in a thermal vacuum environment. The advanced {{solar simulator}} achieved the following values specific to the solar dynamic system: (1) a <b>subtense</b> <b>angle</b> of 1 deg; (2) the ability to vary solar simulator intensity up to 1. 7 kW/sq m; (3) a beam diameter of 4. 8 m; and (4) uniformity of illumination {{on the order of}} +/- 10 %. The flexibility of the solar simulator design allows for other potential uses of the facility...|$|E
40|$|Modifications and {{improvements}} {{on a low}} cost air mass 2 solar simulator are discussed. The performance characteristics of total irradiance, uniformity of irradiance, spectral distribution, and beam <b>subtense</b> <b>angle</b> are presented. The simulator consists of an array of tungsten halogen lamps hexagonally spaced in a plane. A corresponding array of plastic Fresnel lenses shapes the output beam such that the simulator irradiates a 1. 2 m by 1. 2 m area with uniform collimated irradiance. Details are given concerning individual lamp output measurements and placement of the lamps. Originally, only the direct component of solar irradiance was simulated. Since the diffuse component may affect the performance of some collectors, the capability to simulate it is being added. An approach to this diffuse addition is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} briefly the design, construction, {{and operation}} of a low cost air mass 2 solar simulator, and then presents the performance characteristics of a modified version in terms of total irradiance, uniformity of irradiance, spectral distribution, and beam <b>subtense</b> <b>angle.</b> The simulator consists of an array of 143 tungsten halogen lamps and a corresponding array of 143 Fresnel lenses parallel {{and in front of}} the lenses, so that a 1. 2 m by 1. 2 m area is irradiated with uniform collimated irradiance. The performance of this 143 -lamp version is compared with that of the 12 -lamp prototype. It was found that the larger design required a lower lamp voltage for an equivalent average total irradiance in the test plane. However, distribution of total irradiance was not as good for the large simulator...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} 28 {{parameters of}} 202 femurs from Koreans by an automated geometric computation program using 3 D models generated from computed tomography images. The measurement parameters were selected {{with reference to}} physical and forensic anthropology studies as well as orthopedic implant design studies. All measurements were calculated using 3 D reconstructions on a computer using scientific computation language. We also analyzed sex and population differences by comparison with data from previous studies. Most parameters were larger in males than in females. The height, head diameter, head center offset, and chord length of the diaphysis, most parameters in the distal femur, and the isthmic width of the medullary canal were smaller in Koreans than in other populations. However, the neck-shaft <b>angle,</b> <b>subtense,</b> and width of the intercondylar notch in the distal femur were larger than those in other populations. The {{results of this study}} will be useful as a reference for physical and forensic anthropology as well as the design of medical devices suitable for Koreans...|$|R

40|$|Planned {{vacuum tank}} testing of a solar dynamic space power system {{requires}} a solar simulator. Several solar simulators were previously built {{and used for}} vacuum tank testing of various space systems. However, the apparent solar <b>subtense</b> <b>angle,</b> i. e., the angular size of the apparent sun as viewed from the experiment, of these solar simulators is too large to enable testing of solar dynamic systems. A new design was developed {{to satisfy the requirements}} of the solar dynamic testing. This design provides 1. 8 kW/m(sup 2) onto a 4. 5 M diameter test area from a source that subtends only 1 deg, full cone angle. Key features that enable this improved performance are (1) elimination of the collimating mirror commonly used in solar simulators to transform the diverging beam into a parallel beam; (2) a redesigned lamp module that has increased efficiency; and (3) the use of a segmented reflective surface to combine beams from several individual lamp modules at the pseudosun. Each segment of this reflective surface has complex curvature to control the distribution of light. By developing a new solar simulator design for testing of the solar dynamic system instead of modifying current designs, the initial cost was cut in half, the efficiency was increased by 50 percent reducing the operating costs by one-third, and the volume occupied by the solar simulator was reduced by a factor of 10...|$|E
40|$|The 2 kWe Solar Dynamic (SD) Ground Test Demonstration (GTD) {{experiment}} will {{be conducted}} in 1995 at NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC). This solar dynamic power system test {{will be conducted}} in a simulated space environment and will require an artificial sun. To address the solar simulator requirements for the GTD, Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) was hired under contract to review and visit four existing solar simulator facilities. The four facilities included, AEDC's Mark 1 Chamber, NASA-JSC Chamber A, AEDC's 12 V Chamber, and NASA-JPL Space Simulator Chamber. Two design concepts were considered following several months of evaluating existing solar simulator facilities throughout the United States. To satisfy system requirements for the SD GTD experiment the solar simulator needs to provide a uniform light flux to the SD concentrator, provide the light within a <b>subtense</b> <b>angle</b> of one degree, and provide an intensity of one solar constant (1. 37 kW/sq m) at airmass zero. Most solar simulators are designed for supplying heat loads to spacecraft where a cone angle as large as 3 degrees is acceptable. It was also concluded that a solar simulator, such like these considered in the AEDC study, would require major facility modifications for NASA LeRC and result in significant impacts to the program. The advanced solar simulator concept developed by NASA LeRC will meet the system requirements for the SD GTD experiment Since SD GTD solar simulator requirements could not be addressed by existing simulator, an advanced concept was considered...|$|E
