5|$|During the 13th century, a folktale {{developed}} in which Richard’s minstrel Blondel roamed (<b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> {{known only to}} him and Richard) to find Richard's prison. This story was the foundation of André Ernest Modeste Grétry's opera Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and inspired the opening of Richard Thorpe's film version of Ivanhoe. Sixteenth-century tales of Robin Hood began describing him as a contemporary (and supporter) of Richard the Lionheart; Robin became an outlaw {{during the reign of}} Richard's evil brother, John, while Richard was fighting in the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} is Krusty's {{farewell}} special, and as Krusty describes {{the history of}} his career, Bob straps Bart with explosives in order to kill Krusty. Bart attempts to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks to the audience about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow Bob, holding himself responsible of turning Bob into a ruthless criminal. Krusty even goes far by <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> on behalf of Bob, stating how very remorseful he is of mistreating him. Upon witnessing this, Bob is touched and develops a change of heart, but does {{not have time to}} stop his original plan from being carried out. Luckily, Krusty's trained chimp Mr. Teeny sees the life-threatening explosives, which he throws into the network executives' office, killing all the executives, though they would later reanimate themselves like the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Bart comes out of his hypnotic state and he and his family serve dinner with Krusty, Bob and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and Bob reconcile, police decide to execute Bob by guillotine for his plot of attempted murder, although he argues with Chief Wiggum that he should have a trial for it at least.|$|E
25|$|One day, he {{corrected}} a college mate for not hitting right notes while <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song.</b> The boy took offense and rudely questioned his musical credentials. The incident fueled the resolve in Babla to start singing {{in public and}} show the world his capabilities. That was the beginning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title is}} a tongue twister in Japanese, and roughly {{translates}} to [...] "a singer {{asks me to}} <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> song; if I could <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> like <b>a</b> singer <b>sings</b> <b>a</b> <b>song,</b> I would <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> like <b>a</b> singer <b>sings</b> <b>a</b> <b>song,</b> but I cannot <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> like <b>a</b> singer <b>sings</b> <b>a</b> <b>song,</b> so I will not <b>sing</b> <b>a</b> song." ...|$|R

25|$|Magic {{formulae}} usually required {{secrecy and}} could lose their power if they became known {{by other people}} than their owners. For example, a Chugach man experienced a sea otter swimming around, <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song,</b> a magic formula. He knew it is a help in hunting, whose efficiency will be lost for him if anybody else learns it.|$|E
25|$|BBC {{staff have}} {{traditionally}} created parodies {{of its own}} programming to be shown to colleagues at Christmas events and parties. The BBC's 1993 Christmas tape parodied the allegedly robotic, dictatorial and ruthless management style of its then Director-General, John Birt, by portraying him as Davros taking over the BBC, carrying out bizarre mergers of departments, awarding himself a bonus and <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> {{to the tune of}} I Wan'na Be Like You describing his plans.|$|E
25|$|During its six-year {{lifespan}} 22 Jacks toured {{with numerous}} bands, including Reel Big Fish, Lit, The Bloodhound Gang, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Goldfinger, Social Distortion, Bouncing Souls, Unwritten Law, Face to Face, Voodoo Glow Skulls, and Ten Foot Pole. They also sang back up for Joey Ramone on {{a song for}} a Cheap Trick Tribute album. This helped spark a friendship that lead to Joey Ramone showing up at 22 Jacks concerts and even <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> or two with them.|$|E

25|$|Traditions {{similar to}} the modern custom of trick-or-treating extend {{all the way back}} to {{classical}} antiquity, although it is extremely unlikely that any of them are directly related to the modern custom. The ancient Greek writer Athenaeus of Naucratis records in his book The Deipnosophists that, in ancient times, the Greek island of Rhodes had a custom in which children would go from door-to-door dressed as swallows, <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song,</b> which demanded the owners of the house to give them food and threatened to cause mischief if the owners of the house refused. This tradition was claimed to have been started by the Rhodian lawgiver Cleobulus.|$|E
25|$|Mélisande is at {{the tower}} window, <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> (Mes longs cheveux) as she combs her hair. Pelléas appears and asks her to lean out so he can kiss her hand as he is going away the next day. He cannot reach her hand but her long hair tumbles down {{from the window and}} he kisses and caresses it instead. Pelléas playfully ties Mélisande's hair to a willow tree in spite of her protests that someone might see them. A flock of doves takes flight. Mélisande panics when she hears Golaud's {{footsteps}} approaching. Golaud dismisses Pelléas and Mélisande as nothing but a pair of children and leads Pelléas away.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E

25|$|Later, the CEO of Crypton Future Media {{appeared}} in San Francisco {{at the start}} of the San Francisco tour where the first Hatsune Miku concert was hosted in North America on September 18, 2010, featuring songs provided by the Miku software voice. A second screening of the concert was on October 11, 2010 in the San Francisco Viz Cinema. A screening of the concert was also shown in New York City in the city's anime festival. Hiroyuki Ito, and planner/producer, Wataru Sasaki, who were responsible for Miku's creation, attended an event on October 8, 2010 at the festival. Videos of her performance are due to be released worldwide. Megpoid and Gackpoid were also featured in the 2010 King Run Anison Red and White concert. This event also used the same projector method to display Megpoid and Gackpoid on a large screen. Their appearance at the concert was done as a one-time event and both Vocaloids were featured <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> originally sung by their respective voice provider.|$|E
25|$|Toad {{appeared}} in the animated series The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! in 1989. Although he usually tagged along with Mario and Luigi in cases where King Koopa had kidnapped Princess Peach, he sometimes got captured as well. Toad's role in the show {{was to be the}} sidekick to the Mario Bros. (as Luigi was a major character rather than a sidekick). He remained on the show when it spun off into The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3, allowing them to live in his house. During the show he got alternate forms such as The Toad Warrior, Fire Toad and even Baby Toad; however, these forms of Toad have not made an appearance outside of the show. Due to his absence in the Super Mario World game, Toad did not make an appearance in the TV show of Super Mario World with Yoshi and Oogtar (the latter having the same voice actor as Toad) instead taking his place. Toad {{appeared in}} the Super Mario Bros. comic books published by Valiant as well. In these comics, Toad often followed Mario on his adventures, seemingly replacing Luigi as the hero's sidekick. He was a regular companion for King Toadstool, and even indulged in the King's activities. Played by Mojo Nixon, Toad appeared as a street musician in the non-canon Super Mario Bros. film. In the film, Toad is arrested for <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> that badmouths Koopa, who punishes him by having him turned into a Goomba. Despite this, the Goomba-fied Toad (portrayed by John Fifer) still manages to help Princess Daisy escape and distract the other Goombas by playing his harmonica.|$|E
500|$|The final {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Pendleton Ward) as she attempts {{to win a}} talent show by <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> entitled [...] "These Lumps". Before she can perform, however, a group of candy citizens steal her song. Lumpy Space Princess becomes enraged and throws a basketball into the audience, which hits an audience member and accidentally makes a basket in the process. Due to the impressiveness of this action, Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) names her the winner. Just then, Finn and Jake collide in mid-air, producing a high five that reverberates across Ooo. The duo are named the winner, much to Lumpy Space Princess' chagrin.|$|E

500|$|Before Christmas of 2000, Top Of The Pops 2 aired a {{video of}} Cassidy {{performing}} [...] "Over the Rainbow", which resulted in Songbird climbing steadily up the UK charts {{over the next few}} weeks. Just as ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald aired a feature on Cassidy, the album topped the chart. Shot at Blues Alley by a friend with a camcorder the same night the album was recorded, the video became the most requested video ever shown on Top Of The Pops 2. [...] "There's an undeniable emotional appeal in hearing an artist who you know died in obscurity <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> about hope and a mystical world beyond everyday life", wrote The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|Brazilian {{football}}ing icon Pelé tweeted, [...] "I {{always said}} that football is a box of surprises. Nobody in this world expected this result," [...] followed by, [...] " [...] Will {{try to get the}} sixth title in Russia. Congratulations to Germany." [...] Carlos Alberto Torres, the captain of Brazil's winning team in 1970, said that the country lost due to a [...] "feeling of 'we've already won'". He added that [...] "Germany played how I like to see and Scolari's tactics for this match were suicidal". Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella struggled to explain Brazil's loss, saying [...] "Football is illogical". In contrast, Argentinian icon Diego Maradona was seen <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> mocking the Brazilian defeat.|$|E
500|$|The song's writer, Brian Elliot, commented {{about the}} debate: [...] "I {{just wanted to}} make this girl in the song a {{sympathetic}} character. As a father myself, I'd want to be accessible to my children's problems." [...] Madonna avoided the controversy, and did not comment on the song's use as a pro-life statement. Her publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said that [...] "she [...] is <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song,</b> not taking a stand", adding that [...] "her philosophy is people can think what they want to think." [...] Danny Aiello, having appeared in the video as the titular [...] "Papa", recorded [...] "Papa Wants the Best for You" [...] later that year, an answer song written by Artie Schroeck from the father's point of view.|$|E

500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|Other {{artists who}} have written tributes to Barrett include his {{contemporary}} Kevin Ayers, who wrote [...] "O Wot a Dream" [...] in his honour (Barrett provided guitar to {{an early version of}} Ayers' song [...] "Religious Experience: <b>Singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>Song</b> in the Morning"). Robyn Hitchcock has covered many of his songs live and on record and paid homage to his forebear with the song [...] "(Feels Like) 1974". Phish covered [...] "Bike", [...] "No Good Trying", [...] "Love You", [...] "Baby Lemonade" [...] and [...] "Terrapin". The Television Personalities' single [...] "I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives" [...] from their 1981 album And Don't the Kids Love It is another tribute. In 2008, The Trash Can Sinatras released a single in tribute to the life and work of Syd Barrett called [...] "Oranges and Apples", from their 2009 album In the Music. Proceeds from the single go to the Syd Barrett Trust in support of arts in mental health.|$|E
500|$|During the {{beginning}} of Mr. Garrison's class, Cartman writes an essay on the TV series Simon & Simon instead of Asian culture. Also, Bill suggested that Stan take Sparky to a Barbra Streisand concert. The disappearance of Big Gay Al {{at the end of}} the episode is a spoof of Dr. Lao's disappearance {{at the end of the}} movie The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao. Big Gay Al's ride also features a number of miniature characters, among them Olympic figure skater Brian Boitano, <b>singing</b> <b>a</b> <b>song</b> called [...] "We Are Gay", which is a parody of the ride [...] "It's a Small World", an attraction at the Disneyland theme park. Boitano was featured in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas", and would later be the basis for the original song [...] "What Would Brian Boitano Do?" [...] from [...] The song played during the closing credits of [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] is [...] "Now You're a Man" [...] by DVDA, a punk rock band that Parker and Stone founded.
