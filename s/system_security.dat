25|$|The rate {{at which}} an {{attacker}} can submit guessed passwords to the system is {{a key factor in}} determining <b>system</b> <b>security.</b> Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g. three) of failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other vulnerabilities, such systems can be effectively secured with relatively simple passwords. However the system must store information about the user passwords in some form and if that information is stolen, say by breaching <b>system</b> <b>security,</b> the user passwords can be at risk.|$|E

Existing {{studies show that}} {{a great number of}} security incidents are caused by trusted personnel within organizations due to the tension between the design of information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> policies, guidelines, rules and tools, and how they actually are used. This paper describes a framework for anlyzinging users’ compliance with the creator’s intentions that underlie an information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> design. This framework is anchored in the concept of rationality, and the result can be used, for example, to facilitate the task of analyzing security incidents, to verify existing information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> approaches, and to match information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> approaches with organizational requirements.

25|$|DNS {{responses}} traditionally do {{not have}} a cryptographic signature, leading to many attack possibilities; the Domain Name <b>System</b> <b>Security</b> Extensions (DNSSEC) modify DNS to add support for cryptographically signed responses. DNSCurve has been proposed as an alternative to DNSSEC. Other extensions, such as TSIG, add support for cryptographic authentication between trusted peers and are commonly used to authorize zone transfer or dynamic update operations.|$|E
25|$|The Domain Name System {{specifies}} a set {{of various}} types of resource records (RRs), which are the basic information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration time (time to live), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a resource record set (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement round-robin ordering to achieve load balancing. The Domain Name <b>System</b> <b>Security</b> Extensions (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{compared the}} employment of the skills and attributes needed by information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> professionals in an information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> work environment with those taught in NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education. Using two surveys {{the goal of this}} research was to determine if the skills and attributes identified in the CISSP were employed in an information systems work environment and if these skills were taught in colleges and universities designated as NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education. The skills and attributes within the 10 domains of the CISSP were identified by 23 questions contained in two surveys, one to information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> professionals working in the field and one to information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> faculty in NSA designated Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education. The CISSP domains cover the following areas of information security responsibilities: 1) Access Control Systems and Methodology, 2) Telecommunications and Network Security, 3) Security Management Practices, 4) Applications and <b>Systems</b> Development <b>Security,</b> 5) Cryptography, 6) Security Architecture and Models, 7) Operations Security, 8) Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery Planning, 9) Laws, Investigations, and Ethics, and 10) Physical Security. The CISSP domains were chosen as the defining criteria {{for the development of the}} operational definitions after an extensive review of literature in the field of information security. The surveys were developed over three phases: the pilot phase, the validity phase, and the reliability phase. The breakdown of the domain descriptions into questions was accomplished during the pilot survey phase. Requests for participation in the survey were e-mailed to 800 information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> professionals and 321 information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> faculty. There was a 67 % information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> faculty response rate and a 20 % information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> professional response rate. This research indicated that information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> professionals working in an information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> work environment employed or addressed the skills and attributes identified in the 10 domains of the CISSP. This research also indicated that the skills and attributes taught in the curriculum of NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education had no association with the skills and attributes employed, or addressed, by information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> professionals in an information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> work environment. There was one exception, Domain 4, Applications and <b>Systems</b> Development <b>Security,</b> which indicated there was an association between how the skills and attributes were employed in an information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> work environment and were taught in NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education. The findings of this research can be used as a baseline to develop information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> curriculum. Further research is needed to determine the differences, if any, in the skills and attributes identified in the various information security certifications, the correlation between the skills and attributes identified in each of the information security certifications, and any differences in {{the employment of}} these skills and attributes between certified and non-certified information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> professionals...|$|R

To this end, {{there is a need}} to investigate other means of managing information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> since most information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> approaches although valuable they focus on technical oriented solutions, e. g. checklists, risk analysis, evaluation methods, and ignore the social aspects of risks and the informal structures of organizations.

25|$|Strikingly {{different}} {{interpretations of the}} medieval state of Kievan Rus' appear in the four schools of historiography within Ukraine: Russophile, Sovietophile, Eastern Slavic, and Ukrainophile. The Sovietophile and Russophile schools have become marginalized in independent Ukraine, with the Ukrainophile school being dominant in the early 21st century. The Ukrainophile school promotes an identity that is mutually exclusive of Russia. It has come to dominate the nation's educational <b>system,</b> <b>security</b> forces, and national symbols and monuments, {{although it has been}} dismissed as nationalist by Western historians. The East Slavic school, an eclectic compromise between Ukrainophiles and Russophilism, has a weaker ideological and symbolic base, although it is preferred by Ukraine's centrist former elites.|$|E

40|$|Information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} {{a growing concern}} for businesses of all sizes. As security threats and incidents become more pervasive and the legal and business stakes for information security increases, understanding an organization's information security practices becomes essential in the security planning and development process. The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe the effectiveness of information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> practices in small and medium enterprises. To date there is no quantitative or qualitative data within the extant literature describing the state of information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> practices in small businesses. The data that exists has been produced by commercial organizations with business interests in information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> consulting or services, such as Deloitte & Touche and Ernst & Young, and by organisations with charter responsibilities in the information security and technology arena, such as the Computer Security Institute. The aim of this study is to contribute to the theoretical understanding of how information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> should be pursued in small businesses and to provide evidence to assist in the development of policies, programs, and technology in support of information <b>systems</b> <b>security</b> goals in small businesses.
