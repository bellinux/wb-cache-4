40|$|Research and trainings {{related to}} reduced-impact logging have been {{conducted}} in CIFOR Malinau Research Forest (MRF), East Kalimantan since 1998. Indonesian selective logging and planting system (called TPTI: Tebang Pilih Tanam Indonesia) is a current silvicultural system in Indonesia. It is stipulated that all dipterocarps (i. e timber trees in family Dipterocarpaceae) with a diameter at 1. 3 m in dbh (diameter at breast height) over 50 or 60 cm can be harvested with a polycyclic felling schedule of 35 years. However sustainable forest management in Indonesia is <b>still</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go. Harvesting intensity in Indonesian dipterocarps forest exceed 100 m 3 /ha and more than 10 trees/ha. Conventional logging generally damages more than 50 % of the original stand. Several experiments in mixed dipterocarps forests have demonstrated that RIL techniques can reduce damage by at least 30 - 50 % compared with normal operation, also called conventional logging. Training, close supervision and proper planning are among others required by RIL technique. Based on RIL results studies in Borneo, some silvicultural rules are suggested: (1) {{there is a need}} for simple and practical prescriptions which limit the densities of trees harvested to 8 per hectare, (2) a minimum spacing distance between harvested trees (35 - 40 m), (3) single tre...|$|E

40|$|All {{living organisms}} {{including}} {{plants and animals}} are composed of millions of cells. These cells perform different functions for the organism although they possess the same chromosomes and carry the same genetic information. Thus, {{to be able to}} understand multicellular organism we need to understand the life cycle of individual cells from which the organism comprises. The cell cycle is the life cycle of a single cell in the plant or animal body. It involves series of events in which components of the cell doubles and afterwards equally segregate into daughter cells. Such process ensures growth of the organism, and specialized reductional cell division which leads to production of gamets, assures sexual reproduction. Cell cycle is divided in the G 1, S, G 2 and M phase. Two gap-phases (G 1 and G 2) separate S phase (or synthesis) and M phase which stays either for mitosis or meiosis. Essential for normal life progression and reproduction is correct chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Defects in the division program lead to aneuploidy, which in turn leads to birth defects, miscarriages or cancer. Even thou, researchers invented much about the regulation of the cell cycle, there is <b>still</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> understand the complexity of the regulatory machineries that ensure proper segregation of chromosomes.

O objetivo desta pesquisa ÃÂ analisar se a participaÃÂÃÂo de crianÃÂas e adolescentes em uma apresentaÃÂÃÂo artÃÂstica institucional, caracterizada como trabalho social, se configura em trabalho infantil. A extensÃÂo deste projeto se refere a cursos profissionalizantes ofertados pela instituiÃÂÃÂo proponente e assistÃÂncia mÃÂdica.

40|$|Benefits {{of cloud}} {{computing}} to Small Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) seem obvious: financial savings (e. g. infrastructure savings, maintenance savings, etc.) and resource management advantage (e. g. skilled IT labor and equipment, resource flexibility, etc.). Software as a Service (SaaS) {{is one of}} cloud service model that has been acknowledged as the most plausible cloud service for SMEs. With regard to SMEs, Indonesia has enormous market size consisting of around 650. 000 units. Despite its market size, according to Indonesian Cloud Forum (ICF), SMEs adoption to cloud computing including SaaS is only 3 %. Yet, {{little is known about}} why the adoption of such technology is very low for SMEs in Indonesia. A requirement to SaaS adoption is the ICT adoption, notably the availability of basic IT infrastructure such as Internet and computer, which can also be seen as the basic requirement for SaaS adoption. However it is also unclear how many SMEs have adopted this basic IT infrastructure. Various factors may facilitate or inhibit SaaS adoption, yet very little is known about these factors. In this regard, this study seeks to investigate the factors that influence SMEs in Indonesia to adopt SaaS by focusing on manufacturing industry. Ordinal logistic regression and rough set analysis were applied to test the hypotheses in investigating the ICT and SaaS adoption factors. The study found a low level of ICT adoption among the SMEs. Moreover, the findings of the study suggest that firm size, education of middle to top management, and industry sector positively influence the ICT adoption among SMEs. In addition, the findings concerning SaaS adoption indicate that relative advantage, complexity, and compatibility as the strongest factors that tend to influence SaaS adoption level. These findings provide a better understanding on how SaaS is adopted by SMEs in Indonesia. It is <b>still</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go for SaaS to be adopted widely by SMEs; much effort is needed to boost such adoption. The low level of ICT adoption among SMEs should be addressed prior to or in parallel with SaaS adoption. Other factors from this study that expected to influence the ICT adoption are necessary to be investigated in this issue. Further, this study contributes to the knowledge on the adoption factors of information technology among SMEs in general. In terms of practical relevance, it gives recommendations to the national government as well as SaaS providers in formulating strategies for a better penetration of SaaS in the SMEs market.
