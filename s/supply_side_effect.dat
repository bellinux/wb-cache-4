40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-country dynamic perfect foresight Ricardian model with wealth effects {{to study the}} relationship between government spending financed by alternative taxation, the terms of trade and welfare. An increase in domestic government spending financed by a distortionary capital income tax leads the real exchange rate initially to appreciate (a pure demand effect). But along the transitional path an intertemporal terms of trade effect (a <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect)</b> operates and the real exchange rate depreciates to a steady state value ultimately higher relative to the initial equilibrium. The welfare of the domestic resident increases due to a reversed immiserizing growth effect. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} of <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> on corporate capital structure in China. We find that bank-dependent firms, that {{are large and}} state-owned companies in China, increase (decrease) their leverage ratios if loan supplies increase (decrease) relative to small and private firms due {{to their ability to}} access bank loans. With ability to substitute different forms of capital sources, large and state-owned firms are relatively less (more) likely to use internal funds and equity financing when bank loans are (not) available than small and private firms. During credit boom in 2009 and 2010, the large and state-owned firms increase leverage ratios by 2. 26 % and 2. 76 % more than matching firms; and small and private firms are shown to decrease leverage in this period. These findings lend support to the importance of <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> and bank loan segmentation on capital structure decisions...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 174 - 177) Microfiche. ix, 177 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAlthough {{recent studies}} have tried to isolate the effect of adjustment lending on representative macroeconomic variables such as GNP, inflation, and the current account, they have not explicitly dealt with the <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> on the economy. This is, however, supposed {{to be one of}} the most important objectives on which almost all adjustment lending has been concentrated during the last decade. The growth aspect of adjustment lending has recently been getting closer attention due to depressed investment performance. The purpose of this work is to examine the <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> with particular emphasis on the efficiency factor. It examines whether or not the possible supply enhancement effect of overall aid money has been augmented by policy reforms which have been imposed on the recipient countries as conditions of adjustment loans. In order to estimate such an effect, a suitable econometric model will be developed. For this purpose, a standard neoclassical growth model with external financial flows will be modified through the introduction of either dummy variables or structural adjustment variables. Pooled regression analysis using cross-section and time-series data from recipient countries shows that in both the IMF-WB program and the export growth case, middle-income Asian countries showed expected, and hence encouraging, results [...] statistically significant positive effects, with lags. Assuming that there are no problems such as inadequate data on conditionality or insufficient control for autonomous microeconomic policy reform, this implies that factors that were specific and/or idiosyncratic to middle-income Asian countries, at least during the estimation period, impact the efficiency factor in the supply side of the economy concerned. Historical, intellectual, and practical aspects of adjustment lending will also be discussed comprehensively...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze a {{monetary}} model with asset scarcity. A large and persistent deleveraging shock {{in the spirit}} of Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) leads to a persistent liquidity trap, with an increase in cash holdings and a long-term output decline. The long-term impact is a <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> independent of nominal rigidities, coming from the fact that holding cash is costly. Quantitative easing is ineffective at the ZLB, but it can postpone the exit from a liquidity trap. An increase in public debt may accelerate such an exit, but it may lower the capital stock because of higher interest rates. Monetary transfers are effective in stimulating employment in the short-run, but not in affecting the long term output level.

40|$|Demand shocks likely play a {{key role}} in driving {{business}} cycles. However, in the standard newkeynesian model, the monetary policy reaction to these shocks have a <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> Thechange in real rate affects the marginal utility of consumption generating an income effect onlabor supply. Wages, inflation and through monetary policy, aggregate demand will increase. This <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> have a surprising importance for the model, especially when the sensi-tivity of aggregate demand to interest rate is low. A demand shock will have a large impact(close to one) on output, but a very small one on the output gap. The limited monetary policymovement induced by the taylor rule remains very close to the natural rate of interest. Thereare nearly no differences between the sticky price and the flexible price model. It representsa very disappointing result, the entire purpose of sticky prices being to generate inefficiencieswhen the aggregate demand is hit. Coupled with very tiny empirical support for this supplyside effect of monetary policy, it suggests to explore the theoretical possibilities to kill this ef-fect. First, we review the two ways the literature have proposed, nonseparable preferences andsticky wages. The main drawback is a strong reliance on very specific assumption for the labormarket. We explore an alternative approach. We attempt a radical departure from traditionnalassumption about the optimizing behavior of the representative agent. Instead of optimizingsimulatneously with respect to hours, consumption and saving, the household decomposes theproblem in two steps. First, the agent chooses between labor income and hours. Second, heoptimizes between consumption and saving. The interest is to disentangle the income effectwhich affects the labor equation and those affecting the intertemporal choice. Thus it is possibleto reduce the wealth effect on labor supply whereas keeping a low sensitivity of consumptionto interest rate. This flexible approach also allows to challenge the effect of interest rate onwealth offering a potential explanation for small effects of interest rate on both labor supplyand consumption whereas keeping large income effects...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the direct/indirect long-run relationships and dynamic interactions between public investment (PI) and output performance in Nigeria using annual data spanning 1970 - 2010. A macro-econometric model derived from Keynes’ income-expenditure framework was employed. The model was disaggregated into demand and supply sides to trace the direct and indirect effects of PI on aggregate output. The direct <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> was assessed using the magnitude of PI multiplier coefficient, while the indirect effect of PI on the demand side was evaluated with marginal propensity to consume, accelerator coefficient and import multiplier. The results showed relatively less strong direct effect of PI on aggregate output, while the indirect effects were stronger with the import multiplier being the most pronounced. This is attributed to declining capital expenditure, poor implementation and low quality of PI projects due to widespread corruption. By and large, we concluded that PI exerted considerable influence on aggregate output...|$|E

Since then the level of minimum wage has been valorised many times (in January 2006 the valorisation of minimum wage was the thirteenth time the minimum wage had been changed).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} role of demand structure in explaining patterns {{of international trade and}} the directions of structural transformations during globalization. In contrary, recent literature in international and development economics has heavily focused on the production side of general equilibrium. In particular, I study the different impacts of the two components of aggregate demand, namely per-capita income and country size, on bilateral trade when preferences are non-homothetic. In addition, I investigate how endogenous demand structure based on human capital endowments induces countries to undergo different patterns of structural change which generate different implications for changes in national productivity. This thesis therefore makes an effort to illustrate some fundamental questions that cannot be fully addressed by solely looking at the <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> in international trade and economic development. Chapter One introduces non-homothetic preferences and controls for comparative advantage to a multi-sector, multi-country trade model and yields a structural gravity equation that demonstrates explicitly how per-capita income and country side affect the pattern of bilateral trade differently, and how their effects vary with sectoral characteristics. In Chapter Two, I structurally estimate the gravity model derived from the previous chapter. The reduced-form test utilizing the estimates of sectoral demand elasticities conforms the predictions of the theoretical hypotheses. Counterfactual experiments are also conducted which acknowledge {{the role of}} demand non-homotheticity with respect to both per-capita income and country size in better understanding some observed patterns in trade data. Motivated by the systematic relationship between consumer preferences of domestic production over imports and the pattern of industry structural transformation, the final chapter constructs a theoretical model between two trading partners with different skilled labor endowments. The theory incorporates relative preferences, sectoral productivity and structural change within a unified framework and generates stylized predictions on industrial transformation that are consistent with the observed data...|$|E

A university of applied sciences as one component of such an environment should be able to influence the innovation behaviour of enterprises positively, although those universities traditionally are noticed as educational institutions.

The flexibility will be the higher, the higher the qualification level of employees is. The last aspect of universities of applied science in opposite to (ordinary) universities is their stronger regional orientation.

40|$|China’s unique {{approach}} to the market economy during its transitional phase has provoked widespread interest among researchers. While the Western literature can certainly not be directly applied under Chinese economic conditions, it offers important theoretical grounds on which we can build our understanding of different behaviour of firms and banks in China. In the first chapter, we employ {{a unique set of}} data on financial information of over 6, 000 firms and study the lending pattern of banks in China at a firm level. We find that in addition to common factors such as profitability, size, and credit history, state ownership is highly correlated with banks’ lending decision;the evidence is consistent with the existence of soft budget constraint. The debate over whether such lending bias is caused by the supply side (banks) leads us to the second chapter. We examine and compare investment behaviour of firms under different ownership, with a focus on investment to cash flow sensitivity, using financial and accounting data on over 1, 700 listed firms in China. We find opposite effects of cash flow on firms when sample is split between different ownership, with privately owned firms showing a higher sensitivity of investment to cash flow. This result enables us to establish that the cause of lending bias and soft budget constraint in China is indeed a <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> We also find that such sensitivity is positively correlated with firm size and age, but not related to Tobin’q, which we interpret as indicating the lack of market value information about firms in China. Institutional development in the sense of enhancement of the effectiveness of the market is widely viewed as the core to economic reform in transition economies. As privately owned firms generally outperform their state owned counterparts (see Estrin et al. 2009), we study the impact of regional institutions on total factor productivity (TFP) of firms under different ownership. We find that the quality of institutions is highly correlated with firms’ TFP, and that improving institutions to facilitate business operations is crucial for firms to achieve higher effectiveness and sustainable growth. The results also suggest that urgent reform is needed for the state owned sector in China...|$|E

In the empirical study of user modifications to kite-surfing equipment, it was found that both components independently contribute to identifying commercially attractive user innovations. Component 1, the high expected-benefits dimension, predicts innovation likelihood, and component 2, the ahead of the trend dimension, predicts both the commercial attractiveness of a given set of user-developed innovations and innovation likelihood due to a newly proposed innovation <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> It was concluded that the component variables in the lead-user definition are indeed independent dimensions, so neither can be dropped without loss of information¿an important matter for lead-user theory. It also was found that adding measures of users' local resources can improve the ability of the lead-user construct to identify commercially attractive innovations under some conditions. The findings reported here have practical as well as theoretical import. Product modification and development has been found to be a relatively common user behavior in many fields. Thus, from 10 to nearly 40 percent of users report having modified or developed a product for in-house use in the case of industrial products or for personal use in the case of consumer products in fields sampled to date. As a practical matter, therefore, it is important to find ways to selectively identify the user innovations that manufacturers will find to be the basis for commercially attractive products in the collectivity of user-developed innovations. The implications of these findings for theory as well as for practical applications of the lead-user construct are discussed - that is, how variables used in lead-user studies can profitably be adapted to fit specific study contexts and purposes.

40|$|A two sector {{model of}} the Irish economy is used to analyse whether either {{temporarily}} or permanently deferring reductions in labour tax rates would cut inflation in the short run. If the deferral of tax cuts is seen as permanent, simulations indicate the demand reduction caused by the higher tax rate may outweigh the reduction in supply causing prices to fall. If the deferral of tax cuts is seen as temporary the <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> dominate and the price level will rise as long as labour 2 ̆ 7 s share of non-traded output is higher than labour 2 ̆ 7 s share of traded output. This indicates that the argument being made by some economists that reductions in income tax should be temporarily deferred to curb inflation may be misguided...|$|R
40|$|The 1990 s were an {{extraordinary}} {{period for the}} US economy, both because of declining budget deficits and beginning budget surpluses, {{as well as for}} high rates of economic growth. This paper confronts the conventional wisdom that high growth rates caused budget improvements, and claims that budget consolidations also contributed to foster economic growth. We propose the existence of a non-Keynesian effect, where fiscal policy runs in contrast to Keynesian theory and a fiscal consolidation can foster economic growth. We present empirical evidence that an increase in tax revenues reduces the distortionary bias of future taxation and therefore leads to an increase in consumer confidence and consumption. Two <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> were proposed. A reduction in transfers reduced labor market pressures and government savings provided liquidity for financial markets which both increased incentives to invest. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of economic theory on labour supply and discusses factors that can affect the labour supply decision including financial and non-financial benefits or disincentives, individual or household characteristics and labour demand. This review found relatively few research papers on the labour supply responses to increases in minimum and otherwise low wages, both in Australia and internationally. Findings from empirical studies reviewed were ambiguous and varied in their methodology. Some population subgroups {{have been found to be}} more responsive to wage changes, such as females (particularly partnered females), and these subgroups are also more likely to be award-reliant and therefore more likely to respond to minimum wage changes. More research is needed to better understand the <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> of an increase in minimum wages.
