50|$|Councilman Tommy Carcetti hosts {{his public}} <b>safety</b> <b>sub-committee</b> meeting with Acting Commissioner Ervin Burrell and Deputy Commissioner William Rawls. He is {{concerned}} that the impressive reduction in crime from the Western district may be a misrepresentation and Burrell tries to reassure him {{that it is a}} statistical aberration. Carcetti moves on to the witness protection problems the city has been having and Burrell tells him there is no funding. Carcetti lays into Burrell despite urging from Councilman Anthony Gray to hold back. Theresa D'Agostino leaves the meeting because Carcetti has ignored her advice to save the witness protection program as ammunition for his campaign. At a dinner with Carcetti and his wife, D'Agostino chastises Carcetti for his short-sightedness in using facts to win arguments instead of inspiring people and urges him to be more likeable. D'Agostino arranges for Carcetti to get coaching in improving his demeanor.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this technical note is to document {{the details of the}} infrastructure development process that was realized at the A 0 photo injector facility to establish RF cold testing capability for 1. 3 GHz superconducting niobium single cell cavities. The activity began the last quarter of CY 2006 and ended the first quarter of CY 2009. The whole process involved addressing various aspects such as design of vertical insert and lifting fixture, modification of existing RF test station and design of new couplers, development of a Temperature Mapping (T-Map) system, radiation considerations for the test location (north cave), update of existing High Pressure Rinse (HPR) system, preparation of necessary safety documents and eventually obtaining an Operational Readiness Clearance (ORC). Figure 1 illustrates the various components of the development process. In the past, the north cave test station at A 0 has supported the cold testing 3. 9 GHz nine cell and single cell cavities, thus some of the components were available for use and some needed modification. The test dewar had the capacity to accommodate 1. 3 GHz single cells although a new vertical insert that could handle both cavity types (1. 3 and 3. 9 GHz) had to be designed. The existing cryogenic system with an average capacity of {approx} 0. 5 g/sec was deemed sufficient. The RF system was updated with broadband components and an additional amplifier with higher power capacity to handle higher gradients usually achieved in 1. 3 GHz cavities. The initial testing phase was arbitrated to proceed with fixed power coupling. A new temperature mapping system was developed to provide the diagnostic tool for hot spot studies, quench characterization and field emission studies. The defining feature of this system was the use of diode sensors instead of the traditional carbon resistors as sensing elements. The unidirectional current carrying capacity (forward bias) of the diodes provided for the ease of multiplexing of the system, thus substantially reducing the number of cables required to power the sensors. The high gradient capacity of the 1. 3 GHz cavities required a revision of the radiation shielding and interlocks. The cave was updated as per the recommendations of the radiation safety committee. The high pressure rinse system was updated with new adapters to assist the rinsing 1. 3 GHz single cell cavities. Finally, a proposal for cold testing 1. 3 GHz single cell cavities at A 0 north cave was made to the small experiments approval committee, radiation safety committee and the Tevatron cryogenic <b>safety</b> <b>sub-committee</b> for an operational readiness clearance and the same was approved. The project was classified under research and development of single cell cavities (project 18) and was allocated a budget of $ 200, 000 in FY 2007...|$|E
500|$|After {{approving}} {{the list of}} resolutions, delegates created a seven-member central committee to convene future meetings. [...] The central committee would be based in San Felipe [...] "for the purpose of circulating information of events of importance to {{the interest of the}} people".

40|$|AbstractObjectivesInvolving {{patients}} {{and the public}} in patient safety is seen as central to health reform internationally. In England, NHS Foundation Trusts are seen as one way to achieve inclusive governance by involving local communities. We analysed these arrangements by studying lay governor involvement in the formal governance structures to improve patient safety. MethodsInterviews with key informants, observations of meetings and documentary analysis were conducted at a case study site. A national survey was conducted with all acute Foundation Trusts (n= 90), with {{a response rate of}} 40 % (n= 36). Follow up telephone interviews were conducted with seven of these. ResultsThe case-study revealed a complex governance context for patient safety involving board, <b>safety</b> and various <b>sub-committees.</b> Governors were mainly not involved in these formal mechanisms, with participation being seen to pose a conflict of interest with the governorsâ€™ role. Findings from the survey showed some involvement of governors in the governance of patient safety. ConclusionsThis study revealed a lack of inclusivity by Foundation Trusts of lay governors in patient safety governance. It suggests action is needed to empower governors to undertake their statutory duties more effectively and particularly through clarification of their role and the provision of targeted training and support to facilitate their involvement in the governance of patient safety...|$|R
