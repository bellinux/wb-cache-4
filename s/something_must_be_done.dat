5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1930 season, Jardine was offered the vice-captaincy of Surrey. He was unable to accept owing to business commitments and played just nine matches for the season, scoring 402 runs at an average of 36.54 and managing one century and one fifty. He was never in the running for Test selection that season, although his presence may have been missed as the English batting was unreliable in the Tests. Christopher Douglas argues that had Jardine been playing regularly, he would have been made captain for the final Test, when Chapman was dropped in favour of the sounder batsman Bob Wyatt. The sensation of the Test series was Donald Bradman, who dominated the English bowling to score 974 runs with unprecedented speed and certainty, making the English selectors realise that <b>something</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to address his skill. With Bradman at the fore, Australia regained the Ashes 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The next era of Kīlauea's history {{began with}} the {{establishment}} of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano's rim in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar, head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; after witnessing the devastation of the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy, he declared that <b>something</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to support systematic volcanic and seismic study, and chose Kīlauea as the site of the first such establishment. After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii, Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes. After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Park Service, before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kīlauea's caldera.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{locomotive}} accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures {{will start to}} generate a counter-electromotive force (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose {{the output of the}} main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, {{the locomotive}} will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, <b>something</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as [...] "transition," [...] a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.|$|E

2500|$|In 1883, Layton and Alexander Mitchell {{were given}} a {{farewell}} dinner at the Milwaukee Club on a Monday evening to celebrate their upcoming departure to Europe. After a toast to their safe journey, Layton commented that <b>something</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to build an art gallery {{for the city of}} Milwaukee. Word spread quickly and Layton was called on the next day by a newspaper reporter, enquiring how soon he planned to build an art gallery. Layton told him “to say but little about it since the whole matter was yet but an intention.” [...] Instead, the Milwaukee Sentinel reported that Layton “was now going abroad and intends studying the architecture and management of art institutes while there and hoped to pick up some information that would be of value in the construction of a model building here.” By Sunday, the New York Times reported that Layton “stated definitely that on his return from Europe he will give the city a fine art building.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The spark {{generation}} {{story is a}} little more complicated. The purpose of the ignition coil is to make a spark that jumps the spark plug's gap, which might be [...] (it also has to jump the rotor-to-distributor-post gap). At the moment the points open, there is a much smaller gap, say about , across the points. <b>Something</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to prevent the points from arcing as they separate; if the points arc, then they will drain the magnetic energy that was intended for the spark plug. The capacitor (condenser) performs that task. The capacitor temporarily keeps the primary current flowing so the voltage across the points is below the point's arcing voltage. There is a race: the voltage across the points is increasing as the primary current charges the capacitor, {{but at the same time}} the points' separation (and consequent arcing voltage) is increasing. Ultimately, the point separation will increase to something such as , the maximum separation of the points.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, {{health and}} safety {{legislation}} is drawn up and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HASAWA). [...] HASAWA introduced (section 2) a general duty on an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; {{with the intention of}} giving a legal framework supporting 'codes of practice' not in themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what was reasonably practicable (deviations from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment). [...] The previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change, leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated. [...] HSE has continued to make some regulations giving absolute duties (where <b>something</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with no 'reasonable practicability' test) but in the UK the regulatory trend is away from prescriptive rules, and towards 'goal setting' and risk assessment. Recent major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace the concept of risk assessment. The other key aspect of the UK legislation is a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected {{health and safety}} representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar approach in Scandinavia, and that approach has since been adopted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia, for example.|$|E
