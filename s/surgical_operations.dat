5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But since they were treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|One of his {{students}} in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the Jewish faith in Ulysses came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce. While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

5|$|Schweitzer {{had prior}} {{interest}} in nursing {{and the medical}} field before Albert became involved in medicine. Therefore, Schweitzer played {{a vital role in}} his work, acting as a possible influence. In the first nine months, Schweitzer and Albert had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In her time in Africa, she worked as nurse and helped with the hospital. She played an essential part in sanitation efforts, especially by preparing medical equipment for surgery. Schweitzer was an anaesthetist for <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{results from}} {{breathing}} gases under elevated pressure, {{and may be}} classified by the principal gas involved. The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function, but their effect on psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity) varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a diminution of mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and xenon has so much anesthetic activity {{that it is a}} usable anesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure. Xenon has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice, but it has been successfully used for <b>surgical</b> <b>operations,</b> and xenon anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed.|$|E

25|$|Subsequent {{research}} in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as Frederick Banting's {{research in}} dogs, which {{determined that the}} isolates of pancreatic secretion {{could be used to}} treat dogs with diabetes. This led to the 1922 discovery of insulin (with John Macleod) and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. John Cade's research in guinea pigs discovered the anticonvulsant properties of lithium salts, which revolutionized the treatment of bipolar disorder, replacing the previous treatments of lobotomy or electroconvulsive therapy. Modern general anaesthetics, such as halothane and related compounds, were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
25|$|Schweitzer's wife, Helene Schweitzer, was an {{anaesthetist}} for <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b> After briefly {{occupying a}} shed formerly {{used as a}} chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were built, like native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking Galoa (Mpongwe) who first came as a patient.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatments}} {{date back}} to the prehistoric era. The oldest for which there is evidence is trepanation, in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the skull, thus exposing the dura mater in order to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. Prehistoric surgical techniques are seen in Ancient Egypt, where a mandible dated to approximately 2650 BC shows two perforations just below the root of the first molar, indicating the draining of an abscessed tooth. Surgical texts from ancient Egypt date back about 3500 years ago. <b>Surgical</b> <b>operations</b> were performed by priests, specialized in medical treatments similar to today, and used sutures to close wounds. Infections were treated with honey.|$|E

25|$|By January 2002 Lightfoot {{had written}} 30 new songs {{for his next}} studio album. He {{recorded}} guitar and vocal demos {{of some of these}} new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in Orillia, Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to McMaster Medical Centre in Hamilton, Ontario. He underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Lightfoot endured a six-week coma and a tracheotomy, and he underwent four <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b> All of his remaining 2002 concert dates were cancelled. More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.|$|E
25|$|Henry Hill Hickman (1800–1830) {{experimented with}} the use of carbon dioxide as an {{anesthetic}} in the 1820s. He would make the animal insensible, effectively via almost suffocating it with carbon dioxide, then determine the effects of the gas by amputating one of its limbs. In 1824, Hickman submitted the results of his research to the Royal Society in a short treatise titled Letter on suspended animation: with the view of ascertaining its probable utility in <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> on human subjects. The response was an 1826 article in The Lancet titled 'Surgical Humbug' that ruthlessly criticised his work. Hickman died four years later at age 30. Though he was unappreciated {{at the time of his}} death, his work has since been positively reappraised and he is now recognised as one of the fathers of anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{about whether or not}} Ibn al-Nafis participated in {{dissection}} to come to his conclusions about pulmonary circulation. Although he states in his writings that he was prevented from practicing dissection because of his beliefs, other scholars have noted that al-Nafis must have either practiced dissection or seen a human heart in order to come to his conclusions. According to one view, his knowledge about the human heart could have been derived from <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> rather than dissection. Other comments found in al-Nafis’s writings such as dismissing earlier observations with a reference to dissection as proof, however, support the view that he practiced dissection in order to come to his conclusions about the human heart and pulmonary circulation. Ibn al-Nafis’s comments to the contrary and the alternate explanations, however, keep his possible practice of dissection in question.|$|E

The pains were more pronounced at night and with ingestion of food. A mass of about 10 cm was palpable at the epigaster region. The patient underwent the <b>surgical</b> <b>operation</b> and pathologic findings indicated pancreatoblastoma. Results: Pancreatoblastoma, although is a malignant tumor, with early diagnosis and with prompt <b>surgical</b> <b>operation,</b> half of children recover fully...|$|R
25|$|Lister {{continued}} to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection {{could be better}} avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led {{to the rise of}} sterile surgery. Lister instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands in 5% carbolic solution before and after operations, and had surgical instruments washed in the same solution. He also introduced the steam steriliser to sterilize equipment. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward <b>surgical</b> <b>operations,</b> the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} the official university lectures, but complained that most were stupid and boring, {{and found himself}} too sensitive {{to the sight of}} blood. He was disgusted by the dull and outdated anatomy lectures of professor Alexander Monro tertius, and later regretted his failure to persevere and learn dissection. Munro's lectures included vehement opposition to George Combe's daringly materialist ideas of phrenology. As the exception to the general dullness, the spectacular chemistry lectures of Thomas Charles Hope were greatly enjoyed by the brothers, but they did not join a student society giving hands-on experience. Darwin regularly attended clinical wards in the hospital despite his great distress about some of the cases, but could only bear to attend <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> twice, rushing away before they were completed due to his distress at the brutality of surgery before anaesthetics. He was long haunted by the memory, particularly of an operation on a child.|$|E
25|$|The 224th {{commanded}} by Lieutenant-Colonel D.H. Thompson {{was divided into}} groups for the landings. The commanding officer and sixty-five men who were to establish the Main Dressing Station (MDS) travelled in the same aircraft as brigade headquarters, while Nos 1, 2 and 3 Sections were attached to the 1st Canadian, 8th and 9th parachute battalions. Arriving in Normandy from around 01:00, many of the unit landed {{too far to the}} east in the flooded marshes beside the River Dives. One of those men was the commanding officer who then spent three weeks trying to rejoin the unit from behind German lines before being captured. The members of the 224th who landed on the correct drop zone proceeded to set up their Main Dressing Station in a farm at Le Mesnil. By noon, around two thirds of the 22nd were still missing, but the MDS had managed to treat fifty-five wounded and conduct ten <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
