50|$|The 1962 <b>Stock</b> <b>units</b> were {{virtually}} {{identical to the}} earlier 1959 <b>Stock</b> <b>units,</b> which were built for the Piccadilly line, although a number or improvements were introduced {{as a result of}} experience with the earlier trains. The major improvement was the use of motor alternators for the auxiliary supplies using static rectification, instead of the motor generator sets.

5000|$|With Canadian {{involvement}} in Afghanistan, Diemaco and the Canadian Forces have developed {{improvements to the}} C7A1 to better suit the operational situations at hand. The result, the C7A2, has a four-point telescoping <b>stock</b> <b>unit</b> {{similar to that of}} the C8 carbine and a 3-rail TRI-AD I mount on the front sight triangle. The selector lever, magazine release, and charging handle latch are ambidextrous. Also, the C7A2 is issued with green colour furniture as standard. These weapons are often seen with a similar plethora of accessories as their American counterparts given the overall commonalities of the system and the rail mounts. The C7A2 is also issued with the C79A2 ELCAN optical gunsight with 3.4× magnification but with a uniform green rubber armored coating, but some soldiers who are issued it have either been issued or have purchased sights like the EOTech holographic weapons sight and the Trijicon ACOG. Within an eight-man section, six soldiers will normally carry a C7A2: the section commander and second in command, two grenadiers and two riflemen, with only the machine gunners carrying a C9A2 LMG. The C7A2 is considered a [...] "mid-life" [...] upgrade for the C7 family. The addition of the TRI-AD rail mount has made it easier for soldiers to attach accessories such as laser designators and tac lights.|$|E
5000|$|First {{introduced}} in September 2002, ZipZaps were an instant success {{and one of}} the most popular gifts of the holiday season in North America, with RadioShack stores often selling out of the starter kits. They were referred to as [...] "micro R/C" [...] due to their diminutive size. At around 1:64 scale, ZipZaps were only slightly larger than popular die-cast toy cars such as Hot Wheels and Matchbox.ZipZaps were unique among toy-style micro R/C vehicles in that they could be customized much like large R/C models. Each partially assembled ZipZaps kit included a pre-assembled chassis with built-in nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries on which the gears, tires and hubcaps could be changed for better appearance and performance. Five motors and three gear ratios were offered, ranging from the 16,000 rpm <b>stock</b> <b>unit</b> to the high-speed 34,000 rpm [...] "NX" [...] (named after a popular brand of nitrous oxide). Gear ratios were 12:1 [...] "stock", 9.86:1 [...] "performance" [...] and 8.25:1 [...] "turbo". Tracking was adjusted via a wheel alignment lever underneath the vehicles themselves. The vehicle's on-board battery was charged by snapping the entire car onto the top of the transmitter. Full charge was accomplished in about 40 to 60 seconds with run times averaging five minutes. Neither steering nor throttle was proportional, with both functions either full on or full off. The SE series added semi-proportional, two-speed throttle and fully proportional rack-and-pinion steering with steering trim adjustable at the transmitter, as with a full-sized R/C.|$|E

40|$|An {{essential}} prerequisite {{of sustainable}} fisheries is the match between biologically relevant processes and management action.

40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of possums as competitors with livestock for pasture is sometimes used as justification for possum control. Unfortunately a confusion of {{wet and dry}} weight values of pasture and daily consumption by possums appears to {{have resulted in a}} significant overestimate of the economic costs of possums as pasture pests. A correctly estimated daily dry matter intake of pasture by possums is 0. 0144 kg pasture dry matter per possum per day. For a possum density of 1 ha – 1, this amounts to a reduction of about 1 % of a <b>stock</b> <b>unit</b> ha – 1 year – 1. At higher possum densities, which often occur on farms adjacent to forest or scrub, losses would be correspondingly higher. A more direct way to measure possum impact on pasture production would be to use exclosures. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E
