40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} the operational characteristics of <b>spliced</b> portable power <b>cables.</b> This research had a dual purpose: (1) {{to determine the}} thermal and mechanical performance of repaired trailing cables and compare them with undamaged cables and (2) to gauge the impact of long-term, localized heating on the insulating and jacketing materials contained in <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> kits accepted or approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. The ranges of splice joint resistance and tensile breaking strength were determined from laboratory measurements. The choice of crimping tools affected {{the strength of the}} splice under tension. Thermal profiles of energized <b>spliced</b> <b>cables</b> were constructed, which showed that spliced conductor joints operated 5 to 2020 C hotter than the intact cable at rated currents. Accelerated life tests of thermally aged samples of splice kit insulation and jacket materials confirmed a deficiency in the thermal rating of the insulating tape. The recommendations in this report may be utilized to revise splice kit design, splice kit approval criteria, and trailing cable loading guidelines. Characterizing the thermal operating limits of <b>spliced</b> trailing <b>cables</b> may help to minimize the associated risks from explosions, fires, personnel burns, and shock...|$|R

50|$|The rising {{demand for}} these fiber-optic cables outpaced the {{capacity}} of providers such as AT&T. Having to shift traffic to satellites resulted in poorer quality signals. To address this issue, AT&T had to improve its cable laying abilities. It invested $100 million in producing two specialized fiber-optic cable laying vessels. These included laboratories in the ships for <b>splicing</b> <b>cable</b> and testing its electrical properties. Such field monitoring is important because the glass of fiber-optic cable is less malleable than the copper cable that had been formerly used. The ships are equipped with thrusters that increase maneuverability. This capability is important because fiber-optic cable must be laid straight from the stern (another factor copper cable laying ships {{did not have to}} contend with).|$|R

40|$|As the {{high-voltage}} {{power cable}} insulation material growing worse, the aged insulation material can cause serious power supply problems. Most of the damages {{can be found}} in <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> and <b>cable</b> terminators. This article mainly aims at developing the inspection methods for cable joints problem.

To speak from the degree of sensibility, the impulse current method has the best sensibility, while the capacitive coupler and AE methods are less sensible. To speak from the noise-resist ability, it is contrary to the degree of sensibility. The impulse method is prone to be interrupted by noise. To speak from the PD signal source location ability, the AE method is better than the other two methods. 1...|$|R
