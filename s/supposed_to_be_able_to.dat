5|$|Plants {{including}} {{trees are}} important in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may {{be more or less}} magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E

25|$|While, as {{with any}} sort of folklore, the details may vary, this {{particular}} tale (Bloody Mary) encouraged young women to walk {{up a flight of}} stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant that they were destined to die before they married.|$|E
50|$|A flying submarine, {{submersible}} aircraft or aerosub is {{a combination}} of a seaplane and a submarine. It <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> both <b>to</b> fly and to travel under water. Starting from the surface of water is also intended.|$|R

25|$|Since the 2000–01 season, the SM-liiga {{has been}} closed, meaning that relegations and {{promotions}} take place {{only by the}} judgment {{of the board of the}} SM-liiga. The only such promotion took place instantly in 2000. Without the threat of relegation, the weaker clubs were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> recuperate and improve. This had, however, a side effect: clubs with a losing record that had lost their hopes of reaching the playoffs often disposed of high-salary star players, letting down their supporters. To counteract this, the playoffs were expanded to the best 10 clubs each season from among the 13 total in the league.|$|E
25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a €300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have {{a chilling effect on}} the development of free software in France, since any modern desktop system is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> read music and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges.|$|E
25|$|In {{military}} studies {{concerning the}} deployment of nuclear weapons, Swedish plans focused on bombs dropped by ground-attack aircraft. The Swedes planned to have {{a relatively small number}} of tactical nuclear weapons; the Saab 36 bomber was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> carry an 800kg free falling nuclear weapon, but development of the aircraft was cancelled in 1957. Thus, it was the Air Force's most modern fighter-bomber that was intended to carry nuclear weapons as well as other weaponry. Had the program followed its original schedule, the Saab A32 Lansen would have been the relevant platform. According to the revised schedule in which nuclear weapons would have appeared first in the 1970s, the AJ 37 Viggen would have also been relevant.|$|E

A simulation step <b>is</b> generally performed <b>to</b> verify that the expected generated deviations fit with these requirements. It <b>is</b> then necessary <b>to</b> assess the actual deviations of the process in progress. This is usually done by the verification of the conformity of the workpiece to manufacturing tolerances {{at the end of}} each set-up. It <b>is</b> thus necessary <b>to</b> determine these manufacturing tolerances. This step is called "manufacturing tolerance synthesis". In this paper, a numerical method <b>is</b> proposed <b>to</b> perform 3 D manufacturing tolerances synthesis. This method uses the result of the numerical analysis of tolerances to determine influent mall displacement of surfaces. These displacements are described by small displacements torsors.

25|$|The {{idea for}} a stadium at Delta Park in Portland, Oregon, was started by a {{development}} group {{in the summer of}} 1963. They looked at building a domed stadium, similar to the Harris County Domed Stadium in Houston, Texas which was being constructed at the time. Plans were made for a 46,000 seat facility that could be expanded to 80,000 or possibly 100,000. Architects drew up plans for a 17,000 vehicle parking lot. The ceiling of the dome was going to be made from plexi-glass, which would add natural light. The plexi-glass was also <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> open for ventilation and an open-air feel. If it was approved, the dome was said to be ready to open by 1968. It was estimated to cost US$25 million (US$ million adjusted for inflation).|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Gatski arrived in Bowling Green, he had {{acquired}} the nickname [...] "Gunner" [...] for {{his strength and}} speed on the offensive line. Growing up in the rough surroundings of a West Virginia mining town had toughened him up, {{and he did not}} mind Cleveland coach Paul Brown's overbearing perfectionism. As a professional, he later said, [...] "you're <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take that crap." [...] Initially, Gatski's prospects of making the team looked dim. Brown had brought in veteran center Mo Scarry to be the starter. But Gatski proved his value to the team with his reliability and work ethic. He made the team and signed a $3,000 per year contract.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the title}} of this game was [...] "Romancing SaGa 4" [...] during early development. In that stage of development, two more heroes' quests were also being planned, in {{addition}} to the existing seven lead characters. One of them was Fuse, the IRPO agent who may be enlisted as a playable character in the actual release. In his quest, Fuse was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take part in other characters' scenarios, and the ultimate goal of his quest might be determined by what the player did in the course of gameplay. The [...] "ninth" [...] protagonist was to be the daughter of a channellers family who is engaging in a controversy as to who of them shall inherit the property of their former patriarch. This scenario seems to be dropped during the early development because of being too comedic.|$|E

2500|$|Some more {{advanced}} flying saucers capable of spaceflight have been proposed, often as black projects by aeronautics companies. The Lenticular Reentry Vehicle {{was a secret}} project run by Convair for a saucer device which could carry both astronauts and nuclear weapons into orbit; the nuclear-powered system was planned in depth, but <b>is</b> not believed <b>to</b> have ever flown. More exotically, British Rail worked on plans for the British Rail [...] "Space Vehicle" [...] a proposed, saucer-shaped craft based on so far undiscovered technologies such as nuclear fusion and superconductivity, which <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> transport multiple passenger between planets, but never went beyond the patent stage.|$|R
30|$|Second, the mono-objective {{approach}} considers in {{the same}} objective function, {{the cost of a}} jockey (cStaff) and the cost of a rejected demand (cRejectFull and cRejectEmpty); this latter which {{can be seen as the}} carsharing price. Hence, it <b>supposes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fix these costs. Despite the importance of the cost parameters, in [18] those costs were left behind for simplicity reason. Setting different cost values will change the entire results of an ILP since we have one objective to optimize. But it should be noted that while cStaff <b>is</b> somehow easy <b>to</b> determine, the cost of a rejected demand <b>is</b> very difficult <b>to</b> evaluate. We can calculate the loss of not satisfying a demand; however, we also have to calculate the negative impact on the image of the service and eventually the risk of not using the service in the future. For these two reasons, using a multiobjective approach can be seen as a powerful alternative to the existing algorithm. In this approach, each objective is treated separately and independently from other objectives. Thus, it <b>is</b> not necessary <b>to</b> take costs into consideration when they are the same for each rejected demand, for each relocation operation and for each jockey. However, if costs were not the same (from one trip to another, from a relocation operation to another, from a jockey to another), it will <b>be</b> necessary <b>to</b> integrate them in the objective functions (for example, weighted objective functions, with non-constant costs, may lead to obtain solutions that prioritize solving rejected demands having high carsharing prices).|$|R
500|$|Holmes drew {{inspiration}} from Inuit beliefs and the Native American languages which are spoken in the area which the bears live. Holmes developed Ujuark's shape-shifting powers after reading up on shamans, who are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> transform into other animals. Holmes liked the idea and decided {{to have one of}} the bears have the same ability, which allowed him to [...] "infiltrate a human community without them guessing the truth." [...] Later, Holmes [...] "needed to establish what sort of beliefs each bear would have," [...] so after finding that bears are closely linked to their environment just like Native Americans, Holmes centered her research around the Natives. The names of the bears are from Native American languages; Lusa means midnight or black in Choctaw, while Kallik means lightning in Inuktitut, Silaluk means storm in Inuktitut, Taqqiq means moon, Toklo means two in Chicksaw, and Ujurak means rock.|$|E
