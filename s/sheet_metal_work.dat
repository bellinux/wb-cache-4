25|$|A major {{controversy}} over the August 4 agreement erupted the day after it was signed. An African American sheet metal worker, Gilbert Foster, began work, which led to rumors that white workers would strike in protest. Despite an emergency meeting by federal and city officials with leaders of Sheet Metal Workers Local 65, 14 white sheet metal workers walked off the job on August 6. The workers argued that Foster was not a union-accredited sheet metal worker, and that union rules required him to work for at least seven days to prove his skills. Paul Ristau, business agent for Local 65, agreed that Foster had not yet become a union member, but said his application was being processed. The UFM threatened to picket if Foster was not employed, so A. Nabakowski Co., the sheet metal contractor, offered to keep Foster {{on the job and}} pay him if he reported to work. The following day, Nabakowski paid Foster to sit in a trailer. Local 65 ordered its men back to work, and 11 of them did so (under protest) on August 7. Foster himself agreed to perform whatever non-work, makework, or <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>work</b> the company wanted, which short-circuited the UFM's demand that he work solely on sheet metal projects.|$|E

The power press is playing major role in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> die manufacturing industry which is more noise generating machine. Several types of noises are observed from the various machines involved in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>works</b> exceeding the OSHA TWA (Time weighted average) standards. Noise induced hearing loss and environment pollutions are the main cause of such kind of industries. Goal of the study is to evaluate the noise level in those small scale industries and suggested to alleviate the noise level and its annoyances to development of safe and healthy work environment for the workers in press tool industries...|$|R
