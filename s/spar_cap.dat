2500|$|As {{competition}} in the wind market increases, companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs. One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters, and thus blade length. Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a system-level redesign. By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems, manufacturers may increase {{the length of the}} blades without increasing their overall weight. For instance, the <b>spar</b> <b>cap,</b> a structural element of a turbine blade, commonly experiences high tensile loading, making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced tensile properties of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber. Higher stiffness and lower density translates to thinner, lighter blades offering equivalent performance. [...] In a 10-MW turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blade lengths may reach over 100 m and weigh up to 50 metric tons when fabricated out of glass fiber. A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent, or approximately 15 metric tons. [...] The compressive properties of carbon fiber do not differ significantly from those of glass fiber. [...] It is therefore economical to replace glass fiber components under compression with carbon fiber components. [...] Improving performance through weight reductions rather than increasing scale also has advantages in transportation. [...] The size of a wind turbine, its blades and tower, are all limited by the height and width clearances, and turning radius, of the route used to transport the components to the installation site. The scale of these pieces has in some cases forced the adoption of Schnabel trailers.|$|E

50|$|Wood {{wing spars}} of multipiece {{construction}} usually consist of {{upper and lower}} members, called <b>spar</b> <b>caps,</b> and vertical sheet wood members, known as shear webs or more simply webs, that span {{the distance between the}} <b>spar</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1979, Morry Hummel, {{who worked in the}} Curtis Wright {{experimental}} department during World War II, purchased the plans for Gary Watson’s Windwagon and the development of the [...] "Hummel Bird" [...] began. Because of the weather in Hummel's state of Ohio, a canopy was needed. The horizontal stabilizer attach construction was redesigned. The seat back was raised 5 inches so a shoulder harness could be added, and the instrument panel was raised 2 inches, increasing fuel capacity and leg room. The wing was completely re-engineered. The dihedral break on the Windwagon was in the middle; Morry made the center wing section straight and put the dihedral break {{at the point where the}} outer wing panels bolt to the center section. The Hummel Bird spar is built up of 1/8 6061-t6 aluminum angle spar caps, with a [...]040, 2024-t3 spar web. The <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> angles are doubled in the center section, and tapered in the outer panels. The number of ribs was increased, the thickness of the skin was reduced, and the skins get even thinner toward the tips. The ribs are now a two piece design with one in front of the spar(nose rib) and one between the spars(main rib). The skins are riveted to the spars leaving no bump where the one piece ribs previously pushed the skin up where it crossed the spar. Both the Teenie Two and the Windwagon had tricycle landing gear, however, Morry preferred conventional landing gear so taildragger gear became a popular option. There were other changes as well, compromising a significant improvement over the wind wagon. He finished his project in July 1980. In July 1982, the plane was featured in an article written by Jack Cox, of Sport Aviation. Jack dubbed Morry’s new creation the “Hummel Bird” and the name stuck.|$|E

Wind turbine blade on box-section beams girder is calculated by ply thickness, main girder and trailing edge. In this study, a realistic 30 [*]m blade from a 1. 2 [*]MW wind turbine model of blade girder parameters is established. The optimization evolves a structure which transforms {{along the length of}} the blade, changing from a design with <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> at the maximum thickness and a trailing edge mass to a design with <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> toward the tip. In addition, the cross-section structural properties and the modal characteristics of a 62 [*]m rotor blade were predicted by the developed beam finite element.

40|$|The {{buckling}} {{resistance is}} a key design driver for large wind turbine blades with a significant influence on the material costs. During the structural design process the choice was made for carbon spar caps and two shear webs, which were set relatively far apart in order to stabilize the panels. This design presented a major challenge for {{the stability of the}} spar caps. The topology of these spar caps has been modified with regard to stability, comparing a continuous <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> with split <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> concepts and considering both lay-ups with hybrid carbon glass spar caps or sandwich concepts. Within those concepts, parametric studies were conducted varying different geometrical parameters of the spar caps and its layups. In order to determine the buckling resistance of the <b>spar</b> <b>cap,</b> an analytical model considering a 2 D cross section discretized blade model was utilized to select the basic concept, after which a 3 D numerical finite element model taking the whole blade into account was used to evaluate the chosen design concepts.

40|$|In this paper, the {{sensitivity}} of the structural integrity of wind turbine blades to debonding of the shear web from the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> was investigated. In this regard, modal analysis, static and fatigue testing were performed on a 45. 7 m blade for three states of the blade: (i) as received blade (ii) when a crack of 200 mm was introduced between the web and the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> and (iii) when the crack was extended to 1000 mm. Calibration pull-tests for all three states of the blade were performed to obtain the strain-bending moment relationship of the blade according to the estimated target bending moment (BM) which the blade is expected to experience in its service life. The resultant data was used to apply appropriate load in the fatigue tests. The blade natural frequencies in flapwise and edgewise directions over a range of frequency domain were found by modal testing for all three states of the blade. The blade first natural frequency for each state was used for the flapwise fatigue tests. These were performed in accordance with technical specification IEC TS 61400 - 23. The fatigue results showed that, for a 200 mm crack between the web and <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> at 9 m from the blade root, the crack did not propagate at 50 % of the target BM up to 62, 110 cycles. However, when the load was increased to 70 % of target BM, some damages were detected on the pressure side of the blade. When the 200 mm crack was extended to 1000 mm, the crack began to propagate when the applied load exceeded 100 % of target BM and the blade experienced delaminations, adhesive joint failure, compression failure and sandwich core failure...|$|E

The CX- 100 blade was designed to investigate {{the use of a}} carbon <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> to reduce weight and increase stiffness while being incorporated using conventional manufacturing techniques. The TX- 100 blade used carbon in the outboard portion of the skin to produce twist-bend coupling to passively alleviate aerodynamic loads. In the fatigue tests, the CX- 100 blade was loaded by a single hydraulic cylinder while the TX- 100 blade was loaded via a hydraulically-actuated resonant loading system called the Universal Resonant Exciter. The blades were outfitted with approximately 30 strain gages as well as displacement and load sensors. Both blades survived to cycle counts sufficient to demonstrate a 20 -year operational life. The CX- 100 blade failed at approximately 1. 6 million cycles because of a buckle and crack that formed and grew just outboard of max-chord.
