5|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{event was}} {{proposed for the}} anniversary, the Moulin à paroles. Thousands gathered on the Plains of Abraham to listen to recitations of 140 significant texts from Quebec history, including the 1970 FLQ Manifesto. The inclusion of that document in the event led to condemnations and a boycott from federalist politicians and the withdrawal of <b>some</b> <b>government</b> funding for the event. The Moulin à paroles took place without incident.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam's Labor {{government}} {{was elected in}} 1972 after 23 years of rule by a coalition formed by the Liberal and Country parties. The ALP Government enjoyed a nine-seat majority in the House of Representatives, but did not control the Senate. In accordance with pre-election promises, it instituted {{a large number of}} policy changes, and offered much legislation. The Opposition, which still controlled the Senate, allowed <b>some</b> <b>Government</b> bills to pass the Senate, and blocked others.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII's health {{began to}} fail {{in the spring}} of 1824. He was {{suffering}} from obesity, gout and gangrene, both dry and wet, in his legs and spine. Louis died on 16 September 1824 surrounded by the extended royal family and <b>some</b> <b>government</b> officials. He was succeeded by his youngest brother, the Count of Artois, as Charles X.|$|E

5|$|Successive Reichsstatthalter decrees between 1933 and 1935 {{effectively}} {{abolished the}} existing Länder (constituent states) of Germany and {{replaced them with}} new administrative divisions, the Gaue, headed by NSDAP leaders (Gauleiters), who effectively became the governor of their respective regions. The change was never fully implemented, as the Länder were still used as administrative divisions for <b>some</b> <b>government</b> departments such as education. This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the administrative style of the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|Considering that he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, Kanō's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in <b>some</b> <b>government</b> ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws (jinrikisha) right to {{the doors of the}} classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The teachers often felt compelled to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants.|$|E
5|$|Electric vehicle {{warning sounds}} are {{a series of}} sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by <b>some</b> <b>government</b> regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can {{make it more difficult for}} pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.|$|E

5|$|Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance produced days of prolonged {{rainfall and}} gusty winds across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Localized flooding and rough sea conditions caused extensive road damage, infrastructure failures, and some beach erosion along coastlines. During {{the passage of}} the storm, numerous residents were left without water and power, and a state of emergency was declared for several Caribbean nations. Schools, businesses and <b>some</b> <b>government</b> offices across all of the Virgin Islands and Saint Kitts and Nevis were closed until storm conditions abated. The weather system ultimately accounted for substantial monetary losses throughout these areas, pinned at over $22million (2010USD). In addition, Otto was widely {{regarded as one of the}} wettest storms in the history of the northeastern Caribbean, repeatedly shattering various rainfall records.|$|E
5|$|Politically {{the city}} was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, which had developed a strong political machine. The Republicans dominated the post-war elections, and corrupt officials {{made their way into}} the government and continued to control the city through voter fraud and intimidation. The Gas Trust was the hub of the city’s political machine. The trust controlled the gas company supplying lighting to the city. With the board under complete control by Republicans in 1865, they awarded contracts and perks for themselves and their cronies. <b>Some</b> <b>government</b> reform did occur during this time. The police department was reorganized; and volunteer fire companies were eliminated and were replaced by a paid fire department. A compulsory school act passed in 1895, and the Public School Reorganization Act freed the city's education from the political machine. Higher education changed as well. The University of Pennsylvania moved to West Philadelphia and reorganized to its modern form; and Temple University, Drexel University and the Free Library were founded.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the plan}} was {{theoretically}} sound, it was ineffective in stimulating economic growth. During Diem's time, there was little meaningful economic investment or development of infrastructure. The businessmen mostly used the import subsidies to purchase consumer goods such as boats, motorbikes, refrigerators, radios, music systems and other similar goods, which were luxuries at the time. The program was thus effective in expanding {{the size of the}} urban middle class, but it did not generate much economic investment. Only a minority of the purchases were of capital goods such as manufacturing equipment and supplies for factory production. As a result, not much of the subsidies created more economic production. The government funds generated from selling importing licenses also became a problem, with corruption and explicit theft dogging its effectiveness as a means of bankrolling the military and civil service. In addition, <b>some</b> <b>government</b> officials would not sell the coveted licenses to the businessmen until a bribe was paid. Another criticism of the CIP was that the funds collected by the government were not used for any significant amount of government-sector economic investment but mainly to fund the army. Diem defended this by stating that national security was paramount.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a network of foreign businessmen in Japan who could be turned into an intelligence network in time of war, it was suggested by his commander, Colonel Burnett, that Mashbir resign his commission and become a businessman in Tokyo himself, {{in order to put}} the M-Plan in effect. Consequently, Mashbir resigned in 1923 to pursue business interests and undercover secret intelligence operations, under the impression that he could be reinstated in the Army when his work was done. However the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923 bankrupted him and, when he sought reinstatement in the military, discovered that it was not possible, because the reinstatement clause of the law under which he had resigned was no longer valid. Neither Mashbir nor Colonel Burnett, who had urged Mashbir to resign, was aware of this, and it become a sticking point for Mashbir in later life, noting that even in 1926 the law was still being reprinted without the correct clause. Consequently, the M-Plan to establish an intelligence network in Japan was scrapped. Mashbir returned to the United States in 1926 under the impression that his military career was over, and sought employment selling refrigerators. He managed to rejoin the Military Intelligence Division G-2 Reserves, but only spent one year in active duty beginning in the summer of 1927 during which time he updated the Order of Battle documentation on Japan. For the next ten years he returned to his original profession of engineering, including <b>some</b> <b>government</b> work on technical standards.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{association is}} an incorporated body of volunteers {{who use the}} fort under licence from the Minister. The association operate the fort and visitor centre, holding monthly public open days at which {{the history of the}} fort is recreated; this includes drill demonstrations and firing of the fort's weapons. The association maintain static displays of the fort's active period and sell souvenirs. The association's goal is to have the site open as a fully operational fort for interpretation, tourism and education. The volunteers are involved with recreation, living history and ceremonial work outside the fort. They act as guards of honour at <b>some</b> <b>Government</b> House functions and attended the restoration opening of the Albany, Western Australia fort, and the annual re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo in Keyneton, Victoria. The fort has living history displays, including the barracks laid out and furnished in period detail. The visitor centre has displays showing the development of South Australia's colonial defence from 1836 and artifacts found on site during restorations.|$|E
