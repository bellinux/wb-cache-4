60|$|Finally, I {{have not}} {{examined}} {{a sufficient number}} <b>of</b> <b>skeletons</b> to say whether any of the foregoing differences, except in the skull, are characteristic of the several breeds. Apparently some differences are more common in certain breeds than in others,--as an additional rib to the fourteenth cervical vertebra in Hamburghs and Games, and {{the breadth of the}} end of the pubic bone in Cochins. Both <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> the Sultan <b>fowl</b> had eight dorsal vertebrae, and the end of the scapula in both was somewhat attenuated. In the skull, the deep medial furrow in the frontal bones and the vertically elongated occipital foramen seem to be characteristic of Cochins; as is the great breadth of the frontal bones in Dorkings; the separation and open spaces between the tips of the ascending branches of the premaxillaries and nasal bones, as well as the front part of the skull being but little depressed, characterise Hamburghs; the globular shape of the posterior part of the skull seems to be characteristic of laced Bantams; and lastly, the protuberance of the skull with the ascending branches of the premaxillaries partially aborted, together with the other differences before specified, are eminently characteristic of Polish and other Crested fowls.|$|R
40|$|The centres of {{ossification}} {{occurring in}} the <b>skeleton</b> <b>of</b> the domestic <b>fowl</b> from hatching onwards have been re-investigated in groups of birds from the same hatches, reared under standardised conditions and sampled at intervals from hatching to 182 days. Selected areas have been surveyed in adult birds. The numerous centres which are already present at hatching have been identified. Those first appearing {{around the time of}} hatching were for the uncinate processes and the phalanx of digit IV. The centres appearing after hatching were those for metacarpal II, four carpal centres, the orbitosphenoid, rostal and caudal basibranchials, epibranchials, entoglossal, proximal tibial centre, patella and tarsal sesamoid. These have been illustrated and the mean time of appearance and range of time of appearance of each calculated. Some evidence of slight variation in sequence of appearance was detected. The proximal tibial centre was concluded to be the only true secondary centre in the long bones and to correspond to the traction epiphysis of this region in the mammal. In adults, the phalangeal formula of the manus was found usually to be 2 : 2 : 1, but occasionally it was reduced to 1 : 2 : 1. The only sesamoidean centre found, other than the patella and the tarsal sesamoid, was in the carpal region and was termed the dorsal carpal sesamoid. Some of the many controversies existing in the previous literature have been assessed {{in the light of the}} findings of this study...|$|R

Significantly (p< 0. 05) lower incidence <b>of</b> <b>Fowl</b> cholera was found in vaccinated (0. 15 ? 0. 26 %) than in non-vaccinated flocks (1. 45 ? 0. 63 %).

60|$|Seven is {{the normal}} number of true ribs, but in two <b>skeletons</b> <b>of</b> the Sultan <b>fowl</b> (in which the fourteenth {{cervical}} vertebra was not furnished with little ribs) {{there were eight}} pairs; the eighth pair seemed to be developed on a vertebra corresponding with the first lumbar in G. bankiva; the sternal portion of both the seventh and eighth ribs did not reach the sternum. In four skeletons in which ribs were developed on the fourteenth cervical vertebra, there were, when these cervical ribs are included, eight pairs; but in one Game cock, in which the fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs, there were only six pairs of true dorsal ribs; the sixth pair in this case did not have processes, and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons; in this Game cock, as far as could be judged from {{the appearance of the}} lumbar vertebrae, a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs was missing. We thus see that the ribs (whether or not the little pair attached to the fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted) vary from six to eight pair. The sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes. The sternal portion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in Cochins, and is completely ossified. As previously stated, it is scarcely possible to count the lumbo-sacral vertebrae; but they certainly do not correspond in shape or number in the several skeletons. The caudal vertebrae are closely similar in all the skeletons, the only difference being whether or not the basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis; they hardly vary even in length, not being shorter in Cochins, with their short tail-feathers, than in other breeds; in a Spanish cock, however, the caudal vertebrae were a little elongated. In three rumpless fowls the caudal vertebrae were few in number, and anchylosed together into a misformed mass.|$|R
