5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>serval</b> is Leptailurus <b>serval.</b> It is the sole member of the genus Leptailurus. The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber as Felis <b>serval.</b> In 1858, Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov proposed the genus name Leptailurus.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, some taxonomists {{inspected}} <b>serval</b> {{skins and}} identified two {{species on the}} basis of coat pattern: Felis <b>serval</b> (<b>serval),</b> with large, pronounced spots, and F. servalina or F. ornata (servaline cat), marked by freckle-sized dots. F. servalina was first described in 1839 by Irish naturalist William Ogilby from Sierra Leone; in 1867, British zoologist John Edward Gray described F. herschelii from an Indian skin, which was probably the same as the servaline cat. In 1907, British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock commented that the two forms should be considered independent species, but reverted from this in 1917. Eventually, the two forms came to be recognised as the same species. Another form, F. himalayanus (Himalayan <b>serval),</b> was described from a skin procured from the Himalayan region; however, Scottish naturalist William Jardine noted in The Naturalist's Library (1843) that no such specimen had been identified by him or his colleagues, and that it differed considerably from the common <b>serval.</b> In 1944, Pocock identified three races of the <b>serval</b> from northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) {{lists the}} <b>serval</b> as least concern; {{the animal is}} also {{included}} in CITES Appendix II. A major threat {{to the survival of}} the <b>serval</b> include the degradation of wetlands and grasslands. Trade of <b>serval</b> skins, though on the decline, still occurs in countries such as Benin and Senegal. In western Africa, the <b>serval</b> has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} species of felid, <b>servals</b> are {{occasionally}} kept as pets, although their wild nature means that ownership of <b>servals</b> is regulated in most countries.|$|R
5|$|The {{association}} of <b>servals</b> with human beings {{dates to the}} time of Ancient Egypt. <b>Servals</b> are depicted as gifts or traded objects from Nubia in Egyptian art.|$|R
5|$|<b>Servals</b> {{occur in}} several {{protected}} areas across its range. Hunting of <b>servals</b> is prohibited in Algeria, Botswana, Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Cape Province (South Africa), and Tunisia; regulations apply in Angola, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia.|$|R
5|$|The <b>serval</b> is {{confined}} to Africa – it is rare in northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in southern Africa, where their range is reportedly expanding. In northern Africa, the <b>serval</b> is known only from Morocco and has been reintroduced in Tunisia, but is feared to be extinct in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, the caracal was {{classified}} under the genera Felis or Lynx. However, a 2006 phylogenetic {{study showed that}} the caracal evolved nearly a million years before the lynx appeared. The caracal is most {{closely related to the}} African golden cat (Profelis aurata, often considered a species of Caracal). These two species, together with the <b>serval</b> (Leptailurus <b>serval),</b> form one of the eight lineages of Felidae. The Caracal lineage came into existence 8.5 mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6 mya.|$|E
5|$|It diverged {{from the}} <b>serval</b> {{probably}} {{within the last}} five million years, around {{the boundary between the}} Pliocene and the Pleistocene.|$|E
50|$|Visitors {{can also}} book various 'specialty' tours, {{including}} the Off Road Safari, or close encounters with gorillas, <b>servals</b> or giraffe.|$|R
50|$|Predators {{are housed}} in the {{northern}} part of the zoo, and include tigers, snow leopards, wolves, bears, Canada lynx, bobcats, cougars, coyotes, foxes, badgers, and <b>servals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Earth Rangers Centre houses over 40 {{animals that}} act as Animal Ambassadors for the organization, {{including}} ring-tailed lemurs, red foxes, bald eagles, African <b>servals,</b> and American kestrels.|$|R
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the <b>serval</b> {{have remained in}} dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M.C. McKenna and S.K. Bell classified Leptailurus as a subgenus of Felis, while others like O.R.P. Bininda-Edmonds (of the Technical University of Munich) have grouped it with Felis, Lynx and Caracal. Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s show that the <b>serval,</b> along with the caracal and the African golden cat, forms {{one of the eight}} lineages of Felidae. According to a 2006 genetic study, the Caracal lineage came into existence 8.5mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6mya.|$|E
5|$|The <b>serval</b> {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build and coat pattern, though not in size. The <b>serval</b> shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|E
5|$|The <b>serval</b> prefers {{areas with}} cover such as reeds and tall grasses and {{proximity}} to water bodies, such as wetlands and savannahs. It {{is rare in}} northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in southern Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the <b>serval</b> as least concern. It occurs in protected areas across its range, and hunting of servals is either prohibited or regulated in several countries.|$|E
50|$|In September 2014, Wellington Zoo {{opened their}} newest exhibit, Grassland Cats, {{home to the}} zoo's <b>servals</b> and brand new caracals, the first ones {{in the country for}} a long time.|$|R
50|$|African Experience was not {{complete}} as of 2009. It will {{be expanded to}} house many other animals including zebras, giraffes, pygmy hippos, hoofed mammals, birds, leopards, <b>servals,</b> colobus monkeys and other primates, meerkats, and Nile crocodiles.|$|R
50|$|The Carnivore Evolutionary Research Institute was {{incorporated}} as a non-profit in 1981, and {{changed its name}} to Carnivore Preservation Trust (CPT). CPT became well known for its success in breeding certain species, particularly <b>servals,</b> ocelots, and binturongs.|$|R
5|$|In Africa, Crex {{species may}} be hunted by the leopard, <b>serval,</b> cats, the black-headed heron, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle, Wahlberg's eagle, and black sparrowhawk. In South Africa, newly hatched African crake chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{include the}} leopard, <b>serval,</b> cats, the black-headed heron, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle and Wahlberg's eagle. In South Africa, newly hatched chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang. If surprised, an African crake will leap vertically into the air before running away, a tactic believed to help it to evade snakes or terrestrial mammals.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1986, {{a healthy}} hybrid kitten between a male <b>serval</b> {{and a female}} {{domestic}} cat was born; this kitten was larger than a typical domestic kitten and resembled its father in its coat pattern. It appeared to have inherited a few domestic traits, such as tameness, from its mother. The hybrid cat may have a doglike habit of following its owner about, and {{can be a good}} swimmer. Over the years, savannah cats have gained popularity as pets.|$|E
5|$|Due to its slow movements, the addax is an {{easy target}} for predators such as lions, humans, African hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards. Caracals, hyenas and <b>servals</b> attack calves. The addax are {{normally}} not aggressive, though individuals may charge if they are disturbed.|$|R
50|$|Cedar Cove Feline Conservatory & Sanctuary {{is a small}} {{sanctuary}} {{located in}} Louisburg, Kansas, United States. It houses several felines, such as Siberian and Bengal tigers, lions, <b>servals,</b> a caracal, mountain lions, a leopard, and bobcats, as well as coatis and wolves.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Servals</b> and caracals {{have the}} longest history as human companions. Part of their {{popularity}} {{can be attributed}} to the fact that they readily hybridize with domestic cats. The resulting crosses (savannahs and caracats) inherit traits of both the domestic cat and the wild species.|$|R
5|$|The caracal {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of {{difference between the two}} is that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric <b>serval</b> can be told apart from the caracal by the former's lack of ear tufts, white spots behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks the tear streaks of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The <b>serval</b> has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E
25|$|A few predators species are: lion (Panthera leo), {{spotted hyena}} (Crocuta crocuta), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and <b>serval</b> (Leptailurus <b>serval).</b>|$|E
50|$|Ketamine {{has been}} proven safe, when used in <b>servals,</b> {{together}} with medetomidine (Domitor, Dorbene, Dormilan, Medetor, Sedastart, Sedator, Sededorm) and butorphanol (Alvegesic, Dolorex, Torbugesic, Torbutrol, Torphasol) with the antagonist atipamezole (Alzane, Antisedan, Atipam, Revertor, Sedastop). Dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor) is {{a new version of}} medetomidine, with fewer side effects.|$|R
