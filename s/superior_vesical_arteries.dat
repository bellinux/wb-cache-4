30|$|In the Swift operation, {{as in the}} {{previously}} proposed nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy, the deep lateral part of the parametrium is not removed. Is this a problem from a radicality point of view? We think not. We have seen {{no significant difference in}} the survival or local recurrence rate since we started with nerve-sparing surgery in 2001 / 2002. Some concern about the importance of removing the deep lateral portion of the parametrium has been expressed by the authors of the so-called “giant section” studies, in which the whole of the parametrium from the uterus to the pelvic side wall was embedded for pathology assessment. In these studies also, lymph nodes in the deep lateral part of the parametrium were found. In the giant-section studies, parametrial resection is performed before the pelvic lymphadenectomy, making it impossible to distinguish these nodes as “deep lateral parametrial” or “deep medial obturator.” We have found that, after an extensive and deep lymphadenectomy in which the lymph-bearing tissue dorsally from the <b>superior</b> <b>vesical</b> <b>arteries</b> is also removed, apart from the autonomous nerves, hardly any tissue remains in the area that is called the deep lateral parametrium. The only tissue that can be found is directed in a more distal course towards the bladder and is to be regarded as bladder mesentery. Furthermore, in the giant section technique, it is not possible to distinguish between parametrium and uterosacral ligamentous tissue.|$|E

In a retrospective study from January 2012 to January 2014, 55 male patients (110 hemipelves) with BPH who underwent PAE were evaluated by Cone-beam CT in addition to pelvic DSA during embolization planning. Each hemipelvis was evaluated regarding the number of prostatic arteries (PA) and their origins, diameters, territorial perfusion, and anastomoses with adjacent arteries. A total of 114 PAs were identified in 110 hemipelves. There was one PA in 96. 4 % of the hemipelves (n= 106), and two independent PAs in the other 3. 6 % (n= 4). The PA was found to originate from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac artery in 39. 5 % of cases (n= 45), from the <b>superior</b> <b>vesical</b> <b>artery</b> in 32. 6 % (n= 37), and from the internal pudendal artery in 27. 9 % of cases (n= 32).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the anatomy and imaging {{findings of the}} prostatic arteries (PAs) on multirow-detector pelvic computed tomographic (CT) angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) before embolization for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study from May 2010 to June 2011, 75 men (150 pelvic sides) underwent pelvic CT angiography and selective pelvic DSA before PA embolization for BPH. Each pelvic side was evaluated regarding the number of independent PAs and their origin, trajectory, termination, and anastomoses with adjacent arteries. RESULTS: A total of 57 % of pelvic sides (n = 86) had only one PA, and 43 % (n = 64) had two independent PAs identified (mean PA diameter, 1. 6 mm ± 0. 3). PAs originated from the internal pudendal artery in 34. 1 % of pelvic sides (n = 73), from a common trunk with the <b>superior</b> <b>vesical</b> <b>artery</b> in 20. 1 % (n = 43), from the anterior common gluteal-pudendal trunk in 17. 8 % (n = 38), from the obturator artery in 12. 6 % (n = 27), and from a common trunk with rectal branches in 8. 4 % (n = 18). In 57 % of pelvic sides (n = 86), anastomoses to adjacent arteries were documented. There were 30 pelvic sides (20 %) with accessory pudendal arteries in {{close relationship with the}} PAs. No correlations were found between PA diameter and patient age, prostate volume, or prostate-specific antigen values on multivariate analysis with logistic regression.

30|$|Chronic {{bleeding}} {{has been}} described in cases of most significant problems of oncourology. Oncologic patient can face a permanent cascade of disbalance between pathways of coagulation (Fricke et al., 2017; Salignac et al., 2002; Kennedy et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016). These patientsare in slightly greater risk of bleeding without any surgical procedure and greater risk of bleeding in post-operative period. The {{most common cause of}} such complication could be a diffuse bleeding from traumatized tumor tissue surface after cystoscopic punch-biopsy. Conservative methods of bleeding control (Kolev & Longstaff, 2016) (fibrinolysis inhibitors) will be ineffective in most cases. It’s a complex situation, because not each all patient from this cohort can survive cystostomy due to poor performance status. Recently, superselective embolization became the method of choice to control such bleeding. Besides, physicians choose embolization among other methods of treatment for acute bleeding: combined trauma with pelvic fractures, uncontrollable bleedings after gynecological surgical operations and complications of radiotherapy (may be chronic as well) (Agolini et al., 1997; Matityahu et al., 2013; Ali et al., 2014; Sieber, 1994; Samuel Washington & Benjamin, 2016; El-Shalakany, 2003). Usually, sequence of actions comprises bilateral diagnostic angiography of internal iliac arteries in order to determine a source of bleeding (arterial supply of bladder tumors can originate from <b>superior</b> and/or inferior <b>vesical</b> <b>arteries,</b> prostatic arteries, not infrequently it may be branches of internal pudendal artery, obturator arteries (Vikash Prasad, 2009)) followed by superselective embolization using various embolic agents. The most frequently-used agents are embolic spheres of different sizes, that can provide permanent tumor vessels occlusion (choosing spheres diameter depends on expected vessel penetration), but IRs also can use polymorphic PVA agents (also permanent occlusion), gelfoam particles (temporary occlusion) or combinations of those. Described method are effective alternative to surgery. Embolization can be performed even in the in patients in shock and with high procedure success. The patient does not require special preparations. Despite obvious advantages and minimally invasive character of the procedure, in some cases embolization can lead to serious complications. In retrospective study of Matityahu et al. (Matityahu et al., 2013) authors report 11 % chance of complications, including one case of bladder necrosis from cohort of 98 patients. Serious complications were reported in all patients who underwent bilateral embolization. A major complication as bladder necrosis is described within the first 4 – 5 [*]weeks following the embolization (Ali et al., 2014; Sieber, 1994), however, we have found data of bladder necrosis in earlier post-operative period (two weeks after intervention) (Sieber, 1994; Samuel Washington & Benjamin, 2016).|$|R

In our case computed tomography was useful for this purpose. We suggest that partial cystectomy should be the preferred choice when the patient is preoperatively confirmed to have a high-stage hemangioma, whereas transurethral resection may suffice when the hemangioma is confirmed to be at a low stage. Fatal bleeders could be controlled by open surgery even if the hemangioma extends beyond the bladder wall.

However, the underlying mechanisms of non-obstructive detrusor overactivity and LUTS remain largely unknown. Growing evidence suggests that ischemia may be an independent factor {{in the development of}} non-obstructive bladder dysfunction. Our goal was {{to determine the effects of}} ischemia on detrusor function and voiding behavior and define redox-mediated cellular stress and cell survival signaling in the ischemic bladder. Materials and methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into treatment (n= 8) and control (n= 8) groups. In the treatment group, iliac artery atherosclerosis and chronic bladder ischemia were induced. At 8  weeks after bladder ischemia, voiding patterns were examined in metabolic cages, cystometrograms were recorded in conscious animals, and then bladder blood flow was measured under general anesthesia. Bladder tissues were processed for assessment of transcription factors, markers of cellular and mitochondrial stress, mitochondrial respiration, and cell survival signaling pathway. Results: Atherosclerotic occlusive disease spread from the common iliac arteries to the internal iliac and <b>vesical</b> <b>arteries</b> and produced sustained bladder ischemia. Studies in metabolic cages showed increased micturition frequency and decreased voided volume in bladder ischemia. Conscious cystometrograms produced consistent data showing significant increase in micturition frequency and decreased voided volume and bladder capacity. Voiding behavior and cystometric changes in bladder ischemia were associated with significant decrease in DNA binding activity of Nrf 2, significant increase in cellular levels of stress protein Hsp 70 and mitochondrial stress protein GRP 75, and significant decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and upregulation of PI 3 K and Akt expression. Conclusion: Chronic bladder ischemia may be a mediating variable in the development of detrusor overactivity in the non-obstructive bladder. The mechanism may involve ischemia-induced cellular stress, Nrf 2 functional deficit, depression of mitochondrial respiration, and upregulation of PI 3 K/Akt cell survival signaling pathway.
