We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E

Another baby was stabbed by a man trying to kill her mother.|$|E

Pedro II revealed in a letter written to the Countess of Barral in early 1881 that: [...] "The [...] with the earrings which you mentioned, has been the cause for much recrimination {{on the part of}} someone [...] who thinks that I have been to blame for their disappearance." [...] Her son-in-law, Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, wrote a letter recounting how she had accidentally broken her arm in October 1885: [...] "On Monday 26 when crossing the library on the way to dinner with the emperor who as usual preceded her by a few steps (and with whom, I infer from what <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> she was arguing as she sometimes does), she caught her foot in a file under a table and fell down flat face forward." [...] Nonetheless, she continued to express undiminished love for her husband.|$|E

"Yes, <b>she</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that, Mr. Wingfield; and {{although}} we don't know you personally, we feel sure--my sister Ada and I--from what <b>she</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> of your behavior while you have been together, that you are an honorable gentleman, and we hope and believe that you will make her happy." ...|$|R

5000|$|For The Independent, James Kidd said, [...] "Atwood's body of {{work will}} last {{precisely}} because <b>she</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about ourselves. It {{is not always a}} pretty picture, but it is true for all that." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{next morning}} the two {{brothers}} started for home. [...] Along the trail they met , Talking God, and , Water Sprinkler. [...] "Well done, nihinálí, our grandsons," [...] they said. [...] You are worthy of all that we taught you. [...] You have served your people well." [...] And the two gods each sang a song to celebrate {{the victory of the}} twins over , the Giant. [...] These two songs are sung today whenever a victory is celebrated. [...] When the brothers came close to the home of Changing Woman, their mother, and First Man and First Woman, they hid their armor and weapons and the scalp of [...] in the bushes, and then went inside. [...] Changing Woman rejoiced when she saw them. [...] "Where have you been?" [...] she asked. [...] "I thought a monster had devoured you." [...] "We followed , the Holy Trail," [...] said the elder son, [...] [...] "We came upon , Spider Woman, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> how to go to the house of , our father the Sun. [...] He gave us weapons, and with them we killed , the Big Giant." [...] "Do not say this," [...] said First Man. [...] "No one can kill [...]" [...] Then the brothers led their mother and grandparents outside and showed them the scalp of Yéʼiitsoh, and they rejoiced.

2500|$|In her 2014 [...] "Selp Helf" [...] tour, she {{instructed}} her (mostly young, female) {{audience on}} how to get a boyfriend by being more Miranda-like. [...] "To break up the horrendous musical numbers, Miranda incorporated a series of segments that took the four daily concepts of porn, bullies, love and 'haters' and transformed the subject matter into ... comical banter that relied heavily on audience participation ... she worked off everything the volunteers said and did, improvising and creating punchlines on the spot. ... Ballinger, the genius behind Miranda, is so convincing in the role, you ... will likely forget that there is a normal person behind the red lips". Miranda's more risque stage business is performed [...] "in a way that will have parents laughing and children oblivious." [...] "There was some great physical comedy. Miranda's alternative to twerking has to be seen to be believed and her recreation of her own birth ... was a hoot. As <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> she was always famous, it's just that everyone else knows it now." [...] "But [...] is deeper than it initially appears. ... She is funny and a strong role model, with a healthy disdain for pop’s oversexualisation. .... The satire is not exactly mindblowing but the message is undeniably positive. Plenty of interaction keeps everyone interested and lends proceedings an inclusive feel ... when there was an appeal for volunteers almost every hand shot straight into the air." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{observed}} Beyoncé's persona [...] "Sasha Fierce" [...] and I Am... Sasha Fierce {{album to}} be influenced by Damita Jo. The Sydney Morning Herald stated [...] "When Janet Jackson released the album Damita Jo after the Super Bowl nipple furore, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that [...] "Damita Jo is one of the characters that lives inside of me". And now Beyonce wants us to know that this album ... reflects how: [...] "I have someone else that takes over when it's time for me to work and when I'm on stage, this alter ego that I've created kind of protects me and who I really am." [...] The Courant commented [...] "her musical forebear Janet Jackson is occasionally known as Damita Jo, so why shouldn't Beyonce have an alter-ego, too?". The rear artwork of Jennifer Lopez's Rebirth drew comparisons to Jackson's Damita Jo album cover, depicting Lopez topless in a similar pose amidst a white backdrop. Critics cited [...] "Just a Little While" [...] to influence Crystal Kay's [...] "Busy Doing Nothing" [...] and Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Cherry Pie." [...] The Washington Times likened Whitney Houston's [...] "Like I Never Left", a duet with Akon, to being inspired by Jackson's [...] "My Baby," [...] which featured Kanye West. AllMusic compared the erotic tone of Jill Scott's [...] "" [...] to the album's suggestive content. Furthermore, Lil' Kim released a remix of the album's title track.|$|E
6000|$|Our eyes met. Where was Alfred Inglethorp? His absence {{was strange}} and inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp's dying words. What lay beneath them? What more could <b>she</b> have <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> if <b>she</b> had had time? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; no. Why {{should all}} the world know it? Had <b>she</b> not <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{we should not have}} known it. We should not have {{suspected}} it. Mr. Furnival, who understands these things;--he does not think her guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better than I thought I should. She is well-bred, unassuming, {{and very}} {{entertaining}} when she likes. <b>She</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{some of the}} wittiest stories I've heard for a long time. Didn't our laughter wake you?" [...] replied Lucia.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} visit my aunt, who is staying there. She was where I live, last summer, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> about it. But I couldn't seem to {{understand}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|Oddly enough, as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> {{like her}} husband, Mrs. Eversley during all those endless years had never lost {{some kind of}} belief that she {{would one day be}} saved {{otherwise}} than by death.|$|E
6000|$|I opened it, and by {{the light}} of torches the Prince, Bakenkhonsu, and I read. It was as <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>us</b> in what seemed to be my writing, and signed and sealed as she had said. The words ran: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Meanwhile, thou man, I shame {{not to say}} {{it before}} all these witnesses, I love thee, {{and it seems that}} this--this woman or goddess--loves thee also, and <b>she</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that now, now thou must choose between us once and for ever. <b>She</b> has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> too that if I sinned against Isis, whose {{minister}} be it remembered she declares herself, herself she sinned yet more. For she would have taken thee both from a heavenly mistress and from an earthly bride, and yet snatch that guerdon of immortality which is hers to-day. Therefore if I am evil, she is worse, nor does the flame that burns within the casket whereof Oros spoke shine so very pure and bright.|$|R

6000|$|... "Patience sent us to {{get some}} salt," [...] {{explained}} Rusha, [...] "and we saw them from Dame Redman's door. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> we had better be off and get home {{as fast as we}} could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed she does, for <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> {{as much as}} soon as she got home; and Henrietta and Ann {{have made}} {{themselves}} very merry with their speculations on the subject of Miss Warren's great incognito. They call you Herzog von Geige." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{looked at}} the Story Girl's dry, piteous eyes, and {{suddenly}} remembered that I {{had never seen her}} cry. When <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>us</b> sad tales, in a voice laden with all the tears that had ever been shed, she had never shed one of her own.|$|E

6000|$|... “It was an impertinence,” snapped out the Baron, his {{protruding}} eyes {{taking on}} a scandalised expression; “fancy the woman talking like that at our table. <b>She</b> almost <b>told</b> <b>us</b> we were nobodies, and I don’t believe a word of it.

6000|$|... "You don't know that, Judith.

6000|$|... "No {{possible}} {{question about}} the bona fides this time," [...] said he, in answer, perhaps, to some little gleam of amusement in my eyes. [...] "My wife has known her for many years.
