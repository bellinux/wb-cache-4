40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> flocculants, {{frequently}} {{utilized for}} flocculating efficiency and low cost, recently {{have been discovered}} as producing increased risk to {{human health and the}} environment. Development of a more efficient and environmentally sound alternative flocculant agent is investigated in this paper. Bioflocculants are produced by microorganisms and may exhibit a high rate of flocculation activity. The bioflocculant ETH- 2, with high flocculating activity (2849 mg Kaolin particle/mg ETH- 2), produced by strain Enterobacter sp. isolated from activated sludge, was systematically investigated with regard to its production, characterization, and flocculation mechanism. Analyses of microscopic observation, zeta potential and ETH- 2 structure demonstrates the bridging mechanism, as opposed to charge neutralization, was responsible for flocculation of the ETH- 2. ETH- 2 retains high molecular weight (603 to 1820 kDa) and multi-functional groups (hydroxyl, amide and carboxyl) that contributed to flocculation. Polysaccharides mainly composed of mannose, glucose, and galactose, with a molar ratio of 1 : 2. 9 : 9. 8 were identified a...|$|E

50|$|Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA or Carbomer) is {{generic name}} for <b>synthetic</b> <b>high</b> {{molecular}} weight <b>polymers</b> of acrylic acid. They may be homopolymers of acrylic acid, crosslinked with an allyl ether pentaerythritol, allyl ether of sucrose or allyl ether of propylene. In a water solution at neutral pH, PAA is an anionic polymer, i.e. {{many of the}} side chains of PAA will lose their protons and acquire a negative charge. This makes PAAs polyelectrolytes, {{with the ability to}} absorb and retain water and swell to many times their original volume. Dry PAAs are found in the market as white and fluffy powders. Carbomer codes (910, 934, 940, 941 and 934P) are an indication of molecular weight and the specific components of the polymer. For many applications PAAs are used in form of alkali metal or ammonium salts, e.g. sodium polyacrylate.|$|R
40|$|Cavitation {{erosion and}} fatigue tests were cariied out for <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials; epoxy resin, polypropylene, {{high-density}} polyethylene and polyamide 66, {{and the relationship}} between cavitation erosion resistances and mechanical properties was examined. Resistance of cavitation erosion for <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials is ranged between half and 30 times in comparison with that for carbon steels. Cavitation erosion for <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials is caused by fatigue as well as metals. As <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials have relatively small acoustic impedance, impact loads applied by collapse of bubbles becomes so small. Therefore, the resistance and incubation period of cavitation erosion for <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> materials can be evaluated by strain energy in fatigue by taking account of impact energy due to collapse of bubbles...|$|R

40|$|Investment casting {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as the best option in producing TiAl components with key benefits of accuracy, versatility and integrity. The collapsibility of ceramic moulds for investment casting is critical in the manufacturing process of TiAl components due to TiAl’s intrinsic brittleness at room temperature. The aim of the present research {{is to provide a}} method for production of TiAl components by investment casting in ZrO 2 ceramic moulds with improved collapsibility. Slurries prepared with <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> additions were utilized during the preparation of ceramic moulds. The stress/strain curves obtained from green and baked ceramic moulds demonstrate that the green strength was increased with the application of <b>high</b> <b>polymer,</b> while baked strength decreased, thus the collapsibility of ceramic moulds was improved. It is suggested that this result is related to the burn-out of <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> which left a lot of cavities.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that car-brake lining is made of {{asbestos}} fibers and an organic <b>high</b> <b>polymer.</b> When brake operates, dust containing asbestos is emitted and deposited in brake drum. So we studied on the quantitative analysis of asbestos in the dust. The following results were obtained : 1) From the X-ray diffraction pattern of brake lining surface, the used asbestos is crysotile. 2) The ordinary analysis cannot be applied for the purpose of determining of the chrysotile concn in dust, because an organic <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> in dust adheres to asbestos. 3) When the dust were calcined at 800 ℃, chrysotile transformed to powderly forstelite and an organic <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> were removed. 4) Forstelite concn of the calcined dust could be measured with X-ray diffraction analysis using fluorite as binary mixture. 5) The chrysotile concn of the dust in brakedrum installed on a bus was 20 - 30 wt% by means of the above mentioned method. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>high</b> <b>polymers</b> in solution {{has been}} extensively investigated by many methods, but the diffusion of <b>high</b> <b>polymers</b> has received little attention experimentally, and limited {{progress has been made}} in its theoretical treatment. According to these theories, the rate of diffusion is governed in large measure by the shape of the polymer chain which, however, need not be the same in different solvents. Evidence for a change of shape in different solvents is obtained indirectly from experiments on viscosity, osmotic pressure, sedimentation velocity, and streaming birefringence, while direct evidence is provided by measurements of light scattering. Experimental studies on the diffusion of <b>high</b> <b>polymers</b> should therefore be of interest from two points of view, (i) to provide data by which to examine the validity of existing theories, and (ii) to obtain additional information about the extent to which a polymer may alter its configuration in different solvents. The, present work was undertaken with these two objectives. [ [...] . ...|$|R
