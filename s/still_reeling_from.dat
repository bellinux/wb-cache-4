Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While <b>still</b> <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E

5|$|No {{congressional hearing}} was convened to {{investigate}} the misallocation of funds by Powell, and neither Cope nor Marsh was held responsible for any of their mistakes, but some of Ballou's charges against Marsh came {{to be associated with}} the Survey. Facing anti-Survey sentiment inflamed by western drought and concerns about takeovers of abandoned western homesteads, Powell found himself the subject of larger scrutiny before the House Appropriations Committee. Galvanized to action by Marsh's perceived extravagance with Survey funds, the Appropriations Committee demanded the Survey's budget be itemized. When his appropriation was cut off in 1892, Powell sent a terse telegram to Marsh demanding his resignation, a personal slight as well as a financial one. At the same time, many of Marsh's allies were retiring or had died, lessening his scientific credence. Just as Marsh's extravagant lifestyle was catching up with him, Cope received a position on the Texas Geological Survey. Cope, <b>still</b> <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> the personal attacks levied at him during the Herald affair, did not take advantage of the change in fortunes to press his personal attacks. Cope's fortunes continued to look up throughout the early 1890s, as he was promoted to Leidy's position as Professor of Zoology and was elected President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same year that Marsh stepped down as head of the Academy of Sciences. Towards the latter part of the decade, Cope's fortunes began to sour once more as Marsh regained some of his recognition, earning the Cuvier Medal, the highest paleontological award.|$|E

40|$|In November 2001, as {{the world}} <b>still</b> <b>reeled</b> <b>from</b> {{the attack on the}} Twin Towers, German {{historian}} Sonke Neitzel discovered an extraordinary cache of documents from the Second World War. The documents were the transcripts of German prisoners of war talking among themselves in prisoner of war camps, and secretly recorded by the allies. In these apparently private conversations the soldiers talked freely and openly about their hopes and fears, their concerns and their day-to-day lives. With a banality and ease which to the modern reader can appear shocking, they also talked about the horrors of war [...] about rape, death and killing. Sonke Neitzel shared the material with renowned and bestselling psychologist Harald Wezler and they set about {{trying to make sense of}} the vast piles of documents, the hours of transcripts. The result is SOLDATEN, a landmark book which will change the way we look at soldiers and war, and is as relevant to our modern conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as it was to the soldiers of the German Army in 1945. Published to huge acclaim and controversy in Germany it was a number one bestseller there and reignited the debate about the banality of evil under the Nazi regime...|$|R

50|$|Following 9/11, the U.S. has {{increased}} its interest {{in this part of}} the world, leading to divisions in opinion and welcome. The US opened the Transit Center at Manas in December 2001 following the 9/11 incident. Both Russia and China were dismayed and in later years reportedly offered large bounties if Kyrgyzstan closed the base. In 2006, the President of Kyrgyzstan demanded further concessions to the agreement and in this year a US Air Force personnel officer was kidnapped (media later reported inconsistenties in this account; the USAF reconfirmed a kidnapping took place in 2012). 2006 also saw the killing of a Kyrgyz civilian wielding a knife by a US serviceman with a gun. Local Kyrgyz sentiment and media was outraged as the Kyrgyz region is plagued by lawlessness, banditry, and smuggling and the carrying or even threatening with a knife is relatively common in Kyrgyz street culture. For the Americans, <b>still</b> <b>reeling</b> and devastated <b>from</b> the 9/11 terrorist assault on their largest city, any forcible entry by a civilian into a military base can and is met with deadly force. The US military placed the serviceman under administrative punishment and an undisclosed financial settlement was made to the family.According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 34% of Kyrgyz people approve of U.S. leadership, with 43% disapproving and 23% uncertain.|$|R

25|$|In {{the absence}} of the main Byzantine army, the Bulgarians also revolted under Peter IV of Bulgaria. Their timing could not have been better, since Byzantium was <b>still</b> <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> a bloody coup and a {{disastrous}} invasion. Isaac resolved to pacify the Bulgarian rebellion with force and headed a military expedition north. The Byzantine army was ambushed in a way reminiscent of the Battle of Manzikert and of the earlier fiasco at Pliska. The last attempt to enforce Byzantine authority over Bulgaria concurred with Isaac's last genuine attempts at running the Empire; according to scholars, from then on, Isaac's policies were rarely more than reactionary.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the minimal}} damage inflicted, American morale, <b>still</b> <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor and Japan's {{subsequent}} territorial gains, soared when news of the raid was released. The Japanese press was told to describe the attack as a cruel, indiscriminate bombing against civilians, women, and children. After the war, the casualty count was 87 dead, 151 serious injuries, and more than 311 minor injuries; children were among those killed, and newspapers asked their parents to share their opinion on how the captured raiders should be treated. For years before the attack on Pearl Harbor, there had been mock air raid drills in every Japanese city, although China's air force was almost nonexistent; {{this may have been}} part of the process of keeping warlike emotion at a high pitch.|$|E
25|$|President Eisenhower did {{not want}} to fly American U-2 pilots over the Soviet Union because he felt that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or {{captured}} that it could be seen as an act of aggression. At a time like the Cold War, any act of aggression could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the Royal Air Force fly these missions in place of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). With the United Kingdom <b>still</b> <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> the aftermath of the Suez Crisis and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower {{to be able to use}} the U-2 plane to see what the Soviet Union was hiding, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.|$|E

25|$|The first Gulf War {{triggered}} by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, sent fuel prices skyrocketing, which severely depressed global economic activity. This in turn caused a sharp contraction of worldwide air travel demand, plunging once profitable operations, including Pan Am's prime transatlantic routes, into steep losses. These unforeseen events constituted a further major blow to Pan Am, which was <b>still</b> <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> the 1988 Lockerbie disaster. To shore up its finances, Pan Am sold most of its routes serving London Heathrow – arguably Pan Am's most important international destination – to United Airlines. This left Pan Am with only two daily London flights, serving Detroit and Miami, which used Gatwick as their London terminal {{from the start of}} the 1990/91 winter timetable. Further asset disposals included Pan Am's sale of its IGS routes to Berlin to Lufthansa for $150million, which became effective at the same time and brought the total value of asset disposals to $1.2billion. These measures were accompanied by the elimination of 2,500 jobs (8.6% of its work force). These cutbacks had already been announced by the airline in September 1990.|$|E
25|$|The Charlotte Three, {{consisting}} of T.J. Reddy, James Grant, and Charles Parker, were {{a group of}} men arrested and convicted in Charlotte, North Carolina for the burning of Lazy B Stables, a horse stable. The burning took place on September 24, 1968, one year after Lazy B Stables was integrated. All three men were arrested and implicated in the arson on December 1971, a full three years after the incident. The men were eventually convicted for their presumed actions, and were unsuccessful in having their appeals accepted, with the Supreme Court rejecting their motions. They were all well known radical activists in Charlotte and some people claimed their arrest was aimed at stopping their political motives. Many observers believed that this case was a representation of the still heavily racist Southern United States of the 1970s, and the various underhanded methods prosecutors were willing to utilize to obtain convictions against African Americans. The Charlotte Three were victims in the eyes of some, of an American South that was <b>still</b> <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> widespread integration and general mistrust in Black affairs. The men were held against their will incorrectly not for crimes that they did not commit, but because of the social change they worked hard to attain. Finally, in 1979, North Carolina Jim Hunt commuted all three men's sentences after a vigorous campaign by state, national, and international activists on their behalf.|$|E
