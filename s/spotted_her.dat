5|$|When David's first book, Mediterranean Food was {{published}} in 1950 the British public was still enduring food rationing after the Second World War. Her evocation of the everyday plenty and excellence of Mediterranean food was revelatory, and although she did not reach a wide public until cheap paperback editions of her books {{came out in the}} mid 1950s, reviewers immediately <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> importance.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{was still}} {{serving on the}} Home Station on 11 April 1811 when she sent into Cork a French privateer. This was the 18-gun Auguste (or Augusta), which had been taken on 6 April. Nearly a month later, on 5 July, Emerald left Madeira {{in the company of}} five East Indiamen and was still on convoy duties later that month when a {{transport}} ship <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> escorting thirteen vessels off the coast of West Africa on 18 July.|$|E
5|$|Hermes was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when {{a warning}} of an {{approaching}} Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that day for the Maldives with no aircraft on board.

With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship, although 307 men from Hermes {{were lost in the}} sinking.|$|E

5|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} {{who was the first}} choice for the role of the itinerant prostitute, Suzy. By some accounts, Rodgers and Hammerstein attempted to get Julie Andrews, only to find that she had just signed a two-year contract to appear in a musical by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, tentatively titled My Lady Liza. Andrews's role, as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, would launch her to stardom. Another candidate was Janet Leigh, whom Rodgers admired greatly, but the actress proved to be unavailable. The producers settled on Judy Tyler, auditioned after Rodgers <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> on television while watching The Howdy Doody Show, in which she appeared as Princess Summerfall Winterspring.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the cast}} members {{at the time were}} {{relatively}} unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> picture in the Austin American-Statesman. For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.|$|E
5|$|Captain the Honourable G. Fraser was {{appointed}} on 15 August 1934 {{as the new}} commanding officer and the ship began trials of the new equipment in early November. At {{the same time the}} nine Fairey Seal torpedo bombers of 824 Squadron joined the ship. Hermes left Portsmouth on 18 November for the China Station and arrived at Hong Kong on 4 January 1935. The Hawker Osprey reconnaissance biplanes of 803 Squadron were transferred aboard from Eagle before that ship left Hong Kong. Pirates captured a British-owned merchant ship, SS Tungchow, with 90 British and American children on board on 29 January and Hermes was ordered to search for the ship when she failed to arrive at Chefoo at her scheduled time. Three Seals <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> in Bias Bay on 1 February and the pirates abandoned the ship when it was found, leaving the passengers unharmed. Hermes remained in the vicinity of Hong Kong until mid-May when she steamed to Wei Hai Wei. There she remained until 12 September when the Admiralty decided to transfer her to Singapore where she was closer to East Africa in case a military response to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia was deemed necessary. The ship arrived on 19 September and remained in the area for the next five months.|$|E

The U-boat escaped without serious damage.|$|E
25|$|During 1943, U-552 was {{increasingly}} unable to serve effectively against the well-prepared and organized Allied convoy system, a fact reflected by her failure to sink a single ship during her two patrols into the North Atlantic Ocean. During one of these, a Royal Air Force B-24 Liberator aircraft <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> {{and she was}} seriously damaged by depth charges, which necessitated four months' repairs.|$|E

The French, bound for Brest, continued on their route without giving chase.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the twenty}} {{who survived the}} sinking, only one was a female. Anna Boecker was a shy, quiet maid in the {{employment}} of an elderly lady, travelling with her employer to Southampton. In the panic and confusion of the collision she had been unable to save her employer. She joined the terrified crush of passengers lowered into the first lifeboat. When it capsized under the sheer weight of numbers, Anna ended up in the ocean. All the others from her lifeboat clambered back onto the sinking ship. Anna was alone in the treacherous sea until the survivors in the second lifeboat <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> foundering in the water and pulled her up to safety.|$|E
25|$|Seydlitz was sighted {{at about}} 2400 by Marlborough, who did nothing. The second {{ship in the}} squadron, Revenge (Captain Kiddle) {{challenged}} the unidentified ship, and received the wrong response, but took no action. Agincourt (Captain Doughty) {{at the rear of}} the line <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> but did not challenge her so as not to give our division's position away. Light cruisers Boadicea and Fearless (Captain Roper) also spotted Seydlitz, but followed the example of the battleships and did nothing. Roper stated that by the time he could identify the ship, it was too late to fire a torpedo at her (Fearless was capable of 25 knots compared to Seydlitz's maximum 16 knots because of the damage). Seydlitz, already badly damaged and unable to put up much of a fight, was able to limp back to Germany.|$|E

Frame also held foreign {{membership of the}} American Academy of Arts and Letters and, in her native New Zealand, received two honorary doctorates {{as well as the}} status of cultural icon. Rumours occasionally circulated portraying Frame as a contender for the Nobel Prize in literature, most notably in 1998, after a journalist <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> name {{at the top of a}} list later revealed to have been in alphabetical order, and again five years later, in 2003, when Åsa Beckman, the influential chief literary critic at the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter, wrongly predicted that Frame would win the prestigious prize.|$|E

25|$|Radcliffe's {{father was}} a keen {{marathon}} runner as a young man. He took up the hobby again {{in an attempt to}} lose weight after giving up smoking. Despite suffering from asthma Radcliffe took up running at the age of seven. In 1992 Radcliffe discovered that she suffers from anaemia. Radcliffe was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma at the age of 14 after blacking out whilst training. During her father's training jogs in the woods Radcliffe and her brother would often run with him for a mile or two. Radcliffe attended Frodsham Athletic Club until the age of nine, Radcliffe became a member of Bedford & County Athletics Club, when they moved to Oakley. There she was coached by Alex Stanton, who still fulfilled that role in her professional career. Stanton started to coach Radcliffe at the age of 12 after his wife Rosemary <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> talent. At the age of 10 Radcliffe, accompanied by her father, watched Ingrid Kristiansen run in the London Marathon, inspiring her to become an athlete. Her first race at a national level came as a 12-year-old in 1986, when she placed 299th in the English Schools Cross Country Championships. In 1991 Radcliffe won the English Schools 1500metres title.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in August 1914, the yacht was requisitioned and hired by the Admiralty as an armed patrol vessel. Equipped with two 6-pounder guns and depth charges. Lorna probably operated as the Group Leader of {{a unit of the}} Auxiliary Patrol, both in home waters and in the Mediterranean. On the evening of 26 May 1918, Lorna was escorting a convoy off Portland Bill at the eastern end of Lyme Bay. Sighting a submarine's periscope only thirty yards away, Lorna was able to approach to ten yards before the U-boat <b>spotted</b> <b>her</b> and began to dive. Passing directly over where the periscope had been, (some accounts state that Lorna struck the periscope) Lorna dropped two depth charges resulting in a large patch of turbulence with some debris in it. Returning to recross the area, it was realised that some items in the water were actually four survivors from the U-boat, their calls for help being heard too late to prevent a third charge from being dropped. Three {{of the men in the}} water were killed instantly, the fourth was still alive when recovered but died within three hours, although not before revealing that the destroyed submarine had been the SM UB-74. Lorna was returned to her owner in February 1919, she was then sold on to Walter Preston, an engineer and Member of Parliament.|$|E

The team was also hindered by tension brought on by a generational divide.
