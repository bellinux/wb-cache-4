40|$|Abstract – This paper {{draws on}} data from many sources to examine the nature of both capital gains {{realized}} by taxpayers and those taxpayers them-selves. The data show that high-income taxpayers realize {{the overwhelming majority of}} capital gains, but that, over a ten-year period, nearly a third of taxpayers report a capital gain on their tax returns. Even a larger percentage own assets that might generate capital gains. Sales of corporate <b>stock</b> <b>account</b> for more gains than sales of any other asset. Most capital gains arise from returns with many sales and large capital gains.

Transposing this into a new way to predict events and searching for the ‘broadest possible set of new ways to prevent terrorist attacks,’ allowing anonymous speculators to bet on forecast terrorist attacks, assassinations and coups in an ‘online futures market’ seems to take the idea slightly too far. The opportunity to bet on such events was at: www. policyanalysis. org. It is not now available. Traders who registered would have deposited money into an account, similar to a <b>stock</b> <b>account</b> and won or lost based on predicting events.

The portfolio optimization problem is formulated as an infinite dimensional stochastic classical-impulse control problem. The quasi-variational HJB inequality (QVHJBI) for the value function is derived in this paper. The second pa-per contains the verification theorem for the optimal strategy.

40|$|As EU {{existing}} buildings <b>stock</b> <b>account</b> for 40 % {{of the total}} energy consumption, {{it is important to}} take measures to reduce these needs and, consequently, reduce the EU external energy dependency as well as reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with what is prescribed in the EU Directive 2002 / 91 /EU on Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EPBD) and reinforced with the "EPBD-recast". The implementation of energy efficiency measures in the existing building stock is necessary to meet the 2020 targets. Thus, energy refurbishment of {{existing buildings}} is essential to achieve these goals. However, during the buildings refurbishment, energy issues should not be the only concerns since the indoor air quality is also as important.

To do so, the main problems of the existing buildings should be identified, in order to do the right choices regarding the refurbishment project. This work presents a study carried out in a large office building to identify the main pathologies, related to the energy efficiency and also to the indoor air quality. The study encompasses an “in-situ” evaluation of the operating conditions, indoor air quality and air change rate. The main objective of this study was to support the development of a refurbishment project of the building that can optimize the energy efficiency, but also the relevant parameters to the Indoor Air Quality.

40|$|Recently, {{automotive}} industry recorded decrease of their profits. In these days, however, {{the situation has}} improved since the neighbouring countries have approved car-scrapping bonuses. Thanks to it, cheaper branches increased their sales more rapidly. The automotive companies' suppliers are thus to enlarge their stocks so as to satisfy the companies' demand. Having sufficient reserves of goods became nowadays an indispensable part of their property. The aim of this thesis, which I called ``Purchase, processing and sales of goods in an automotive company``, is to analyze the complications connected with purchase, processing and sales of goods in the Edscha Bohemia s. r. o. automotive company. The goods are accounted according to the A-method. The purchased goods are priced with their purchase prices. When the goods are delivered from stock, weighted average method is then used. Smaller assets up to 3000 CZK is included in consumption costs. When purchasing goods, account no. 111 is not used as usually; <b>stock</b> <b>account</b> no. 112 is used instead. In my opinion, the company uses a well-designed stock-accounting system: the analytical accounts system, which {{is used by the}} company, makes the accounting process more effective. In Germany, sub-accounts are being used for the stocks, which makes their accounts more effective than the accounts in the Czech Republic are; they are using special sub-accounts for empties, compensations for defective goods, and also secondary purchase costs. The rest of the assets from those sub-accounts are transferred to root accounts {{at the end of the}} accounting period. If I had the chance to influence the stock-accounting system in the Czech Republic, I would definitely open sub-accounts for stock accounts. From this place, I could only recommend the accounting entities using as many analytical accounts as possible. In my opinion, in general, when analyses are being utilised, accounting with them becomes more effective, and is of a good service then...|$|E
40|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{the residential}} and commercial building <b>stock</b> <b>account</b> for a considerable share of final energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Building stock modeling is an established tool to assess different development paths of buildings on city, region or country level. Current building stock models (BSM) as well as previous works of the authors, however, lack a holistic approach that take technological, economic and ecological factors into account on an individual building scale. There are, therefore, limitations in the conclusions that can be drawn. In order to increase their significance, current research shows trends towards spatial differentiation, representation of individual building and owners {{as well as economic}} decision modeling. However, no model combines all three aspects in a more holistic approach. This paper describes a novel approach which combines spatial differentiation with building specific heat demand modeling and an economic decision simulation. The model developed combines a building specific engineering model with a micro-economic discrete choice approach. Using spatial building data, the engineering model calculates space heat and hot water energy demand on a building level. The alteration of the building refurbishment state is modeled using a discrete choice approach to simulate the decision process of building owners of building envelope refurbish and/or to substitute the heating system. Due to the building specific approach, the decision model is able to take into account building specific information such as size, geometry, room temperature, investment, maintenance and energy costs and achievable energy savings as well as other factors such as local potentials and restrictions on the use of renewable energy. In a case study of the city of Zürich we demonstrate the feasibility and strengths of the new model approach. The results demonstrate that modeling space heating demand on an individual building scale yields specific heat demand distribution across building clusters (and not simply in average values as in other models). The building level approach enables the model to deliver differentiated results of the heat demand development for the whole building stock, building types building periods or spatially distributed as shown in the results...|$|E
