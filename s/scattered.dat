5|$|Models by Julio Ángel Fernández {{suggest that}} the <b>scattered</b> disc, which is the main source for {{periodic}} comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, {{about half of the}} objects <b>scattered</b> travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The <b>scattered</b> disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of the <b>scattered</b> disc's population is likely to end up in the Oort cloud after 2.5billion years.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the <b>scattered</b> disc. The <b>scattered</b> disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the <b>scattered</b> disc). Because the <b>scattered</b> disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the <b>scattered</b> disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
50|$|Electromagnetic {{waves are}} one of the best known and most {{commonly}} encountered forms of radiation that undergo <b>scattering.</b> <b>Scattering</b> of light and radio waves (especially in radar) is particularly important. Several different aspects of electromagnetic <b>scattering</b> are distinct enough to have conventional names. Major forms of elastic light <b>scattering</b> (involving negligible energy transfer) are Rayleigh <b>scattering</b> and Mie <b>scattering.</b> Inelastic <b>scattering</b> includes Brillouin <b>scattering,</b> Raman <b>scattering,</b> inelastic X-ray <b>scattering</b> and Compton <b>scattering.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recall that by definition, {{mobility}} {{is dependent}} on the drift velocity. The main factor determining drift velocity (other than effective mass) is <b>scattering</b> time, i.e. how long the carrier is ballistically accelerated by the electric field until it <b>scatters</b> (collides) with something that changes its direction and/or energy. The most important sources of <b>scattering</b> in typical semiconductor materials, discussed below, are ionized impurity <b>scattering</b> and acoustic phonon <b>scattering</b> (also called lattice <b>scattering).</b> In some cases other sources of <b>scattering</b> may be important, such as neutral impurity <b>scattering,</b> optical phonon <b>scattering,</b> surface <b>scattering,</b> and defect <b>scattering.</b>|$|R

These <b>scattering</b> mechanisms are: Umklapp phonon-phonon <b>scattering,</b> phonon-impurity <b>scattering,</b> phonon-electron <b>scattering,</b> and phonon-boundary <b>scattering.</b> Each <b>scattering</b> mechanism can be characterised by a relaxation rate 1/ which is the inverse of the corresponding relaxation time.|$|R
5|$|The centaurs, {{which are}} not {{normally}} {{considered part of the}} Kuiper belt, are also thought to be <b>scattered</b> objects, the only difference being that they were <b>scattered</b> inward, rather than outward.

5|$|The {{classical}} objects (cubewanos) {{are very}} different from the <b>scattered</b> objects: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low-inclination, near-circular orbits whose eccentricities peak at 0.25. Classical objects possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Though the inclinations of <b>scattered</b> objects are similar to the more extreme KBOs, very few <b>scattered</b> objects have orbits as close to the ecliptic as much of the KBO population.|$|E
5|$|The planets <b>scattered</b> the {{majority}} of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then <b>scattered</b> off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. Those objects <b>scattered</b> by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud; those objects <b>scattered</b> to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and <b>scattered</b> disc. This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and <b>scattered</b> disc's present low mass. Some of the <b>scattered</b> objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances. Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.|$|E

5|$|The <b>scattered</b> disc is a sparsely {{populated}} region, overlapping with the Kuiper belt but extending to beyond 100 AU. <b>Scattered</b> disc objects (SDOs) have very elliptical orbits, often also very inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of Solar System formation show both KBOs and SDOs first forming in a primordial belt, with later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, sending the objects outward, some into stable orbits (the KBOs) and some into unstable orbits, the <b>scattered</b> disc.

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU.

5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} the <b>scattered</b> disc {{to be the}} place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the intermediate stage in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud objects are also thought to have originated in the <b>scattered</b> disc.

40|$|By large-distance asymptotics, in {{conventional}} <b>scattering</b> theory, {{at the cost}} of losing the information of the distance between target and observer, one arrives at an explicit expression for <b>scattering</b> wave functions represented by a <b>scattering</b> phase shift. In the present paper, together with a preceding paper (T. Liu,W. -D. Li, and W. -S.
