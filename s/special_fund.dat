5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> and disbursements. The <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> was designated for payments to workers with occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E
5|$|Trust {{funds are}} {{earmarked}} for specific programs and purposes {{in accordance with}} a statute that designates the fund as a trust. Its statutory designation distinguishes the fund as a trust rather than a <b>special</b> <b>fund.</b> The Highway Trust Fund {{is an example of}} trust funds.|$|E
5|$|Wayne Young {{stated that}} {{portions}} of the film's gross would be donated to Greenpeace, the Rainforest Foundation Fund, and the Sierra Club, {{as well as a}} <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> benefiting environmental projects worldwide that was administered by the Smithsonian Institution, though he did not disclose exact figures.|$|E
40|$|After the {{implementation}} of the tax division system, the central appropriation of <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> remains, but there will be no further increase in the total amount of such funds. At the same time, the establishment of a transfer payment system {{at the core of the}} tax division system will add new contents to the central appropriation of <b>special</b> <b>funds.</b> In this respect, the amount of centrally appropriated <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> will increase at a more rapid pace, which requires more efficient management. However, if we only pay attention to the absolute amount of the funds, while neglecting the rational distribution and management of the funds, the central appropriation of <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> will lose its original meaning. This article analyzes problems in the central appropriation of <b>special</b> <b>funds,</b> their causes, and solutions. ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Special</b> <b>funds</b> {{are similar}} to the <b>special</b> revenue <b>funds</b> used by state and local governments, {{earmarked}} for a specific purpose (other than business-like activities).|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a Master-KAG usually applies to <b>special</b> <b>funds,</b> in {{contrast}} to public <b>funds.</b> <b>Special</b> <b>funds</b> typically are held by institutional investors. If a KAG outsources the asset management of public funds to external managers, {{it is not yet}} categorised as a Master-KAG.|$|R
5|$|Men {{who worked}} for farmers or {{psychiatric}} hospitals received regular wages, which {{they were required to}} give to the federal government. Objections to this practice developed immediately because the men felt they were helping to fund the war. A compromise was reached where the wages were put into a <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> that was unused until {{after the end of the}} war. At one point, church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living allowance for the men's dependents.|$|E
5|$|After the Virginia Tech {{massacre}} on April 16, 2007, Vick and the United Way donated $10,000 {{to assist}} families affected. The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia {{to be placed}} in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and a <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> at the United Way of Montgomery, Radford and Floyd counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said the money would be used to provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.|$|E
5|$|Simone's mother, Mary Kate Waymon (c. 1902 – April 30, 2001), was a Methodist {{minister}} and a housemaid. Simone's father, John Divine Waymon (c. 1898 – October 24, 1972), was a handyman who {{at one time}} owned a dry cleaning business, but also suffered bouts of ill health. Simone's music teacher helped establish a <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> {{to pay for her}} education. Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist her continued education. With the help of this scholarship money she was able to attend Allen High School for Girls in Asheville, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Other {{business}} in the session included creating a <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> that would allow Jefferson to recover the USS Philadelphia, which had been captured {{off the coast of}} northern Africa, and the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1800; Breckinridge supported the passage of both measures. He feared that passage of an act making permanent the pay raises for executive administrative personnel first enacted in 1799 would hurt his party in the upcoming elections, especially in the House, but the act passed and there was no significant backlash at the polls. Robert Wright's measure adjourning Congress to Baltimore, Maryland, in protest of legislators' poor accommodations in Washington, D.C., was defeated by a vote of 9–19, but Breckinridge considered the issue of moving the U.S. capital worthy of further study. Breckinridge supported the successful impeachment of federal judge John Pickering and also served on the Senate committee that prepared the rules governing the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. The latter impeachment was widely seen as politically motivated, and some Democratic-Republicans joined the Federalist minority in voting for acquittal. Majorities were obtained on only three of the eight articles of impeachment, and each of those fell at least three votes short of the required two-thirds majority. Breckinridge and three other Democratic-Republicans voted to convict on every article except the fifth, on which every senator sided with Chase.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, a <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> {{known as}} Rural Electrification Fund (FAER), of similar {{characteristics}} to the FAZNI, {{was established to}} subsidize investment in rural areas of the interconnected system. The fund was designed to collect a surcharge of US$0.40 per MWh of electricity sold to the wholesale market, which would yield approximately US$18 million per year. Projects are presented to the FAER by the local government authorities. In order to be eligible, they must form part of the local development plan and the investment plan of the corresponding distribution utility and must also pass through the national project screening and evaluation system.|$|E

It prioritised conservation of marine life and integrated management of biotopes, with a particular emphasis on international cooperation and coordination. Projects financed included a programme for return of large migratory species such as salmon to the Rhine, which received nearly ECU 5 million, and re-colonisation of eelgrass in shallow coastal waters around Denmark (EU funding of ECU 252,500).|$|E

In May 2010, they were inventoried and published, in print and DVD format, as Arhiva Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș. A selection of these works was displayed in 2011, during a special Museum of the Romanian Peasant exhibit, sponsored by the Romanian Cultural Institute. The rest, preserved by the Fine Arts School, were donated to the Museum of the Romanian Peasant in 2000.

25|$|Eastern Airlines had {{reported}} losses for 1981 {{and felt that}} the purchase of Braniff's South America routes would help, but Eastern's financial condition worsened through the 1980s. Eastern never made a profit with their South American routes, due to the region's delicate financial situation at the time. On April 26, 1990, the United States Department of Transportation approved the sale of Eastern Airlines' Latin American routes to American Airlines for 349 million USD. Eastern had recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and planned {{to use the money}} from the route sale to repay creditors and regain its financial footing. The funds were placed into a <b>special</b> <b>fund</b> controlled by Eastern's creditors who had recently ousted controversial Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who took over the 60-year-old aviation legend in 1986.|$|E
