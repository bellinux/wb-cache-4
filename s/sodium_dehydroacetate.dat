40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{controlling}} factors on the polymorphic outcome of <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate</b> crystallization {{was investigated in}} this study. Cooling crystallization experiments of <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate</b> in water were conducted at different concentrations. The results revealed {{that the rate of}} supersaturation generation {{played a key role in}} the formation of the hydrates. At a high supersaturation generation rate, a new <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate</b> dihydrate needle form was obtained; on the contrary, a <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate</b> plate monohydrate was formed at a low supersaturation generation rate. Furthermore, the characterization and transformation behavior of these two hydrated forms were investigated with the combined use of microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic vapor sorption (DVS). It was found that the new needle crystals were dihydrated and hollow, and they eventually transformed into <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate</b> monohydrate. In addition, the mechanism of formation of <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate</b> hydrates was discussed, and a process growth model of hollow crystals in cooling crystallization was proposed...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} papers it {{was reported}} that the spoilage of 2 ̆ 2 Kamaboko 2 ̆ 2 in the inner part was scarcely found and mostly occured on the surface. It was further noticed that the spoilage on the surface was due to growth of both bacteria and fungi while that of the inner part if occurred would be caused solely by bacteria. The present paper deals with the effectiveness of inclusion of bacteriostatics into the whole paste and also with the inclusion of both bacteriostatics and fungistatics into the outer layer of the paste. 1. In case of combination of <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate</b> (DHA-Na) and 5 -nitro- 2 -furylacrylamide (NFA), the best result was obtained in the experimental group which contained NFA (0. 002...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{food-grade}} microemulsions {{have been}} of increasing interest to researchers and exhibited great potential on their industrial applications. The microbiological and quality characteristics of NuoMiGao, a traditional Chinese steamed rice cake, affected by a prepared food-grade monolaurin-containing microemulsion have been evaluated in this study. Microbiological analysis indicated that 0. 05 % microemulsion was comparable to 0. 01 % <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate,</b> extending the shelf-life by two days. The quality analysis showed that {{the addition of the}} microemulsion effectively prevented the hardening phenomena in rice cake; the lightness and yellowness were fairly stable while redness increased slightly (P< 0. 05); the lowered pH value and the prevention of moisture drop in rice cake were in agreement with the microbiological analysis and hardness trends...|$|E
40|$|Some phisiological {{effects of}} food {{additives}} on Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells {{were examined in}} the presence of sodium cholate (CA) or sodium laurylbenzensulfonate (LBS). Most of food additives inhibited 20 ~ 60 %of oxygen uptake attended by oxidation of cellular respiratory substrates. These inhibitions were significantly increased {{in the presence of}} LBS. Some food additives addition to cells suspension resulted in a large release of magnesium ion from cells. Leakages were increased 50, 90 and 80 %compared with one of control by phloxine, potassium sorbate and <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate,</b> respectively. These leakages were intensely increased in the presence of CA or LBS. Furthermore,intact cells and protoplasts treated with some food additives, CA and LBS were observed with scanning electron microscope, Remarked histological damages were scarcely observed in intact cells, but,in protoplasts, cells were dameged more badly by most of drugs...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis (CZE) method {{was developed for}} the simultaneous determination of sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate,</b> and the parabens, i. e. ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl p-hydroxybenzoic esters, which are used in several processed foods as preservatives. The compounds were well separated from each other on a fused silica capillary utilizing a 20 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9. 65) and UV detection at 200 nm. The total analysis time was less than seven minutes per sample. Furthermore, sodium benzoate and the five parabens, i. e. ethyl, isopropyl, n-propyl, isobutyl and n-butyl p-hydroxybenzoic esters, permitted as food preservatives in Japan were well separated {{from each other in}} less than eight minutes using a micellar electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis (MEKC) method. Concentrations of sodium benzoate and n-butyl paraben in several soft drinks were determined using the CZE method and the levels of sodium benzoate and n-butyl paraben in the samples were in good agreement with those determined by the HPLC procedure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:【Objective】The {{experiment}} was aimed {{to study the}} effect of two silage fermentative inhibitors－sodium diacetate (SDA) and <b>sodium</b> <b>dehydroacetate</b> (SD) that normally are used as food preservatives on quality and aerobic stability of corn silage 【Method】In the experiment, whole newly-mowed corn plants as raw materials were ensiled after treatment with 0. 4 % SDA and 0. 1 % SD, respectively, and then were taken to compare with negative control (no additives used) and positive control (with acidizer added, 3 ml·kg- 1 LuproMix NC). 【Result】The results of the experiment showed that SD-treated silage had lower values in the quantities of molds and yeasts, dry matter loss (DML), and VBN/TN than both the negative control and the positive control significantly (P＜ 0. 05). SDA-treated silage had the highest lactic acid and acetic acid concentrations, but its DML and VBN/TN were lower than the negative control, but not significant (P＞ 0. 05). For aerobic stability, SD-treated silage were the greatest (＞ 213 h), and SDA-teated silage (＞ 147 h) were poorer than the positive control (LuproMix-treated, ＞ 187 h), but better than the negative control (118 h). 【Conclusion】Thus, addition of SD or SDA {{did not affect the}} quality of corn silage but significantly improve...|$|E
