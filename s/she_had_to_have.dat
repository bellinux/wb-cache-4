5|$|In February 1952, Hergé was {{involved}} in a car crash in which Germaine's leg was shattered; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a steel rod implanted in it, and was confined to a wheelchair for several months. Their relationship was further strained when they received news of Wallez's death in September 1952. His friendship with Van Melkebeke also broke apart in this period, in part due to advice gained from an alleged clairvoyant, Bertje Janueneau, whom both Hergé and Germaine were increasingly relying upon for guidance. In January 1955 a young woman named Fanny Vlamynck was hired as a colourist at the Studios. Hergé embarked on an extra-marital affair with her in November 1956, {{with the rest of the}} studio staff soon finding out. Germaine grew suspicious of her husband's affections for Fanny, but was also experiencing strong romantic attraction to her ballroom dance partner. Hergé and Germaine went on a cruise for the former's fiftieth birthday in May 1957, in which they visited Casablanca, Rabat, Palermo, and Rome, and in October went on a second holiday, this time to Ostend. Following this, he revealed his affair with Fanny to Germaine.|$|E

500|$|Well {{before leaving}} England, Wilson {{was married to}} Elizabeth Mansfield, the {{daughter}} of Sir John Mansfield, and had at least two children born in England, but his wife had initially refused to come to New England with him. [...] Her refusal {{was the subject of}} several letters sent from John Winthrop's wife, Margaret, to her son John Winthrop, Jr., in May 1631. [...] Wilson then made a trip back to England from 1631 to 1632. Though his biographer, in 1870, stated that she still did not come back to New England with Wilson until 1635, Anderson in 1995 pointed out that the couple had a child baptized in Boston in 1633; therefore <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come with Wilson during this earlier trip.|$|E
500|$|Baweja, {{who is a}} Scorpio {{like his}} {{character}} Yogesh in the film, {{said that he could}} relate to the character. While reading the script, he told Gowariker that some of his character's dialogue was what he would usually say. At the time, Chopra described the film as the [...] "most difficult and important" [...] in her career. She found playing twelve characters equivalent to performing in twelve different films. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a different look for each of them but had very little time to prepare and establish each character on screen, since each character had [...] "one song and about two scenes". Since all the characters except one were between ages eighteen and twenty-four, Chopra found it difficult to make every character look distinct. She said that there were not many options other than changing her hair and the characters' outfits to portray them. As a result, she chose to work on her body language and experimented with her voice and accent to make the characters distinct from one another, describing it as [...] "a real test".|$|E

She made her film debut the {{following}} year in Pride & Prejudice, the 2005 film adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, portraying Kitty Bennet. Later that year, she auditioned for and won the role of orphan Ada Clare in the BAFTA award-winning BBC adaption of Charles Dickens' Bleak House, her television debut. Among her 2007 projects were My Boy Jack, starring Daniel Radcliffe, that features her in a supporting role, and Northanger Abbey. She identified with her role Elsie, the daughter of writer Rudyard Kipling, who vociferously opposes her brother going to war. She earned a Constellation Award for playing the main character Sally Sparrow in the Doctor Who episode [...] "Blink". She rounded out 2007 by appearing in an acclaimed revival of The Seagull, in which she played Nina to Kristin Scott Thomas's Arkadina and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Trigorin. The Daily Telegraph said her performance was [...] "quite extraordinarily radiating'" [...] and The Observer called her [...] "almost unbearably affecting." [...] While {{in the middle of the}} production, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an appendectomy, preventing her from being able to perform for a week. For her debut Broadway performance in the 2008 American transfer of The Seagull, she was nominated for a Drama Desk Award, but lost to Angela Lansbury.|$|E

[...] Ruth later died in the Holocaust. Amichai occasionally referred to her in his poems as [...] "Little Ruth".

He instead saw Brody get out and walk to the rear, apparently trying to free it. [...] "What struck me was how calm she was—she didn't seem to be panicking, or in a hurry at all, even though the gate was down," [...] he said later. [...] "She wasn't in a hurry at all, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> known that a train was coming." [...] Brody looked at him, and he motioned to {{her to come back}} in his direction, although he allows that she may not have seen him due to the glare from his headlights. Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, seemed to pause as if she was adjusting her seat belt. The train was getting closer and the situation more urgent.

And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry". In an interview with V magazine, Rihanna revealed, [...] "The thing that made me {{fall in love with}} [...] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When you read the lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face." [...] Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single [...] "Only One", a track dedicated to West's daughter North. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on Jay-Z's 2009 single [...] "Run This Town" [...] — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — and West's 2011 single [...] "All of the Lights", a track featuring backup vocals by John Legend, Fergie, and Elton John among others.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her marriage to Nick, Sharon became insecure and felt like <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a child so that Nick would stay tied to her. During this period, Nick hired Sharon's best friend from Madison Grace Turner (Josie Davis) to work at his father's company Newman Enterprises. Sharon became pregnant by deliberately skipping her contraceptive pills, which she confessed to Nikki. Nick asked Sharon to have an abortion. [...] Without his permission, she arranged to have an abortion to save her marriage. However, at the last minute, Nick realized he was wrong and stopped it from happening. Grace's old boyfriend Tony Viscardi (Nick Scotti) arrived in town but she resisted him because she began having fantasies about Nick. Their firstborn baby son Noah Christian Newman was born prematurely on March 3, 1997 after Sharon fell. Noah became ill and nearly died. Believing he would eventually die, Grace (now played by Jennifer Gareis) and Tony tracked down Sharon's long lost eight-year-old daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes) and brought her to town, believing it would help Sharon get through Noah's death. However, once Noah survived, Grace kept Cassie so she could raise her as her own, as her [...] "pet". She did this despite knowing very well Sharon was definitely Cassie's biological mother. [...] Nick became drunk one night after partying with his college friends, the same night Sharon was sick with a cold and Grace was babysitting Noah. Nick entered the nursery and had sex with Grace who he believed was Sharon, leaving him guilt-ridden after he found out it wasn't.|$|E

Ryan was born Gary Moss, and adopted his stage name upon joining the Blackhearts in 1979, in part to cover for {{the fact that he was}} only 15 at the time. Ryan was part of the Los Angeles punk scene and had played bass with local artists Top Jimmy and Rik L. Rik. He had been a fan of the Runaways and Jett for years. Jett recognized him at the audition and he was in. Ryan in turn recommended guitarist Eric Ambel, who was also at the time part of Rik L. Rik.
