There is a 32-bit B register too, which is most commonly used together with the A register as a 64-bit BA register for double precision floating point operations. A 16-bit X register is used mainly for array indexing, and two 16-bit Y and Z registers are used as 16-bit pointers. A 16-bit L register points to function local data, and a G register always contains zero {{which can be used}} as a 16-bit global pointer, and also an 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit zero value. The 16-bit S (<b>sequence)</b> <b>register</b> points to the next instruction to be obeyed. The 8 bit EC register contains condition codes bits. (Some of this is illustrated in the much simpler instruction set of the GEC 2050.) A read-only keys register allows programs to read the value set on the front panel toggle switches (keys) by the operations staff. No 32-bit PAS pointer register exists—32-bit PAS pointers always reside in memory in the 16-bit CST address space, and are accessed by using a 16-bit pointer. There is no instruction set support for a stack. There are a number of registers inaccessible to programs which are used by Nucleus, such as the hardware segment registers which point to the running process's 4 CSTs and master segment and PAS segments, and the system tables.|$|E

40|$|Sequence-specific protein {{recognition}} of single-stranded nucleic acids {{is critical for}} many fundamental cellular processes, such as DNA replication, DNA repair, transcription, translation, recombination, apoptosis and telomere maintenance. To explore the mechanisms of sequence-specific ssDNA recognition, we determined the crystal structures of 10 different non-cognate ssDNAs complexed with the Oxytricha nova telomere end-binding protein (OnTEBP) and evaluated their corresponding binding affinities (PDB ID codes 1 PH 1 – 1 PH 9 and 1 PHJ). The thermodynamic and structural effects of these sequence perturbations {{could not have been}} predicted based solely upon the cognate structure. OnTEBP accommodates non-cognate nucleotides by both subtle adjustments and surprisingly large structural rearrangements in the ssDNA. In two complexes containing ssDNA intermediates that occur during telomere extension by telomerase, entire nucleotides are expelled from the complex. Concurrently, the <b>sequence</b> <b>register</b> of the ssDNA shifts to re-establish a more cognate-like pattern. This phenomenon, termed nucleotide shuffling, may be of general importance in protein {{recognition of}} single-stranded nucleic acids.

We previously reported the structure of an autoinhibited ZAP- 70 variant in which two regulatory tyrosine residues (315 and 319) in the SH 2 -kinase linker were replaced by phenylalanine. We now present a crystal structure of ZAP- 70 in which Tyr 315 and Tyr 319 are not mutated, leading to the recognition of a five-residue <b>sequence</b> <b>register</b> error in the SH 2 -kinase linker of the original crystallographic model. The revised model identifies distinct roles for these two tyrosines. As seen in a recently reported structure of the related tyrosine kinase Syk, Tyr 315 of ZAP- 70 {{is part of a}} hydrophobic interface between the regulatory apparatus and the kinase domain, and the integrity of this interface would be lost upon engagement of doubly phosphorylated peptides by the SH 2 domains. Tyr 319 is not necessarily dislodged by SH 2 engagement, which activates ZAP- 70 onlỹ 5 -fold in vitro. In contrast, phosphorylation by Lck activates ZAP- 70 ̃ 100 -fold. This difference is due to the ability of Tyr 319 to suppress ZAP- 70 activity even when the SH 2 domains are dislodged from the kinase domain, providing stringent control of ZAP- 70 activity downstream of Lck. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology...|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{pressure}} on residue interactions, intramolecular or intermolecular, {{that are important}} for protein structure or function can lead to covariance between the two positions. Recent methodological advances allow much more accurate contact predictions {{to be derived from}} this evolutionary covariance signal. The practical application of contact predictions has largely been confined to structural bioinformatics, yet, as this work seeks to demonstrate, the data can be of enormous value to the structural biologist working in X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM or NMR. Integrative structural bioinformatics packages such as Rosetta can already exploit contact predictions in a variety of ways. The contribution of contact predictions begins at construct design, where structural domains may need to be expressed separately and contact predictions can help to predict domain limits. Structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) benefits from contact predictions in diverse ways: in difficult cases, more accurate search models can be constructed using ab initio modelling when predictions are available, while intermolecular contact predictions can allow the construction of larger, oligomeric search models. Furthermore, MR using supersecondary motifs or large-scale screens against the PDB can exploit information, such as the parallel or antiparallel nature of any β-strand pairing in the target, that can be inferred from contact predictions. Contact information will be particularly valuable in the determination of lower resolution structures by helping to assign <b>sequence</b> <b>register.</b> In large complexes, contact information may allow the identity of a protein responsible for a certain region of density to be determined and then assist in the orientation of an available model within that density. In NMR, predicted contacts can provide long-range information to extend the upper size limit of the technique in a manner analogous but complementary to experimental methods. Finally, predicted contacts can distinguish between biologically relevant interfaces and mere lattice contacts in a final crystal structure, and have potential in the identification of functionally important regions and in foreseeing the consequences of mutations...|$|E

Despite {{a large number of}} functions that have been ascribed to TERRA, little is known about its biogenesis. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the molecular structure of TERRA. We identify biochemically distinct TERRA complexes, and we describe TERRA regulation during the cell cycle. Moreover, we demonstrate that TERRA 5 � ends contain 7 -methylguanosine cap structures and that the poly(A) tail, present on a fraction of TERRA transcripts, contributes to their stability. Poly(A) � TERRA, but not poly(A) � TERRA, is associated with chromatin, possibly reflecting distinct biological roles of TERRA ribonucleoprotein complexes. In support of this idea, poly(A) � and poly(A) � TERRA molecules end with distinct <b>sequence</b> <b>registers.</b> We also determine that the bulk of 3 �-terminal UUAGGG repeats have an average length of 200 bases, indicating that the length heterogeneity of TERRA likely stems from its subtelomeric regions.

The S. cerevisiae has 20 genes that encode hexose transporter proteins. Among these gene families, seven genes HXT 7 -HXT 1 have important an role in alcohol production.

Materials and methods: In this research, isolation of HXT 6 gene by specific primers via PCR technology was achieved. The amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector and transformed to Escherichia coli and sequence analysis was carried out. Results: The nucleotide sequence of open reading frame of HXT 6 gene revealed a 1713 bp long with a deduced amino acid of 570 residues.
