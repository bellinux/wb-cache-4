It stated that the finding had been reviewed by a Crown prosecutor and that no wrongdoing was found. The families of two of the deceased expressed disapproval of the decision and indicated that they may bring a lawsuit against several of the involved parties, though others have publicly stated that they accepted the decision. The chief coroner of the province stated that a provincial inquest was possible, though it would take <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to any decision on the matter. No decision on whether or not to have an inquest was made for over a month.|$|E

The definitive surface-to-air missile project, Lark, was expected to take <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to fruition, so a simpler missile, based on existing parts, was proposed by the Naval Air Material Unit.|$|E
25|$|After {{several hours}} of intense combat, Braddock was shot off his horse, and {{effective}} resistance collapsed. Colonel Washington, although he had no official position {{in the chain of}} command, was able to impose and maintain some order and formed a rear guard, which allowed the remants of the force to disengage. This earned him the sobriquet Hero of the Monongahela, by which he was toasted, and established his fame for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

25|$|With Transport for London {{purchasing}} fifty Routemasters {{and having}} them thoroughly rebuilt in 2001/02, {{it appeared that}} the Routemasters would be around for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> In February 2003, route 10 was split, with the Kings Cross to Hammersmith section converted to OMO operation and the Archway to Marble Arch section remaining Routemaster-operated as route 390. In the same month route 36 was curtailed between Lewisham and New Cross and duplicated by route 436 between New Cross and Paddington, operated by Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses.|$|E
25|$|Although the region's large {{industries}} {{have been affected}} by the Great Recession, the Inland Empire is projected to remain California's fastest-growing region for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> The area is also projected to remain one of the least educated areas of the state with the lowest average in annual wages in the country. A 2006 study of salaries in 51 metropolitan areas of the country ranked the Inland Empire second to last, with an average annual wage of $36,924. However, inexpensive land prices and innovative institutional support networks have attracted some small businesses and technology startups into the area.|$|E
25|$|Ellenborough Park is a {{large area}} of parkland in Weston-super-Mare. The land was owned in 1855 by two tenants in common, who sold off parts of the land for the {{building}} of houses, and granted rights to {{the owners of the}} houses to enjoy the parkland which remained. The land was enjoyed for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> until 1955, when Judge Danckwerts delivered his decision on the case which arose. Part of the problem arose out {{of the fact that the}} War Office had taken possession of the land during World War II, and compensation was due to be paid to the owners of the properties built on land surrounding the land which had been occupied during the war under the Compensation Defence Act 1939, section 2 (1).|$|E

60|$|He {{was very}} grave and very gentle, when Sally was {{presented}} to him. His opinion of the injury to her bosom relieved the anxiety of Amelius: there might be pain for <b>some</b> little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> {{but there were no}} serious consequences to fear. Having written his prescription, and having put several questions to Sally, the surgeon sent her back, with marked kindness of manner, to wait for Amelius in the patients' room.|$|R
500|$|The Spectators {{literary}} reviewer, Anita Brookner, {{based on}} her reading of the novel in the original French, described the book as a [...] "masterly novel...diabolically (and I use the word advisedly) clever. It is also impressive, not merely {{as an act of}} impersonation but perhaps above all for the fiendish diligence with which it is carried out...presuppose(s) formidable research {{on the part of the}} author, who is American, educated in France and writing fluent, idiomatic and purposeful French. This tour de force, which not everyone will welcome, outclasses all other fictions and will continue to do so for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> No summary can do it justice." [...] The Observer 's Paris correspondent, Jason Burke, praised the book as an [...] "extraordinary Holocaust novel asks what it is that turns normal people into mass killers," [...] adding that [...] "notwithstanding the controversial subject matter, this is an extraordinarily powerful novel." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{battle was}} {{undoubtedly}} {{a victory for}} the British; four French ships of the line, a fourth-rate and a frigate were destroyed and much of the remainder of the Brest fleet badly damaged and requiring extensive repairs; Océan and Foudroyant were in a particularly poor state. French casualties in the engagement are not known with certainty, but are estimated at 150–200, while British losses were only 13 killed and 30 wounded. Allemand later wrote that most significant damage resulting from the battle was to the morale of the French fleet; he wrote that [...] "the greater part are disheartened; every day I hear them lamenting their situation, and speaking in praise of their enemy." [...] another French commentator told a British officer that the French sailors [...] "had now no security from the English in their harbours, and they expected we should next go into Brest and take out their fleet". [...] No British ships suffered more than minor damage in the two weeks of combat, and the fleet could return to its blockade with the knowledge that the Brest fleet was neutralised for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and confined to Rochefort, although a powerful squadron was still under construction at Rochefort, where the defences had been swiftly repaired. This was the last time during the Napoleonic Wars that a significant French fleet was able to put to sea from the Atlantic ports; historian Richard Woodman describes it as the [...] "biggest scare from a break-out French fleet in the post-Trafalgar period." [...] Without naval support, the French colonies in the Caribbean were isolated, blockaded, invaded and captured shortly afterwards.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm sure I'm {{very much}} obliged, sir," [...] said Crabwitz, putting {{out his hand}} and taking the cheque. He felt that his master had got the better of him, and he was still a little melancholy on that account.

60|$|My dear Sir, I {{congratulate you}} on having fixed {{your name in}} history as the first free-State {{governor}} of Louisiana. Now {{you are about to}} have a convention, which, among other things, will probably define the elective franchise. I barely suggest for your private consideration, whether some of the coloured people may not be let in--as, for instance, the very intelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks. They would probably help, in <b>some</b> trying <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>to</b> keep the jewel of liberty within the family of freedom. But this is only a suggestion, not to the public, but to you alone.|$|R

2500|$|There {{is strong}} modern {{scholarly}} consensus that Uinniau (thus [...] "Ninian") and Finnian of Moville {{are the same}} person. In one Vita on Finnian of Molville, the Tudwallus of the Vita Niniani is realised as Túathal Máelgarb, king of Tara. Despite Ailred's work, {{the cult of the}} original Uinniau remained strong in south-western Scotland for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> an important centre being Kilwinning (from the Gaelic for [...] "church of Uinniau") where [...] "Saint Winnin" [...] or [...] "Saint Finan" [...] was worshipped into the later Middle Ages. Nevertheless, supported by a bishopric, the cult of Saint [...] "Ninian" [...] took {{a life of its own}} after Ailred's work, becoming one of the most venerated cults in Scotland in the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
2500|$|While {{functioning}} normally, coal plants, {{which are}} the predominate source of electricity in the U.S. (a trend {{that is expected to}} continue for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> as renewable energy alone cannot cheaply supply constant base load power) shorten nearly 24,000 lives a year in the United States with 2,800 from lung cancer alone. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that a range of 13,000 to 34,000 preventable premature deaths could be avoided by the reductions in PM2.5 and ozone produced by coal power plants. In 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations calculated that coal particulates pollution cause approximately one million deaths annually across the world, [...] which is approximately one third of all premature deaths related to all air pollution sources.|$|E

5000|$|Many in {{the labor}} {{movement}} later argued that UPIU and the AFL-CIO had [...] "sold out" [...] Local 14.

2500|$|Primate Visions {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} books to come along in the last twenty years. Historians of science have begun to write more externalist histories, acknowledging the possibilities of a science profoundly integrated with ongoing social agenda. Haraway's history of primatology in the twentieth century sets new standards for this approach, standards that will not be surpassed for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> The book is important to students of science, feminists, historians, and anyone else interested in how the complex systems of race, gender, and science intertwine to produce supposedly objective versions of the [...] "truth." [...] This analysis of primatology is at once a complex, interdisciplinary, and deeply scholarly history and an imaginative, provocative analysis of the working of science in late twentieth-century Euro-America.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these advances, {{there are}} certain skills to which humans will be better suited than {{machines}} for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{and the question is}} how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and {{led to the development of}} new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the [...] "man-robot merger". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic [...] "human-robot collaboration".|$|E
2500|$|The good press {{coverage}} gained Munch {{the attention of}} influential patrons Albert Kollman and Max Linde. He described the turn of events in his diary, [...] "After twenty years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and a bright door opens up for me." [...] However, despite this positive change, Munch's self-destructive and erratic behavior involved him first with a violent quarrel with another artist, then with an accidental shooting {{in the presence of}} Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings. His paintings Still Life (The Murderess) and The Death of Marat I, done in 1906-7, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after effects.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, XEYZ-AM, {{a station}} which Rivas partly owned for <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> air, and in 1958, Rivas bought {{competing}} station XERO (now XHERO-FM 98.9).

60|$|The {{explanation}} was difficult, {{but it was}} achieved at last, and then the young lady broached the subject of leaving the book unused.
