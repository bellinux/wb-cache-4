[...] The Jayhawks, led by Manning (31 points, 18 rebounds, 5 steals, 2 blocked shots), caught up with them around the 11 minute mark.

2500|$|David Thompson, an All-American {{player from}} North Carolina State, called the NIT [...] "a loser's tournament" [...] in 1975. NC State, {{which had been}} the {{previous}} year's NCAA champion, refused {{to play in the}} tournament that year, following the precedent set by ACC rival Maryland the previous season after losing the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game to the top-ranked Wolfpack. In succeeding years, other teams such as Oklahoma State, Louisville, Georgia Tech, Georgetown, and LSU have declined to play in the NIT when they did not make the NCAA tournament. One such team was Maryland; after being rejected by the NCAA selection committee in 2006, head coach Gary Williams announced that 19-11 Maryland would not go to the NIT, only to be told that the university had previously agreed to use Comcast Center as a venue for the NIT. The Terrapins were eliminated in the first round by the Manhattan College Jaspers. In 2008, however, Williams announced that if invited, the Terps would play, because it would serve as a chance to further develop six freshman players on his squad and to give <b>senior</b> <b>forward</b> James Gist more exposure. At UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, there are individual championship banners for all 11 NCAA titles, various other banners touting many other NCAA and other tournament championships for other sports, but no mention of UCLA's 1985 NIT championship.|$|E

50|$|The {{position}} is very strenuous, and players who specialise as CHFs often have unnaturally shortened careers—Dermott Brereton {{is a good}} example of a great player worn out too quickly. In the modern game, coaches preserve these players, playing them in a variety of relief positions, often in the opposite position at centre half-back; this typically preserves the longevity of their career. A good example is James Hird, who often played on the half-back flank towards the end of his career. While others may only play in CHF only when there is a more <b>senior</b> full <b>forward</b> ahead of them in the depth chart.|$|R
