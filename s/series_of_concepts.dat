2500|$|The {{reason why}} this {{subsumption}} {{takes place in a}} <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> is that Hegel's method, in his Science of Logic and his Encyclopedia, is to begin with basic concepts like Being and Nothing, and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned. In this manner, a solution that is reached, in principle, in the account of [...] "true infinity" [...] in the Science of Logics chapter on [...] "Quality,", is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to [...] "Spirit" [...] and [...] "ethical life", in the third volume of the Encyclopedia.|$|E

2500|$|Bakhtin had a {{difficult}} life and career, and few of his works were published in an authoritative form during his lifetime. As a result, there is substantial disagreement over matters that are normally taken for granted: in which discipline he worked (was he a philosopher or literary critic?), how to periodize his work, and even which texts he wrote (see below). He is known for a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> {{that have been used}} and adapted in a number of disciplines: dialogism, the carnivalesque, the chronotope, heteroglossia and [...] "outsidedness" [...] (the English translation of a Russian term vnenakhodimost, sometimes rendered into English—from French rather than from Russian—as [...] "exotopy"). Together these concepts outline a distinctive philosophy of language and culture that has at its center the claims that all discourse is in essence a dialogical exchange and that this endows all language with a particular ethical or ethico-political force.|$|E

Survey-based World War II studies on leadership and group morale sparked further confidence that such properties could be investigated and measured. Later, Frederick Herzberg concluded that positive motivation is driven by managers giving their employees developmental opportunities, activity he termed 'vertical enrichment'.|$|E
