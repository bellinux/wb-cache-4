5|$|From the 16th {{century the}} Commonwealth {{suffered}} {{a series of}} Tatar invasions. In the 16th century Cossack raids began descending on the Black <b>Sea</b> <b>area</b> Turkish settlements and Tatar lands. In retaliation the Ottoman Empire directed their vassal Tatar forces, based in Crimea or Budjak areas, against the Commonwealth regions of Podolia and Red Ruthenia. The borderland area to the south-east {{was in a state}} of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people had been captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate.|$|E
5|$|Further RAN {{involvement}} included HMAS Yarra and HMAS Torrens {{who were}} both {{also involved in}} the Black <b>Sea</b> <b>area,</b> being the first two destroyers on station at Novorossiisk and Batum. HMAS Parramatta carried despatches and mail between Constantinople and Sebastopol {{from the time of}} the Turkish surrender until early January 1919. Parramatta also escorted a group of Russian warships, which were handed over to the anti-Bolshevik forces at Sebastopol in late November 1918. All these operations appear to have been free of incident.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the question of}} classifying the <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> as <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> difficult for navi-gation, unrestricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> restricted by land (bottom or shore). Most of all, the article depicts the characteristics of restricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas.</b> It presents the attempt to define {{in a new way}} the following notions: ‘safety of shipping’, ‘safety of navigation’, ‘risk of navigation’, ‘risk of collisions’, ‘navigational obstacle’, and ‘sea area difficult for naviga-tion’. In this paper author also presents methods {{that can be used for}} estimating safety of navigation (navigational risk) in the restricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> by means of the model of the ship’s domain. The essence of the method suggested in the thesis is the systematic approach to sea vessel operation in the aspect of estimating its safety when navigating in restricted <b>sea</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Schwaben {{and the rest of}} her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. After it reached full combat readiness, the Squadron was employed both as a defense force in the German Bight—usually stationed in the mouth of the Elbe—and for operations in the Baltic. Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. In May 1915, IV Squadron, including Schwaben, was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>area.</b> Schwaben and her sisters were then based in Kiel. During this period, she served as the flagship of the second command admiral of the Squadron, KAdm Alberts.|$|E
5|$|Allied air {{and naval}} attacks against Japanese {{shipping}} in the South China Sea were expanded during early 1945 as additional USAAF units moved into {{bases in the}} Philippines and other demands on these forces permitted. Land-based patrol aircraft and medium bombers operated over the sea from liberated areas of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies from February. While Allied submarines and these aircraft failed to prevent the escape of the Ise-class battleships when they sailed for Japan during Operation Kita in mid-February, the medium bombers were sinking large numbers of Japanese merchant ships {{by the end of}} the month. Medium and heavy bombers also raided Japanese-held ports across the South China <b>Sea</b> <b>area.</b> As a result of the air and submarine attacks, the Japanese ceased sending ships through the South China Sea in April.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{is rich in}} Paleolithic remains, holding {{evidence}} of inhabitance by Homo erectus, Neanderthal and modern humans. The oldest {{evidence of}} human habitation dates back around 250,000 years. The Kharanah area in eastern Jordan has evidence of human huts from about 20,000 years ago. Other Paleolithic sites include Pella and Al-Azraq. In the Neolithic period, several settlements began to develop, most notably an agricultural community called 'Ain Ghazal {{in what is now}} Amman, one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in the Near East. Plaster statues estimated to date back to around 7250 BC were uncovered there, and are among the oldest large human statues ever found. Villages of Bab edh-Dhra in the Dead <b>Sea</b> <b>area,</b> Tal Hujayrat Al-Ghuzlan in Aqaba and Tulaylet Ghassul in the Jordan Valley all date to the Chalcolithic period.|$|E

5|$|Like in Sandakan, {{people in}} Tawau have always {{relied on the}} sea for their sustenance. Every day, {{hundreds}} of deep sea trawlers and tuckboats {{can be seen at}} the Cowie Bay. Barter trade also happens in the <b>sea</b> <b>area</b> around Tawau. The Tawau marine zone are one of Sabah four marine zones, with the other been in Sandakan, Kudat and the west coast. A great variety of high-grade fishes and all kinds of crustaceans were found in abundance in the sea and waterways around Tawau. Prawn farming has become largest sea economic source for the district. The oldest and largest prawn farm were located in this area together with six frozen shrimp processing plants.|$|E
5|$|Vitus Bering {{had been}} a {{prominent}} sailor in Russia. After successful expeditions in 1725, 1728, and 1730, Bering was sent to explore {{what is now the}} Bering <b>Sea</b> <b>area</b> of the Pacific in 1740. He soon settled on Kamchatka, where he started a settlement and built two additional vessels, dubbed St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1741 Bering and his company started towards North America, but were stalled by a storm and in being delayed were forced to take land. During the storm they could not make out the Alaskan coast. The storm proved too powerful so the ships turned around, along the way charting several of the Aleutians, including Gareloi. Since then, it has been barely studied, resulting in a fragmentary knowledge of its eruptions and possibly even unrecorded episodes.|$|E
5|$|The Zarubintsy culture circle, in {{existence}} roughly from 200 BC to 150 AD, extended along {{the middle and}} upper Dnieper and its tributary the Pripyat River, but also left traces of settlements in parts of Polesie and the upper Bug River basin. The main distinguished local groups were the Polesie group, the Middle Dnieper group and the Upper Dnieper group. The Zarubintsy culture developed from the Milograd culture {{in the northern part of}} its range and from the local Scythian populations in the more southern part. The Polesie group's origin was also influenced by the Pomeranian and Jastorf cultures. The Zarubintsy culture and its beginnings were moderately affected by La Tène culture and the Black <b>Sea</b> <b>area</b> (trade with the Greek cities provided imported items) centers of civilization in the earlier stages, but not much by Roman influence later on, and accordingly its economic development was lagging behind that of other early Roman period cultures. Cremation of bodies was practiced, with the human remains and burial gifts including metal decorations, small in number and limited in variety, placed in pits.|$|E

5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 3February, Terra Nova arrived {{unexpectedly}} in the Bay of Whales. She had sailed from New Zealand on 29November 1910 and had arrived in McMurdo Sound early in January. After landing Scott and his main party there, Terra Nova had taken a party of six men, led by Victor Campbell, eastward to King Edward VII Land. This group intended to explore this then-unknown territory, but had been prevented by sea ice from approaching the shore. The ship was sailing westward along the Barrier edge in search of a possible landing place when it encountered Fram. Scott had previously speculated that Amundsen might make his base in the Weddell <b>Sea</b> <b>area,</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the continent; this proof that the Norwegians would be starting the race for the pole with a 60 nautical mile advantage was an alarming prospect for the British. The two groups behaved civilly towards each other; Campbell and his officers Harry Pennell and George Murray Levick breakfasted aboard Fram, and reciprocated with lunch on the Terra Nova. Amundsen was relieved to learn that Terra Nova had no wireless radio, since that might have imperilled his strategy to be first with the news of a polar victory. He was worried, however, by a remark of Campbell's that implied that Scott's motorised sledges were working well. Nevertheless, he offered the British party a site alongside Framheim as a base for the exploration of King Edward VII Land. Campbell turned the offer down, and sailed for McMurdo Sound to inform Scott of Amundsen's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Dogger Bank, the Admiralty saw {{the need}} for {{dedicated}} battlecruiser squadrons in British waters, and earmarked Australia to lead one of them. On 11 January, while en route to Jamaica, Australia was diverted to Gibraltar. Reaching there on 20 January, the battlecruiser was ordered to proceed to Plymouth, where she arrived on 28 January and paid off for a short refit. The docking was completed on 12 February, and Australia reached Rosyth on 17 February after sailing through a gale. She was made flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (2nd BCS) of the Battlecruiser Fleet, part of the British Grand Fleet, on 22 February. Vice Admiral Patey was appointed to command this squadron. In early March, to avoid a conflict of seniority between Patey {{and the leader of}} the Battlecruiser Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty, Patey was reassigned to the West Indies, and Rear Admiral William Pakenham raised his flag aboard Australia. British and Allied ships deployed to the North Sea were tasked with protecting the British Isles from German naval attack, and keeping the German High Seas Fleet penned in European waters through a distant blockade while trying to lure them into a decisive battle. During her time with the 2nd BCS, Australias operations primarily consisted of training exercises (either in isolation or with other ships), patrols of the North <b>Sea</b> <b>area</b> in response to actual or perceived German movements, and some escort work. These duties were so monotonous, one sailor was driven insane.|$|E
