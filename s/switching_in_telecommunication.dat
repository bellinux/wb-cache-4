30|$|Chalcogenide glasses (ChGs) {{are typical}} representatives of non-oxide glasses. ChGs are very {{promising}} versatile functional materials {{for use in}} optoelectronics as high-speed optical elements, for applications such as data processing devices, electronic switches, and other optical elements. ChGs possess unique characteristics which are different from other glasses: photoinduced phenomena, broad optical transmission window, high linear refractive index (n[*]≈[*] 2 – 3), and high optical non-linearity (around two orders of magnitude higher than silica, this makes them suitable for ultra-fast <b>switching</b> <b>in</b> <b>telecommunication</b> systems). These materials and their properties were reviewed {{in a number of}} books and review papers [1 – 6]. ChGs transmit to longer wavelengths in the IR than silica and fluoride glasses. ChGs based on sulfur, selenium, and tellurium typically transmit up to around 10, 15, and 20  μm, respectively [5]. In spite {{of a wide range of}} compositions in binary, ternary, and more complex systems of chalcogenide glasses, the problem of modification of parameters still exists. Such modifications can be performed partially by the special technologies (cooling rate, thin film deposition, exposure by light, e-beams or ion beams), by modification, or by creating complex artificial structures [7 – 13].|$|E

On the other hand the law expresses nothing but the high versatility of the underlying usually silicon based technology. A huge variety of applications where an electromagnetic wave experiences a spatial-temporal modulation makes use of this technology: High resolution as well as ultra-compact displays, optical <b>switches</b> <b>in</b> <b>telecommunication</b> as well as data storage devices, spectrometers e. g. for quality control, as well as adaptive optics and pattern generation to mention only a few. The applications completely differ {{with regard to the}} requirements in almost all aspects. The most important drivers to use silicon based micro-optical modulators are high accuracy, high bandwidth and high miniaturization. A continuous further development of the technology can be reported. Novel optical, mechanical and electrical working principles are investigated to meet future requirements. After a short overview of the most typical applications of silicon based micro-optical modulators the high versatility of this technology is detailed by means of selected devices and applications.

As {{part of this}} project, researchers in the Microelectronics and Computer System (MACS) Laboratory at McGill University are developing a reconfigurable free-space optical backplane architecture capable of supporting terabits per second (Tbps) throughput. The optical backplane can be dynamically reconfigured to support the <b>switching</b> schemes used <b>in</b> both multiprocessor systems and <b>in</b> <b>telecommunication</b> systems. <b>In</b> this thesis, we will consider {{the performance of the}} optical backplane when it is configured to support a 160 Gigabit per second (and a 640 Gigabit per second) ATM <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> a standard <b>telecommunication</b> environment. <b>In</b> this thesis, we assume that the backplane is configured to support a traditional 3 -stage crossbar switching system, with electrical <b>switches</b> <b>in</b> the first and third stages, and optical <b>switches</b> <b>in</b> the second stage.

40|$|Differential {{interconnects}} are extensively used in high-speed {{digital circuits}} at fast data rates and in environments of high noise like backplanes. For such applications they are preferred over single-ended lines owing {{to their ability}} to reject common-mode noise. Differential schemes like Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) are used for wireless base stations and ATM <b>switches</b> <b>in</b> <b>telecommunication</b> applications, flat panel displays and servers and for system-level clock distribution. LVDS applications use data rates from 100 Mbps to about 1. 5 Gbps and are expected to be highly immune to noise. However, noise will also be injected into differential signals at these high data rates, if there are irregularities in the interconnect setup. These anomalies may be via transitions from differential lines through power planes in power distribution systems, via stubs, asymmetric lengths of differential lines, different transition points for each of the differential vias etc. The differential setup is expected to be immune to such imbalances; however, investigation of these discontinuities indicate that sufficient signal energy can be leaked to power distribution networks (PDN) of packages and boards. The effect of this energy loss was examined in time-domain and was found to cause signal integrity effects like jitter. Irregular differential structures were compared with the equivalent single-ended configuration and symmetrical perfect differential lines. This thesis work quantifies signal to power coupling caused by irregular differential structures in the presence of PDN planes in frequency domain. Presence of noise in differential signaling is verified through a set of test vehicles. The jitter induced as a result of signal to power coupling from differential lines was also investigated. M. S.

50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange must run continuously without interruption at all times, by implementing a fault-tolerant design. Early trials of electronics and {{computers in the}} control sub systems of an exchange were successful and resulted {{in the development of}} fully electronic systems, <b>in</b> which the <b>switching</b> network was also electronic. A trial system with stored program control was installed in Morris, Illinois in 1960. It used a flying-spot store with a word size of 18 bits for semi-permanent program and parameter storage, and a barrier-grid memory for random access working memory. The world’s first electronic switching system for permanent production use, the No.1 ESS, was commissioned by AT&T at Succasunna, New Jersey, in May 1965. By 1974, AT&T had installed 475 No. 1ESS systems. In the 1980s SPC displaced electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>in</b> the <b>telecommunication</b> industry, hence the term lost all but historical interest. Today SPC is a standard feature in all electronic exchanges.|$|R

The trend of meeting large bandwidth and strict latency requirements in both global on-chip and off-chip communication face critical challenges in maintaining a sustainable performance-per-watt.

40|$|Transmission and <b>switching</b> <b>in</b> digital <b>telecommunication</b> {{networks}} require {{distribution of}} precise time signals among the nodes. Commercial systems usually adopt a master-slave (MS) clock distribution strategy building slave nodes with phase-locked loop (PLL) circuits. PLLs {{are responsible for}} synchronizing their local oscillations with signals from master nodes, providing reliable clocks in all nodes. The dynamics of a PLL is described by an ordinary nonlinear differential equation, with order one plus the order of its internal linear low-pass filter. Second-order loops are commonly used because their synchronous state is asymptotically stable and the lock-in range and design parameters are expressed by a linear equivalent system [Gardner FM. Phaselock techniques. New York: John Wiley & Sons: 1979]. In spite of being simple and robust, second-order PLLs frequently present double-frequency terms in PD output {{and it is very}} difficult to adapt a first-order filter in order to cut off these components [Piqueira JRC, Monteiro LHA. Considering second-harmonic terms in the operation of the phase detector for second order phase-locked loop. IEEE Trans Circuits Syst [2003; 50 (6) : 805 - 9; Piqueira JRC, Monteiro LHA. All-pole phase-locked loops: calculating lock-in range by using Evan`s root-locus. Int J Control 2006; 79 (7) : 822 - 9]. Consequently, higher-order filters are used, resulting in nonlinear loops with order greater than 2. Such systems, due to high order and nonlinear terms, depending on parameters combinations, can present some undesirable behaviors, resulting from bifurcations, as error oscillation and chaos, decreasing synchronization ranges. In this work, we consider a second-order Sallen-Key loop filter [van Valkenburg ME. Analog filter design. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston; 1982] implying a third order PLL The resulting lock-in range of the third-order PLL is determined by two bifurcation conditions: a saddle-node and a Hopf.
