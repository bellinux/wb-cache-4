5|$|Throughout the game, {{he has a}} {{rivalry with}} Seifer Almasy. The opening {{sequence}} features the duel where <b>Squall</b> receives his facial scar (giving Seifer a mirror image), and scenes where <b>Squall</b> and Seifer are supposed to cooperate are characterized by squabbles between the cadets. Although Seifer later allies with the Sorceress (requiring <b>Squall</b> to fight him several times), <b>Squall</b> still feels a camaraderie with him.|$|E
5|$|After Ultimecia is defeated, {{the time}} and space that she had absorbed begin to return to normal, pulling Squall's comrades back into their places in the timeline, while <b>Squall</b> returns to the orphanage and meets a younger Edea. Since {{she does not want}} to involve the children, she absorbs the dying Ultimecia's powers as part of the cycle of sorceresses (a sorceress must pass her powers to a {{successor}} before she can die peacefully). <b>Squall</b> plants the ideas for Garden and SeeD in her mind, creating an origin paradox: <b>Squall</b> must become leader of Balamb Garden so he can pass its version of SeeD tradition to Edea, who teaches them to her husband Cid (who co-founds Balamb Garden, which admits Edea's orphans—including <b>Squall).</b>|$|E
5|$|And then it grew dark {{again with}} a <b>squall,</b> this time even {{stronger}} and worse than before.

25|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{normally have}} <b>squalls</b> coincident with spiral bands of greater curvature than many mid-latitude systems {{due to their}} smaller size.

25|$|In {{most parts}} of the country, <b>squalls</b> are called subasko and are {{characterized}} by heavy rains driven by blustery winds. Local fishermen at sea are often on the lookout for signs of impending <b>squalls</b> on the open water and rush to shore at its early signs.|$|R

5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into <b>squall</b> lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the <b>squall</b> line, and may lead to acceleration of the <b>squall</b> line itself.|$|E
5|$|During {{one of the}} cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, <b>Squall</b> is impaled by the Edea in battle. This {{created a}} theory that <b>Squall</b> dies in battle. When asked about this, Kitase laughed at this and denied this theory. However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff would think of changing elements from the story.|$|E
5|$|Selphie first appears {{when running}} into <b>Squall</b> while late for class. She asks <b>Squall</b> {{to show her}} around because she {{recently}} transferred. During the Dollet exam, Selphie joins Squall's team after Seifer abandons them. She becomes a SeeD with <b>Squall</b> and Zell, and the three are assigned to the same team. When Galbadia launches missiles at Trabia Garden, she reacts with outrage and helps destroy the missile base. Throughout the game, she revisits her childhood closeness with Irvine, who serves as her copilot on the Ragnarok.|$|E

5|$|The <b>squall</b> line finally overtook the supercells {{just after}} midnight on March2, after putting down 37 tornadoes that day. As the <b>squall</b> line overtook the cells, a few tornadoes — all EF0 — took place {{overnight}} in Florida and extreme southern Georgia within the <b>squall</b> line, before the severe weather emerged in the Atlantic Ocean that morning. The final tornado was a landfalling waterspout in the Outer Banks of North Carolina late that morning. In addition to the tornadoes, widespread straight-line wind damage from microbursts were also reported, along with scattered large hail, the largest of which were the size of baseballs.|$|E
5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature <b>squall</b> lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a <b>squall</b> line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the <b>squall</b> line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|With Irvine, Nomura {{tried to}} strike a balance between not overshadowing <b>Squall</b> and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than <b>Squall.</b> Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E

5000|$|Hay was {{convinced}} by Ken Starratt {{to move to}} Athens, Georgia, from Maine after making a trip to Athens in the late 1970s and surveying the blossoming music scene. Bob met other local musicians including roommate [...] "Big" [...] Al Walsh, Mig Little and Diana Torell and formed the band the <b>Squalls.</b> They were well known for switching instruments and singing duties during their shows. In 1986, they were featured in the movie Athens, GA: Inside Out. The <b>Squalls</b> underwent various lineup changes after Mig Little left the band. They were joined by Mark Cooper Smith, Juan Molina, Paul Hammond and others at various times during their career. The <b>Squalls</b> made a self-released e.p. and single, {{as well as two}} albums for Dog Gone It Records-a label owned by Jefferson Holt, the manager for REM. The <b>Squalls</b> made several trips up and down the East coast of the U.S. and a trip through the mid-West before disbanding.|$|R

5|$|A <b>squall</b> line (also {{known as}} a quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the <b>squall</b> line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature <b>squall</b> lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a <b>squall</b> line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the <b>squall</b> line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the <b>squall</b> line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, <b>Squall</b> {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although <b>Squall</b> remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E

5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the <b>squall</b> line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating <b>squall</b> line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E
5|$|From here, {{a general}} {{thinning}} of a <b>squall</b> line will occur: with winds decaying over time, outflow boundaries weakening updrafts substantially and clouds losing their thickness.|$|E
5|$|In fact, <b>Squall</b> and {{the heroes}} do help Ultimecia start Time Compression, {{but they do}} so to confront her in her own time. After <b>Squall</b> and his party defeat Sorceress Adel, Adel {{transfers}} her power to Rinoa, then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again, and Ellone uses her power to send their consciousness to the past, at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression. At that moment, the heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E

5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in <b>Squall,</b> Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues <b>Squall</b> has through the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} two main {{characters}} was planned {{since the beginning}} of the game's development.

The designers intended Laguna to be more similar to the previous protagonists in the series to complement <b>Squall,</b> who is different from previous main characters. Laguna is ranked seventh in Electronic Gaming Monthlys list of the top ten video game politicians.|$|E
