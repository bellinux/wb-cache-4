50|$|Psychiatric diagnoses such <b>as</b> <b>sluggish</b> {{schizophrenia}} {{were used}} in the USSR for political purposes; the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia was most frequently used for Soviet dissidents. <b>Sluggish</b> schizophrenia <b>as</b> <b>a</b> diagnostic category was created to facilitate the stifling of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tool of oppression {{in the name of a}} political system. American psychiatrist Peter Breggin points out that the term “sluggish schizophrenia” was created to justify involuntary treatment of political dissidents with drugs normally used for psychiatric patients.|$|R

500|$|The first subfossil {{remains of}} Babakotia radofilai were {{discovered}} <b>as</b> part of <b>a</b> series of expeditions following upon discoveries of Jean Radofilao and two Anglo-Malagasy reconnaissance expeditions in 1981 and 1986–7. The {{second wave of}} research was launched in the 1980s by biological anthropologist Elwyn L. Simons who unearthed in 1988 at <b>a</b> cave known <b>as</b> Antsiroandoha in the Ankarana Massif, northern Madagascar a nearly complete skeleton and skull {{in addition to the}} remains of roughly a dozen other individuals. [...] Identified immediately <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sloth</b> lemur (palaeopropithecid) upon its discovery, Babakotia along with Mesopropithecus helped to settle a debate about the relationship between the sloth lemurs, the monkey lemurs (family Archaeolemuridae) and the living indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The larger sloth lemurs, on the other hand, retained a dentition similar to living indriids, yet differed by having more robust and specialized skulls. Babakotia and Mesopropithecus not only shared the indriid dentition, but also the indriid-like skulls, providing evidence that sloth lemurs were most closely related to living indriids, with monkey lemurs <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sister group to both. Furthermore, the discovery of Babakotia helped to demonstrate that the ancestral indriids were not [...] "ricochetal leapers" [...] (bouncing rapidly from tree to tree) like living indriids, but vertical climbers and hanging feeders, and possibly occasional leapers.|$|R

Most Chrysauginae larvae have a sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the metathorax.|$|R
50|$|In China, the {{structure}} of forensic psychiatry was {{to a great extent}} identical to that in the USSR. This is not strange, since psychiatrists of the Moscow Serbsky Institute visited Beijing in 1957 to help their Chinese brethren: the same psychiatrists who promoted the system of political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. As a consequence, diagnostics were not much different than in the Soviet Union. The only difference was that the Soviets preferred <b>sluggish</b> schizophrenia <b>as</b> <b>a</b> diagnosis, and the Chinese generally clove to the diagnosis of paranoia or paranoid schizophrenia. However, the results were the same: long hospitalization in a mental hospital, involuntary treatment with neuroleptics, torture, abuse, all aimed at breaking the victim's will.|$|R
5000|$|His son John II (1432-1458), was {{described}} as [...] "effeminate, but not unattractive" [...] and was reviled by Pope Pius II <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vile evil <b>sloth.</b> He was dominated by two women in his life, both Greek; Helena Palaiologina his wife and Marietta de Patras, his mistress. Supposedly in a fight between these two in the king's presence, the queen bit off her adversary's nose. As the queen was Greek, she was well loved by the Cypriots and the orthodox church.|$|R

The original gorilla [...] "mask" [...] seen in films like The Ape (1940) was replaced with a subtler design with a more mobile jaw. Corrigan later sold his gorilla suits in 1948 and provided training in using them to their new owner, Steve Calvert, a Ciro's bartender. Calvert stepped into Corrigan's paw prints starting with a Jungle Jim film. Despite reports to the contrary, Calvert and Corrigan never appeared together on-screen in an ape costume. Since both Corrigan and Calvert eschewed screen credit playing gorillas, their film credits are often confused; any appearance of the [...] "Corrigan suit" [...] after 1948 is by Calvert.|$|R
40|$|Prevention of {{clotting}} is {{an important}} factor in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to ensure that solute clearance, electrolytes and acid base and fluid balance are controlled. This article will focus attention on the components and design of the CRRT circuit, identifying strategies in the literature which may promote circuit life. It is important that the CRRT circuit incorporates biocompatible materials and is designed in a way which limits turbulent blood flow. Premature clotting is also more likely to occur when blood flow through the circuit is interrupted or <b>sluggish</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of poor vascular access, or when there is increased resistance or obstruction in the circuit. The pre-dilution method of fluid replacement reduces blood viscosity inside the haemofilter and assists in delaying the onset of blood clots by limiting the potential for haemoconcentration. The monitoring and adjustment of the blood level inside the venous bubble or air trap can lessen the effect of blood-air contact and protect the site from excessive clotting. A number of other factors are also considered important as predictors of circuit life in the operation and management of the circuit. They include the choice of access site and design configuration of the catheter device, and the level of competency of nursing staff preparing and monitoring circuit function. Whilst the value of intermittent saline flushing has not been proven to be of benefit in promoting circuit life, it remains to be determined whether the choice in the CRRT mode affects circuit life differently. In conclusion, specific measures in the application of CRRT besides anticoagulation therapy can influence the development of blood clots and the duration of circuit life. This requires the development of evidence-based practice guidelines which include strategies that are known to promote circuit life...|$|R

60|$|But {{the several}} moods of feeling, faintly {{as they were}} marked, through which he had passed, {{occurring}} in so brief an interval of time, had evidently wearied the stranger.

A slumberous veil diffused itself over his countenance, and had an effect, morally speaking, on its naturally delicate and elegant outline, like that which a brooding mist, with no sunshine in it, throws over the features of a landscape. He appeared to become grosser,--almost cloddish. If aught of interest or beauty--even ruined beauty--had heretofore been visible in this man, the beholder might now begin to doubt it, and to accuse his own imagination of deluding him with whatever grace had flickered over that visage, and whatever exquisite lustre had gleamed in those filmy eyes.|$|R
