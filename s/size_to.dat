5|$|At , Cameroon is the world's 53rd-largest country. It is {{slightly}} larger than the nation of Sweden and comparable in <b>size</b> <b>to</b> Papua New Guinea. The country is located in Central and West Africa on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. Cameroon lies between latitudes 1° and 13°N, and longitudes 8° and 17°E.|$|E
5|$|Construction for an {{extension}} to the Main Stand began on 8 December 2014. This extension increased the stadium capacity to 54,074, {{making it one}} of the largest all-seater single stands in European football. There are future plans to expand the Anfield Road Stand which would bring the stadium <b>size</b> <b>to</b> around 59,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite the defeat, the {{soldiers}} were received as heroes in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential disaster for the patriot armies turned into a minor setback. The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada reduced its <b>size</b> <b>to</b> 5,000 soldiers, which was closer to the royalist forces. They took position next to the Maipo River, near Santiago.|$|E

5|$|FRELIMO attack {{groups had}} {{also begun to}} grow in <b>size</b> <b>to</b> include over 100 {{soldiers}} in certain cases, and the insurgents also began to accept women fighters into their ranks. On either October 10 or October 11, 1966, on returning to Tanzania after inspecting the front lines, Filipe Samuel Magaia was shot dead by Lourenço Matola, a fellow FRELIMO guerrilla who {{was said to be}} in the employ of the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|For the 1999–2000 {{season the}} league {{increased}} in <b>size</b> <b>to</b> 22 clubs when two clubs were promoted into the Alliance but none relegated out of it. One of the promoted clubs was Oadby Town of the Leicestershire Senior League, {{the first time}} a team from that league had been promoted into the Alliance. Two years later, the league increased in <b>size</b> <b>to</b> 23 clubs as more teams joined than left, but Stapenhill resigned midway through the 2001–02 season, reverting the number of clubs in the competition back to 22. The league expanded to 24 clubs for the 2003–04 season, at the end of which, for the first time, Alliance clubs were promoted to the Northern Premier League, rather than the Southern League, when Rocester and Willenhall Town joined the more northerly of the two leagues. The following season Coalville Town became the first Alliance team to reach the first round proper of the FA Cup, a feat which was repeated in the 2005–06 season by both Chasetown and Leamington.|$|E

5|$|K–Pg {{boundary}} mammalian {{species were}} generally small, comparable in <b>size</b> <b>to</b> rats; this small size {{would have helped}} them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.|$|E

5|$|On July 19, 2009, {{an impact}} site was {{discovered}} at approximately 216 degrees longitude in System 2.
