5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País. The comedian turned mayor of Reykjavík, Iceland, Jón Gnarr, has gone <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that he would not}} enter a coalition government with anyone who has not watched the series.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a {{striking}} resemblance to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic accident in a small town, is sentenced to work at the town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} talk of {{building}} a replica of the memorial. On 31 May 2008 on Anzac Parade, Canberra, the formal dedication of a site in which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held. A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: going <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that {{they would be willing to}} accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{sense in}} which this kind of {{additivity}} expresses a fundamental postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author goes <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.|$|E
25|$|In September 1640 he {{conveyed}} {{to the king}} at York the petition of the London clergy against the 'etcetera oath', and succeeded in getting it dispensed with. Clarendon in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England goes <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the influence of Burges and Stephen Marshall was greater with both houses of parliament than that of Laud had ever been with the court, a statement which, as Edmund Calamy the Elder observes, 'carries a pretty strong figure in it'.|$|E
25|$|Scotland Office {{minister}} David Mundell, {{the only}} Scottish Conservative MP, initially {{said that it}} would 'take a very great deal of convincing' to make him support the idea, however later came out in stark opposition to the plan, calling it 'betrayal' and stated that he would still run as a Conservative at the next general election whether or not Fraser was successful. Several other senior Conservative figures, including Norman Tebbit and Daniel Hannan supported Fraser's plan, and Daily Mail journalist Peter Hitchens went <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this idea should be adopted by the whole UK Conservative Party in order to re-claim support.|$|E

25|$|If {{a search}} or seizure is {{unlawful}} under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 {{then it is}} also likely to be considered an unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and unreasonableness are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable. Despite this, the courts have said that in terms of the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search. Elias CJ went <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that unlawful searches should automatically be unreasonable. An exception is that where the search is only unlawful on minor or technical grounds it may still be reasonable.|$|E
25|$|When the American Civil War broke out, the Blackwell sisters aided {{in nursing}} efforts. Blackwell sympathized heavily with the North {{due to her}} {{abolitionist}} roots, and even went <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> she would have left the country if the North had compromised {{on the subject of}} slavery. However, Blackwell did meet with some resistance {{on the part of the}} male-dominated United States Sanitary Commission. The male physicians refused to help with the nurse education plan if it involved the Blackwells. In response to the USSC, Blackwell organized with the Woman's Central Relief Association. The WCRA worked against the problem of uncoordinated benevolence, but ultimately was absorbed by the USSC. Still, the New York Infirmary managed to work with Dorothea Dix to train nurses for the Union effort.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he thought Darwin was right.|$|E

25|$|It is {{considered}} to be an outstanding edible species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor. However, great caution must be exercised to properly identify it, as the deadly Amanita ocreata (and occasionally Amanita phalloides) is also found in the same habitat at the same time of year, and can often be found in close proximity to each other. A. ocreata and A. phalloides have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, an annulus, a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than A. velosa. These differences can fade as the fruiting body ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact. Some authorities go <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no Amanita should be considered for eating.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{the extent}} of his empire vary greatly. The Burmese and Thai chronicles report an empire which covered the present-day Burma and {{northern}} Thailand. The Thai chronicles assert that Anawrahta conquered the entire Menam valley, and received tribute from the Khmer king. One states that Anawrahta's armies invaded the Khmer kingdom and sacked the city of Angkor, and another one goes <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Anawrahta even visited Java to receive his tribute. However, Western historians (Harvey, Hall, et al) present a much smaller empire, consisted of the Irrawaddy valley and nearer periphery. His victory terracotta votive tablets (emblazoned with his name in Sanskrit) have been found along the Tenasserim coastline in the south, Katha in the north, Thazi in the east and Minbu in the west.|$|E
25|$|Traditionalist Catholics {{other than}} sedevacantists {{recognize}} as legitimate {{the line of}} Popes leading to and including Pope Francis. Some of them hold that {{one or more of}} the most recent popes have held and taught unorthodox beliefs, but do not go <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they have been formal heretics or have been widely and publicly judged to be heretics. Sedevacantists, on the other hand, claim that the infallible Magisterium of the Catholic Church could not have decreed the changes made in the name of the Second Vatican Council, and conclude that those who issued these changes could not have been acting with the authority of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, they hold that Pope Paul VI and his successors left the true Catholic Church and thus lost legitimate authority in the Church. A formal heretic, they say, cannot be the Catholic pope.|$|E

25|$|A brief {{notice on}} Boudet's book, written by French prehistorian {{specialist}} Émile Cartailhac, {{a member of}} the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude and of the Société archéologique du Midi de la France was published in 1892 in the Revue des Pyrenées. Unsympathetic to Boudet's works, Cartailhac asked the local archeologists to be cautious about the claims of a gullible priest, author he said of the ridiculous book La Vrai langue celtique. In 1893, Cartailhac's notice was used by Gaston Jourdanne for his introduction of Boudet's book to the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude. Citing various renowned authorities, including a work by his friend, a well known Celtic expert, Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Jourdanne demonstrated the errors of Boudet's researches and conclusions. Jourdanne's harsh criticism went <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Boudet's study was worthy at most of publication in the British satirical magazine Punch.|$|E
25|$|Although Cappadocian Greek {{was once}} {{believed}} to be a dead language, the discovery of a population of speakers has led to an increase in awareness, both within and outside of the Cappadocian community in Greece. In the documentary “Last Words,” which follows Mark Janse through Cappadocian-speaking villages on the Greek mainland, community members are seen encouraging each other to use their dialect for ordinary things, such as joke telling. The members of these villages, including such notable figures as the bishop, recount being touched by a presentation given in Cappadocian by Janse on a visit to the region. The bishop went <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Janse’s speech “has lifted their shame.” The revitalisation process is seen through examples such as this, wherein the speakers have begun to take back their identity and embrace their mother tongue. Additionally, younger generations are embracing the power of technology to spread awareness, utilising social media about the language to inform the larger Greek population.|$|E
25|$|In 1614–1615, Musashi {{participated in}} the war between the Toyotomi and the Tokugawa. The war had broken out because Tokugawa Ieyasu saw the Toyotomi family {{as a threat to}} his rule of Japan; most {{scholars}} believe that, as in the previous war, Musashi fought on the Toyotomi side. Osaka Castle was the central place of battle. The first battle (the Winter Battle of Osaka; Musashi's fourth battle) ended in a truce. The second (the Summer Battle of Osaka; Musashi's fifth battle) resulted in the total defeat of Toyotomi Hideyori's Army of the West by Ieyasu's Army of the East in May 1615. Some reports go <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Musashi entered a duel with Ieyasu, but was recruited after Ieyasu sensed his defeat was at hand. This may seem unlikely since Ieyasu was in his 70s and was in poor health already, but it remains unknown how Musashi came into Ieyasu's good graces.|$|E

25|$|The {{requirement}} for reliance {{has not been}} pushed <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a misrepresentor is never liable when a misrepresentee could have found out the truth. In the leading case, Redgrave v Hurd Mr Hurd {{was told by the}} elderly Mr Redgrave that the solicitor practice earned £300 pa. Mr Redgrave told Mr Hurd he could check some documents in the office to prove it. Mr Hurd did not check, and subsequently signed a contract to join Mr Redgrave as a partner. Then Mr Hurd found out the practice only generated £200 pa, and the documents in the office had never said otherwise. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Mr Redgrave had still made a misrepresentation. Furthmore it would be inferred that Mr Hurd relied on the statement {{from the fact that it}} was untrue. Edgington v Fitzmaurice confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.|$|E

AllGame reviewer Scott Alan Marriott felt {{that the game}} [...] " [...] a constant sense of dread without relying too much on obvious shock values", while GameSpot highlighted the quality and variety of sound effects, noting that [...] "there seem to be dozens of sound effects for footsteps alone." [...] However, some publications considered the voice acting to be weak due to its exaggerated delivery.|$|E
