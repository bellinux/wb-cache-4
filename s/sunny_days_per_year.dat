500|$|Conversely, {{the northeastern}} {{portion of the}} Olympic Peninsula, which lies east of the Olympic Mountains is located within the Olympic rain shadow and {{receives}} significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas. Prevailing airflow from the west is forced to cool and compress when colliding with the mountain range, resulting in high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes. Once the airflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains it then lowers and expands resulting in warmer, and significantly dryer air. Sequim, Washington, nicknamed [...] "Sunny Sequim", is located approximately [...] northwest of downtown Seattle and receives just [...] of annual precipitation, more {{comparable to that of}} Los Angeles. Oftentimes an area devoid of cloud cover can be seen extending out over the Puget Sound to the north and east of Sequim. On average Sequim observes 127 <b>sunny</b> <b>days</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> in addition to 127 days with partial cloud cover.

40|$|Abstract We {{analyzed}} the environmental determinants {{of the regional}} distribution of Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata) in Spain (ca. 500, 000 km 2), taking into account its frequency of occurrence on UTM blocks of 50 · 50 km. We found that the distribution pattern of Bonelli’s eagle was a highly predictable phenomenon based on climate, vegetation and interspecific relationships. The proportion of <b>sunny,</b> anticyclonic <b>days,</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> (i. e., high levels of solar radiation) was the main environmental predictor explaining the distribution and abundance pattern of the Bonelli’s eagle. Sparse plant formations (mainly shrublands) had also a positive effect, while altitude, agricultural land and deciduous forests had a negative influence. The relative abundance {{of one of its}} main preys, the Red Partridge (Alectoris rufa), favored the probability of occurrence of Bonelli’s eagle, but only in the less sunny areas located in the north of Spain. The relative abundance of its main competitor, the Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), was slightly but positively correlated with both the distribution and the abundance of the Bonelli’s eagle in the Spanish portion of the Iberian Peninsula, probably due to similarities in their habitat preferences. Finally, we did not find further regional effects of the variables describing the degree of human pressure (density of roads, urban cover, and length of power lines) ...|$|R
