First order shear deformation theory {{was used to}} model the VAT laminate {{and the effect of}} fiber angle orientation on the instability behavior of VAT laminates is studied.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to create laminae that have spatially varying fiber orientation with a tow placement machine. A laminate which is composed of such plies will have sti#ness properties which vary {{as a function of}} position. Previous work had modelled such variable-stiffness laminae by taking a reference fiber path and creating subsequent paths by shifting the reference path. This thesis introduces a method where subsequent paths are truly parallel to the reference fiber path. The primary manufacturing constraint considered in the analysis of variable-sti#ness laminates was limits on fiber curvature which proved to be more restrictive for parallel fiber laminae than for shifted fiber. The in-plane responses of shifted and parallel fiber variable-sti#ness laminates to either an applied uniform end shortening or in-plane shear were determined. Both shifted and parallel fiber variable-stiffness laminates can redistribute the applied load thereby increasing critical buckling loads compared to traditional <b>straight</b> <b>fiber</b> laminates. The primary differences between the two methods is that parallel fiber laminates are not able to redistribute the loading to the degree of the shifted fiber. This significantly reduces the increase in critical buckling load for parallel fiber variable-sti#ness laminates over <b>straight</b> <b>fiber</b> laminates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} for morphing composite structures based on variable stiffness composite plates. The variable stiffness morphing laminate proposed in this paper consists in {{a modified version of}} a <b>straight</b> <b>fiber</b> laminate composed of two regions, one with symmetric and the other with unsymmetric stacking sequence. Since there is a lay-up mismatch where the two regions meet, stress concentrations are expected to occur. A solution to ameliorate this effect is analyzed in which the fibers are allowed to vary smoothly along the plane from one region to the other. The particular trajectories followed by the curved fibers were designed such that the plate can be manufactured using Advanced Fiber Placement technology (AFP). A finite element analysis of the laminate is performed to predict its out-of-plane displacements for the two possible stable configurations that may be obtained after the curing process. Then, the plate may be snapped from one shape to the other with the application of a force. This snap-through behavior is analyzed and compared with the original <b>straight</b> <b>fiber</b> plate. The concept of a bi-stable Variable Stiffness Plate composed of regions of symmetric and unsymmetric lay-ups that preserve the tangential continuity of the fibers could be of great importance in morphing or shape-adaptable structures, such as winglets or flaps...|$|E

The stiffened panels made from <b>straight</b> <b>fiber</b> laminates are designed using a previously developed bi-level optimization approach, including panel level optimization {{of the cross}} sectional panel dimensions and laminate level design of the stacking sequence using a genetic algorithm. Variable ply percentages for the skin and stiffeners are selected within practical manufacturing constraints, and the effect on panel weight is presented. It is shown that there is 10 % weight variation when the ply percentages are within a specific range, whereas out of the range, the weight penalty could be 50 %. The optimum designs maximize the proportion of ± 45 degree (0 degree) plies in the skin (stiffener), indicating that a soft skin is better for stiffened panel design. For the particular example considered, an I-stiffened panel offers about 6 % weight saving compared with a blade-stiffened panel when the load case is compression combined with out-of-plane pressure. Tow placed plates made from curved fiber laminates are modeled efficiently using the exact finite strip program, VICONOPT, for buckling analysis, and results are validated using the literature.

Single microtubules were axially shifted {{relative to their}} neighbors in the fiber. In this manner, fibers might extend by several average microtubule lengths. Furthermore, multitudes of <b>straight</b> microtubule-based <b>fibers</b> may spontaneously create a network, i.e. they can form a discrete spatial pattern of a higher topological complexity (Figure  1 B) at higher MTP concentrations (10 mg/ml). If microtubules are predominantly straight, then they can maintain a partial parallel ordering pattern at some locations, while they cross each other multiple times elsewhere, forming star-like patterns. Additionally, some locations maybe free of microtubules while they densely populate other locations. Consequently, the initially homogenous space of microtubule multitudes become heterogeneous through symmetry breaking, i.e. differentiated into three regions: (a) microtubule free regions, (b) regions consisting of star-like microtubule patterns and (c) the railroad regions of parallel microtubules.
