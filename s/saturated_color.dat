25|$|Other {{properties}} of a color, {{such as its}} saturation or lightness, may {{be determined by the}} other substances that accompany pigments. Binders and fillers added to pure pigment chemicals also have their own reflection and absorption patterns, which can affect the final spectrum. Likewise, in pigment/binder mixtures, individual rays of light may not encounter pigment molecules, and may be reflected as is. These stray rays of source light contribute to a slightly less <b>saturated</b> <b>color.</b> Pure pigment allows very little white light to escape, producing a highly <b>saturated</b> <b>color.</b> A small quantity of pigment mixed with a lot of white binder, however, will appear desaturated and pale, due to the high quantity of escaping white light.|$|E
25|$|The metric is not perceptual; all {{errors are}} equally weighted, whereas humans favor certain errors over others. A color {{can be more}} {{saturated}} or less saturated without {{a change in the}} numerical value of ∆E'i, while in general a <b>saturated</b> <b>color</b> is experienced as being more attractive.|$|E

In characteristic Impressionist style, Renoir suggested the details of a scene through freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings.|$|E

25|$|After Inness {{settled in}} Montclair, New Jersey in 1885, and {{particularly}} in the last decade of his life, this mystical component manifested in his art through a more abstracted handling of shapes, softened edges, and <b>saturated</b> <b>color</b> (October, 1886, Los Angeles County Museum of Art), a profound and dramatic juxtaposition of sky and earth (Early Autumn, Montclair, 1888, Montclair Art Museum), an emphasis on the intimate landscape view (Sunset in the Woods, 1891, Corcoran Gallery of Art), and an increasingly personal, spontaneous, and often violent handling of paint. It is this last quality in particular which distinguishes Inness from those painters of like sympathies who are characterized as Luminists.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} marketed as being [...] "grittier {{than the average}} cop show" [...] {{according}} to Tony Schwartz of The New York Times, who described the setting as a San Francisco precinct. The Boston Globe Jack Thomas described the show's debut as the [...] "newest effort to dramatize the danger and frustration of police work" [...] and as being set in the Midwest. William A. Henry III wrote in The Boston Globe that the show's marketing endured so much conflict and confusion {{that it would have}} been sufficient to keep most shows from ever being scheduled to air. [...] With all the confusion, Henry's Globe colleague Bud Laughton described the pilot episodes and the series as [...] "long-awaited, on-again, off-again". Henry noted that, [...] "It is filmed to look like a documentary, with <b>saturated</b> <b>color,</b> a hand-held camera, quick cuts from scene to scene, high-decibel background noise, overlapping dialogue. The show creates atmosphere more than character. Like a documentary, it conveys a way of living more than a story." [...] The original version of the pilot had one mortal wound, but Henry correctly predicted that it would be re-edited to reduce the violence and allow both officers to return to work.|$|E

[...] We used a lot of words not usually {{associated}} with high-tech blockbusters … We went for a very, very, very, very <b>saturated</b> <b>color</b> palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges. The classic Japanese woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, [...] "I would say 'Give me a Hokusai wave'… we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically." [...] The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: [...] "It's pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie." [...] Del Toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: [...] "The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I'd say 'Get out of the wave [...]'" ...|$|E

500|$|Schwartz {{wrote in}} August 1980 that [...] "...the pilot episode manages to stuff nearly every imaginable aspect of low life into its first hour: prostitution, panhandling, pickpocketing, hostage taking, drug {{addiction}} and, finally, {{the murder of}} two policemen." [...] William Beamon of The Evening Independent noted that the opening episode introduces the audience to {{a vast array of}} characters masterfully intertwined in the storyline in a way that gives the series a [...] "powerful start". A review in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal commented that public defender Davenport's role adds professional intrigue that heightens the provocative nature of their illicit romance. However, The Miami News Jicha speculates that the romance was contrived to make the police show enticing to audiences. Jicha notes that the attack upon the police depicts the uncertainty of the daily life in law enforcement, but that the introduction of Belker's persona shows the writers are a bit out of touch with reality. Buckley's review in The New York Times claimed the episode [...] "veers back and forth between comic situations that aren't funny, serious matters that aren't that convincing and a romance that is merely silly" [...] and stated that various lighting and acting techniques were unsuccessful. The Boston Globe Henry III wrote that [...] "The redeeming virtue is a visual style reminiscent of documentaries — hand-held camera, <b>saturated</b> <b>color,</b> deliberately ragged editing." [...] He also described the show as [...] "a wacky, black-comic and frequently scary portrait of life in a big city police station". Buckley claimed that the show attempts to present an entire force of police officers with foibles that make them unfit for duty. Henry describes the shooting of the officers as an [...] "appallingly realistic random shooting", but since they were not found for hours, he describes their survival and recovery in the next episode, [...] "Presidential Fever", as miraculous.|$|E
