40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedThe subject of <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> power supplies was examined. A comparison between linear regulators and <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> power supplies {{was made to}} show the options available for {{the various types of}} convertors. Two <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> power supplies were constructed and tested. The operating efficiency of both systems was found to be more than eighty percent over the specified input voltage and load current conditions. The <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> power supply circuits required additional components in the design due to the complex pulse width regulation, pulse amplification, and self start circuit required for the system operation. The <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> power supply is an inherent source of radio frequency interference, thus the complexity of the problem v/as examined with several methods presented that minimized the RFI of the system.

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} ballasts usually {{change the}} frequency of the power from a standard mains frequency of 50 or 60 Hz up to 40 kHz or higher, often using a <b>Switched</b> <b>Mode</b> Power Supply (SMPS) circuit topology with Power Factor Correction (PFC). First the AC input power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a film capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component {{in the middle of the}} ballast circuit is a polyester film capacitor used for PFC.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetization}} reversal {{processes of}} [10 nm ErFe 2 / n YFe 2 / 4 nm DyFe 2 / n YFe 2] multilayer films with a (1 1 0) growth axis and a variable YFe 2 layer thickness n are investigated. The magnetically soft YFe 2 compound {{acts as a}} separator between the hard rare earth (RE) ErFe 2 and DyFe 2 compounds, each of them bearing different temperature dependent magnetic anisotropy properties. Magnetic measurements of a system with n = 20 nm reveal the existence of three switching modes: an independent <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> at low temperatures, an ErFe 2 spin flop <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> at medium high temperatures, and an YFe 2 dominated <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> at high temperatures. The measurements are in qualitative agreement {{with the findings of}} micromagnetic simulations which are used to illustrate the <b>switching</b> <b>modes.</b> Further simulations for a varied YFe 2 layer thickness n ranging from 2 to 40 nm are carried out. Quantitative criteria are defined to classify the reversal behavior, and the resultant <b>switching</b> <b>modes</b> are laid out in a map with regard to n and the temperature T. A new coupled <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> emerges above a threshold temperature for samples with thin YFe 2 separation layers {{as a consequence of the}} exchange coupling between the magnetically hard ErFe 2 and DyFe 2 layers. It reflects the increasing competition of the two conflicting anisotropies to dominate the magnetic switching states of both RE compounds under decreasing n. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.
