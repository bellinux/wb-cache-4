5|$|A <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> of development, {{undertaken}} in two stages, was approved in November 2009. This included a general refurbishment and {{improvement of the}} existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre. This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, local development funds and Gateshead College. The covering of the 4,000-seat East Stand with a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a Diamond League event. The second stage of the re-development—the building of the corporate and media facilities—commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer2011. The {{total cost of the}} work was estimated to be £7.6million.|$|E

50|$|Russian President Putin {{told his}} Dmitry Medvedev's Cabinet on 29 January (and {{just after the}} {{resignation}} of the second Azarov Government) that “it’s reasonable” to wait until a successor cabinet was installed in Ukraine before extending more aid to Ukraine. Furthermore, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev stated Ukraine wasn’t paying its natural gas bills even with the lower price, which “seriously changes the situation.” Meanwhile, Serhiy Arbuzov (who had replaced Mykola Azarov as acting Ukrainian Prime Minister) believed Russia would be its <b>second</b> $2 billion <b>tranche</b> “in the nearest future".|$|R
40|$|The euro {{crisis was}} fueled by the diabolic loop between {{sovereign}} risk and bank risk, coupled with cross-border flight-to-safety capital flows. European Safe Bonds (ESBies), a union-wide safe asset without joint liability, would help to resolve these problems. We make three contributions. First, numerical simulations show that ESBies {{would be at least}} as safe as German bunds and approximately double the supply of euro safe assets when protected by a 30 %-thick junior <b>tranche.</b> <b>Second,</b> a model shows how, when and why the two features of ESBies - diversification and seniority - can weaken the diabolic loop and its diffusion across countries. Third, we propose a step-by-step guide on how to create ESBies, starting with limited issuance by public or private-sector entities...|$|R
5000|$|... == Career == On 19 May 2009, in a shock move, he {{was moved}} to the post of Assistant to the Director of the Rulers Court for Foreign Affairs. Later on June 23, 2009 he was {{relieved}} from all Government posts including his new role in the rulers court after resigning from several public posts a few days earlier. [...] His exit, for which no reason was given, shook the business community as he had been seen as one of the key architects of Dubai’s efforts to deal with the fallout from the global financial crisis, which has severely affected the emirate’s economy. Just days before being replaced, Al-Shaikh was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Jordan about how the <b>second</b> $10 billion <b>tranche</b> would be distributed. A few weeks prior he also spoke in depth about the economic situation during an exclusive interview on Dubai Eye 103.8's The Business Breakfast.|$|R
25|$|Securitizations {{are often}} {{structured}} as a sequential pay bond, {{paid off in}} a sequential manner based on maturity. This means that the first tranche, which may have a one-year average life, will receive all principal payments until it is retired; then the <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> begins to receive principal, and so forth. Pro rata bond structures pay each tranche a proportionate share of principal throughout {{the life of the}} security.|$|E
25|$|The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (AML/CTF Act) is the {{principal}} legislative instrument, although there are also offence provisions contained in Division 400 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Upon its introduction, it was intended that the AML/CTF Act would be further amended by a <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> of reforms extending to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) including, inter alia, lawyers, accountants, jewellers and real estate agents; however, those further reforms {{have yet to be}} progressed.|$|E
25|$|The United States has {{encouraged}} Belarus to conclude and adhere to {{agreements with the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, {{as well as to}} undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June 1992 but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Belarus is eligible for Export-Import Bank short-term financing insurance for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated. The IMF granted standby credit in September 1995, but Belarus has fallen off the program and did not receive the <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> of funding, which had been scheduled for regular intervals throughout 1996.|$|E
25|$|In April 2011, it was alleged a male cadet used Skype {{to stream}} video of consensual {{sex with a}} female cadet to several other cadets at ADFA. The {{allegation}} achieved national media attention, and {{is the subject of}} current civil charges in the ACT courts. Aside from this court action, the incident triggered several other inquiries, investigations and reviews into ADFA. These included an inquiry led by Mr Andrew Kirkham QC into ADFA's management of the incident, and a review led by Elizabeth Broderick Sex Discrimination Commissioner, into the treatment of women at ADFA. The Broderick Review found that ADFA was a greatly improved institution since the 1990s, and that the extreme cultural concerns identified by Bronwen Grey in 1998 were no longer apparent. Notwithstanding, the Broderick Review found there were still structural and cultural deficiencies at ADFA which contributed to widespread, low-level sexual harassment. This review has led to a <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> of major reform at ADFA, which is still underway.|$|E
500|$|The Danton-class {{ships were}} ordered as the <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> of a French naval {{expansion}} plan {{that began in}} response to the growth of the Imperial German Navy after 1900. Discussions began in 1905 for an enlarged version of the preceding [...] design. French analyses of the Russian defeat by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 credited the latter's victory to the large number of medium-caliber hits that heavily damaged the superstructures of the Russian ships and started many fires that the crews had difficulty extinguishing. The superior speed and handling of the Japanese ships was also credited with a role in their victory.|$|E
500|$|The CH-47Fs have {{generally}} similar performance to the CH-47Ds. However, the F variant {{was designed to}} be easier to maintain and deploy. Its fuselage comprises a small number of machined components, rather than the large number of fabricated sections of sheet metal used in the D variant, which reduces vibration and structural cracking. The F variant also includes more advanced avionics as well as design features which enable the helicopters to be more quickly prepared to be transported within a cargo aircraft. The first seven Australian CH-47Fs are fitted with rotor brakes and other equipment to better enable them to operate from the Royal Australian Navy's Canberra class landing helicopter dock vessels, but are otherwise identical to those operated by the US Army. The <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> of three CH-47Fs are not fitted with rotor brakes as they were taken directly from the production line of helicopters for the US Army. As of 2017, it was planned to fit these helicopters with rotor brakes by 2020.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 April 2014, Australia {{confirmed}} {{the purchase of}} 58 F-35A Lightning II fighters in a US$11.5 billion deal. [...] The 58 fighter order is the <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> of the Australian Defence Force's Air 6000 Phase 2A/2B new air combat capability (NACC) project, with a previous order of 14 F-35s being the first tranche. [...] The 72 F-35s will replace the RAAF's fleet of 71 F/A-18A/B Hornets and supplement the country's F/A-18F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fleets. [...] The first four F-35s are to be delivered to Australia in 2018, with IOC being reached in 2020. [...] A Phase 2C tranche of {{the plan is to}} purchase 28 more planes to replace the Air Force's 24 Super Hornets. [...] Although Super Hornets were bought as a bridging capability until the arrival of the F-35, delays in the JSF program will keep the Super Hornets and Growlers flying for 20 years, with a decision regarding Phase 2C deferred until the early 2020s. The purchase will be in line with previous defense budget planning.|$|E
2500|$|PNGDF {{capability}} is considered modest, {{with the army}} facing significant problems including a chronic budget crisis, a lack of experience in conventional operations, limited ability to be deployed independently overseas as well as internal tensions. The air force and navy also suffer major equipment and funding shortfalls—to the point of sometimes almost being grounded—and are both too small and poorly equipped {{to take part in}} operations overseas. Indeed, the entire PNGDF is badly in need of new equipment. Australia, New Zealand, France and several other nations are assisting in the training and the professionalisation of the PNGDF, while others—including Germany and China—provide budgetary assistance. Australia's aid for the PNGDF is currently worth AUD9.2 million with an additional AUD40 million committed the reform programme. AUD20 million was committed initially, mainly for paying off redundant personnel. A <b>second</b> <b>tranche</b> of AUD20 million is for the refurbishment of barracks over five years (AUD5 million). As of January 2006 29 Australian defence personnel were engaged in training and advising in areas including policy, management, maritime, infantry, engineering, personnel, logistic and finance areas of assistance. Two more Australian personnel were seconded as advisers on logistics and personnel matters in August 2006, while an Australian bureaucrat from the Department of Defence is posted to the PNG defence department.
