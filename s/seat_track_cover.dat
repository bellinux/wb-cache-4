40|$|A <b>Seat</b> <b>Track</b> Attach Mechanism (SAM) is a multiple-use {{clamping}} device {{intended for use}} in mounting various objects on the standard <b>seat</b> <b>tracks</b> used on the International Space Station (ISS). The basic SAM design could also be adapted to other settings in which <b>seat</b> <b>tracks</b> are available: for example, SAM-like devices {{could be used as}} universal aircraft-seat-track mounting clamps. A SAM (see figure) is easily installed by inserting it in a <b>seat</b> <b>track,</b> then actuating a locking lever to clamp the SAM to the track. The SAM includes an over-center locking feature that prevents premature disengagement that could be caused by some inadvertent movements of persons or objects in the vicinity. A SAM can be installed in, or removed from, any position along a <b>seat</b> <b>track,</b> without regard for the locations of the circular access holes. Hence, one or more SAM(s) can be used to mount an object or objects on a track or a pair of tracks in an infinite number of preferred configurations. A SAM can be incorporated into a dual swivel device, so that two of the SAMs can be made to lock onto two side-by-side <b>seat</b> <b>tracks</b> simultaneously, as would be the case in a standard ISS rack bay where two side-by-side racks reside. The main benefit to using two SAMs in a side-by-side arrangement is to provide a coupled load. By picking up load points on two <b>seat</b> <b>tracks,</b> a coupled loading is created, improving the stability and strength since the load is spread to two <b>seat</b> <b>tracks</b> at a short distance...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{testing of}} {{aircraft}} seats has been incorporated {{to enhance the}} survivability of aircraft mishaps for over 10 years. This standard may be introduced into aircraft with certification basis prior to this introduction if seat loads can {{be limited to the}} structural capabilities of the <b>seat</b> <b>track.</b> Since the earlier <b>seat</b> <b>tracks</b> typically had lower load requirements they may not be capable of bearing a dynamic seat test with current seat designs. An attempt to establish the performance objects of energy absorbing features will be investigated. Modeling dynamic events with MADYMO software has been proven to be efficient and accurate in many aerospace and automotive applications. Using this tool, a model was developed to investigate how limiting loads at the <b>seat</b> <b>track</b> affect occupant performance. Both finite element and multibody techniques were used to create a detailed model of a typical commercial airplane seat with three occupants. Both a baseline model without energy absorption and a modified model with energy absorption were developed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of energy absorbing devices between the seat and the <b>seat</b> <b>track...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{benchmarking}} study is presented {{on the performance}} of automotive <b>seat</b> <b>track</b> profiles according to their sensitivity to manufacturing variation. Variation in rail geometry affects the elastic track preload and consequently the rolling effort of the track assembly. Rolling effort must be precisely controlled to achieve customer performance targets. Two benchmarking parameters are relevant to rolling effort: variation in bearing clearance and variation in bearing contact force. These were assessed using statistical tolerance analysis of CAD data, and numerical analysis, respectively. Significant variation in performance was identified for the selected track profiles, which include commercially available designs and proposed concepts. The benchmarking approach demonstrated in this work provides a way of rapidly assessing the relative robustness of automotive <b>seat</b> <b>track</b> designs subject to manufacturing variation. The outcome assists automotive manufacturers to apply a systematic approach to automotive seat design based on a robust design evaluation of alternative embodiments...|$|R
40|$|Product {{development}} processes generate {{large quantities}} of experimental and analytical data. The data evaluation process is usually quite lengthy since the data needs to be extracted from {{a large number of}} individual output files and arranged in suitable formats before they can be compared. When the data quantity grows extremely large, manual extraction cannot be done in a limited timeframe. This paper describes a set of tools developed by MTS engineers to automatically extract the desired information from a large number of files and perform data post-processing. The tools greatly improved both speed and accuracy of the evaluation process during the development of a sound quality-based end-of-line inspection system for <b>seat</b> <b>tracks</b> [1]. It allowed engineers to quickly gather a comprehensive understanding of the relative importance of individual design parameters and of their correlation to the subjective perception of the sound quality of the <b>seat</b> <b>track...</b>|$|R
