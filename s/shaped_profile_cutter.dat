50|$|A wood moulder is {{a machine}} used to <b>shape</b> wood with <b>profiled</b> <b>cutters.</b> The <b>profiled</b> <b>cutters</b> are {{also known as}} knives, and blades. Tooling refers to cutters, knives, blades {{including}} planer blades, and cutterheads. Most moulders require the blades to be secured into a cutterhead that mounts on the shaft(s) of the machine. However, some machines such as the Williams & Hussey and the Shop Fox require the blades to bolt directly onto the shaft of the machine. The wood being fed into a moulder is {{commonly referred to as}} either “stock” or “blanks”.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Creating {{a method}} of {{profiling}} tools, which forms the rear surface shaped cutters. Analysis of the established methods. The study of the error in determining {{the profile of the}} tool. Design / methodology / approach. The back surface of the shaped cutter produces abrasive tools. To determine the profile of abrasive tools using the kinematic method. The surfaces of the tool and parts have a common perpendicular. The tool moves along its trektorii. The point where the common perpendicular intersects with the trajectory is the center of the abrasive tool. There are two methods for determining the position of this point. The method of constructing the table. The center of the abrasive wheel is determined by the tables. The table can make before you start. The table is suitable for any instrument. Using the table you can define any profile. For each point <b>shaped</b> <b>profile</b> <b>cutters</b> always have two answers. The method of solution of the transcendental equation. The center of the abrasive tool is determined by Newton's method. You can calculate the coordinates of each point of the <b>profile</b> <b>shapes</b> of abrasive tools. These points are treated with a ribbon, which is located on the tooth cutters. Calculations can be done with a given accuracy. Findingsa. Created by two methods for determining the profile of abrasive tool that handles the back surface of the contoured mills. Found the equations for determining the parameters of the circle that replaces the curved line Originality/value. These results allow us to determine the profile instrument for the formation {{of the back of the}} cutter to the desired accuracy. ??????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????? ??? ???????????????? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ???? ? ????????? ?????. ???????? ?????????????? ???????????, ??????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ? ???????????? ??? ????, ??????? ???????????? ????? ??? ????????????? ???????? ????, ??? ? ????????? ?????????? ???????. ?????????? ????? ????????????? ????? ??????????? ??????? ????????????? ?????, ??????? ???????? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ?????. ?????????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ??? ??????????? ???????. ?????? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ???????????????? ????????? ????????? ??????????, ? ????? ?????? ????????????????? ??????? ?????????, ?????????? ?? ?????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ??? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????. ???????? ?????????????? ??????????? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????????...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes an Linear Matrix Inequality based problem {{formulation}} {{to determine}} input <b>shaped</b> <b>profiles.</b> The cost function is the residual energy, a quadratic {{function of the}} amplitude of the <b>shaped</b> <b>profile,</b> for each sampling interval. The Schur complement permits representing the quadratic function as a Linear Matrix Inequality. Augmenting the state space model with {{the sensitivity of the}} states to uncertain parameters, input <b>shaped</b> <b>profiles</b> which are robust to model uncertainties can be derived. Finally, a minimax input <b>shaped</b> <b>profile</b> which minimizes the maximum magnitude of the resid-ual energy over the domain of uncertainties is determined using the LMI problem. The proposed technique is illustrated on the single spring-mass-dashpot example. The solutions derived are shown to coincide with the solutions presented in the literature, without the requirement of solving a nonlinear programming problem. I...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} soft contact lens midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge design on the apparent epithelial thickness and indentation of the ocular surface with lens movement. Methods. Four soft contact lens designs comprising of two different plano midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profiles</b> and two edge designs (chiseled and knife edge) of silicone-hydrogel material were examined in 26 subjects aged 24. 7 ± 4. 6 years, each worn bilaterally in randomized order. Lens movement was imaged enface on insertion, at 2 and 4 hours with a high-speed, high-resolution camera simultaneous to the cross-section of {{the edge of the}} contact lens interaction with the ocular surface captured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) nasally, temporally, and inferiorly. Optical imaging distortions were individually corrected for by imaging the apparent distortion of a glass slide surface by the removed lens. Results. Apparent epithelial thickness varied with edge position (P < 0. 001). When distortion was corrected for, epithelial indentation decreased with time after insertion (P = 0. 010), changed after a blink (P < 0. 001), and varied with position on the lens edge (P < 0. 001), with the latter being affected by midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge design. Horizontal and vertical lens movement did not change with time postinsertion. Vertical motion was affected by midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> (P < 0. 001) and edge design (P < 0. 001). Lens movement was associated with physiologic epithelium thickness for lens midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge designs. Conclusions. Dynamic OCT coupled with high-resolution video demonstrated that soft contact lens movement and image-corrected ocular surface indentation were influenced by both lens edge design and midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R
