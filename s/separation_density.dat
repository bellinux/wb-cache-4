It was demonstrated that efficient combustible recovery and control of the <b>separation</b> <b>density</b> to target low ash products could be achieved. The major finding from the study was the critical importance of providing sufficient fluidization water, though beyond the critical level the process was largely insensitive to the fluidization rate. It was concluded the required fluidization velocity is nominally 10 m/h per mm of top-size, hence for a nominal 4 mm top size the required velocity is 40 m/h.

Significant improvement in separation efficiency was achieved by exploiting new separation mechanisms that apply to particles of a given size within the inclined channels. For the coarsest size range, the use of a sufficiently large channel aspect ratio, defined by the channel length to gap ratio, leads to separation densities that are independent of the particle size, and in turn strong control of the cut point.

ABSTRACT: Stabilization of coal quality {{parameters}} is {{an important}} technological problem especially {{in the presence of}} variable raw coal characteristics such as coal size distribution and its washability. Local control systems for gravitational preparation processes have been introduced (the control of the density of separation in heavy media vessels and the refuse discharge in jigs) to compensate the influence of various disturbances on the performance of technology. The main task of these local control systems is to stabilize technological chosen parameters on the desired level, which makes it easier to keep the quality of coal within the limits of declared price and allows to control final products parameters according to the terms of the contract. Concentrates of steam or coking coal are often produced in a system of parallel processes of coal separation in heavy media vessels, jigs and flotation. In such a system there usually exists an optimal point of work (global extremum) for which the maximum amount of the final concentrate with desired ash content can be obtained. The final product of desired quality (ash content) can be produced for various set values of the densities of separation in both processes so that the blending of two components would give product of desired quality. Further analysis will show that the considered system has the characteristic of the extreme object i. e. that for the desired ash content in the product it is possible to choose optimal separation densities for which the system produces the maximum amount of the blend or the maximum value of the product [1]. In the paper an application of computer simulation program for coal preparation processes analysis and their control has been presented. The integral part of this software is an algorithm of searching the function algorithm of control target, i. e. the maximum production function of preset quality. In the paper is presented results of analysis part of coal preparation system, that is two jigs. These results relate detailed analyses one of certain of plant reviewed in the study [11]. Value of <b>separation</b> <b>density</b> was desired in one jigs, but in second jigs the value of <b>separation</b> <b>density</b> was calculated as optimum value. The density of separation in jigs can be changed indirectly, for instance by the adjustment of the float position linked with refuse removal gate. Relative values were given to the production for examined cases of enriching.
