Introduction: As looked at by one philosopher, Mr. Allen, life has no object any more than the sun has an object, or the {{revolution}} of the planets or the milky-way. That there is no why to it. We exist and naturally have to live our time out. He thinks that the question descended to us from a time when man thought that the world was made expressly for him, and did not realize his utter smallness. He even asks—“Why on earth <b>should</b> <b>life</b> have a purpose to subserve any more than the bubbles that rise and fall aimlessly on the wave, or the terrific commotions that send and revolutionize the sun’s atmosphere?” Evidently to him life means little. “Happiness”—Mr. Mallock’s answer to the problem, has been objected to as being too vague and of a doubtful truth. Since life is held so sacred we naturally suppose it must have some object. What this may be depends in a measure upon the individual, but of lives in general, we will suppose that they have some common aim. Now it is our desire to find out what this object or aim is...|$|E

40|$|How <b>should</b> <b>life</b> {{support for}} deep space be developed? The International Space Station (ISS) {{life support system}} is the {{operational}} result of many decades of research and development. Long duration deep space missions such as Mars {{have been expected to}} use matured and upgraded versions of ISS life support. Deep space life support must use the knowledge base incorporated in ISS but it must also meet much more difficult requirements. The primary new requirement is that life support in deep space must be considerably more reliable than on ISS or anywhere in the Earth-Moon system, where emergency resupply and a quick return are possible. Due to the great distance from Earth and the long duration of deep space missions, if life support systems fail, the traditional approaches for emergency supply of oxygen and water, emergency supply of parts, and crew return to Earth or escape to a safe haven are likely infeasible. The Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU) maintenance approach used by ISS is unsuitable for deep space with ORU's as large and complex as those originally provided in ISS designs because it minimizes opportunities for commonality of spares, requires replacement of many functional parts with each failure, and results in substantial launch mass and volume penalties. It has become impractical even for ISS after the shuttle era, resulting in the need for ad hoc repair activity at lower assembly levels with consequent crew time penalties and extended repair timelines. Less complex, more robust technical approaches may be needed to meet the difficult deep space requirements for reliability, maintainability, and reparability. Developing an entirely new life support system would neglect what has been achieved. The suggested approach is use the ISS life support technologies as a platform to build on and to continue to improve ISS subsystems while also developing new subsystems where needed to meet deep space requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} Skellig Michael is {{shrouded}} in mystery: {{from the earliest}} times to the present, memories of shipwrecks, ghosts and graveyards have associated the place with death and the Otherworld. The choice of St Michael, the arch enemy of satanic forces, as patron saint of the rock reinforces the grim feeling that its steep slopes and hardly accessible peaks have been a key battleground for the endless struggle between light and darkness, good and evil, life and death. The scanty evidence that has survived from the distant past leaves ground for so many conjectures that imagination and irrationality have surreptitiously {{found their way to}} the heart of rational modern and contemporary interpretations of the site, {{to the extent that it}} is difficult to know if the heritage of Skellig Michael that is being handed down to present and future generations is a fake or not. Yet preservation and conservation have been on the agenda for decades, particularly since 1996, when the island and its early monastic remains were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Heritage policies naturally raise several questions. Should ancient sites be made untouchable, turned into museums and venerated as sacred ? 1 Or <b>should</b> <b>life</b> be breathed into them for fear that heritage might come to be understood as fixed, inert, in other words dead and irrelevant ? 2 In any case, heritage is a social construction, and attitudes to it are but one aspect of the tyranny of the present over the past. This paper will examine Skellig Michael in this perspective. Because of the rich folklore associated to the site and possible parallels that can be drawn with comparable sites in Europe, it will also argue that the site's intangible cultural heritage deserves as much attention as its currently acknowledged tangible and natural heritages. As all World Heritage Sites, Skellig Michael was considered for inscription on the UNESCO list on account of its « outstanding universal value ». 3 According to its Management Plan 2008 – 2018, « it is the interaction between the monks of Skellig Michael and the island's topography in what was physically a harsh environment that gives the site its outstanding universal value ». 4 Besides, « the Skelligs islands have been recognized as two of Ireland's most important sites for breeding seabirds for several hundred years ». 5 The 1 Christophe Charle argues that there are similarities between the cult of saints in the Middle Ages and the cult of heritage sites today. « Pour une sociologie historique du patrimoine », in Duanmu Mei et Hugues Tertrain (eds), Temps croisés I, Paris, Editions de la maison française des sciences de l'homme, 2010, p. 32. 2 « Faire passer dans notre patrimoine le souffle de vie et en finir avec une vision trop répandue selon laquelle le patrimoine ne serait qu'un ensemble de choses inertes », Rapport Querrien, 1982, quoted by Dominique Poulot, « De la raison patrimoniale aux monde du patrimoine », in Les mondes du patrimoine, Socio-anthropologie 19, 2006, [URL] Accessed 29 April 2017. 3 It is held to have « cultural and (…) natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries » and to be « of common importance for present and future generations of humanity »...|$|E
40|$|The ageing of Europe's {{population}} {{is a crucial}} challenge for the 21 st century. Today, the mean life expectancy in Sweden is 83 years for women and 78 for men. Ageing well is a frequently used process, describing the objectives of future elderly care and rehabilitation. Enabling elderly people to live longer and independently in their homes is one goal for society as a whole. Providing health care of high quality, on equal terms for all citizens, is an important political goal in Sweden. It is a great challenge for providers to achieve elderly care of high quality and to develop products, services and technologies that {{meet the needs of}} elderly people. There is an assumption that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) will enhance quality of life. Additionally "electronic accessibility" is one of the goals for the European Information Society to support and enable self-determination and mobility. Dimensions of empowerment such as participation and ability to influence/control one's life situation imply an approach to health care with the patient/client in focus. The aim of this thesis was to explore different dimensions of empowerment and an empowerment methodology for elderly persons in home health care, and if ICT was a useful tool in this process. A multi-method approach was used that included interviews with patients with experience of rehabilitation, interviews with elderly persons with homecare and safety alarms, exploring their needs in relation to empowerment dimensions such as autonomy, self-determination, participation and mobility, an intervention where a mobile safety alarm was tested by elderly individuals and reflective learning workshops with front line staff in home care. Different methods of analysis were used, including Grounded Theory, Latent Content analysis and Constructivist Grounded Theory together with reflections. One of the overall findings was that all patients/clients that participated in these studies had not reflected upon whether it would be possible or not, to influence care and rehabilitation. The results indicate low patient participation in and influence on, the rehabilitation process. Elderly people perceived freedom of movement as a prerequisite for participation and in one of the studies the elderly participants felt that they could influence care and be participating in one aspect, but they still wanted more support with, for example, being more physically active, like walking out doors. The overall findings show a genuine patient/client desire, but limited possibilities to influence care and rehabilitation. Put another way, patients/clients want to have influence and participate authentically, but they do not exactly know how to achieve this. All patients/clients were positive towards the professionals in care and rehabilitation. They were really grateful and admired the professionals and also identified themselves with how stressed and how overloaded with work the professionals were. This might mean that the concept interdependency is looked upon as more important than real autonomy. The patients/clients tried to be compliant and this can be understood as "learning unpretentiousness". After reflecting upon their situation they were more able to articulate their needs that were not responded to or taken care of. When ICT, as an empowering tool, was implemented, findings showed that elderly people experienced the use of a mobile safety alarm as empowering. The mobile safety alarm gave them the freedom of movement needed to be physically active and still feel safe. The positioning device was not experienced as a threat to their integrity. Mobility and safety were experienced as more important than privacy. The research findings indicate that in order to improve home health care services from the patient's/client's perspective, we need to work with the triads of participation, empowerment and mobile Information and Communication Technology. We need to critically and creatively reflect on what clients say and then try to respond positively to what we learn and shift the focus away from ‘what's life like?' and ‘what <b>should</b> <b>life</b> be like?', towards the explicit action question, ‘what {{needs to be done to}} make life as good as it can be?'
