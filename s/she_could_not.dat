5|$|Wu {{completed}} her Ph.D. in June 1940, and {{was elected to}} Phi Beta Kappa. In spite of Lawrence and Segrè's recommendations, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> secure a position at a university, so she remained at the Radiation Laboratory as a post-doctoral fellow.|$|E
5|$|As Sovereign, Victoria {{used the}} royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom. Before her accession, she {{received}} no grant of arms. As <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> succeed to the throne of Hanover, her arms did not carry the Hanoverian symbols that were used by her immediate predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on the throne.|$|E
5|$|Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled {{her death}} an accident; {{a case of}} {{starvation}} with exposure as a contributing factor. A spokesman for the coroner said Barker became trapped in the closet, and died of fright and starvation. Due to {{a hole in the}} closet, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have suffocated.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are so kind {{in asking}} me and I 'm {{not afraid of}} them," [...] {{explained}} Polly, prancing, simply because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> keep still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cats got it, did n't they?" [...] jeered {{the voice}} {{in a tone that}} made Polly sit down and laugh till <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> laugh any longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, one. Carlotta Gispardi. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> speak English, and I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> speak Dago; and she died. I don't care; though I {{never knew}} any, I {{seem to know}} as much about them as you do." ...|$|R
5|$|Edgar Quinet was {{converted}} into a training ship in the mid-1920s before running aground off the Algerian coast in January 1930. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be pulled free and sank five days later. Waldeck-Rousseau served as the flagship of the Far East fleet from 1929 to 1932 and was decommissioned after returning to France. She was hulked in 1936 and scrapped in 1941–44.|$|E
5|$|Goldman made funeral {{arrangements}} for Berkman. It {{had been his}} desire to be cremated and have his ashes buried in Waldheim Cemetery in Chicago, near the graves of the Haymarket defendants who had inspired him, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford the expense. Instead, Berkman was buried in a common grave in Cochez Cemetery in Nice.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Bloomberg News {{reported}} that Manning could be visited by only those she had named before her imprisonment, {{and not by}} journalists. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be photographed or give interviews on camera. Manning {{was not allowed to}} browse the web, but could consult print news and have access to new gender theory texts.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had stopped}} {{in a garden}} path; Acton looked hard at his rosy young kinsman. [...] "She said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> fancy what had got into you; you {{appeared}} to have taken a violent dislike to her." ...|$|R
60|$|He took no heed of the exclamation, but {{asked her}} why she had {{deliberately}} kept him waiting,--as {{if she had not}} made a fool enough of him already. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> suppose it was for his pleasure he had come into the house.|$|R
60|$|Harry laughed, {{and even}} Marie, anxious as <b>she</b> was, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help smiling.|$|R
5|$|She was {{defeated}} {{the minute she}} tried to do it, because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> sell the people of California {{that she would be}} a better fighter against communism than Dick Nixon. She made the fatal mistake of attacking our strength instead of sticking to attacking our weakness.|$|E
5|$|When the {{two sons}} of {{the chief of the}} gods {{fell in love with a}} {{beautiful}} maiden named Loowit, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the cascades of the Columbia River Gorge.|$|E
5|$|After 34 {{years at}} NASA, Jackson had earned {{the most senior}} {{engineering}} title available. She realized <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> earn further promotions without becoming a supervisor. She accepted a demotion to become a manager of both the Federal Women’s Program, in the NASA Office of Equal Opportunity Programs, and of the Affirmative Action Program. In this role, she worked to influence both the hiring and promotion of women in NASA's science, engineering, and mathematics careers.|$|E
60|$|But Polly {{did n't get}} {{a chance}} to be miserable very long, for as she went up stairs feeling like the most injured girl in the world, she caught a glimpse of Miss Mills, sewing away with such a bright face that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> resist {{stopping}} for a word or two.|$|R
60|$|When she {{was ready}} nobody could have been prettier, but <b>she</b> still <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help looking sad.|$|R
60|$|Jane Lavinia {{only knew}} that <b>she</b> must--she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help it. There was {{something}} in her that demanded expression thus.|$|R
5|$|After April's failed {{wedding to}} Matthew, Callie and Arizona {{bought a house}} together, a fresh start, away from the {{memories}} of their apartment. They later decided to try again for a second child. However, {{a trip to the}} OB/GYN led to the discovery that Callie had developed adhesions in her uterus in the years since Sofia's birth, meaning <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> carry any more babies. After talking about it, the couple agreed to postpone their dream to have another baby until they're on more solid footing as a couple.|$|E
5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|At sunrise on 25 July 1953 New Jersey {{was off the}} key port, {{rail and}} {{communications}} center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a whaleboat {{in an attempt to}} spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see the results of her six-gun salvo.|$|E
60|$|What had {{prompted}} Editha de Chavasse {{to return}} thus alone to the Quakeress's cottage, <b>she</b> herself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> exactly have told.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me for a moment with an air of perplexity, as if <b>she</b> really <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{remember}} whom I was.|$|R
60|$|The {{poor girl}} got up the best <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and, <b>not</b> daring even to sigh, resumed her {{position}} {{at the foot of}} the table.|$|R
5|$|Born to a large, impoverished {{family of}} farm workers, Ellen {{was sent to}} work as a nursemaid at the age of eleven. Soon afterwards, she began {{suffering}} periods of drowsiness and was referred to a local hospital. After four months her condition was declared incurable, and she was sent home. Two days later, Ellen had a series of seizures and—her mother claimed—fell into a deep sleep from which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be roused.|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Brandon's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, Peirce had envisioned a young Jodie Foster. The role was also offered to Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Polley. Peirce {{ultimately}} decided to cast Chloë Sevigny based on her performance in The Last Days of Disco (1998). Sevigny had auditioned for {{the role of}} Brandon, but Peirce decided Sevigny would be more suited to playing Lana because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> picture Sevigny as a man.|$|E
5|$|His mother Kukaeleiki was the {{daughter}} of Kalauawa, a Kauaʻi high chief, and she was also a cousin of Queen Keōpūolani, the most sacred wife of Kamehameha I. Among Naʻea's more notable ancestors were Kalanawaʻa, a high chief of Oʻahu, and Kuaenaokalani, a Maui high chiefess who held the sacred kapu rank of Kekapupoʻohoʻolewaikala (the kapu of Poʻohoʻolewaikala, a rank so sacred that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be exposed to the sun except at dawn).|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it. I {{thought she}} was at one time, and {{expected}} every day to have her {{come in with a}} long face, and say <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> stand it. But somehow, lately, she is always bright and happy, seems to like her work, and don't have the tired, worried look she used to at first. The three months are out, so pay up, Tommy." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{she kissed}} the girl--if not with tenderness, {{at any rate}} with a curious feeling of pity which <b>she</b> herself <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have defined.|$|R
60|$|Why Tom {{should look}} troubled and turn grave all at once, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> understand, but <b>she</b> liked {{to see him}} stroke his mother's cheek so softly, as he stood with his head resting on the high back of her chair, for Polly fancied that he felt a man's pity for her weakness, and was {{learning}} a son's patient love for a mother who had had much to bear with him.|$|R
5|$|Jerry {{is unable}} {{to decide whether or}} not to tell George he is dating Marlene, but Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) {{eventually}} convinces him that he should. After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. She was afraid of moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. She was afraid that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in a country whose customs she did not know. In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> adjust to the Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.|$|E
5|$|Now aged 23, Matilda {{had only}} limited options {{as to how}} she might {{spend the rest of}} her life. Being childless, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{exercise}} a role as an imperial regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a nun or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She {{does not appear to have}} expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As your chief ambition?' said Miss Fennimore, who, governess as <b>she</b> was, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help being {{a little}} satirical, {{especially}} when Bertha's eyes twinkled responsively.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{think she}} can. And if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> I'm <b>not</b> sure. But isn't Pragmatism a {{perfectly}} beastly word, George? It has {{no sense of}} humour in it at all." ...|$|R
