25|$|Sega ported Sonic CD to Microsoft Windows in 1995, {{making it}} the first Sonic game {{released}} on personal computers. A second port of the game was given a retail release {{as part of the}} Sega PC brand in 1996, distributed by <b>SoftKey</b> in Japan on August 9, August 26 in North America, and October 3 in Europe. The PC version contains the complete FMV animation, and all versions of the game use the North American soundtrack. Despite the improvements in the opening and ending cutscenes, this version is known to suffer from technical issues such as slowdown. This version of Sonic CD has been included in a number of compilations; however, it is only compatible with older Windows 9x-based computers.|$|E
500|$|In early 1992 word {{leaked to}} the press on a {{possible}} merger between WordStar International Inc., and soon after both firms made public {{the fact that they}} had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over [...] "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that [...] "we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. I still believe that it's possible for us to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and <b>SoftKey</b> Software Products Inc. to form <b>SoftKey</b> International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, The Learning Company {{had been}} {{acquired}} by <b>SoftKey</b> International for cash and stock valued at $606 million, with <b>SoftKey</b> assuming {{the name of}} its acquisition. At the end of December 1997, the new iteration of The Learning Company acquired Creative Wonders from Capital Cities/ABC and Electronic Arts, which became a brand of the company though allowed to operate as a separate division. This was {{the latest in a}} string of acquisitions the company made {{toward the end of the}} 1990s and it added Madeline to its roster of assets. According to The Salt Lake Tribune, some games were published under a [...] "Davidson/Creative Wonders" [...] brand. The mid-90s had seen software companies begin to market products toward families after the decrease in the price of personal computers led to increased access to the technology. The Learning Company capitalized on the demand for educational software by purchasing popular characters and franchises, such as Sesame Street and Madeline, from smaller companies. Chief executive Michael Perik wanted the company to be the lead supplier of educational software by incorporating recognizable brands in its catalogue.|$|E

40|$|Airport moving maps (AMMs) {{have been}} shown to {{decrease}} navigation errors, increase taxiing speed, and reduce workload when they depict airport layout, current aircraft position, and the cleared taxi route. However, current technologies are limited in their ability to depict the cleared taxi route due to the unavailability of datacomm or other means of electronically transmitting clearances from ATC to the flight deck. This study examined methods by which pilots can input ATC-issued taxi clearances to support taxi route depictions on the AMM. Sixteen general aviation (GA) pilots used a touchscreen monitor to input taxi clearances using two input layouts, <b>softkeys</b> and QWERTY, each with and without feedforward (graying out invalid inputs). QWERTY yielded more taxi route input errors than the <b>softkeys</b> layout. The presence of feedforward did not produce fewer taxi route input errors than in the non-feedforward condition. The QWERTY layout did reduce taxi clearance input times relative to the <b>softkeys</b> layout, but when feedforward was present this effect was observed only for the longer, 6 -segment taxi clearances. It was observed that with the <b>softkeys</b> layout, feedforward reduced input times compared to non-feedforward but only for the 4 -segment clearances. Feedforward did not support faster taxi clearance input times for the QWERTY layout. Based on the results and analyses of the present study, it is concluded that for taxi clearance inputs, (1) QWERTY remain the standard for alphanumeric inputs, and (2) feedforward be investigated further, with a focus on participant preference and performance of black-gray contrast of keys...|$|R

2500|$|In the {{previous}} few years, <b>SoftKey</b> founder Kevin O'Leary had wanted the new The Learning Company {{to collaborate with}} developers to [...] "produce products to service that 40 {{percent of the market}} that hasn't bought educational software because of pricing issues." [...] This resulted in a new budget line of [...] "Platinum" [...] CD-ROM products; during this period The Learning Company would become known for aggressively driving down the development costs of products, and laying off employees in the companies it acquired. Post-1997 Madeline products were manufactured by BMG's manufacturing division, Sonopress, and order fulfillment was handled by BMG Distribution. These products were distributed {{to a wide range of}} retail outlets including: Best Buy, Circuit City, Computer City, Egghead Software, Office Depot, Price Club/Costco, Sam's Club, and Staples. [...] Robin Ray of the Boston Herald noted in 1998 that while new releases in kid's software used to be in the $50 range, they were now being released at $35, and with a rebate or a few months wait customers could often get them for half price; he deemed the repackaging of two separate games into Madeline's Thinking Games Deluxe as a [...] "bargain." [...] While Madeline and Magnificent Puppet Show had been released with a retail price of $49.95 three years prior, Madeline Rainy Day Activities and Madeline Thinking Games Deluxe were launched in late 1998 at a price of $19.95, [...] "in time to meet holiday demands for entertainment software to complement cross-curricular products."

The joystick combined two modulation sources and pitch bend: left/right adjusts pitch bend, up emits MIDI controller 1 messages, and down emits MIDI controller 2 messages. No arpeggiator was offered (a common omission until mid-90's) and the synth enforced patch-based programming instead of performance controls. No disk drive was integrated, so only MIDI SysEx dumps and memory cards provided methods to save sequences and programs outside the keyboard.|$|R

40|$|Over {{one billion}} people own or use {{cellular}} mobile telephones. Therefore, industry practitioners {{are faced with}} a question: how big steps can they take when designing the user interfaces for their new products, or how closely should they stick with the already existing user interface conventions that may already be familiar to the consumers. The objective of this research work is to create and communicate new knowledge for design and usability practitioners about how to design and evolve interaction style conventions in mainstream, voice-centric mobile telephones. In the context of this study, interaction style denotes the framework consisting of the physical interaction objects, the abstract interaction elements, and the associated behavior or interaction conventions that are applied throughout the core functionality of the mobile phone, but excludes the stylistic appearance elements of the user interface. The main research problem ‚Äî how do mobile phone interaction style changes affect the initial usability of a mobile phone for users with earlier experience with mobile phones ‚Äî is approached via several methods. A literature study compares the interaction styles applied in mainstream computing domains against the aspects relevant in the mobile phones domain. A heuristic analysis of contemporary mobile phones is used to formulate an understanding of the available interaction styles and analyze whether there is convergence towards specific types of interaction styles in the industry. An empirical usability testing experiment with 38 test users is conducted with a novel mobile phone interaction style to investigate differences between users who are already familiar with different mobile phone interaction styles. The study reveals that interaction styles applied in contemporary mobile telephones are designed around menu navigation, and they implement the three primary operations ‚Äî Select, Back and Menu access ‚Äî with dedicated hardkeys, context-sensitive <b>softkeys,</b> or using special control devices like joysticks or jog dials. The control keys in the contemporary interaction styles are converging around various two- and three-softkey conventions. The aspects related to indirect manipulation and small displays pose specific usability and UI design challenges on mobile phone user interfaces. The study shows that the mobile handset manufacturers are applying their usually proprietary interaction styles in a rather consistent manner in their products, with the notable exception of mobile Internet browsers that often break the underlying interaction style consistency. Based on the results from the empirical usability testing, we claim that despite differences between interaction styles in contemporary mobile phones, users do not face significant difficulties when transferring to a novel mobile phone model. reviewe...|$|R
