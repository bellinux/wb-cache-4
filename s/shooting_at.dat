5|$|About {{ten minutes}} after the surrender, Pritchard heard rapid gunfire to the north. He left Davis and the {{captured}} men {{in the hands of}} his 21-year-old adjutant. Once he had approached the gunfire, he realized it was the 4th Michigan and the 1st Wisconsin <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> each other with Spencer repeating carbines, neither realizing who they were <b>shooting</b> <b>at.</b> Pritchard immediately ordered his men to stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded.|$|E

5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E

5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, framing Lépine's actions {{as the result}} of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following a <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E

5|$|Armidale {{undertook}} evasive action, manoeuvring frantically {{to avoid}} the aerial attack. However, at 15:15, the vessel was struck by two air-launched torpedoes, one hitting her port side and the other colliding with the engineering spaces, before a bomb exploded aft. Armidale listed sharply to port at this stage, and the order was given to abandon ship. As the crew leapt into the sea, they were strafed by the attacking aircraft. Sheean—after assisting to free a life-raft—was hit by two bullets {{from one of the}} aircraft, wounding him in the chest and back. Scrambling across the deck, he strapped himself into the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> the fighters in an effort to protect some of the sailors already in the sea. Subject to the fire from Sheean's Oerlikon, the Japanese aircraft were kept at bay and were unable to effectively strafe those in the water.|$|E
5|$|Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols {{was raised}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a {{softball}} pitcher, {{but he was also}} an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.|$|E
50|$|Beaufoy {{began to}} <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> {{the age of}} twenty and became an enthusiast for game shooting, preferring quality of game to quantity. He had his own <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> Coombe House, near Shaftesbury, in the border country of Wiltshire and Dorset, {{consisting}} of about fifteen hundred acres, plus another five hundred which he rented. The land was ideal for pheasant shooting. Beaufoy also ran a second <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> Ashmore in Dorset.|$|R
50|$|A tie can {{be broken}} {{in one of two}} ways: A sudden death shoot-off, used at all National and large {{regional}} competitions and for the overall match winner. Master class and AAA shooters would <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> Turkeys, AA class <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> Rams, A <b>shoots</b> <b>at</b> Chickens and B class <b>shoots</b> <b>at</b> Pigs. To save time and effort, a reverse animal count can also be used (number of hits on hardest animal to easiest), Whoever hits the most Turkeys would be the winner. If a tie still exists whoever hit the most Rams would be the winner. This would continue to Chickens and finally Pigs.|$|R

5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E
5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol <b>shooting,</b> <b>at</b> his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|E

5|$|In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez {{pleaded guilty}} to one count of {{property}} destruction and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence, thereby avoiding the charge of attempting to assassinate the President.

In September 2014, The Washington Post published an investigative report detailing errors that the Secret Service made {{on the night of the}} shooting that led to the crime going undiscovered. A House of Representatives hearing followed and Julia Pierson, director of the Secret Service, resigned the following week.

5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order.

His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore {{them out on the}} ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{attended}} Zionsville Community High School, {{where he}} became a star basketball player. He wore No. 31 {{in high school in}} honor of Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller. During his freshman year, he would get up early to practice <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> a local gym before school. The hard work paid off as Stevens made the varsity team that same year. By the time his high school career was complete, Stevens had set school records for career scoring, assists, steals, and three-point field goals. As of 2010, he still holds the records for points (1508), assists (444), and steals (156), as well as the single-season points record (644 in 1995). Stevens was named to the all-conference team three times. In 1995, he was named the sectional MVP and was the leading scorer in state sectional play (32.3 ppg).|$|E
60|$|Give a child {{a bow and}} arrow, {{and send}} him {{out into the yard}} to try it, and if he does not happen to see any thing to <b>shoot</b> <b>at,</b> he will <b>shoot</b> <b>at</b> random into the air.

He <b>shoots</b> <b>at</b> the vane on the barn, at an apple on a tree, a knot in a fence--any thing which will serve the purpose of a mark. This is not because he has any end to {{accomplish}} in hitting the vane, the apple, or the knot, but only because there is an impulse within him leading him to shoot, and if there happens to be any thing to <b>shoot</b> <b>at,</b> it gives that impulse a direction.|$|R

Maggie refuses to leave him, and {{stands in the middle of}} the road, <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> the Duke's car until he runs her down, killing her. Snake and the President reach the perimeter wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke opens fire on the wall, killing the guards and forcing Snake to dive for cover, but the President shoots the Duke dead. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives in his neck are neutralized.|$|E

5|$|The {{core of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is focused}} on stealth-based tactics, which require one to silently take out enemies using silenced weapons or other lethal attacks. However, most {{of the game is}} action-orientated, which involves Logan navigating through levels whilst loudly <b>shooting</b> <b>at</b> enemies with no consequence to the mission. The game takes place {{in a wide variety of}} locations, including narrow interior streets of Washington D.C. to wide open plains of Kazakhstan. In some stealth based missions, the game will involve various puzzles. Some locations feature low light ambience, which force the player to use their torch despite its drawbacks imposed during stealth missions.|$|E
