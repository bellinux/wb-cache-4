Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have been in <b>some</b> <b>way</b> beneficial in Galba's eyes.

The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless <b>some</b> <b>way</b> is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E

Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in <b>some</b> <b>way</b> and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in <b>some</b> <b>way</b> so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
