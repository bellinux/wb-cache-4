40|$|Taiwanese distant water {{longline}} fishery {{has operated}} throughout the WCPO since the 1960 s {{with the following}} target species: northern albacore in Regions 1 and 2 of the WCPO, bigeye and yellowfin in Regions 3 and 4, and <b>southern</b> <b>albacore</b> in Regions 5 and 6. Among the regions, fishing operations in Region 6 have the most complete time series of data, with more consistent fishing activity and species targeting than indices available from other distant water fishing nations. It is therefore considered important to obtain standardized CPUE series for this fleet and region, which may then {{be used in the}} stock assessments of WCPO yellowfin and bigeye tunas. This report provides standardized CPUE series for the two species in the region using a delta-lognormal approach. Factors affecting catch rates are investigated using regression tree methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Rent {{generated}} by the tuna fisheries occurring {{in the waters of}} Pacific Islands Nations is estimated for various levels and combinations of purse-seine, pole-and-line, frozen tuna longline, and fresh tuna longline fishing effort, using a multi-species, multi-fleet bioeconomic model. The underlying population model integrates available information on the population dynamics of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye, and <b>Southern</b> <b>albacore</b> tunas in the Pacific Ocean. The economic model utilizes the most recent data on fishing effort costs for the purse seine, pole-and-line, and longline fleets operating in the western and central Pacific Ocean, along with recent estimates of prices by species, method of capture and market, and estimates of demand elasticities. The results of the model indicate that fishery rent could be increased substantially above the current level by decreasing the size of all fleets, {{with the possible exception of}} the tuna longline fleet. The results also suggest that the countries of the region could benefit significantly by changing the level and structure of access fees levied as a percentage of total catch revenue.
