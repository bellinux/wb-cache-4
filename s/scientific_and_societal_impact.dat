40|$|ISBE {{connections}} {{should be}} formatted {{in ways that}} maximize {{the usefulness of the}} systems biology centres and, thereby, the infrastructure as a whole. They should greatly increase the yield and efficiency of European science and technology by enabling them to find, connect to, and engage with systems approaches and training thereof. The ISBE WP 13 aims to develop recommendations for what the connections in the infrastructure should comprise and how they should be structured in order to best serve the above purpose. WP 13 defines the connectivity amongst ISBE nodes that enable European systems research and training activities to integrate and scale up. Connections include computer-only, computer-assisted and human-human interactions. Through ISBE, large systems biology-driven community efforts become feasible by connecting the expertise and resources of multiple different projects in past and present, and by enabling the new workforce to do so. This builds ISBE as a platform from which to launch large-scale integrative projects with high <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> <b>societal</b> <b>impact.</b> The partners of WP 13 had finalised a draft proposal on the ISBE connections in month 15 (Deliverable D 13. 1, October 2013). In spring 2014, the steering committee initiated a structured process, led by WP 11, towards drafting a Business Case by November 2014, which was subsequently concurred with by the consortium. The concepts and designs described in D 13. 1 provided {{a key part of the}} basis from which the delineation of the structure and functional coherence of the infrastructure as a whole was further being developed, back-to-back with the full ISBE consortium. Next, WP 13 partners engaged in drafting the Business Case and embedding the proposed connections therein, not as a separate activity but within the discourse of the full modus operandi of ISBE. The contents of this document reflect the outcomes and recommendations on ISBE connections as encapsulated in the ISBE Business Plan...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} Grid {{solution}} to a grand challenge problem, the simulation and visualization of the human arterial system. We implemented our simulation and visualization system on the National Science Foundation’s TeraGrid and demonstrated it at the iGrid 2005 conference in San Diego, California. We discuss our experience in running on a computational Grid and present observations and suggestions for improving similar experiences. 1. Simulating the Human Arterial System The present study is motivated by a grand challenge problem in biomechanics — the simulation of blood flow in the entire human arterial tree—whose solution is not feasible with conventional supercomputers. This problem presents significant fundamental and application challenges, but a solution will have profound <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> <b>societal</b> <b>impacts.</b> The human arterial tree simulation problem originates from the widely accepted causal relationship between blood flow {{and the formation of}} arterial disease such as atherosclerotic plaques. These disease conditions preferentially develop in separated and recirculating flow regions such as arterial branches and bifurcations. Interactions of blood flow in the human arterial system can occur between different scales, or at similar scales in different regions, of the vascular system. At the largest scale...|$|R
30|$|Evaluations of {{research}} often include both {{qualitative and quantitative}} elements. The qualitative aspect tends to constitute a process of peer review by people with expertise within the appropriate area or different kinds of participatory approaches (workshops, interviews, etc.), whilst the quantitative aspect frequently {{involves the use of}} indicators. In the latter case, the data can be obtained e.g. by questionnaire survey. Traditionally, involvement of informed peers has been regarded as the most reliable and comprehensive way (and indeed sometimes the only way) to judge <b>scientific</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>societal</b> <b>impact</b> [4, 21].

40|$|We {{propose to}} {{investigate}} the neuroendocrine basis of arterial hypertension, which represents the most frequently encountered pathology in response to chronic exposure to a stressful environment. This proposal brings together three teams engaged {{in the study of}} cellular and tissular mechanisms involved in vascular pathologies and associated mitochondrial dysfunction correlated with risk factors (stress, aging, diabetes,…). Our organism is daily subjected to environmental changes often perceived as stressors and copes with this by triggering physiological adaptive responses, mediated in particular by an increase in circulating catecholamines. Catecholamines are among the first mediators to be released in response to stress and the adrenal medulla, which is the main source of circulating epinephrine, plays a crucial role in this process. Once delivered into the blood circulation, catecholamines exert multiple actions in particular on the cardiovascular system, leading to appropriate adjustments of blood pressure and cardiac rhythm, and on the energy metabolism. However, as a consequence of prolonged or repetitive stress, adaptive mechanisms can dysregulate, contributing to the development of several illnesses including vascular pathologies such as arterial hypertension or atherosclerosis. Although it is clearly accepted that increased circulating catecholamines can contribute to such pathologies, the involvement of the adrenal medullary tissue in arterial hypertension remains largely neglected. The SURR-TENSION project proposes to address this issue by characterizing the anatomo-functional changes occurring in the adrenal medullary tissue of a strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats. The study will be conducted using two complementary investigation approaches, both at the functional level (ex vivo in acute adrenal slices and in macrodissected medulla and in vivo in anaesthetized and freely moving rats) and at the transcriptional level. We will first focus on the remodeling of the major cellular/intercellular pathways involved in stimulus-secretion coupling, i) chromaffin cell excitability, which ensures the direct control of catecholamine secretion, ii) cholinergic synaptic transmission via the splanchnic nerve terminals that control chromaffin cells excitability and iii) gap junction-mediated cell-cell coupling allowing direct electrical and metabolic communication between chromaffin cells. Second, we will address the role of mitochondria, a Ca 2 +- sequestering organelle that {{plays an important role in}} cytosolic Ca 2 + homeostasis and therefore in catecholamine secretion. Indeed, emergent studies argue for a role of mitochondria in the dysregulation of adrenal stimulus-secretion coupling occurring in hypertension. Mitochondria will be investigated both for their ability to regulate intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis and for their crucial contribution to cellular bioenergetics (ATP production, activity of mitochondrial enzymes, mitochondrial membrane potential). This project dealing with "Stress" and "Health" will contribute to identify new adrenal medullary targets that could potentially be pertinent for the prevention or treatment of stressassociated pathologies. The SURR-TENSION project is clearly interdisciplinary and involves a unique combination of various technical <b>and</b> <b>scientific</b> expertise, brought by the three partners. The results will have direct <b>scientific,</b> economic <b>and</b> <b>societal</b> <b>impacts</b> since they will i) prompt further research on the link between the adrenal medullary tissue and the development and/or maintenance of arterial hypertension, ii) allow to formulate new recommandations for stress care, and iii) provide new molecular or cellular targets for preclinical and clinical R&D in stress-associated disorders...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. invests {{billions of}} taxpayers 2 ̆ 7 dollars in {{research}} {{tied to the}} national priorities that contribute to its competitiveness in a global economy. As the federal funding agency with an explicit focus on engineering education, the National Science Foundation (NSF) contains a portfolio of projects focused on improving the quantity of engineering graduates {{and the quality of}} engineering programs. Within the agency, the Division of Undergraduate Education invests approximately 190 million (FY 2012) annually on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education projects. Although the DUE portfolio includes a suite a projects with different foci supporting national initiatives and Principal Investigators (PIs) report their results in annual reports and conferences, there is little consistency on how impact is defined, evaluated, and measured. ^ While many agree on the importance of investing in research, the stiff economic climate necessitates that the research that demonstrates impact is what will continue to be supported. However, the dearth of scholarship on impact contributes to the lack of understanding around this topic. This study links the fragmented literature on impact to form a unified starting point for continuing the conversation. While existing literature includes three dimensions of research <b>impact</b> (i. e., <b>scientific,</b> <b>societal,</b> <b>and</b> domain-specific <b>impact),</b> this study focuses on the domain-specific impacts of engineering education research using two guiding frameworks, namely, Toulmin 2 ̆ 7 s Model (1958) and the Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development (Earle et al., 2013), and a multiphase mixed methods research design (Creswell 2 ̆ 6 Plano Clark, 2011). ^ The qualitative phase of this study explores how researchers on NSF-funded STEM education R 2 ̆ 6 D projects talk about the impact of their work; the findings reveal eight themes that are commonly discussed when PIs articulate the impact of their research, and two themes related to how they support their claims. The findings also indicate that the STEM discipline associated with the study and the project focus {{have more to do with}} the types of impact PIs claim than the amount of funding awarded to the project. As a result of identifying the points of alignment between PIs 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on impact and existing literature, a preliminary description of what impact looks like in this context is proposed—using the three dimensions of research impact as an organizing framework. Although this study puts forth a preliminary description of the impact of STEM education research, extensions of this work are necessary before providing practitioners and policymakers with a valid, comprehensive framework characterizing what impact means in this context. ^ Ideas supporting the types of claims PIs make when discussing the impact of their work were used to develop a survey that was distributed to a small sample of current and former NSF Program Officers (POs) in the second phase of this study. The survey results provide preliminary evidence on how PIs and NSF PO 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on research impact compare, and affirm that additional studies are needed. Consequently, implications for policy and practice and potential research directions are also discussed. ...|$|R
