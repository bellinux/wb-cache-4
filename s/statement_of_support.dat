Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard issued a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E

500|$|When Dudley was {{commissioned}} in 1686 to temporarily head the Dominion of New England, Stoughton {{was appointed to}} his council, and he was then elected by the council as the deputy president. [...] During the administration of Sir Edmund Andros {{he served as a}} magistrate and on the council. [...] As a magistrate he was particularly harsh on the town leaders of Ipswich, who had organized tax protests against the dominion government, based on the claim that dominion rule without representation violated the Rights of Englishmen. When Andros was arrested in April 1689 in a bloodless uprising inspired by the 1688 Glorious Revolution in England, Stoughton was one of the signatories to the declaration of the revolt's ringleaders. [...] Despite this <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for the popular cause, he was sufficiently unpopular due to his association with Andros that he was denied elective offices. [...] He appealed to the politically powerful Mather family, with whom he still had positive relations. [...] In 1692, when Increase Mather and Sir William Phips arrived from England carrying the charter for the new Province of Massachusetts Bay and a royal commission for Phips as governor, they also brought one for Stoughton as lieutenant governor.|$|E

The Special Representative and head of the newly created United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA), Abou Moussa, said that international interest in Kony was [...] "useful, very important". The White House released a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> through Press Secretary Jay Carney, who stated in a news conference, [...] "We congratulate {{the hundreds of thousands of}} Americans who have mobilized to this unique crisis of conscience" [...] and said that the raised awareness from the video is [...] "consistent with the bipartisan legislation passed by our congress in 2010." [...] Cameron Hudson, policy director at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and former Africa director in the National Security Council, also praised Invisible Children for reaching [...] "tens of millions of people who probably never previously heard of Joseph Kony."

500|$|On September 11, Matthew Woll, an AFL vice-president, {{said his}} {{organization}} discouraged strikes by government employees but defended {{their right to}} organize: [...] "all wage earners {{have the right to}} associate with one another and collectively to improve their condition". He blamed the strike on government managers who failed to recognize that right and put the Boston situation {{in the context of the}} broader union movement: [...] "On the question of industrial democracy , we find still that group of employers, Bourbonic in character, who believe democracy means for them to ruin or rule industrially. They cannot conceive that the workers have any right in the management of industry. ... The time has passed when any man can say he is the ruler of the people in his employment." [...] AFL President Samuel Gompers, just returned from Europe, quickly assessed the situation and the strength of public sentiment. On September 12, he urged the strikers to return to work, asking the city to agree to suspend judgment on whether to recognize the police union. In a telegram to Mayor Peters he cited the model of Washington, D.C., which had, at the suggestion of President Wilson, suspended its regulation forbidding police officers to join a union affiliated with the AFL until a conference scheduled for October 6. The police accepted Gompers' recommendation immediately. Coolidge replied with a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for Curtis' hard line. Gompers telegraphed Coolidge again, this time blaming Curtis for the crisis. Coolidge dismissed the Commissioner's behavior as irrelevant, because no provocation could justify the police walkout. His terse summation created his reputation on the national scene: [...] "There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime." [...] Coolidge said he would continue to [...] "defend the sovereignty of Massachusetts." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} full season in 1938, he batted [...]343 – behind only batting {{champion}} Jimmie Foxx's [...]349 – while leading the league with 18 triples. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a [...]292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. [...] "It was just another blunder in a bad season that has been full of mistakes", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, [...] "I'm going to show 'em I'm no flash in the pan. Last year I was overswinging and taking my eye of the ball. I'm {{not going to do that}} this season." [...] During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players and by the end of it, a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low [...]219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh.|$|E
