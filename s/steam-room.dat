It seemed strange that beyond the buttressed walls of Caprona icebergs floated and the south wind was biting, for only a gentle breeze moved {{across the face of}} these living waters, and that was damp and warm.

The king had originally expressed surprise at Edward's request asking him [...] "What could you possibly want that queer old place for? Those damn weekends I suppose", but then smiled and gave his permission. Edward's previous residence had been York House, part of St. James's Palace in London, which he had thought [...] "more an office than a home." [...] He would later write that he [...] "created a home at the fort just as my father and grandfather had created one at Sandringham ... here I spent some of the happiest days of my life."During Edward's occupancy, extensive renovation of the interior and grounds was carried out. I came to love the Fort as I loved no other material thing - perhaps {{because it was so}} much my own creation" [...] - Edward, Duke of Windsor [...] He built a swimming pool at the fort between 1931 and 1932, that replaced an old lily pond, and added a tennis court and developed stables in the grounds of the fort.

Notable interior decorators to work on the fort under Edward included Sybil Colefax, Lady Mendl, Maison Jansen, and Herman Schrijver. Edward and Wallis entertained most weekends at the house; guests present included 'courtiers and diplomats, American men of affairs and English Society, garnished with a sprinkling of statesmen, soldiers and sailors'. Giles Gilbert Scott added a guest wing to the fort after Edward's accession as king in 1936. In 1936 Wallis moved permanently to the fort after receiving threatening anonymous letters, and left Fort Belvedere for the final time on 3 December 1936, a week before Edward's abdication.|$|E
