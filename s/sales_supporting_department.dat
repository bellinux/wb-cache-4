The question this thesis attempts to answer is: How can Nordea keep its current child customers loyal? The thesis describes the communication of the bank, the process of forming a relationship and a dialogue between the bank and its child customers. The term 'child customer' means minor customers who have an account at Nordea, children of age 0 to 17 years. The main concentration is on the ages 3 to 17 years. The method: The relationship dialogue model of Christian Grönroos is being used because he has specialized in services. This model builds a holistic view of a relationship communication by taking different kinds of marketing methods and messages into consideration {{and can be used}} to analyze the deepness of a relationship. Theories of consumer socialization, reference group, financial lifecycle, different stages of children’s development and customer clubs are being used to create a better picture of the communication and other factors influencing it. Most of the empirical material is collected in forms of interviews from Nordea´s <b>sales</b> <b>support</b> <b>department</b> and from two bank offices, which are both situated in Eastern Vantaa, in Finland...|$|R

50|$|Some {{elevator}} manufacturers {{may also}} employ trained staff in technical <b>sales</b> and <b>support</b> engineering <b>departments</b> {{to assist in}} the design of elevator and escalator systems. Elevator consultants however, are generally employed as independent contractors by architects, engineers or directly by property owners for large scale building projects involving multiple technical disciplines. A design team for a major building project will often require a specific technical design experience by professional consultants, such as a kitchen consultant, lighting consultant, audio-visual consultant, landscape architect, and/or am elevator consultant to supplement the technical work of the architect and engineer. It is expected by the Owner that these design teams will avoid using consultants that represent a specific manufacturer to minimize the potential, or even the appearance of a conflict of interest.|$|R

40|$|The {{reciprocal}} {{method for}} allocating costs of <b>support</b> <b>departments</b> {{is the only}} method that recognizes all services provided to other departments. Yet, even {{as the number of}} <b>support</b> <b>departments</b> and their costs increase, the adoption of the reciprocal method has been hampered since it requires solving simultaneous equations for reciprocated costs of each <b>support</b> <b>department.</b> Matrix functions in spreadsheets will solve for reciprocated costs of many <b>support</b> <b>departments.</b> The Sasha Case illustrates the use of matrices to model services among <b>support</b> and operating <b>departments,</b> to solve simultaneous equations for the reciprocated costs of <b>support</b> <b>departments,</b> and to allocate the reciprocated costs to other departments...|$|R
