5|$|Christy has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her storyline with Billie, which {{was compared to}} those from previous seasons. Her role as a villain received positive attention, while Patterson's acting was cited as over-exaggerated.

The development of Uxbridge declined after the opening of the Great Western Railway in 1838, which passed through West Drayton. A branch line to Uxbridge was not built until 1904.|$|E

Asellus and White Rose remain on the run from Orlouge's many servants, but after White Rose sacrifices herself to save Asellus's life and freedom, Asellus decides to return and defeat Orlouge, to end the struggle once and for all. Depending on the actions the player does, there are three endings, in which she end live on as a human, half Mystic, or complete Mystic.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Robert's {{agreement}} with the Crown, the government of England was controlled by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella of France, who was ruling as regent {{in the name of}} her young son, Edward III. Isabella fell from power when Edward toppled Mortimer in a coup d'état in 1330, but after a short period of house arrest she led a relatively normal life, enjoying considerable <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> King's mother. Edward granted Isabella several royal castles in England, including Castle Rising. Robert had died in 1329 and in 1331 Emma sold her rights to the castle to Isabella for £400.|$|E
5|$|Being the South's {{first line}} of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E

5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she could be used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational <b>status.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Despite the splendidly sized new {{building}} (albeit a plain one), the church declined in <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> college gradually died. It {{is possible that}} the community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. Nor do we know whether the clas resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with the appointment of a rector by King Henry III in 1246, although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost. There have been suggestions that there were one or more chantry chapels, which could suggest the presence of more than one priest.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{gained a}} home in {{television}} in the 1960s animated sitcom The Flintstones, in another example of dinosaurs shown as coexisting with humans (for comedic effect in this case). Dinosaurs also entered comic books in this period in such series as Tor and Turok, where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs. For those wanting more scientific accounts of dinosaurs, there were the first nontechnical dinosaur books. Ned Colbert's The Dinosaur Book (1945) was the first such book, and its <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure for the coming generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts.|$|E
