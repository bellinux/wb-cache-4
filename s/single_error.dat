On June 29, Rixey pitched a four-hit shutout against the New York Giants, facing the minimum 27batters, because of three double plays, and a player caught stealing. In 1917, despite having a 2.27 earned run average, Rixey {{led the league in}} {{pitching}} losses with 21. He also handled 108chances without a <b>single</b> <b>error.</b> Rixey hated losing and was known for destroying the team locker room, or disappearing {{for days at a time}} after a loss. He missed the 1918 season to serve in the Chemical Warfare Division of the United States army during the war effort. He struggled upon returning to baseball, going 6–12 with a 3.97earned run average in 1919, and again leading the league in losses with 22 in 1920. Prior to the 1920 season, rumours circulated that his former manager, Pat Moran, now with the Cincinnati Reds, was interested in trading for Rixey. The relationship between Rixey and manager Gavvy Cravath was never good, and Cravath had made known his desire to trade him; however, he stayed with the Phillies that season, working on his delivery with former pitcher Jesse Tannehill, who, Rixey admitted, helped with his pitching delivery.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new architecture for the reliable {{implementation of the}} symmetric-key algorithm Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Since FPGAs are prone to soft errors caused by radiation, and AES is highly sensitive to errors, reliable architectures are of significant concern. Energetic particles hitting a device can flip bits in FPGA SRAM cells controlling {{all aspects of the}} implementation. Unlike previous research, heterogeneous error detection techniques based on properties of the circuit and functionality are used to provide adequate reliability at the lowest possible cost. The use of dual ported block memory for SubBytes, duplication for the control circuitry, and a new enhanced parity technique for MixColumns is proposed. Previous parity techniques cover <b>single</b> <b>errors</b> in datapath registers, however, soft errors can occur in the control circuitry as well as in SRAM cells forming the combinational logic and routing. In this research, propagation of <b>single</b> <b>errors</b> is investigated in the routed netlist. Weaknesses of the previous parity techniques are identified. Architectural redesign at the register-transfer level is introduced to resolve undetected <b>single</b> <b>errors</b> in both the routing and the combinational logic. Reliability of the AES implementation is not only a critical issue in large scale FPGA-based systems but also at both higher altitudes and in space applications where there are a larger number of energetic particles. Thus, this research is important for providing efficient soft error resistant design in many current and future secure applications...|$|R

The deinterlever at the succeeding stage distributes these erasures across 28 D2 codewords. Again in most solutions, D2 is set to deal with erasures only (a simpler and less expensive solution). If more than 4 erasures were to be encountered, 24 erasures are output by D2. Thereafter, an error concealment system attempts to interpolate (from neighboring symbols) in case of uncorrectable symbols, failing which sounds corresponding to such erroneous symbols get muted.|$|E
