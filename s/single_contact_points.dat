5000|$|Both hairy {{and smooth}} pads in {{arthropods}} act {{to maximize the}} amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. [...] Hairy pads can be classified as pulvillus, fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy attachment pads employed few other features, such as flaw tolerance, lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the attachment strength in hairy systems is realized by {{increasing the number of}} <b>single</b> <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> [...] Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. [...] Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. [...] Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the terminal plate, which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy attachment pads of reduviid bugs, flies [...] and beetles [...] secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains non-volatile, lipid-like substances, but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. [...] Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration.|$|E

The Diabetics group gets feedback about their medication intake, activity level, glucose level and food intake. The office workers receive feedback about physical activity and food intake. The feedback to the users of the system consists of personalized reminders, advice and tips, or learn more about why healthy behaviour is important.

The phenomenon occurs due to coupling between normal and rotational degrees-of-freedom such that the effective normal force becomes attractive rather than repulsive. Despite a rich literature, the forward evolution problem remains unsolved other than in certain restricted cases in 2 D with <b>single</b> <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> Various practical consequences of the theory are revisited, including models for robotic manipulators, and the strange behaviour of chalk when pushed rather than dragged across a blackboard. Reviewing recent theory, a general formulation is proposed, including a Poisson or energetic impact law. The general problem in 2 D with a {{single point of contact}} is discussed and cases or inconsistency or indeterminacy enumerated. Strategies to resolve the paradox via contact regularisation are discussed from a dynamical systems point of view. By passing to the infinite stiffness limit and allowing impact without collision, inconsistent and indeterminate cases are shown to be resolvable for all open sets of conditions. However, two unavoidable ambiguities that can be reached in finite time are discussed in detail, so called dynamic jam and reverse chatter. A partial review is given of 2 D cases with two points of contact showing how a greater complexity of inconsistency and indeterminacy can arise. Extension to fully three-dimensional analysis is briefly considered and shown to lead to further possible singularities. In conclusion, the ubiquity of the paradox is highlighted and open problems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Roughness is everywhere. Every object, every surface we {{touch or}} look at, is rough. Even when it looks smooth and flat, if {{analyzed}} {{at the proper}} length scale, it will reveal roughness. Thus, macro-scale, micro-scale, and even nano-scale roughness exist. What is even more fascinating, {{is that most of}} the rough structures, which can be observed at a given length scale, repeat themselves at smaller length scales, as in a fractal. The first implication of the rough nature of surfaces is that what we perceive as a full, solid, and smooth contact area, is in reality a collection of fragmented microscopical contact patches, composed of <b>single</b> <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> Given its intrinsic complexity, the modeling of the real area of contact has been the subject of a huge amount of studies, which yielded different and contrasting results. As it is easy to imagine, the real area of contact is crucial for many real-world applications, such as the prediction of wear and fretting, charge and heat conduction, and frictional effect. Let alone think of how an acting load is normally believed to be uniformly distributed over the contact surface, and how variable and uneven it must, in reality, appear at microscopic length scales. The importance of roughness, together with our knowledge in parallel computing and fast solution methods, are the premises of the current work. In this study, we analyze rough contact between realistic surfaces, and we resolve it numerically at micro-scale, to understand its meso- and macro-scale effects. We do this by means of the Finite Element Method, in combination with an optimal multi-grid strategy and a spatial decomposition to perform the computations on highly parallel super-computers. We concentrate on the type of surfaces for which it is believed that molecular and chemical effects can be neglected. We simulate the contact between an elastic cube and diverse rigid rough surfaces, under different loading conditions, and we derive empirical laws which describe the influence of well known roughness parameters on important features such as contact evolution and static friction production. We also define bounds on the uncertainty of our measurements, to make clear the level up to which our predictions have to be considered reliable and applicable. Literature on roughness is densely populated by models, approaches, and theoretical predictions about the evolution of the real area of contact. An exhaustive comparison of our results with such corpus of works, articles, books, and theses would be infeasible. We therefore compare our results on the real area of contact to the predictions of two widely accepted theories (one by B. N. J. Persson, the other by A. W. Bush, R. D. Gibson, and T. R. Thomas), which have often proved to be interpretable as asymptotical bounds, for systems at low pressures. For large pressures, and consequent large areas of contact, we also compare our results to the newly developed and semi-empirical theory by Yastrebov, Molinari, and Anciaux. Finally, we test our method on the real world problem of tyre-asphalt interactions on wet roads, comparing the results obtained by our method to data from other studies, collected on real highways and runways, and to a theoretical model, which is close, in the assumptions, to our numerical experiments...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} that concerns chemistry is the design of molecules able to modulate protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, since these are involved in many physiological and pathological processes. The interactions occurring between proteins and their natural counterparts can take place through reciprocal recognition of rather large surface areas, through recognition of <b>single</b> <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> and single residues, through inclusion of the substrates in specific, more or less deep binding sites. In many cases, the design of synthetic molecules able {{to interfere with the}} processes involving proteins can benefit from the possibility of exploiting the multivalent effect. Multivalency, widely spread in Nature, consists in the simultaneous formation between two entities (cell-cell, cell-protein, protein-protein) of multiple equivalent ligand-recognition site complexes. In this way the whole interaction results particularly strong and specific. Calixarenes furnish a very interesting scaffold for the preparation of multivalent ligands and in the last years calixarene-based ligands demonstrated their remarkable capability to recognize and inhibit or restore the activity of different proteins, with a high efficiency and selectivity in several recognition phenomena. The relevance and versatility of these ligands is due to the different exposition geometries of the binding units that can be explored exploiting the conformational properties of these macrocycles, the wide variety of functionalities that can be linked to their structure at different distances from the aromatic units and to their intrinsic multivalent nature. With the aim of creating new multivalent systems for protein targeting, the work reported in this thesis regards the synthesis and properties of glycocalix[n]arenes and guanidino calix[4]arenes for different purposes. Firstly, a new bolaamphiphile glycocalix[4]arene in 1, 3 -alternate geometry, bearing cellobiose, was synthesized for the preparation of targeted drug delivery systems based on liposomes. The formed stable mixed liposomes obtained by mixing the macrocycle with DOPC were shown to be able of exploiting the sugar units emerging from the lipid bilayer to agglutinate Concanavalin A, a lectin specific for glucose. Moreover, always thanks to the presence of the glycocalixarene in the layer, the same liposomes demonstrated through preliminary experiments to be uptaken by cancer cells overexpressing glucose receptors on their exterior surface more efficiently respect to simple DOPC liposomes lacking glucose units in their structure. Then a small library of glycocalix[n]arenes having different valency and geometry was prepared, for the creation of potentially active immunostimulants against Streptococcus pneumoniae, particularly the 19 F serotype, one of the most virulent. These synthesized glycocalixarenes bearing β-N-acetylmannosamine as antigenic unit were compared with the natural polysaccharide on the binding to the specific anti- 19 F human polyclonal antibody, to verify their inhibition potency. Among all, the glycocalixarene based on the conformationally mobile calix[4]arene resulted the more efficient ligand, probably due its major possibility to explore the antibody surface and dispose the antigenic units in a proper arrangement for the interaction process. These results pointed out the importance of how the different multivalent presentation in space of the glycosyl units can influence the recognition phenomena. At last, NMR studies, using particularly 1 H- 15 N HSQC experiments, were performed on selected glycocalix[6]arenes and guanidino calix[4]arenes blocked in the cone geometry, in order to better understand protein-ligand interactions. The glycosylated compounds were studied with Ralstonia solanacearum lectin, in order to better understand the nature of the carbohydrate‐lectin interactions in solution. The series of cationic calixarene was employed with three different acidic proteins: GB 1, Fld and alpha synuclein. Particularly GB 1 and Fld were observed to interact with all five cationic calix[4]arenes but showing different behaviours and affinities...|$|E
