5000|$|... 1992Two <b>capital</b> <b>reductions</b> within J.E. Ekornes AS {{were carried}} out during 1992. At the Annual General Meeting on June 29 the <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> of NOK 72,073,880 was written down to NOK 0. This <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> was used to cover losses {{which could not be}} covered in any other way. The <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> was {{achieved}} by redeeming the shares. The Ekornes family's subordinated loan of NOK 2,700,000 was converted into shares. After this, the new <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> amounts to NOK 2,052,000. At the company's Annual General Meeting on October 5, 1992 it was agreed to write down the <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> of NOK 2,052,000 as well. This <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> was also achieved by redeeming the shares. At the same time as this latest <b>capital</b> <b>reduction,</b> 1,026,000 new <b>shares</b> were issued in the company, each with a nominal value of NOK 1. These shares constituted the company's <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> as of December 31, 1992. The Ekornes Group showed a profit {{for the first time since}} 1984.

Incorporation with limited liability enabled companies to ‘lock-in’ their financial capital’ and then invest in the long-term, highly specific investments on which the modern industrial economy would be based. The level of benefit varied from country to country, according to the way that the concept of capital lock-in, or maintenance, was defined in the legal systems concerned. In the UK, the concept was not well defined in early company legislation and challenges were raised through the courts during the late nineteenth century. Some of these, the ‘dividend cases’, have been quite widely considered in the literature but direct <b>reductions</b> of <b>share</b> <b>capital,</b> or <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> schemes, have received far less attention, even though they raised fundamental issues concerning long-term dividend positions, the accounting treatment of accumulated losses, depreciation and asset values and had important effects {{on the development of the}} capital maintenance doctrine and on shareholder class rights. The purpose of this paper is to question whether this literature adequately captures judicial influences on the development of the capital maintenance doctrine in England during the latter part of the nineteenth century, given the limited attention that has been paid to date to the leading <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> cases.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} Swedish minimum capital requirement in relation to the Swedish private limited liability companies. The issue of whether there should be a requirement for minimum <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> has been debated in Sweden {{and the rest of the}} European Union. Sweden and other continental European countries have a tradition of providing a minimum <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> requirement in order to provide creditor protection. Countries that administer an Anglo-Saxon tradition such as England and the United States do not express the same belief in the minimum <b>share</b> <b>capital’s</b> function as creditor protection and has therefore abolished these requirements. The European Union’s Second Company Law Directive provides a minimum <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> of EUR 25, 000 for companies similar to the Swedish public limited liability company. The companies comparable to the Swedish private limited liability companies is thus regulated under the law of the Member States themselves. In Sweden the frequently used arguments for abolishing the minimum <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> requirement are the rule’s dysfunction as creditor protection, the fact that the minimum <b>share</b> <b>capital</b> does not consider the specific capital demand of the company and the potential obstacle effect on entrepreneurship. The author agrees with these arguments but emphasises the minimum <b>share</b> <b>capital’s</b> function as an “entrance fee” to the private limited liability company form as an argument why the requirement should maintain in Swedish company law. The rules in ABL regarding protection of restricted equity could be replaced by a solvency-sufficiency test similar to the provision in § 6. 40 MBCA. The minimum <b>share</b> <b>capital’s</b> obstacle effect on entrepreneurship could be reduced by introducing a beneficial loan with low interest rate provided by the state or the municipalities...|$|R
