5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of worship of a more benign form of Kaali, as Daksinakali, is often attributed to Krishnananda Agamavagisha. He was a noted Bengali leader of the 17th century, author of a Tantra encyclopedia called Tantrasara. According to hearsay - Kaali appeared {{to him in a}} dream and told him to popularize her in a particular form that would appear to him the following day. The next morning he observed a young woman making cow dung patties. While placing a patty on a wall, <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> the alidha pose, with her right foot forward. When she saw Krishnananda watching her, she was embarrassed and put her tongue between her teeth. Krishnananada took his previous worship of Kali out of the cremation grounds and into a more domestic setting. Krishnananda Vagamavagisha was also the guru of the Kaali devotee and poet Ramprasad Sen.|$|E

25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten.

Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E

Amanda Holpuch from The Guardian recalled that the performance of [...] "G.U.Y." [...] received [...] "as much love as [...] first big hit 'Just Dance'". April Spanos from The Village Voice rendered the performances of [...] "Applause" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y." [...] as the [...] "power duo" [...] of the night. She added that the latter was [...] "particularly pleasant to hear live; the Zedd beat was made to be experienced in a club and its crunch was felt all over the dancefloor." [...] Conversely, Hilary Hughes from USA Today felt that the simplest moments of the performances were the ones featuring toned down versions of her singles like [...] "Born This Way" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", rather than the [...] "extravagant" [...] choreography during [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y."

Canadian singer Anjulie became [...] "obsessed with music" [...] and [...] "developed [...] through watching" [...] the tour, recalling [...] "I remember seeing The Velvet Rope Tour and then getting the VHS of that, putting it on slow motion so that I could learn every single dance move."
