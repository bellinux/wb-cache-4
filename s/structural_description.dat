40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{natural deduction}} proofs of the Lambek calculus {{from the point}} of view of tree automata. The main result is that the set of proofs of the Lambek calculus cannot be accepted by a finite tree automaton. The proof is extended to cover the proofs used by grammars based on the Lambek calculus, which typically use only a subset of the set of all proofs. While Lambek grammars can assign regular tree languages as <b>structural</b> <b>descriptions,</b> there exist Lambek grammars that assign non-regular <b>structural</b> <b>descriptions,</b> both when considering normal and non-normal proof trees. Combining the results of Pentus (1993) and Thatcher (1967), we can conclude that Lambek grammars, although generating only context-free languages, can extend the strong generative capacity of context-free grammars. Furthermore, we show that <b>structural</b> <b>descriptions</b> that disregard the use of introduction rules cannot be used for a compositional semantics following the Curry-Howard isomorphism. ...|$|R

5000|$|Chomsky {{states that}} much of modern {{structural}} linguistics {{in the first half}} of the 20th century were preoccupied with observational adequacy.

But for Chomsky this still gives us little insight into the nature of linguistic structure. Therefore a comprehensive coverage of all data in the [...] "observational adequacy" [...] or all <b>structural</b> <b>descriptions</b> at the [...] "descriptive adequacy" [...] level would not be worthwhile nor interesting. A successful linguistic theory must achieve the higher level of [...] "explanatory adequacy", describing the distinctive features of a natural language as opposed to any set of <b>structural</b> <b>descriptions.</b> For Chomsky, considering the stage where linguistics was at the time, such depth of analysis seemed more important than ever-broadening scope.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the idea of characterizing {{sentences}} by the shapes of their <b>structural</b> <b>descriptions</b> only; for example, {{in the case of}} context free grammars, by the shapes of the derivation trees only. Such <b>structural</b> <b>descriptions</b> will be called skeletons. A skeleton exhibits all of the grouping structure (phrase structure) of the sentence without naming the syntactic categories used in the description. The inclusion of syntactic categories as variables is primarily a question of economy of description. Every context free grammar is strongly equivalent to a skeletal grammar, in a sense made precise in the paper. Besides clarifying the role of skeletons in mathematical linguistics, we show that skeletal automata provide a characterization of local sets, remedying a “defect” in the usual tree automata theory. We extend the method of skeletal <b>structural</b> <b>descriptions</b> to other forms of tree describing systems. We also suggest a theoretical basis for grammatical inference based on grouping structure only...|$|R

In this step the <b>structural</b> <b>description</b> is mapped onto the semantic representations giving rise to a full specification of the object. Researchers differ in their belief [...] of how perceptual knowledge has an effect. Some believe that the loss of perceptual attributes should always accompany structural similarity.
