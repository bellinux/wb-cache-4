The local quarries {{were used}} to produce masonry and [...] "stubensand", an early abrasive which was very popular for household cleaning in the 18th and 19th centuries. The town castle, built by the von Kürnbach family and later used by the von Sternenfels, was completely demolished and used to produce stubensand by 1778. In 1866 an observation tower was built and triggered local tourism. Sternenfels image was coined by the [...] "sandbauern", farmers that produced stubensand and wove baskets besides farming. The intensive stubensand production led to damages in the local forests and ongoing conflicts between {{the community and the}} sandbauern, which were entitled to excavate stubensandstone in the local forests. The last <b>sand</b> <b>mill</b> was closed in 1935, however sandbauern costumes are still worn sometimes and the sandbauern image is used to promote the village.

The 14 m high Water tower on the former castle hill was built during 1967 as part of the Lake of Constance Water supply system and styled as a keep. The tower is open for the public and allows an excellent view both over Kraichgau and Stromberg. It includes as well an historic exhibition about the local nobility and geology.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the reasons}} for this was {{expected}} to be the oil contamination during the filtration stage due to the possible leakage of lubricant oil from the larox filter pressing stage; hence, the same larox lubricating oil, RENOLIN B, grade 46 was doped with the pigment during filtration. Another source for oil contamination is from the <b>sand</b> <b>mills</b> during the grinding process. The gear oil used in such mills can leak and contaminate the slurry which proceeds to the surface treatment process. In order to avoid this oil contamination, an effective monitoring of all the <b>sand</b> <b>mills</b> and larox filter for oil leak is required.|$|R

One of the causes of that fact is that lots of brands have become this aspect into their hallmark; a clear example is the red of Ferrari or the green of Jaguar. Thus, {{due to the fact that}} exists a continuous competence between companies to be the industry leader, paints suffer a fast and continuous evolution process to provide better protection and larger range of colours and effects. That is the reason why AkzoNobel, leading global company headquartered in Amsterdam, has decided to carry out a project to study the gloss stability of matte clearcoats due to their increasing demand. This is a hard task even for the most experienced technicians. That is because these clearcoats are characterized by having a hard gloss adjust due to their non-linear performance on the addition of matting agents. By this study, it is expected to achieve a better comprehension of how the gloss is affected by the coat thickness and by the time. In addition, it is also studied if these clearcoats show good painting reproducibility related to the liquid product stability. For this study, the performance of four currently used clearcoats will be observed and compared in order to determine which of them is the best. With that aim, the clearcoats are prepared using two formulations (A and B) and two different dispersion processes (Cowles and <b>sand</b> <b>mill)</b> and several pieces are painted. Through the obtained results, it is observed that the stability is improved by using the <b>sand</b> <b>mill</b> dispersion and that the most stable clearcoat is the one which uses the formulation B and the <b>sand</b> <b>mill</b> dispersion...|$|E

30|$|The {{exfoliation}} {{of natural}} molybdenite powders towards FL-MoS 2 nanosheets {{was conducted in}} the home-made CUM system (Fig.  1) using NMP as the solvent containing PVP as the exfoliation agent at ~ 25  °C. The exfoliation of natural molybdenite powders by the CUM process was conducted under the similar conditions. Typically, natural molybdenite powders (~ 11.25  g) and PVP (~ 3.9  g) were dispersed in 250  mL of NMP, forming a mixture with an initial molybdenite concentration of 45  g L− 1 and a PVP concentration of 15.6  g L− 1. The above mixture was ultrasonically treated for ~ 20  min and then was poured into the <b>sand</b> <b>mill.</b> The synergistic exfoliation under milling and cavitation was kept for 4  h using the CUM process (Fig.  1). The diameter of the horn in the ultrasonication system was 10  mm, and the ultrasonication power was 280  W. The ultrasonication acted intermittently, i.e., 3  s on and 1  s off, avoiding damage to the ultrasonic processor because of heating. The rotation speed of the <b>sand</b> <b>mill</b> was kept at 2250 r.p.m. The as-obtained FL-MoS 2 suspension was classified by centrifugation at various speeds to achieve FL-MoS 2 dispersions. Some of the FL-MoS 2 dispersions were centrifuged, washed carefully, and then freeze-dried to achieve FL-MoS 2 nanosheets.|$|E
30|$|The {{possible}} {{sources of}} oil contamination are during sand milling and larox filtration process. The oil leak {{is due to}} lack of monitoring system and improper maintenance. The oil used in the <b>sand</b> <b>mill</b> rotator for avoiding friction can leak due to its continuous use. Likewise, the larox oil can leak during the pressing process, which can contaminate the filtered cake. In order to investigate this issue, it was decided to study the impact of oil contamination on the pigment, color, and brightness values and correlate the color and brightness values measured using different methods.|$|E
30|$|The {{exfoliation}} {{of natural}} molybdenite powders {{was conducted in}} a home-made coupled ultrasonication-milling (CUM) system. As Fig.  1 a shows, this system consists of an ultrasonic instrument and a <b>sand</b> <b>mill</b> that are commercially available. Possible working mechanism in this CUM system {{can be described as}} Fig.  1 b. Its unique feature is that the sand milling and ultrasonication can act at the same time. The major difference of between conventional wet ball milling and sand milling is their rotation speeds. The rotation speed of sand milling in this exfoliation is more than 2000 r.p.m, much higher than that of the conventional wet ball milling. Also, the special recycling in the sand milling can improve the exfoliation efficiency. With the CUM system, natural molybdenite powders can be exfoliated to few-layer MoS 2 nanosheets via classification by centrifuging, as shown as Fig.  1 c.|$|E

30|$|Cutting {{force is}} one of the {{research}} hotspots in direct <b>sand</b> mould <b>milling</b> because the cutting force directly affects the machining quality and tool wear. Unlike metals, sand mould is a heterogeneous discrete deposition material. There is still a lack of theoretical research on the cutting force. In order to realize the prediction and control of the cutting force in the <b>sand</b> mould <b>milling</b> process, an analytical model of cutting force is proposed based on the unequal division shear zone model of orthogonal cutting. The deformation velocity relations of the chip within the orthogonal cutting shear zone are analyzed first. According to the flow behavior of granular, the unequal division shear zone model of sand mould is presented, in which the governing equations of shear strain rate, strain and velocity are established. The constitutive relationship of quasi-solid–liquid transition is introduced to build the 2 D constitutive equation and deduce the cutting stress in the mould shear zone. According to the cutting geometric relations of up milling with straight cutting edge and the transformation relationship between cutting stress and cutting force, the dynamic cutting forces are predicted for different milling conditions. Compared with the experimental results, the predicted results show good agreement, indicating that the predictive model of cutting force in <b>milling</b> <b>sand</b> mould is validated. Therefore, the proposed model can provide the theoretical guidance for cutting force control in high efficiency <b>milling</b> <b>sand</b> mould.|$|R

This paper reports a novel coupled ultrasonication-milling (CUM) process to exfoliate natural molybdenite powders to achieve few-layer MoS 2 (FL-MoS 2) nanosheets in the solvent of N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) molecules. The synergistic effect of ultrasonication and sand milling highly enhanced the exfoliation efficiency, and the precursor of natural molybdenite powders minimizes the synthetic cost of FL-MoS 2 nanosheets.

30|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. TiO 2 is unique because it efficiently scatters visible light, thereby imparting whiteness, brightness, and opacity when incorporated into a coating. Dry compacted TiO 2 samples are characterized by their brightness and whiteness and exhibit reflectance properties approaching that of the perfect reflecting diffuser. ‘Color’ is carefully controlled during the TiO 2 manufacturing process through the removal of the trace amounts of metal oxide contaminants. These light-absorbing contaminants will detract from the brightness and whiteness of the pigment and can affect the appearance of white and near-white paints containing that pigment. The opacity of white pigments mainly derives from the scattering, while the opacity of black pigments is a result of absorption ability[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It was observed that if the TiO 2 is produced in a commercial production plant on particular days when there is oil leak in the larox filter, the color and brightness of the produced pigment failed when measured the same in acrylic lacquer paint (vehicle b). Also, this failure is not seen when the color and brightness are measured in dry mode (dry b). These observations were not a single case but were seen occasionally in the quality analysis. The failure in the vehicle color, once commenced, was seen continued consecutively with three to four final products. The sources of oil contamination during the manufacturing process can be as follows: In the chloride process of manufacturing TiO 2, rutile or high-grade ilmenite is converted to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) gas. The conversion takes place in a chlorinator (i.e., fluidized bed reactor) in the presence of chlorine gas at 850 °C to 950 °C, with petroleum coke added as a reductant. The chief reaction products are volatile metal chlorides, including TiCl 4, which are collected. The nonvolatile chlorides and the unreacted solids that remain in the chlorinator are wasted, forming the special waste stream ‘chloride process waste solids’. The gaseous raw product stream is purified to separate the titanium tetrachloride from other chlorides. Separation is by fractional condensation, double distillation, and chemical treatment. Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) is removed as a major acidic liquid waste stream through fractional condensation. Additional trace metal chlorides are removed through double distillation. Finally, vanadium oxychloride (VOCl 3), which has a boiling point close to that of TiCl 4 (136 °C), is removed as a low-volume non-special waste by complexing with mineral oil and reduced with hydrogen sulfide to VOCl 2 or by complexing with copper. The purified TiCl 4 is then oxidized to TiO 2 at 985 °C, driving off chlorine gas, which is recycled to the chlorinator. Aluminum chloride is added in the oxidation step to promote formation of the rutile crystal which is the TiO 2 product. The next stage of TiO 2 manufacturing is surface treatment, where the TiO 2 from oxidizer is converted to slurry in water, which is then subjected to sand milling to the required particle size. The clarified slurry from the <b>sand</b> <b>mill</b> is treated with alumina or zirconia for coating the surface of bare titanium dioxide with amorphous aluminum or zirconium oxide. The surface-treated product is then filtered through larox by pressing and followed by organic treatment and spin flash drying. Finally, the dried product is subjected to micronization process to get the surface-treated product. The brightness and color of this product is important for its marketing.|$|E
