The court held that [...] "there was nothing {{degrading}} or dehumanizing in what the appellant did. The scope of her activity was limited and was entirely non-commercial. No one who was offended was forced to continue looking at her" [...] and that furthermore [...] "the community <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> when all of the relevant circumstances are taken into account" [...] was not exceeded.

5000|$|Another {{relates to}} the {{alternative}} definition of [...] "the practice of acts of indecency", since this leaves open the definition of indecency, {{which may not be}} universally understood or accepted. One definition of community standards comes from the Supreme Court decision in R. v. Tremblay, 1993 2 S.C.R. 932. In considering nude dancing the majority held that the acts were not indecent since they did not fall below the community <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance,</b> citing the circumstances surrounding the act, the degree of harm that could result from public exposure, and expert evidence. No complaints had been received; the acts were in a closed room between consenting adults without physical contact, while expert witnesses suggested this was voyeurism and exhibitionism that caused no harm.|$|E

Arnold {{but in this}} case McGowan P.C.J. applied the test of community <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance,</b> following Butler, stating that the action of being topless caused no harm and thus did not exceed community standards of tolerance. She commented, [...] "Undoubtedly, most women would not engage in this conduct for there are many who believe that deportment of this nature is tasteless and does not enhance the cause of women. Equally undoubtedly, there are men today who cannot perceive of woman's breasts in any context other than sexual. It is important to reaffirm that the Canadian standards of tolerance test does not rely upon these attitudes for its formulation. I have no doubt that, aside from their personal opinions of this behaviour, the majority of Canadians would conclude that it is not beyond their level of tolerance." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn industry, {{functional}} <b>tolerancing</b> <b>of</b> mechanisms {{is today}} {{more and more}} based on ISO GPS (Geometrical Product Specification) and ASME standards. In this context, the CLIC method (french acronym for " Cotation en Localisation avec Influence des Contacts ") has been developed in our laboratory since 1998. The current standards are incomplete to specify complex shapes, for example to define a datum reference frame on these surfaces. Using specific examples, the present paper outlines six proposals as possible extension <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerancing</b> to describe the functional need for these links. Two main propositions are developed, the material conditions on complex surfaces and {{the definition of a}} new association criterion. Tolerance analysis models are presented; they must be consistent with respect to proposed functional specifications. The CLIC method [1] enables to elaborate a functional tolerancing based on notion of virtual boundary and a three dimensional tolerance analysis. Junctions between parts are described according to precedence order with primary, secondary and tertiary links. Geometrical functional requirements of the mechanism are imposed by the functional analysis. Intern requirements can be automatically detected by feature recognition (requirement synthesis) or imposed by the designer. Functional tolerancing relative to a given requirement is generated for each requirement (specification synthesis). Next, an equation is established to determine the effect <b>of</b> these <b>tolerances</b> on each functional characteristic (tolerance analysis). The set of equations allows then optimizing the tolerances and nominal dimensions parts in order to decrease the manufacturing cost (tolerance synthesis) ...|$|R

This paper investigates the possibility of trimming 100 micro ohms Manganin shunt resistors with <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> 5 percent to improve their accuracy and performance for use in smart energy meters. In theory, reducing the <b>standard</b> 5 percent <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the shunt resistors {{can be achieved by}} removing controlled amounts of the resistive material. In this experiment, theoretical analysis is carried out to determine the maximum amount of resistive material that can be removed from Manganin shunt resistor to reduce its <b>standard</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> 5 percent. Two alternative designs are then used to trim the material from the Manganin strip using machining techniques. Implications of the experimental results to the flow of electrical current and temperature rise in the shunt resistors are discussed. Results from the initial trimming trials show that the <b>standard</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> 5 percent can be reduced to less than 1 percent...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of the {{variability}} in population values {{plays an important role}} in the analysis of scientific data. Analysis of scientific data often involves developing a bound on a proportion of a population. Sometimes simple probability bounds are obtained using formulas involving known mean and variance parameters and replacing the parameters by sample estimates. The resulting bounds are only approximate and fail to account for {{the variability}} in the estimated parameters. Tolerance bounds provide bounds on population proportions which account for the variation resulting from the estimated mean and variance parameters. A beta content, gamma confidence tolerance interval is constructed so that a proportion beta of the population lies within the region bounded by the interval with confidence gamma. An application involving corrosion measurements is used to illustrate the use <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> bounds for different situations. Extensions <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>tolerance</b> intervals are applied to generate regression tolerance bounds, tolerance bounds for more general models of measurements collected over time, and tolerance intervals for varying precision data. Tolerance bounds also provide useful information for designing the collection of future data...|$|R

50|$|When {{designing}} mechanical components, {{a system}} <b>of</b> standardized <b>tolerances</b> called International Tolerance grades are often used. The standard (size) tolerances {{are divided into}} two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, tapped hole, or nut) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common standard tolerance which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work {{in such a way}} that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015 mm larger than the base dimension, and 0 mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size h6 would mean 10+0-0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009 mm smaller than the base dimension and 0 mm larger. This method <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>tolerances</b> is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog).|$|R
500|$|However, as {{algorithmic}} {{improvements and}} computer performance have erased purely technical deficiencies in older approaches, {{it has become}} clear that there is no one universal criterion for the 'optimal' structural alignment. TM-align, for instance, is particularly robust in quantifying comparisons between sets of proteins with great disparities in sequence lengths, but it only indirectly captures hydrogen bonding or secondary structure order conservation which might be better [...] metrics for alignment of evolutionarily related proteins. Thus recent developments have focused on optimizing particular attributes such as speed, quantification of scores, correlation to alternative gold <b>standards,</b> or <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> imperfection in structural data or ab initio structural models. An alternative methodology that is gaining popularity is to use the consensus of various methods to ascertain proteins structural similarities.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to convert certain single photon sources into devices capable of {{emitting}} large strings of photonic cluster state in a controlled and pulsed "on demand" manner. Such sources would greatly reduce the resources required to achieve linear optical quantum computation. Standard spin errors, such as dephasing, are shown to affect only 1 or 2 of the emitted photons at a time. This allows for the use <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> fault <b>tolerance</b> techniques, and shows that the photonic machine gun can be fired for arbitrarily long times. Using realistic parameters for current quantum dot sources, we conclude high entangled-photon emission rates are achievable, with Pauli-error rates per photon of less than 0. 2 %. For quantum dot sources the method has the added advantage of alleviating the problematic issues of obtaining identical photons from independent, non-identical quantum dots, and of exciton dephasing.

40|$|The central {{thesis of}} this paper is that, for most issues of multiculturalism, {{regarding}} them as a problem <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> puts us on the wrong track because there are certain biases inherent in the principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> These biases - individualism, combined with a focus on religion and a focus on beliefs rather than on persons or practices - can be regarded as distinctly Protestant. Extending the scope <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> may seem a solution but if we really want to counter these biases, the principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> becomes so general that it loses any distinctive meaning. Therefore, we should accept the limited scope <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and its biases. The principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> can still be useful for some problems where there is a clear and direct link to political or religious beliefs. Moreover, it should be cherished as a more general attitude or practice in Dutch society. For most problems of multiculturalism, however, we should appeal to broader theoretical frameworks that do justice to persons and practices. ...|$|R

This study, phase I {{of a continuing}} study, identifies key areas for food safety improvement. This study is designed as an exploratory evaluation of independently owned and operated delicatessen operations, using Escherichia coli and Sta phylococcus aureus as indicators to assess food handling and the public’s risk for pathogenic contamination from commonly served ready-to-eat/take-away foods. The analysis consisted of a comprehensive strategy of laboratory testing of samples for pathogenic contamination, informal field observation of food handling procedures, and {{the examination of the}} most recent health inspection reports for each of the 18 operations visited. The deli turkey, cream cheese and let tuce were tested using bacteria indicator plates. The results showed widespread levels of contamination. Of the 54 samples tested for Escherichia coli, 26 showed positive results which are ~ 45 % for E. coli contamination. Of the 54 samples tested for Staphy-lococcus aureus, 31 showed positive results which are ~ 57 % for S. aureus contamination. One issue discovered while conducting the study was the lack of consistent uniform international <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> contamination <b>tolerance</b> levels. The informal field observations and health report analyses revealed widespread temperature violations and numerous instances of poor food handling. The study offers independent practitioners a strategy designed to improve their health inspections scores, food handling, and mitigation of operator liability.

We argue that public policy should consider these foundations <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and appreciate the context-dependent nature <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> rather than setting out to tightly define the boundaries of intolerance; the latter strategy runs the risk of stimulating a downward spiral whereby people’s thresholds <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> are continually lowered...|$|R
