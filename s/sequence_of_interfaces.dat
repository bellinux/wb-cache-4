The seismic ray tracing problem has often been posed as a "shooting" problem (see for example Shah [6]). That is, the shooting angles of the ray at the source point are varied until the ray ends sufficiently close to the receiver. To find the seismic signals at an array of receivers, more sophisticated shooting methods have been devised (see for example Gjoystodtl and Ursin [2]). Our approach is to formulat...|$|E

40|$|A component-based {{software}} system consists of well-encapsulated components that {{interact with each}} other via their interfaces. Software integration tests are generated to test the interactions among different components. These tests are usually in the form <b>of</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>interface</b> method calls.

40|$|The {{micromechanics}} {{of stress}} transfer is presented for the fibre fragmentation test of microcomposites containing debonded fibre-matrix interface and yielded matrix at the interface region. Results from the parametric study are discussed for carbon fibre composites containing epoxy and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) matrices, representing respectively typical brittle debonding and matrix yielding behaviour at the interface region. The stress transfer phenomena are characterized {{for the two}} interface failure processes. The <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>interface</b> failure and fibre fracture {{as a function of}} applied stress are also identified. Maximum debonded and yielded interface lengths are obtained above which a fibre will fracture into smaller lengths. There are also threshold fibre fragment lengths above which fibre will fracture without interface debonding or matrix yielding. The applied stresses for these conditions are governed by three strength properties of the composite constituents, namely interface shear bond strength, matrix shear yield strength and fibre tensile strength for given elastic constants of the fibre and matrix, and the geometric factors of the microcomposite. The ineffective length, a measure of the efficiency of stress transfer across the fibre-matrix interface, is shown to strongly depend {{on the extent to which}} these failure mechanisms take place at the interface region...|$|R

Ten subjects had to control the zoom and light intensity of an endoscope, using voice, a touch panel or an assistant. For each interface, the subject received nine tasks to control to a certain level, light, zoom or both. The experiment was repeated three times (three cycles) and the <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>interfaces</b> were varied per cycle. Experiments were recorded on video and off-line time needed per task and the number of wrongly interpreted tasks were measured. A questionnaire was used to investigate user satisfaction. Voice control was slower than assistant control and touch panel control (92. 5 s, 80. 2 s and 76. 0 s, respectively, p < 0. 02). There was no significant difference between touch panel control and assistant control. With voice control, 3. 1 % of the commands were not interpreted and 1. 7 % were wrongly interpreted. 40 % of the subjects experienced voice control as the quickest, 30 % touch panel control and 30 % assistant control. 48 % of the subjects preferred voice control, 28 % the touch panel and 24 % assistant control. Voice control was less efficient than touch panel control and manual control by an assistant. The subjects experienced voice control as more efficient, however. In the future, voice control should be improved to overcome wrongly interpreted commands.

40|$|The {{displacements}} and stresses in {{layered rock}} above underground openings {{can be calculated}} using a beam model for the rock layers. The traditional approach assumes that interfaces between layers are frictionless and layers can slip past one another freely as they deflect. In contrast, the design of structural laminated beams has traditionally been {{based on the assumption}} that the interfaces between layers were welded, with no slip occurring there. In this work, the theory of composite laminated beams, which allows for partial slip on layer interfaces, is applied to the problem of predicting displacements and stresses in layered roof rock. The effects of rockbolt reinforcement are modeled by discrete shear and normal stiffnesses incorporated at locations in the model where the rockbolts cross layer interfaces. Published solutions and results for laminated composite beams are reviewed. Composite laminated beam theory provided a means of accounting for rockbolt reinforcement effects and provided a conceptual framework that was used to develop two FORTRAN programs; one, based on the force method of analysis, that automatically finds shear and tensile interface failures in the system, and the other a finite element program that employs beam elements, elastic interface elements, and rockbolt elements to model a rockbolted layered rock system. Published data together with results from these programs suggest that shear reinforcement may be more effective when placed near the ends of roof layers. The normal interaction between layers tends to be uniformly distributed unless rockbolt forces act on the layers or if partial delamination of layers has occurred. Both shear and normal reinforcement will cause stresses to be redistributed within the system of layers. Analysis of this redistribution of stresses requires that the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>interface</b> failure be predicted which, in turn, requires that the properties of the individual layers, <b>of</b> the <b>interfaces</b> between layers, and of the rockbolts be properly taken into account. Laminated composite beam theory and programs based on this theory provide rational and efficient ways to study and analyze the behavior of layered roof rock...|$|R

In particular polar materials enable a variety of classic and even quantum light sources, whose on-going optimisation endeavours challenge generations of researchers. However, the key challenge - the inherent electric crystal polarisation of such materials - remains unsolved and deteriorates the electron-hole pair annihilation rate. Here, our approach introduces a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> reverse <b>interfaces</b> to compensate these polarisation effects, while the polar, natural crystal growth direction is maintained provoking a boost in device performance. Former research approaches like growth on less-polar crystal planes or even the stabilization of unnatural phases never reached industrial maturity.

40|$|Multicellular organisms, from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, have {{roughly the}} same number of protein {{encoding}} genes. We show that the need to prevent disease-causing nonspecific interactions between proteins provides a simple physical reason why organism complexity is not reflected in the number of distinct proteins. By collective evolution of the amino acid <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> protein binding <b>interfaces</b> we estimate the degree of misbinding {{as a function of the}} number of distinct proteins. Protein interaction energies are calculated with an empirical, residue-specific energy function tuned for protein binding. We show that the achievable energy gap favoring specific over nonspecific binding decreases with protein number in a power-law fashion. From the fraction of proteins involved in nonspecific complexes as a function of increasing protein number and decreasing energy gap, we predict the limits these binding requirements place on the number of different proteins that can function effectively in a given cellular compartment. Remarkably, the optimization <b>of</b> binding <b>interfaces</b> favors networks in which a few proteins have many partners, and most proteins have few partners, consistent with a scale-free network topology.

40|$|Human noroviruses are {{the major}} viral {{pathogens}} of epidemic acute gastroenteritis. These genetically diverse viruses comprise two major genogroups (GI and GII) and approximately 30 genotypes. Noroviruses recognize human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) in a diverse, strain-specific manner. Recently the crystal structures <b>of</b> the HBGA-binding <b>interfaces</b> <b>of</b> the GI Norwalk virus and the GII VA 387 have been determined, which allows us to examine the genetic and structural relationships <b>of</b> the HBGA-binding <b>interfaces</b> <b>of</b> noroviruses with variable HBGA-binding patterns. Our hypothesis is that, if HBGAs are the viral receptors necessary for norovirus infection and spread, their binding interfaces should be under a selection pressure {{in the evolution of}} noroviruses. Structural comparison <b>of</b> the HBGA-binding <b>interfaces</b> <b>of</b> the two noroviruses has revealed shared features but significant differences in the location, sequence composition, and HBGA-binding modes. On the other hand, the primary <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> the HBGA-binding <b>interfaces</b> are highly conserved among strains within each genogroup. The roles of critical residues within the binding sites have been verified by site-directed mutagenesis followed by functional analysis of strains with variable HBGA-binding patterns. Our data indicate that the human HBGAs are an important factor in norovirus evolution. Each of the two major genogroups represents an evolutionary lineage characterized by distinct genetic traits. Functional convergence of strains with the same HBGA targets subsequently resulted in acquisition of analogous HBGA binding interfaces in the two genogroups that share an overall structural similarity, despite their distinct locations and amino acid compositions. On the other hand, divergent evolution {{may have contributed to the}} observed overall differences between and within the two lineages. Thus, both divergent and convergent evolution, as well as the polymorphic human HBGAs, likely contribute to the diversity of noroviruses. The finding of genogroup-specific conservation <b>of</b> HBGA binding <b>interfaces</b> will facilitate the development of rational strategies to control and prevent norovirus-associated gastroenteritis...|$|R

A crucial element is the underlying architecture of the kernel, and the proper definition of points where exchanges can be performed.
