40|$|In {{engineering}} design, tribology science carries critical {{contribution to}} the reliability and efficiency of the machine components. The focus of the tribology science on friction, wear and lubrication plays important role in reducing losses, increasing energy efficiency and determining the component’s life span, especially for the high forces and rapid movement components. In sliding contact, researchers divided the wear cycle into three important phases: running-in, <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> and accelerated wear/wear out phase. On the steady-state phase, the adjustment of the wear rate, contact pressure, surface roughness, and surface conformability at the contact interface attains the stabilized condition. The aims {{of this research is}} to model the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase,</b> incorporates mild wear, by employing the analytical, numerical and experimental solutions. Hertz’s analytical formula for elastic contact was developed to predict the wear on the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> of the point and line contacts. The finite element analysis (FEA) is simulated to observe the contact pressure of the sliding contact on a pin-on-disc contact system. In the FEA, the input are geometry, boundary condition, material properties and initial load. Then, the obtained contact pressure is use in wear calculation based on Archard’s wear law by considering the sliding distance. The wear depth of pin for conformal and non-conformal contact is predicted. The ball-on-disc experiment was conducted to verify the wear prediction based on the analytical and the FEA solution. The analytical, FEA and experimental solution show that the wear on the running-in phase increases dramatically until reaching the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase,</b> where the stable condition occurs. In the analytical solution, the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> is identified as the stabilized wear rate for the increasing of the sliding distance. In the FEA solution, the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> is recognized by observing the stabilized contact pressure on the contact area as the sliding distance increases. Combination of the FEA solution and Archard’s wear law predicts the stabilized wear rate on the sliding contact. Experimental observation agrees well with the FEM and analytical solution where the wear of the ball is initially high and reaches its stabile condition at <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase.</b> The interesting phenomenon in sliding contact of ball-on-disc discloses that the radius of the ball increases as the sliding distance increase. The ratio of the initial radius to the worn radius of the contacting ball tends to reach zero when the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> is obtained. Key words: steady state, mild-wear, conformal contact, non-conformal contact, FEA. ...|$|E

Using a site-decoupled mean-field approximation, we identify <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phases</b> with canted antiferromagnetic order, in addition to limit cycle phases, where oscillatory dynamics persist indefinitely. We also identify collective bistable phases, where the system supports two <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> among spatially uniform, antiferromagnetic, and limit cycle phases. We compare these mean-field results to exact quantum trajectories simulations for finite one-dimensional arrays. The exact results exhibit short-range antiferromagnetic order for parameters that have significant overlap with the mean-field phase diagram. In the mean-field bistable regime, the exact quantum dynamics exhibits real-time collective switching between macroscopically distinguishable states. We present a clear physical picture for this dynamics, and establish a simple relationship between the switching times and properties of the quantum Liouvillian.

The evaporative resistance is found to be more than two times higher in the initial phase than that in the saturation phase. The moisture content is gained exponentially in the clothing ensemble.

These may partly explain the poor reproducibility while measuring the evaporative resistance of impermeable clothing for a short period...|$|R

All the operating phases of this system were considered: ignition, partial load, increase in power, and nominal load. In each phase, quantity and type of some pollutants in emissions were determined: the main pollutant gases (CO, NOx, SO 2, H 2 S and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)), total dust (PM) and its content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), regulated heavy metals (Ni, Cd, As and Pb), main soluble ions and Total Carbon (TC). Results show that emission factors of TSP, CO, and of the main determined pollutants (TC, Cd and PAHs) are higher during ignition phase. In particular, this phase prevalently contributes to PAHs emissions. During increase in power phase, gas and particulate emissions do not appreciably differ from nominal load ones; nevertheless, PAH emission factors are higher than <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> ones, but lower than ignition phase. Moreover, during not-steady <b>state</b> <b>phases,</b> PAH mixture is more toxic than during <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phases.</b> In conclusion, this study allowed to go deeper in pellet stove environmental impact, by pointing out how the different operating conditions can modify the emissions.

Mechanisms of cell volume {{regulation}} {{induced by the}} reduction of the osmolality of the Ringer solution by one-third were studied in fused Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Intracellular HCO 3 - K+ and Cl- concentrations [ion]i in parallel with cell membrane potential (PD), cell membrane conductance (Gm) and conductances of individual ions (Gmion) were evaluated with microelectrode techniques. Fused cells regulate their cell volume by about 50 %. Gm increased from 0. 43 ± 0. 03 mS/cm 2 in isotonic Ringer solution to 4. 3 ± 0. 3 mS/cm 2 in the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> of cell swelling. GmCl was 0. 31 ± 0. 03 mS/cm 2 in isotonic Ringer solution and thus was the dominant individual ion conductance. In the initial phase of cell swelling GmK increased transiently 64 -fold to 0. 32 ± 0. 03 mS/cm 2, and consequently PD hyperpolarized. At peak hyperpolarization GmCl transiently decreased by 15 %. Cell swelling increased GmCl 11 -fold ana GmCl GmHCO 3 28 -fold to 0. 95 ± 0. 1 mS/cm 2 in the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> of cell swelling. In this phase and GmHCO 3 were dominating, whereas GmK was only slightly increased compared to isotonic conditions. The hyperpolarization of PD was paralleled by cytoplasmic acidification. At peak acidification [HCO 3 -]i decreased by 6. 4 mmol/kg H 2 O. Cl- extrusion was not detectable in the initial phase of cell swelling. In isotonic Ringer solution [K+]i was 125 ± 5 mmol/kg H 2 O. During the initial phase of cell swelling 23 ± 5 mmol/kg H 2 O K+ was extruded, indicating that yet unknown anions participated in cell volume regulation in this phase of cell swelling. In the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> of cell swelling [pH]i was normalized by replenishing [HCO 3 -]i, whereas Cl- was extruded. We conclude that fused renal epitheloid cells acutely release KHCO 3 in response to hypotonicity, but then regain pH homeostasis in the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase</b> of cell swelling...|$|E

The experiments are modeled {{by a set of}} ordinary differential equations,which we have used in previous studies of the uncoupled free running system in a single CSTR. The model calculations predict three different kinds of qualitative behavior before and after the coupling. First, the qualitative behavior can remain unchanged, i. e. one gets <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> when <b>steady</b> <b>states</b> are coupled or one gets periodic oscillations when periodic oscillations are coupled.

Although exploiting such structures {{is necessary to}} achieve high accuracy and fast learning, once the short learning phase is over, a simple structure can efficiently predict the branch outcome {{for the majority of}} branches. Moreover, for a large number of branches, once the branch reaches the <b>steady</b> <b>state</b> <b>phase,</b> updating the branch predictor unit is unnecessary since there is already enough information available to the predictor to predict the branch outcome accurately.
