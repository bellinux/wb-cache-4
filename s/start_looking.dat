25|$|Przewalski {{females are}} able to give birth {{at the age of}} three and have a {{gestation}} period of about 11 to 12 months. Their reproduction process is seasonal and in Mongolia the season is towards the end of May, June or July. Mating stallions do not <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for mating partners until the age of five. Instinctively, the stallion will look to create his own group of mares or else wander until he finds a group with its own leader. If the stallion finds a group of mares with its own leader, the stallion will usually fight the other leader stallion of the group. The mares will adjust and follow the victor. After birth, the foal can stand almost immediately (only taking about an hour or so) and can walk on its own. The foals drink milk from the mother mare.|$|E
25|$|Jonsvatnet is {{the main}} water {{abstraction}} source for drinking water in Trondheim. As such there have since the 1960s been extensive restrictions on the lake, including bans on any motorized boats and bathing in the lake. However, there were contradictions in restrictions: domesticated cows were allowed to bathe, but not humans, and all motor boat activities were banned, although the lake acted as a water aerodrome. The city asked the club in 1999 to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for another site for a water aerodrome. The municipal council therefore withdrew the airport's concession in March 2003, effective {{at the end of}} the year. However, by August the decision had been reverted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). They gave a ten-year concession in 2005, but this was appealed by the municipality to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. During the public hearing, the Ministry of the Environment supported the municipality's stance, stating that the lake, as a recreational and nature area, should be shielded from use by seaplanes.|$|E

Randy Taraborrelli in his [...] commented that the song was a rhythmic call to party.|$|E
500|$|That day, {{the city}} closed all 11 of its {{municipal}} garbage incinerators. Energy companies Consolidated Edison (called Con Ed for short) and Long Island Lighting Company {{were asked to}} burn natural gas rather than fuel oil to minimize the release of sulfur dioxide; both companies voluntarily cut back emissions, with Con Ed reducing its emissions by 50 percent. The city told 18 inspectors [...] "to forget their turkey dinners and <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for dirty air," [...] and they issued an [...] "unusually high" [...] number of citations for emissions violations, including two for Con Ed plants.

[...] The employees suggest that Michael <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for another job. Michael is unworried at first, until he learns how poorly the economy is performing. He first tries Prince Paper, but they had been run out of business by Dunder Mifflin. After finding no available work, Michael decides {{to start his own}} paper company and unsuccessfully tries to convince others around the office to join him. When Charles catches Michael labeling Dunder Mifflin customer lists with his new company's name, he orders security guard Hank (Hugh Dane) to escort Michael from the building. Michael drives out of the parking lot, but is later spotted sneaking back into the building.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1995, reports {{surfaced}} that Sega would collaborate with Lockheed Martin, The 3DO Company, Matsushita, or Alliance Semiconductor {{to create a}} new graphics processing unit, which conflicting accounts said would be used for a 64-bit [...] "Saturn 2" [...] or an add-on peripheral. Development of the Dreamcast was wholly unrelated to this rumored project. In light of the Saturn's poor market performance, Irimajiri decided to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> outside of the company's internal hardware development division {{to create a new}} console. In 1997, Irimajiri enlisted the services of [...] IBM's Tatsuo Yamamoto to lead an 11-man team to work on a secret hardware project in the United States, which was referred to as [...] "Blackbelt". Accounts vary on how an internal team led by Hideki Sato also began development on Dreamcast hardware; one account specifies that Sega of Japan tasked both teams, while another suggests that Sato was bothered by Irimajiri's choice to begin development externally and chose to have his hardware team begin development. Sato and his group chose the Hitachi SH-4 processor architecture and the VideoLogic PowerVR2 graphics processor, manufactured by NEC, in the production of their mainboard. Initially known as [...] "Whitebelt", this project was later codenamed [...] "Dural", after the metallic female fighter from Sega's Virtua Fighter series.|$|E
500|$|The Hall of Fame {{has been}} criticized for {{inducting}} several lacklustre candidates in the early 2000s decade due to [...] "a shortage of true greatness". Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for failing to induct international players and critics have claimed that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League. A common statement is that it is more of an [...] "NHL Hall of Fame" [...] than a general Hockey Hall of Fame. Partially in response to these claims, the Hall of Fame opened an International Hockey exhibit and announced that it would <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> at more international players for induction. Valeri Kharlamov was inducted in 2005, {{and is one of the}} few modern-day inductees to never play in the NHL. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for overlooking World Hockey Association players and over representing the Original Six era from 1942 to 1967. For several years, the Hall of Fame was criticized for overlooking female hockey players before the Hall of Fame announced that women would be given separate consideration. In 2010, Angela James and Cammi Granato were the first women to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.|$|E

500|$|The website Touch Arcade {{said that}} they loved the game, {{and that it was}} one of their {{favorite}} role-playing games on iOS. They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one's progress. Pocket Gamer, too, thought that things were not explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not even let players know where to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for point B. RPGFan echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. The British newspaper Metro found the game more entertaining than most role-playing games from its time. Gamezebo found the iOS version's touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while Pocket Gamer found the interface to work [...] "reasonably well" [...] while using the landscape mode, and RPGFan found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and Touch Arcade wished the game had been a [...] "universal app", so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.|$|E
500|$|Kohli was {{appointed}} the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh {{on the back}} of his fine performance in Australia. Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, [...] "Hats off to Virat Kohli for the way he played. We have to <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> towards the future. The selection committee and the Board felt Kohli is future captaincy material." [...] Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119. He scored 108 in the opening match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory, while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66. In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time. His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara. Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the book's achievement, Shone remarks [...] "He {{now stands}} at year zero – creatively, psychologically." [...] However, typical {{features}} of Ellis' earlier works remain intact; for example, in its depictions of violence. Commenting on its self-referential aspects, Janelle Brown of the San Francisco Chronicle recommends [...] "for his next endeavor, Ellis should stop worrying and <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> for the exit of his own personal rabbit hole." [...] The Buffalo News awarded the novel its Editor's Choice. Jeff Simon comments that it [...] "brings an excessive Reaganesque flavor to Obama America". With regards to the novel's writing style, he comments [...] "The first-person sentences run on and on, but the individual sections of the book are nothing if not minimal... ghastly narcissism or not, Bret Easton Ellis has a fictional territory all his own and, heaven forbid, a mastery there." [...] The Wall Street Journal on the other hand, described this prose style as [...] "flat and fizzless". Such is the book's violent aesthetic that, for Eileen Battersby of The Irish Times, [...] "the book is closer to his remarkable third novel, American Psycho". She further compliments Ellis as [...] "a bizarrely moral writer who specializes in evoking the amoral." [...] Concerning his writing, she notes its [...] "despair is blunt, factual and seldom approaches the laconic unease of JG Ballard." ...|$|E
