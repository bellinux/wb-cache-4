The {{optical thickness}} variation {{of a test}} target was measured in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer to approximately 0. 5 % of the illumination wavelength using an optical parametric THz laser. The frequency of the laser was continuously tuneable, enabling a synthetic wavelength to be produced by <b>sequential</b> <b>illumination</b> at discrete frequencies, thus extending the unambiguous measurement range to half the synthetic wavelength.

40|$|The {{usage of}} x-ray free {{electron}} laser (XFEL) in femtosecond nanocrystallography involves <b>sequential</b> <b>illumination</b> of many small crystals of arbitrary orientation.

40|$|A generic {{computational}} imaging setup is considered which assumes <b>sequential</b> <b>illumination</b> of a semi-transparent object by an arbitrary set of structured illumination patterns. For each incident illumination pattern, all transmitted light is collected by a photon-counting bucket (single-pixel) detector. The transmission coefficients measured {{in this way}} are then used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the object's projected transmission. It is demonstrated that the squared spatial resolution of such a setup is usually equal to {{the ratio of the}} image area to the number of linearly independent illumination patterns. If the noise in the measured transmission coefficients is dominated by photon shot noise, then the ratio of the spatially-averaged squared mean signal to the spatially-averaged noise variance in the "flat" distribution reconstructed {{in the absence of the}} object, is equal to the average number of registered photons when the illumination patterns are orthogonal. The signal-to-noise ratio in a reconstructed transmission distribution is always lower in the case of non-orthogonal illumination patterns due to spatial correlations in the measured data. Examples of imaging methods relevant to the presented analysis include conventional imaging with a pixelated detector, computational ghost imaging, compressive sensing, super-resolution imaging and computed tomography.

40|$|Nanosized optical antennas {{have the}} {{potential}} to confine and enhance optical electromagnetic fields, making nano-antennas essential tools for applications in integrated nano-optical devices and high-resolution microscopy. The size, shape and material of the nano-antenna, together with the optical frequency, determine the antenna response and its resonances. Here, we discuss a λ/ 4 long optical nano-antenna, analogous to the radio frequency monopole antenna. The antenna is fabricated {{at the end of a}} near-field aperture-type fibre probe by focused-ion-beam milling in two <b>sequential</b> steps. <b>Illumination</b> through the fibre creates a localized evanescent excitation source, with the advantage of a lower background compared to 'apertureless' techniques, which require far-field excitation. Previously, we have studied the field localization, antenna excitation conditions and antenna resonances, both in experiment, by near-field single-molecule detection experiments, and in theory, by finite integration technique simulations. In this study we investigate the importance of both polarization conditions and antenna position in creating an efficient local driving field for the monopole antenna. It is shown that the antenna is driven by the field component along the antenna axis. Next we show the advantage of the antenna over the aperture: upon reduction of the diameter the antenna gains local field intensity, while the aperture field decreases rapidly. Finally, the highly localized field near the antenna apex is probed by single molecules and detected molecular emission features below 30 nm FWHM are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of colour at endoscopy {{has been taken}} for granted since {{the discovery of the}} fibreoptic bundle and the advent of fibreoptic endoscopy. Fibreoptic and lens assemblies can distort the impression of colour by selectively absorbing some wavelengths of light. In the case of electronic endoscopes, the principal sensor is the charge-coupled device (CCD), a small microelectronic device that converts an image into a sequence of electronic signals which, after appropriate processing, are transformed into an image on the monitor screen. The image is therefore visualized as a mosaic of small images, one from each sensing element. Colour is synthesized by using <b>sequential</b> <b>illumination</b> using filters or by filters placed over the CCD. Fibre-endoscopes may alter colour by selectively transmitting certain portions of the visible spectrum, while electronic endoscopes are susceptible to errors due to poor calibration of the instrument and manipulation of the colour controls by endoscopists. Colour information provides the endoscopist with clues {{to the nature of the}} lesion and also a site for biopsy. In experimental situations, colour information has been used to determine blood flow and classify lesions. Much work needs to be done to define normal and abnormal colour in the gastrointestinal tract and to develop a standard terminology for colour nomenclature in endoscopy...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) technique, two frequency PDV (2 v-PDV), {{is described}} that allows {{measurements of the}} velocity field over a plane defined by a laser light sheet using <b>sequential</b> <b>illumination</b> of the flow with two closely separated (&IGHz) frequencies of laser light. This allows a common-path imaging head to be used containing a single CCD camera {{instead of the usual}} camera pair. The problem of image misalignment is now avoided and the polarisation sensitivity of the beam splitter used in two camera imaging heads is also removed. Cost efficiency is improved by the simplification of the system. This paper describes the development of a 2 v-PDV system using a continuous wave argon ion laser capable of making time-averaged velocity measurements. Initially a single velocity component system was constructed using acousto-optic modulators to produce the two illumination frequencies required. The system was then expanded to make 3 D velocity measurements using a single CCD camera and multiple coherent imaging fibre bundles. Measurements were made on the rotating disc, in order to assess error level in the measurements, and on a seeded axisymmetric air jet. A method of improving the sensitivity of the 2 v-PDV system is demonstrated by using both the rising and falling slopes of the iodine absorption line. Reductions in the error levels of velocity measurements of approximately 40 % can be achieved using this increased sensitivity method...|$|E
40|$|Most {{additive}} manufacturing processes today operate by printing voxels (3 D pixels) serially point-by-point {{to build up}} a 3 D part. In some more recently-developed techniques, for example optical printing methods such as projection stereolithography [Zheng et al. 2012], [Tumbleston et al. 2015], parts are printed layer-by-layer by curing full 2 d (very thin in one dimension) layers of the 3 d part in each print step. There does not yet exist a technique which is able to print arbitrarily-defined 3 D geometries in a single print step. If such a technique existed, it could be used to expand the range of printable geometries in {{additive manufacturing}} and relax constraints on factors such as overhangs in topology optimization. It could also vastly increase print speed for 3 D parts. In this work, we develop the principles for an approach for single exposure 3 D printing of arbitrarily defined geometries. The approach, termed Computed Axial Lithgography (CAL), is based on tomographic reconstruction, with mathematical optimization to generate a set of projections to optically define an arbitrary dose distribution within a target volume. We demonstrate the potential ability of the technique to print 3 D parts using a prototype CAL system based on <b>sequential</b> <b>illumination</b> from many angles. We also propose new hardware designs which will help us to realize true single-shot arbitrary-geometry 3 D CAL. Comment: 10 pages, 17 figure, ACM SIGGRAPH forma...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cognitive radar is a {{recently}} proposed approach {{in which a}} radar system may adaptively and intelligently interrogate a propagation channel using all available knowledge including pre-vious measurements, task priorities, and external databases. A dis-tinguishing characteristic of cognitive radar is that it operates in a closed loop, which enables constant optimization in response to its changing understanding of the channel. In this paper, we compare two different waveform design techniques for use with active sen-sors operating in a target recognition application. We also propose the integration of waveform design with a sequential-hypothesis-testing framework that controls when hard decisions may be made with adequate confidence.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} hemodynamic-based markers of {{cortical}} activity (e. g. fMRI and optical intrinsic signal imaging), which are an indirect and relatively slow report of neural activity, and underlying synaptic electrical and metabolic activity through neurovascular coupling {{is a topic}} of ongoing research and debate. As application of resting state functional connectivity measures is extended further into topics such as brain development, aging and disease, the importance of understanding the fundamental physiological basis for functional connectivity will grow. Here we extend functional connectivity analysis from hemodynamic- to calcium-based imaging. Transgenic mice (n = 7) expressing a fluorescent calcium indicator (GCaMP 6) driven by the Thy 1 promoter in glutamatergic neurons were imaged transcranially in both anesthetized (using ketamine/xylazine) and awake states. <b>Sequential</b> LED <b>illumination</b> (λ = 454, 523, 595, 640 nm) enabled concurrent imaging of both GCaMP 6 fluorescence emission (corrected for hemoglobin absorption) and hemodynamics. Functional connectivity network maps were constructed for infraslow (0. 009 - 0. 08 Hz), intermediate (0. 08 - 0. 4 Hz), and high (0. 4 - 4. 0 Hz) frequency bands. At infraslow and intermediate frequencies, commonly used in BOLD fMRI and fcOIS studies of functional connectivity and implicated in neurovascular coupling mechanisms, GCaMP 6 and HbO 2 functional connectivity structures were in high agreement, both qualitatively and also quantitatively through a measure of spatial similarity. The spontaneous dynamics of both contrasts had the highest correlation when the GCaMP 6 signal was delayed with a ~ 0. 6 - 1. 5 s temporal offset. Within the higher-frequency delta band, sensitive to slow wave sleep oscillations in non-REM sleep and anesthesia, we evaluate {{the speed with which}} the connectivity analysis stabilized and found that the functional connectivity maps captured putative network structure within time window lengths as short as 30 seconds. Homotopic GCaMP 6 functional connectivity maps at 0. 4 - 4. 0 Hz in the anesthetized states show a striking correlated and anti-correlated structure along the anterior to posterior axis. This structure is potentially explained in part by observed propagation of delta-band activity from frontal somatomotor regions to visuoparietal areas. During awake imaging, this spatio-temporal quality is altered, and a more complex and detailed functional connectivity structure is observed. The combined calcium/hemoglobin imaging technique described here will enable the dissociation of changes in ionic and hemodynamic functional structure and neurovascular coupling and provide a framework for subsequent studies of neurological disease such as stroke...|$|R
40|$|Hand-held based optical imaging {{systems are}} a recent {{development}} towards diagnostic imaging of breast cancer. To date, all the hand-held based optical imagers {{are used to}} perform only surface mapping and target localization, but are not capable of demonstrating tomographic imaging. Herein, a novel hand-held probe based optical imager is developed towards three-dimensional (3 -D) optical tomography studies. The unique features of this optical imager, which primarily consists of a hand-held probe and an intensified charge coupled device detector, are its ability to; (i) image large tissue areas (5 × 10 sq. cm) in a single scan, (ii) perform simultaneous multiple point illumination and collection, thus reducing the overall imaging time; and (iii) adapt to varying tissue curvatures, from a flexible probe head design. Experimental studies are performed in the frequency domain on large slab phantoms (∼ 650 ml) using fluorescence target(s) under perfect uptake (1 : 0) contrast ratios, and varying target depths (1 – 2 cm) and X-Y locations. The effect of implementing simultaneous over <b>sequential</b> multiple point <b>illumination</b> towards 3 -D tomography is experimentally demonstrated. The feasibility of 3 -D optical tomography studies has been demonstrated {{for the first time}} using a hand-held based optical imager. Preliminary fluorescence-enhanced optical tomography studies are able to reconstruct 0. 45 ml target(s) located at different target depths (1 – 2 cm). However, the depth recovery was limited as the actual target depth increased, since only reflectance measurements were acquired.

40|$|Abstract Two-frequency Planar Doppler Velocimetry is a {{modified}} planar Doppler velocimetry (PDV) technique that uses <b>sequential</b> <b>illumination</b> {{of the flow}} using two illumination frequencies with the flow viewed through an iodine cell. The first illumination frequency is tuned to coincide with an iodine absorption line (typically at around 50 % transmission) {{and the second is}} tuned to a full transmission frequency. An image captured under the first illumination frequency will have intensities related to the Doppler shift of the light scattered from particles seeded in the flow and provides a signal image. A second image captured with the second illumination frequency is insensitive to Doppler shifts and provides a reference image. This allows Doppler velocimetry measurements of the flow to be made using a single CCD camera and avoiding image misalignment issues associated with PDV. The 2 ν-PDV technique has been previously demonstrated making time-averaged velocity measurements using a CW argon ion laser. This paper describes the extension of this work to allow instantaneous velocity measurements to be made using the 2 ν-PDV technique. A pulsed 2 ν-PDV system is described which uses two independently seeded Nd:YAG lasers to illuminate the flow with the two frequencies of light required. A CCD camera capable of capture two closely spaced images (~ 300 ns) is used to capture the signal and references images sequentially.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here describes {{a method that}} allows three component velocity measurements to be made, quickly and non-intrusively, across a plane in a flow defined by a laser light sheet. The method, two frequency planar Doppler Velocimetry (2 v-PDV) is a modification of the planar Doppler velocimetry (PDV) technique, using only a single CCD camera, and <b>sequential</b> <b>illumination</b> of the flow using two frequencies, separated by about 700 MHz. One illumination frequency lies on an absorption line of gaseous iodine, and the other just off the absorption line. The beams sequentially illuminate a plane within a seeded flow and Doppler-shifted scattered light passes through an iodine vapour cell onto the camera. The beam at a frequency off the absorption line is not affected by passage through the cell, and provides a reference image. The other beam encodes the velocity information as a variation in transmission dependent upon the Doppler shift. Use of a single camera ensures registration of the reference and signal images, which is the major problem in any spilt image system such as a two-camera imaging head, and cost efficiency is improved by the simplification of the system. A 2 v-PDV system was constructed using a continuous-wave Argon ion laser and acousto-optic modulators to produce two frequencies of illuminating laser light. This was combined with multiple imaging fibre bundles, to port three different views of the measurement plane to a CCD camera, allowing the measurement of three velocity components...|$|E
