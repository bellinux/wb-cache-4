40|$|The city of Dubuque, Iowa, {{aimed for}} a twofer — lower energy costs for public {{facilities}} and reduced air emissions. To achieve that goal, the city partnered with the Iowa Economic Development Authority {{to establish a}} revolving loan fund to finance energy efficiency and other energy projects at city facilities. But the city needed to understand approaches for financing energy projects to achieve both of their goals {{in a manner that}} would not be considered debt — in this case, obligations booked as a liability on the city’s balance sheet. With funding from the U. S. Department of Energy’s Climate Action Champions Initiative, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) provided technical assistance to the city to identify strategies to achieve these goals. Revolving loans use a source of money to fund initial cost-saving projects, such as energy efficiency investments, then use the repayments and interest from these loans to support subsequent projects. Berkeley Lab and the city examined two approaches to explore whether revolving loans could potentially be treated as non-debt: 1) financing arrangements containing a non-appropriation clause and 2) shared <b>savings</b> <b>agreements.</b> This fact sheet discusses both, including considerations that may factor into their treatment as debt from an accounting perspective...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} issue of {{non-energy}} benefits {{within the context of}} the U. S. energy services company (ESCO) industry?a growing industry comprised of companies that provide energy savings and other benefits to customers through the use of performance-based contracting. Recent analysis has found that ESCO projects in the public/institutional sector, especially at K- 12 schools, are using performance-based contracting, at the behest of the customers, to partially [...] but not fully [...] offset substantial accumulated deferred maintenance needs (e. g., asbestos removal, wiring) and measures that have very long paybacks (roof replacement). This trend is affecting the traditional economic measures policymakers use to evaluate success on a benefit to cost basis. Moreover, the value of non-energy benefits which can offset some or all of the cost of the non-energy measures [...] including operations and maintenance (O&M) savings, avoided capital costs, and tradable pollution emissions allowances [...] are not always incorporated into a formal cost-effectiveness analysis of ESCO projects. Nonenergy benefits are clearly important to customers, but state and federal laws that govern the acceptance of these types of benefits for ESCO projects vary widely (i. e., 0 - 100 percent of allowable savings can come from one or more non-energy categories). Clear and consistent guidance on what types of savings are recognized in Energy <b>Savings</b> <b>agreements</b> under performance contracts is necessary, particularly where customers are searching for deep energy efficiency gains in the building sector...|$|R

The EU is committed to eliminating existing loopholes in the system of taxation of savings income. Switzerland has expressed to the EU its willingness in principle to correspondingly adjust the taxation of savings income.

40|$|The Department of Energy {{estimated}} that the lighting retrofit would reduce annual electricity use by 6. 146 million kWh (62 % of the lighting electricity use), and lower peak electric demand by 1, 300 kW. Estimates of the electricity savings were $ 399, 058 per year, or $ 1, 350, 386 over a seven year period. Environmental impacts of this project have been estimated {{in the range of}} 3, 791 to 4, 160 tons/yr (3. 4 to 3. 8 million kg) of carbon dioxide (CO 2) avoidance, 31. 7 to 33. 2 tons/yr (28. 7 to 30. 1 thousand kg) of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) avoidance, and 13. 6 to 16. 0 tons/yr (12. 3 to 7. 3 thousand kg) of nitrous oxide (NO 2) avoidance. In September of 1993 a 36, 832 fixture lighting retrofit was completed at the United States Department of Energy Forrestal complex in Washington, D. C. This retrofit represents DOE's largest project to date that utilizes a Shared Energy <b>Savings</b> (SES) <b>agreement</b> as authorized under Public Law 99 - 272.

40|$|Federal {{agencies}} have had performance contracting authority since 1985, when Congress first authorized agencies {{to enter into}} shared energy <b>savings</b> <b>agreements</b> with Public Law 99 - 272, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. By the end of FY 2001, agencies had used energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) to attract private-sector investment of over $ 1 billion to improve the energy efficiency of federal buildings. Executive Order 13123 directs agencies to maximize their use of alternative financing contracting mechanisms such as ESPCs when life-cycle cost effective to reduce energy use and cost in their facilities and operations. Continuing support for ESPCs at the Administration and Congressional levels {{is evident in the}} pending comprehensive national energy legislation, which repeals the sunset provision on ESPC authority and extends ESPC authority to water savings projects. Despite the Congressional and Presidential directives to use ESPCs, some {{agencies have}} been reluctant to do so. Decision makers in these agencies see no reason to enter into long-term obligations to pay interest on borrowed money out of their own operating budgets if instead Congress will grant them appropriations to pay for the improvements up front. Questions frequently arise about whether pricing in ESPCs, which are negotiated for best value, is as favorable as prices obtained through competitive sourcing, and whether ESPC as a means of implementing energy conservation projects is as life-cycle cost effective as the standard practice of funding these projects through appropriations. The lack of any quantitative analysis to address these issues was the impetus for this study. ESPCs are by definition cost-effective because of their ''pay-from-savings'' requirement and guarantee, but do their interest costs and negotiated pricing extract an unreasonably high price? Appropriations seem to be the least-cost option, because the U. S. Treasury can borrow money at lower interest rates than the private sector, but appropriations for energy projects are scarce. What are the costs associated with requesting funding and waiting for appropriations? And how is the value of an energy project affected if savings that are not guaranteed do not last? The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and demonstrate methods to help federal energy managers take some of the guesswork out of obtaining best value from spending on building retrofit energy improvements. We developed a method for comparing all-inclusive prices of energy conservation measures (ECMs) implemented using appropriated funds and through ESPCs that illustrates how agencies can use their own appropriations-funded project experience to ensure fair ESPC pricing. The second method documented in this report is for comparing life-cycle costs. This method illustrates how agencies can use their experience, and their judgment concerning their prospects for appropriations, to decide between financing and waiting...|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} of tax harmonisation touched on a vital {{interest of the}} Grand Duchy. Wealth management remained the principal activity of the financial centre, even though other sectors such as management of investment funds were developing. However, considerations of confidentiality constituted the life of private banking. In negotiations on the European level, the Luxembourgish government demanded the maintenance of banking secrecy as long as its principal financial-service competitors maintained it as well. But this confidentiality {{should not be used}} for criminal activities. This was why the previous government had put through anti-money laundering legislation. The Juncker-Polfer government extended these measures to improve the effectiveness of the fight against fraud and economic and financial crime. In terms of tax harmonisation, the European summit of Feira in June 2000 was a way towards a compromise. An action plan with a deadline of 2010 was agreed. In January 2003 in Brussels. in an [...] "Economic and Financial affairs" [...] council meeting, the European Ministers for Finances and the Economy finally reached an agreement on the taxation of revenue from <b>savings.</b> The <b>agreement</b> stipulated that EU member states could choose between two models: information exchanges between tax administrations, or the introduction of a withholding tax with a progressive increase in the rate of revenue which, after a transition period, would reach 35% from 1 January 2011. The move to the generalised automatic exchange of information was coupled to a similar action by third-party countries, including Switzerland.|$|R
40|$|According {{to recent}} {{technology}} road maps, system cost reductions {{and development of}} standardised plug-and-function systems {{are some of the}} most important goals for solar heating technology development. Retrofitting hot water boilers in single-family houses when installing solar collectors has the potential to significantly reduce both material and installation costs. Previous studies have investigated such retrofitting, using theoretical simulations and laboratory tests, but no actual installations were made and tested in practice. This article describes the installation, measured performance and cost effectiveness of a retrofitting solution that converts existing domestic hot water heaters to a solar domestic hot water system. The measured performance is characterised by the monthly and annual solar fractions. The cost effectiveness is evaluated by a life-cycle cost analysis, comparing the retrofitted system to a conventional solar domestic hot water system and the case without any solar heating system. Measurements showed that approximately 50 % of the 5000 kWh/year of domestic hot water consumption was saved by the retrofitted system in south Sweden. Such <b>savings</b> are in <b>agreement</b> with previous estimations and are comparable to the energy savings when using a conventional solar domestic hot water system. The life-cycle cost analysis showed that, according to the assumptions and given climate, the return on investment of the retrofitted system is approximately 17 years, while a conventional system does not reach profitability during its lifetime of 25 years...|$|R
5000|$|In a 5-4 {{decision}} {{published on}} April 27, 2011, the Supreme Court reversed. Justice Scalia, {{writing for the}} Court, first described how the savings clause of 9 U.S.C. §2 affects state law applied to invalidate arbitration agreements: This <b>saving</b> clause permits <b>agreements</b> to arbitrate to be invalidated by [...] "generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability," [...] but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning {{from the fact that}} an agreement to arbitrate is at issue. Scalia then stated that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts not only state law that [...] "prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim", but also [...] "generally applicable" [...] doctrines [...] "applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration". Scalia discussed particular examples, such as law requiring arbitrations to allow for judicially monitored discovery, application of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or decision by a jury. The majority opinion further discussed how [...] "classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA". The majority opinion described the Discover Bank rule as one that essentially applies to require consumers to be able to demand class arbitration to resolve all consumer disputes. Scalia focused on the result of the [...] "Discover Bank" [...] rule - since its application was invalidating a large number of arbitration agreements, it must violate the policy in favor of arbitration. [...] Therefore, the majority opinion concluded that Discover Bank is preempted by the FAA.|$|R

Estimates of the electricity savings were $ 399, 058 per year, or $ 1, 350, 386 over a seven year period 2. Environmental impacts of this project have been estimated in the range of 3, 791 to 4, 160 tons/yr (3. 4 to 3. 8 million kg) of carbon dioxide (CO 2) avoidance, 31. 7 to 33. 2 tons/yr (28. 7 to 30. 1 thousand kg) of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) avoidance, and 13. 6 to 16. 0 tons/yr (12. 3 to 7. 3 thousand kg) of nitrous oxide (NO 2) avoidance. Since this project represents one of DOE's first major SES projects, special effort was given to carefully measuring every aspect of the project {{in order to create a}} well documented case study to serve as a model for other federal agencies. One of these efforts, initiated in 1991, included measuring hourly electricity and thermal savings using pre-post, whole-building measurement techniques developed as part of the Texas LoanSTAR program 4. In September of 1991, whole-building hourly monitoring equipment was installed and used to develop an hourly baseline record of pre-retrofit, whole-building energy use. Monitoring has continued through August of 1995, twentyfour months after the September 1993 retrofit completion date. This report provides an overview of the lighting retrofit and the resultant electricity and thermal savings. It presents results from the whole-building monitoring effort that show that the measured gross electricity savings accounted for $ 324, 705 or 76 % of the total monetary savings. The measured energy savings performed within 90 % of the estimated savings. Quite surprisingly, the thermal savings which were not included in initial estimates by the USDOE accounted for $ 102, 824 or 24 % of the overall savings and increased the total cost savings to $ 427, 529 (107 % of expected electricity cost savings of $ 399, 058).

40|$|In this issue, Potts and Reichenstein {{describe}} {{features of}} U. S. savings bonds and discuss their evaluation. The article {{can serve as}} a reference for busy practitioners who may not follow changes in the savings bond market closely, especially those who tend to rely on productrelated education for updates on financial instruments. Savings bonds remain an important investment for individuals; on March 31, 1994, individuals held $ 174. 9 million in U. S. savings bonds, a 7 % increase from one year prior (Williams, 1994). Further, as Table 1, “Demographic Characteristics of Individual Savings Bond Holders, ” indicates, the holding of savings bonds is not exclusive to any particular age group or income level (Federal Reserve Bulletin, 1994). I. POTENTIAL CHANGES The recently (November 1994) passed General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) included provisions that gave theTreasury Department full authority over interest rate setting on U. S. <b>savings</b> bonds. The <b>Agreement</b> removes the 4 % guarantee previously set by Congress for bonds held for less than five years and enables the Treasury to index the savings bond rate to that of the six-month T-bill. Peter Hollenbach, a spokesman for the Bureau of Public Debt, indicated in December 1994 that changes will not be retroactive and “an announcement of any change is some months away ” (Lazzareschi, 1994 b). While details are not finalized, changes expected are: l Pegging the rate for savings bonds held for less than live years to 85 % of the six-month T-bill rate, eliminating the 4 % rate guarantee. Bonds held for 5 years or more will continue to earn 85 % of the average rate paid by Treasury notes with five years left to maturity, with a minimum of 4 %. l Changing interest accrual from a monthly to a semiannual basis.
