40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the kinetics of in situ degradability parameters of the dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and the passage of materials originating from the ensilage of the waste from pineapple cultivation (aerial parts). The four treatments utilized were silage of pineapple waste compacted at 600, 700, 900 and 1000 kg/m³. After ensiling the material from the pineapple cultivation, the particle-transit and rumen-degradation kinetics were analyzed. For the analysis of particle transit, chromium was utilized as a marker to mark the fiber. Passage rates were determined by retrieving the markers in the feces of the animals. In the degradation assay, samples were incubated in nylon bags for 0, 6, 18, 48 and 96 hours. The behavior observed in the regression curves of the variables analyzed describes high correlation between them, i. e., the time during which the silage is retained in the rumen influences its digestibility and its degradation rate. Although the <b>silage</b> <b>compacted</b> at 900 kg/m³ shows a larger potentially digestible fraction, it is recommended that it be ensiled at a compaction density of approximately 750 kg/m³ due to the lower cost and shorter mean retention time in the rumen-reticulum and rumen fill, thereby increasing the ruminal degradation and passage dynamics...|$|R

Methods: a comparison study {{to evaluate}} Vitek 2 <b>compact</b> <b>machine</b> (Biomerieux Inc. ver 04. 02, France) in reference to manual methods for susceptibility test for Candida resistance among HIV/AIDS patient was done. Categorical agreement between manual disc diffusion and Vitek 2 machine was calculated using predefined criteria. Time to susceptibility result for automated and manual methods were measured. Results: there were 137 Candida isolates comprising eight Candida species with C. albicans and C. glabrata as the first (56. 2 %) and second (15. 3 %) most common species, respectively. For fluconazole drug, among the C. albicans, 2. 6 % was found resistant on manual disc diffusion methods and no resistant was determined by Vitek 2 machine; whereas 100 % C. krusei was identified as resistant on both methods. Resistant patterns for C. glabrata to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B were 52. 4 %, 23. 8 %, 23. 8 % vs. 9. 5 %, 9. 5 %, 4. 8 % respectively between manual diffusion disc methods and Vitek 2 machine. Time to susceptibility result for automated methods compared to Vitex 2 machine was shorter for all Candida species. Conclusion: {{there is a good}} categorical agreement between manual disc diffusion and Vitek 2 machine, except for C. glabrata for measuring the antifungal resistant.
