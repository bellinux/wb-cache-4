500|$|At the {{beginning}} of April 1806, Strachan was the only British admiral <b>still</b> <b>hunting</b> for Willaumez's squadron, following the withdrawal of Duckworth and Warren. Strachan's squadron was hampered in its movements {{by the presence of}} the 98-gun , which was much too slow to operate effectively with Strachan's fast response force. Returning to Britain in early April to resupply, Strachan detached St George and [...] (the new flagship of the Rochefort blockade) at Plymouth and was joined by three additional ships of the line and two frigates, all fast ships capable of extended operations. In early May, news reached Britain of Willaumez's stay at Salvador and his subsequent departure in mid-April, and Strachan was again ordered in pursuit, sailing for the West Indies.|$|E

[...] Yount reported that snow had fallen on 66 of 90 days between December 1880 and February 1881. He described the range and habits of Yellowstone's large mammals and expressed regret for [...] "the unfortunate breakage of my thermometer when {{it could not be}} replaced," [...] along with a submitted synopsis of the weather the previous winter. [...] In this report, he resigned his position [...] "to resume private enterprises now requiring my personal attention," [...] and concluded with a clear recommendation: ...|$|E

6000|$|He chose what {{appeared}} {{to be one of the}} most used paths and followed this as quietly as he could. He soon found that <b>still</b> <b>hunting</b> on snow-shoes and with moccasined feet on bare ground were two very different matters. He was not yet sufficiently adept on the big webs to keep them from clacking as the rim of one shoe passed over the rim of the other. The harder he tried not to the more noise he made, it seemed. Clack, clack, clack. It was most annoying. He stopped to consider. Then on the impulse of a sudden idea he slipped his shoes off and dropped down into the path he had been following. Here he could walk without noise. The droppings of the deer, known as [...] "sign" [...] by all hunters, were numerous, and the brush within reach from the path showed indications of having been browsed on recently, and he found several places where sharp hoofs had pawed away the snow since the last storm.|$|E
60|$|R.C. and I flattered {{ourselves}} that together we made rather a good hunting team. We were fairly {{well versed in}} woodcraft and could slip along stealthily. I possessed an Indian sense of direction that had never yet failed me. To be sure we had much to learn about deer stalking. But I had never hunted with any man whose ears were as quick as R.C.'s. A naturally keen hearing, and many years of <b>still</b> <b>hunting,</b> accounted for this faculty. As for myself, the one gift of which I was especially proud was my eyesight. Almost invariably I could see game in the woods before any one who was with me. This had applied to all my guides except Indians. And I believed that five summers on the Pacific, searching the wide expanse of ocean for swordfish fins, had made my eyes all the keener for the woods. R.C. and I played at {{a game in which}} he tried to hear the movement of some forest denizen before I saw it. This fun for us dated back to boyhood days.|$|E

60|$|Another {{three months}} passed. There was now {{no lack of}} food among the outlaws.

60|$|Spite of {{the killing}} cold, the problem of keeping warm was to the wolves always a simple one. Moving along through the winter night, always on a swift, silent trot, they picked up what game came in their way, and {{scarcely}} felt the eager cold that nipped at their ears, or the wind, keen as an icicle, that strove to penetrate the shaggy white coats that covered them. When their hunger was satisfied, or when the late day came and found them <b>still</b> <b>hunting</b> hopefully, they would push {{their way into the}} thick scrub from one of the numerous paths and lie down on a nest of leaves, which even in midwinter were dry as if no snow or rain had ever fallen. There, where no wind or gale however strong could penetrate, and with the snow filling the low branches overhead and piled over them in a soft, warm blanket three feet thick, they would push their sensitive noses into their own thick fur to keep them warm, and sleep comfortably till the early twilight came and called them out again to the hunting.|$|E
60|$|As the bee {{comes and}} goes irregularly from flower to flower; as the {{butterfly}} flutters in a zig-zag course from one sunny place on the garden wall to another--or, as an old woman runs from wrong omnibus to wrong omnibus, at the Elephant and Castle, before she can discover the right one; as a countryman blunders up one street, and down another, before he can find {{the way to his}} place of destination in London--so does Mr. Blyth now come and go, flutter, run, and blunder in a mighty hurry about his studio, in search of missing colors which ought to be in his painting-box, but which are not to be found there. While he is <b>still</b> <b>hunting</b> through the room, his legs come into collision with a large drawing-board on which there is a blank sheet of paper stretched. This board seems to remind Mr. Blyth of some duty connected with it. He places it against two chairs, in a good light; then approaching a shelf on which some plaster-casts are arranged, takes down from it a bust of the Venus de Medici--which bust he next places on his old office stool, opposite to the two chairs and the drawing-board. Just as these preparations are completed, the door of the studio opens, and a very important member of the painter's household--who has not yet been introduced to the reader, and who is in no way related either to Valentine or his wife--enters the room.|$|E
