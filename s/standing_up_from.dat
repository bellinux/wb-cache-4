50|$|Since {{nitrous oxide}} can cause dizziness, dissociation, and {{temporary}} loss of motor control, it is unsafe to inhale while <b>standing</b> <b>up.</b> Inhalation directly <b>from</b> a tank poses serious health risks, {{as it can}} cause frostbite since the gas is very cold when released. For those reasons, most recreational users will discharge the gas into a balloon or whipped cream dispenser before inhaling.|$|R

These were the Electruk Rider, which could be driven while <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> or <b>from</b> a high bench seat, which became the model E15, and a pedestrian controlled vehicle, which became the model DPC3. Both Express Dairies and the London Co-operative Society had large fleets of the Electruk Rider, and continued to add to them with purchases of the E15. Express Dairies had a fleet of some 2,200 milk floats in 1963, which included 1,220 Electruk Riders and 180 Electruk pedestrian controlled vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} whether a battery of physical function measures in a Parkin-son’s disease (PD) patient cohort predicted mortality status at 7 -year follow-up. Secondary aims were establishing which specific tests were the most useful, and whether PD pheno-type was a predictor. A retrospective correlation design was used in this study. A cohort of 109 PD patients underwent baseline physiotherapy assessment of gait, balance, posture, muscle strength, and ability to change postural set. We com-pared mortality status at 7 -year follow-up and baseline physi-cal assessment tests. Tinetti gait and balance scores, UPDRS score, 10 -m walk test (time, velocity, and number of strides), posture in standing, lying to sitting, sitting to <b>standing,</b> get-ting <b>up</b> <b>from</b> floor assessments, and time to ascend and descend four steps were found to be statistically significan...|$|R
50|$|The {{circulatory system}} and {{respiratory}} system {{is unique in}} this animal, because nearly the whole of these vessels are distinctly visible on {{the skin of the}} back, rising above the general surface. The heart is situated about {{in the middle of the}} back, where it forms a large oval swelling immediately below the skin, having the generative organs beneath. From the posterior end of the heart there a broad elevated but rounded ridge passes down the median line of the back to the caudal end of the body. This ridge is joined on either side by numerous similarly elevated branches, which divide and subdivide as they approach the pallial-like expansion on the sides of the body. The whole of these branches and their subdivisions, <b>standing</b> boldly <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the general surface of the skin, have the branchial cerata set along them, and they give off twigs, which pass up the margin of the broad, flounced, membranous expansion of the cerata.|$|R

50|$|The Jaipur Foot is {{superior}} to its SACH (Solid Ankle Cushion Heel) counterpart in certain ways, mainly {{in the range of}} movements it offers. The articulation at the 'ankle' allows not only inversion-eversion movements but also dorsiflexion (essential for squatting, <b>standing</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> prone position, etc.) and a shorter keel helps achieve this. Also, the materials used at the foot-end are waterproof and moderately mimic a real foot.|$|E

50|$|Arcy-sur-Cure is 30 km {{south-east}} of Auxerre, in the Yonne departement. The caves are 1.3 km {{south of}} Arcy-sur-Cure, {{on the left}} {{bank of the river}} Cure. At this place the river has meandered through the coral limestone substrate, creating a valley bordered by crests <b>standing</b> 125 m <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the present river bed. The caves are in a meander and on the outer side of it where the flow is at its strongest. Most of them are south-orientated, with the most western ones slightly turned towards the south-east. At that place the erosional valley shows very steep sides, in some parts akin to cliffs. Several caves are distributed along some 800 m of the valley’s side, at various levels.|$|R

50|$|Zanabazar (1635-1723), head of Buddhism in Khalkha, {{was a great}} {{master of}} the Buddhist art.

The lotus flowers over the shoulders of Siyama Tara have already blossomed and Siyama Tara herself is {{a woman in the}} bloom of her beauty. She is aware and proud of her perfect beauty.
