5000|$|After grading, {{the comics}} {{are placed in}} an inner well - a <b>sealed</b> <b>sleeve</b> of Barex, a highly gas-impermeable plastic polymer. Then, the comics are sonically sealed in a hard plastic, {{tamper-evident}} holder. This process {{is often referred to}} in comics jargon as [...] "slabbing". A label is affixed at the top indicating the title, date, grade, page quality, and any notes, such as notable creators.

5000|$|In {{the column}} Comic Book Vitamins on the Project Fanboy website, Steven Sykora {{discussed}} preserving collections by submitting your comic books to the CGC, where comics are inspected for flaws, graded accordingly {{and placed in}} an inner well - a <b>sealed</b> <b>sleeve</b> of Barex, a highly gas-impermeable plastic polymer. Then, the comics are sealed {{through a combination of}} compression and ultrasonic vibration in a transparent, hard plastic capsule.

50|$|Again, as with Crumb Duck, {{the release}} was a limited edition.

40|$|Where <b>sealed,</b> grease-lubricated <b>sleeve</b> and ball-bearings {{are used}} with once-only {{lubrication}} for life, the rheological {{properties of the}} grease {{as a function of}} the service life are important in connection with the load-carrying capacity and the sealing capacity. To calculate the bearing capacity of a journal or spiral-groove bearing it is important to know the relation between the rate of shear and the shear stress in the lubricating film, i. e. the apparent viscosity, as a function of time. For sealing of the bearing the value of the yield strength of the grease, after shearing, is also important as a function of time. To measure these two magnitudes, a rotating-cylinder type of viscometer and a cylinder type of yield strength meter have been constructed. The viscometer permits the determination of viscosity up to shear rates of about 5 x lo 5 s-l, while the yield strength meter can ascertain the ultimate strength, after stressing, with shear rates of up to lo 5 s-l-both being determined within the temperature range 25125 °C. A number of commercially available greases have been tested...|$|R
5000|$|The methanol-fueled two-cycle {{glow plug}} engines used for aeromodelling, since their {{adoption}} by model airplane hobbyists in the 1940s, have used varying percentages of castor oil as a lubricant. It is highly resistant to degradation when the engine has its fuel-air mixture leaned for maximum engine speed. Gummy residues {{can still be}} a problem for aeromodelling powerplants lubricated with castor oil, however, usually requiring eventual replacement of ball bearings when the residue accumulates within the engine's bearing races. One British manufacturer of sleeve valved four-cycle model engines has stated the [...] "varnish" [...] created by using castor oil in small percentages can improve the pneumatic <b>seal</b> of the <b>sleeve</b> valve, improving such an engine's performance over time.|$|R
5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the <b>sealing</b> of the <b>sleeves,</b> the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "cartridge seal" [...] is a {{prepackaged}} seal that {{is common}} in more complex applications and were originally designed for installation in equipment where a component type seal was difficult due to the equipment design. Examples of this are horizontally split and vertical pumps.

To accomplish this the seal utilized internal centering of the stationary parts and slotted bolt holes. This [...] "generic" [...] cartridge seal could be manufactured in higher production quantities resulting in a cartridge seal {{that could be used}} in all applications and pumps types. Cassette seals, patent no. 6,685,191 introduced by Gold Seals, Inc., utilize a replaceable inner [...] "cassette" [...] mounted in the cartridge end plate or gland, while modular cartridge seal systems makes it possible to replace only the parts subject to wear, such as sliding faces, secondary seals and springs, while keeping the <b>seal's</b> hardware (gland, <b>sleeve,</b> bolts).Cartridge <b>seals</b> can suffer from clogging due to the bigger space occupied inside the stuffing box, leading to dense or charged fluids not moving enough to centrifugate the solid particles.|$|R
40|$|A small {{portable}} chamber for {{the recovery}} of anaerobic bacteria is described. This rigid chamber is constructed of clear acrylic with dimensions of 30 inches (ca. 76. 2 cm) wide, 18 inches (ca. 44. 7 cm) deep, and 18 inches (ca. 44. 7 cm) high. Conventional bacteriological techniques can be used inside the chamber to efficiently isolate strict anaerobic organisms. An adapter allows the attachment of a standard anaerobic jar {{to the outside of}} the chamber. The jar can be used to store reduced media. Once the jar is attached to the chamber and the media is removed to the interior of the chamber, the jar is available to receive inoculated media. The anaerobic jar can then be removed from the chamber, without contaminating the jar or chamber with oxygen, and be placed in a conventional 37 degreesC incubator. This chamber also allows the microbiologist to process cultures without wearing gloves as was necessary with previous anaerobic chambers. Air-tight latex rubber <b>sleeves</b> <b>seal</b> around the microbiologists arms and to the armport flange of the chamber to prevent the introduction of oxygen into the chamber.
