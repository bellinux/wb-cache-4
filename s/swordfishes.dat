Twenty-one Swordfish torpedo bombers launched from the aircraft carrier [...] attacked the Italian fleet in two waves. The Italian base was defended by twenty-one 90mm anti-aircraft guns and dozens of smaller 37mm and 20mm guns, along with twenty-seven barrage balloons. The defenders did not possess radar, however, and so were caught by surprise when the <b>Swordfishes</b> arrived. Littorio and the other battleships were also not provided with sufficient anti-torpedo nets. The first wave struck at 20:35, followed by the second about an hour later.|$|E

On the other hand, one very large <b>swordfish,</b> a record, was caught in an hour, after a loggy rolling about, like a shark, without leaping. But these are not fighting <b>swordfish.</b> Of course, under any circumstances, it is an event to catch a <b>swordfish.</b> But the accidents, the flukes, the lucky stabs of the game, do not in any sense prove what <b>swordfishing</b> is or what it is not.|$|R

50|$|In July 1936, the <b>Swordfish</b> {{formally}} entered {{service with}} the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), {{which was then}} part of the RAF; 825 Naval Air Squadron became the first squadrons to receive the type that month. The <b>Swordfish</b> began replacing both the Fairey Seal in the spotter-reconnaissance role and the Blackburn Baffin in the torpedo bomber role in competition with the Blackburn Shark in the combined role. Initially, the Shark replaced the Seal in the spotter-reconnaissance squadrons and the <b>Swordfish</b> replaced the Baffin in torpedo squadron, after which the Shark was quickly replaced by the <b>Swordfish.</b> For nearly two years during the late 1930s, the <b>Swordfish</b> was the sole torpedo bomber aircraft equipping the FAA. By the eve of war in September 1939, the FAA, which had been transferred to Royal Navy control, had a total of thirteen operational squadron equipped with the <b>Swordfish</b> I. There were also three flights of <b>Swordfish</b> equipped with floats, for use off catapult-equipped warships. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, a total of 26 FAA Squadrons would be equipped with the <b>Swordfish.</b> More than 20 second-line squadrons also operated the <b>Swordfish</b> for a wide regime of training and pilot tuition purposes. During the early months of the conflict, the activities of the <b>Swordfish</b> were limited to mostly uneventful fleet protection and convoy escort missions.|$|R

60|$|Even as Aquareine spoke, {{they saw}} a swirl and commotion in the water ahead of them, while {{a sound like a}} muffled roar fell upon their ears. Then swiftly there dashed upon them a group of great fishes with long saws {{sticking}} out in front of their noses, armed with sharp, hooked teeth, all set in a row. They were larger than the <b>swordfishes</b> and seemed more fierce and bold. But the mermaids and Trot and Cap'n Bill quietly awaited their attack, and instead of tearing them with their saws as they expected to do, the fishes were unable to touch them at all. They tried every possible way to get at their proposed victims, but the Magic Circle was all powerful and turned aside the ugly saws; so our friends were not disturbed at all. Seeing this, the sawfishes soon abandoned the attempt and with growls and roars of disappointment swam away and were quickly out of sight.|$|E

6000|$|The {{pursuit of}} the {{swordfish}} is much more exciting than ordinary fishing, for it resembles the hunting of large animals upon the land and partakes more {{of the nature of}} the chase. There is no slow and careful baiting and patient waiting, and no disappointment caused by the accidental capture of worthless [...] "bait-stealers." [...] The game is seen and followed, and outwitted by wary tactics, and killed by strength of arm and skill. The swordfish is a powerful antagonist sometimes, and sends his pursuers' vessel into harbor leaking, and almost sinking, from injuries he has inflicted. I have known a vessel to be struck by wounded swordfish as many as twenty times in a season. There is even the spice of personal danger to savor the chase, for the men are occasionally wounded by the infuriated fish. One of Captain Ashby's crew was severely wounded by a swordfish which thrust his beak through the oak floor of a boat on which he was standing, and penetrated about two inches in his naked heel. The strange fascination draws men to this pursuit when they have once learned its charms. An old swordfish fisherman, who had followed the pursuit for twenty years, told me that when he was on the cruising-ground, he fished all night in his dreams, and that many a time he has rubbed the skin off his knuckles by striking them against the ceiling of his bunk when he raised his arms to thrust the harpoon into visionary monster <b>swordfishes.</b>|$|E

"Of {{course it}} sounds strange," [...] {{continued}} the widow, [...] "but I {{know that people}} can see down into clear water, and the water under me was clear, and the crack was wide {{enough for me to}} see through, and down under me was sharks and <b>swordfishes</b> and other horrible water creatures, which I had never seen before, all driven into the bay, I haven't a doubt, by the violence of the storm out at sea. The thought of my bein' upset and fallin' in among those monsters made my very blood run cold, and involuntary-like I began to turn the handle of the rudder, and in a moment I shot into a wall of ragin' sea-water that was towerin' around me. For a second I was fairly blinded and stunned, but I had the cork out of that oil-can in no time, and very soon--you'd scarcely believe it if I told you how soon--I had another placid mill-pond surroundin' of me. I sat there a-pantin' and fannin' with my straw hat, for you'd better believe I was flustered, and then I began to think {{how long it would take}} me to make a line of mill-ponds clean across the head of the bay, and how much oil it would need, and whether I had enough. So I sat and calculated that if a tumblerful of oil would make a smooth place about seven yards across, which I should say was the width of the one I was in,--which I calculated by a measure of my eye as to how many breadths of carpet it would take to cover it,--and if the bay was two miles across betwixt our house and my sister-in-law's, and, although I couldn't get the thing down to exact figures, I saw pretty soon that I wouldn't have oil enough to make a level cuttin' through all those mountainous billows, and besides, even if I had enough to take me across, what would be the good of goin' if there wasn't any oil left to fill my sister-in-law's lamp? ...|$|E

The Florida Straits {{in particular is}} an important breeding and nursery area for North Atlantic <b>swordfish,</b> {{as well as the}} historical fishing grounds for both recreational and commercial <b>swordfish</b> fisheries. The traditional nighttime recreational fishery for <b>swordfish</b> in southeastern Florida is categorized into two periods. The first period started in 1977 and consists of the first tournaments in the area to specifically target <b>swordfish.</b> Despite high initial catches, low catch numbers resulted in the conclusion of the <b>swordfish</b> tournament fishery in 1983. The second period of the fishery started in 2000 and continues to the present (2015). Data were collected from a total of 118 <b>swordfish</b> tournaments (17 historical, 101 modern). For comparison, data were also gathered from 66 billfish tournaments that occurred during the modern period. The tournaments studied occurred on the southeast coast of Florida from Stuart to Key West. Although participation correlated to the number of catches, catch per hour (CPH) remains on a slow decrease over time. The entry fees for modern period <b>swordfish</b> tournaments range from $ 200 to $ 1000, while those for the more exclusive billfish tournaments were tenfold higher.
