50|$|It {{took about}} a week to {{complete}} mine-clearing operations on the KAA and with Umm Qasr in Coalition hands, cargo vessels could begin steaming into the Iraqi port. Naval combat operations concluded {{near the end of}} March, but Adak joined the other WPBs to continue their force protection role and served as escorts while navy salvage vessels Catawba and Grapple removed obstructions in the waterway. On March 28, Coalition forces sent the first shipload of humanitarian aid into Umm Qasr on board the shallow draft Royal Fleet Auxiliary Sir Galahad under the escort of Adak, Wrangell, a minesweeper and patrol craft Firebolt. Adak and its crew continued escort duties along the KAA into early April. On April 11, Adak escorted Iraq’s first commercial <b>shipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> , which carried 700 tons of Red Crescent Society aid of food, water, medical supplies and transport vehicles. Meanwhile, Adak received orders to return to base and, on April 12, Adak redeployed to Bahrain after completing a thirty-five-day non-stop deployment to the NAG.|$|E
50|$|Eddie and his henchmen hijack a shipload {{of liquor}} {{belonging}} to fellow bootlegger Nick Brown (Paul Kelly) who {{had refused to}} cooperate with him. In charge of the liquor <b>shipment</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> is George who proposes that Eddie bring him in as a partner. Eddie agrees and back home they inform the authorities about one of Brown's liquor shipments. After the shipment is confiscated, Eddie and George lead a heist of the warehouse and steal it. As they are leaving, George recognizes one of the watchmen as his former sergeant that he disliked and murders him. After learning of the murder, Lloyd quits with George threatening to kill him if he ever informs on them. In time, as the bootlegging rackets prosper, Eddie sends Danny to arrange a truce with Brown, but Danny's body is dropped {{off in front of}} The Panama Club. Eddie goes after Brown for revenge, but George, by now resentful with Eddie's increasing power, tips off Brown, who sets a trap. A gunfight ensues, and Eddie kills Brown while escaping. Suspecting George's betrayal but unable to prove it, Eddie dissolves their partnership.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} pointed out that {{different}} financial environments would affect the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the various functions provided by bankers on board: monitoring, expertise and (or) certification. During the two years of research period, we plan to analyze empirically the relationships between bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s debt ratio and loan terms in order to clarify the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> for global banks. First, since the firm』s debt ratio is an endogenous variable and would interact with bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> we will employ the simultaneous regression models to estimate the relations between the debt ratio and bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> In addition, the estimation will be further divided into some regressions with different dependent variables, including the lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> non-lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> insurance companies <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> investment banks <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> other investors <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> to detail and compare their relations with the firm』s debt ratio. Finally, we also expect to explore the effects of the tenure of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s financial distress on the role of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> For the first year, the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s borrowing terms will be analyzed, and we plan to investigate how bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> influence the firm』s debt ratio in the second year of this research project. 許多研究指出不同的金融環境會影響銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的角色，本文將嘗試探討在全球國家中，銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種功能：監督、專業評估與（或）認證。在本計畫的兩年時間，我們預計實證分析全球的銀行進入企業董監事會與企業的負債比例以及銀行放款契約條件之間的關係，以釐清銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種可能角色。首先，由於銀行在企業董監事會與企業的負債比例為內生變數且彼此會相互影響，故在方法上將使用聯立迴歸模式（simultaneous regression models）同時考慮企業負債與銀行進入董監事會的關係。此外，本文除了考慮銀行進入企業董監事會之虛擬變數外，也將進一步探討董事銀行比例、非董事銀行比例、保險公司與投資銀行比例、其他投資者比例與企業負債比例之關係，以暸解上述董監事會成員之間的關係是否具有替代或互補關係。最後，本文也預計探討銀行進入企業董監事會的持續時間（tenure）及加入企業財務危機對銀行在董監事會所扮演的角色之影響，因為企業財務危機也可能會影響銀行加入企業董監事會的行為。本研究計畫預計在第一年首先進行銀行在企業董監事會與放款契約條件關係之研究，第二年則將進ㄧ步探討銀行在企業董監事會與企業資本結構之關係...|$|R
