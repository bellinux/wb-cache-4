5|$|The presidential {{campaign}} was Obama's first {{exposure to the}} national political scene; even before the field of Democratic candidates was narrowed to two, she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses. Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about the Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her <b>sarcasm,</b> she toned it down.|$|E
5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and <b>sarcasm</b> {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to be among the most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E

5|$|Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé's {{original}} version) is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is initially {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the original version). The Captain's coarse humanity and <b>sarcasm</b> act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E
25|$|With extreme <b>sarcasm,</b> Muratori ridicules {{not only}} {{the subject of the}} book, but also the style as well. Granting Kenney stylistic ability, he takes it to a level of <b>sarcasm</b> by {{comparing}} Orrery to a display of fireworks. It is overly bombastic in opinion because of its briefness. Were he able to write more and include more analytic evidence, this review might not be a bad source for negative criticism.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of more systematic, abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence. For example, adolescents {{find it easier}} than children to comprehend the sorts of higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies. Their increased facility permits them to appreciate {{the ways in which}} language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and <b>sarcasm.</b> (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend <b>sarcasm</b> at all.) This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} tone and style, Reformation propaganda, while {{sometimes}} serious in tone, was often satirical, featuring word-play and <b>sarcasm.</b> In this it developed earlier medieval traditions of religious satire. One {{example of this}} would be Martin Luther's commentary on the Life of John Chrysostom in his Die Lügend von S. Johanne Chrysostomo.|$|E

25|$|Red's dry, often sarcastic wit is {{balanced}} {{by a strong}} sense of camaraderie with his fellow lodge members, partly because he directs most of his <b>sarcasm</b> toward Harold. Despite this, Harold and the rest of Possum Lodge seem to regard Red {{with a high level of}} respect, though occasionally some of the lodge members will challenge his authority in one way or another.|$|E
25|$|Socrates, {{attempting}} to flatter Phaedrus, responds {{that he is}} in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle <b>sarcasm</b> and asks Socrates not to joke.|$|E
25|$|Steele {{caused some}} {{controversy}} when touring in Europe to support Slow Deep and Hard, thanks to rumors about his {{social and political}} views, with some critics {{going so far as}} to brand him a Nazi sympathizer, even though his bandmate, Josh Silver, is Jewish. Steele suggested that the European press had misunderstood his humor, and that his <b>sarcasm</b> was sometimes lost in translation to print.|$|E

25|$|His {{three main}} volumes of poetry, Balade vesele şi triste ("Ballads, Merry and Sad"), Parodii originale ("Original Parodies") and Migdale amare ("Bitter Almonds"), are a {{compelling}} mixture {{of humor and}} delicate lyricism. Topîrceanu's favorite device is to switch, without warning, from biting <b>sarcasm</b> to genuine sentiment and vice versa, often with beguiling ease. In his own words he aimed to: through jest, render tears all too clear.|$|E
25|$|Short-story {{writer and}} critic Patrick J. Murphy wrote that Cozzens' {{responses}} {{during the interview}} were verbalizations of his writing style: often using parody and <b>sarcasm,</b> quoting other works without attribution, and punctuated by laughter. As sometimes happened with his prose, this style did not translate well into print, {{and the results were}} further distorted because the information seemed to be gathered by one reporter but the article written by someone different.|$|E

However, he does have a special relationship with Komagata Yumi, who functions as an older-sister figure towards him. Sōjirō usually dresses up in a blue kimono with white handguards.|$|E
