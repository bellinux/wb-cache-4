FAO reports that there are no statistics on work carried out in the field of drainage. It is known however, that land in the Central region's Sébaco Valley has been recovered using <b>surface</b> <b>drains</b> and ongoing cleaning of natural drains. The Atlantic region is prone to flooding, therefore, both adequate surface and underground drainage is required. It is estimated that 350,000 ha in Nicaragua require proper drainage.|$|E
25|$|Cooch Behar is a well-planned town, and the {{municipality}} {{is responsible for}} providing basic services, such as potable water and sanitation. The water is supplied by {{the municipality}} using its groundwater resources, and almost all the houses in the municipal area are connected. Solid waste is collected every day by the municipality van from individual houses. The <b>surface</b> <b>drains,</b> mostly uncemented, drain into the Torsa River. Electricity is supplied by the West Bengal State Electricity Board, and the West Bengal Fire Service provides emergency services like fire tenders. Most of the roads are metalled (macadam), and street lighting is available throughout the town. The Public Works Department is responsible for road maintenance and on the roads connecting Cooch Behar with other towns in the region. Health services in Cooch Behar include a government-owned District Hospital, a Regional Cancer Centre, and private nursing homes. Utility services provided in Cooch Behar is considered {{as one of the}} best government utility services of West Bengal though the city gets totally flooded during heavy rains nowadays due to the problems of the drainage system.|$|E
60|$|The {{rivers of}} our region are of three kinds; little <b>surface</b> <b>drains</b> principally in the north; broad {{estuaries}} like the Mersey and many streams of Eastern Scotland {{in the central}} parts, and a single bed, the Ogobe, breaking through the subtending Ghats, and forming a huge lagoon-delta. Beginning at Camarones are the Boroa and Borba Waters, with the Rio de Campo, fifteen leagues further south; of these little is known, except that they fall into the Bight of Panari or Pannaria.|$|E

60|$|The general {{aspect of}} the region is prepossessing. It is a rolling surface sinking towards the Atlantic, in parts broken by hills and dwarf chains, either {{detached}} or pushed out by the Ghats; a land of short and abnormally broad rivers, which cannot, like the Congo, break through the ridges flanking the Central African basin, and which therefore are mere <b>surface</b> <b>drains</b> of the main ranges. The soil is mostly sandy, but a thin coat of rich vegetable humus, quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns, produces a luxuriant vegetation; whilst the proportion of area actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush. In the tall forests, which abound in wild fruits, there are beautiful tracts of clear grassy land, and the woods, clear of undergrowth, resemble an English grove more than a tropical jungle. Horses, which die of the tsetse (Glossina morsitans) {{in the interior of}} North Guinea, and of damp heat at Fernando Po, thrive on its downs and savannahs. The Elais palm is rare, sufficing only for home use. The southern parts, about Cape Lopez and beyond it, resemble the Oil River country in the Biafran Bight: the land is a mass of mangrove swamps, and the climate is unfit for white men.|$|E
6000|$|Behind {{the house}} to the north there was no view, and for a good reason, for here in the very middle of the back garden rose a mound of large size and curious shape, which {{completely}} shut out the landscape. What this mound, which may perhaps have covered half an acre of ground, was, nobody had any idea. Some learned folk write it down a Saxon tumulus, a presumption to which its ancient name, [...] "Dead Man's Mount," [...] seemed to give colour. Other folk, however, yet more learned, declared it to be an ancient British dwelling, and pointed triumphantly to a hollow at the top, wherein the ancient Britishers were supposed to have moved, lived, and had their being--which must, urged the opposing party, have been a very damp one. Thereon the late Mrs. Massey, who was a British dwellingite, proceeded to show with much triumph /how/ they had lived in the hole by building a huge mushroom-shaped roof over it, and thereby turning it into a summer- house, which, owing to unexpected difficulties {{in the construction of the}} roof, cost a great deal of money. But as the roof was slated, and as it was found necessary to pave the hollow with tiles and cut <b>surface</b> <b>drains</b> in it, the result did not clearly prove its use as a dwelling place before the Roman conquest. Nor did it make a very good summer house. Indeed it now served as a store place for the gardener's tools and for rubbish generally.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} a Commerce silt loam (alluvial) soil near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to {{study the effects of}} subsurface drainage on soil trafficability for two different water management systems: surface drainage only and subsurface drainage. Following a 30 –mm rainfall event {{there was a significant difference}} in the decrease of soil moisture at a 10 –cm depth directly above the subsurface drains compared with midway between drain pipes spaced at 15 m. Differences in soil moisture content between subsurface <b>drained</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>drained</b> only plots were not statistically significant, however, the plots that were subsurface drained had trafficable conditions one day sooner than the <b>surface</b> <b>drained</b> only plots. Soil strength values above the subsurface drains were consistently higher than at the mid–point between drains and soil strength increased as water table depth increased. A portable capacitance volumetric soil moisture meter was evaluated in this project for the accuracy in obtaining soil moisture content in the field. Results have shown that there was no correlation between the soil moisture obtained in situ by the volumetric moisture meter and by analysis of soil samples...|$|R

5000|$|Before the 1840s simple <b>surface</b> <b>drains</b> or covered drains {{were used}} in towns. <b>Surface</b> <b>drains</b> carried off surface water by making the road section higher in the centre than at the sides. The {{simplest}} form of covered drain was the box drain that had a broad flat bottom. These drains caused problems because it was common for the entire volume of the drain to be completely filled and blocked. Another type of covered drain was the circular or barrel drain. They were rarely used, as they were more expensive and less effective than box drains. With {{the development of the}} ovoid or [...] "egg-shaped" [...] drains there was a dramatic improvement in the effectiveness of drainage systems. John Phillips designed the first ovoid drain in the 1840s and advocated that in order to have proper drainage of towns, separate drainage systems should be used for stormwater and sewage. The ovoid drains concentrated the flow of the water {{to the bottom of the}} drain and therefore decreased the likelihood of silting and blockage. In the beginning, these drains were made of stone but by the 1870s they were mainly built of cheaper brick ...|$|E

50|$|Simply {{adjusting}} the landscape so that downspouts and paved <b>surfaces</b> <b>drain</b> into existing gardens {{may be all}} that is needed because the soil has been well loosened and plants are well established. However, many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and often more water runs off one's roof than people realize. Often the required location and storage capacity of the garden area must be determined first. Rain garden plants are then selected to match the situation, not the other way around.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{feature of}} the parking lot is its paved area, hence, by {{changing}} this surface to be more permeable to water the parking lot will drain better. Some surface options are open joint pavers, porous asphalt, pervious concrete, or a turf grid. Drainage {{is an important part of}} a green parking lot because runoff is a serious concern. In addition to using a more porous surface, a more porous subsurface may be used to maximize drainage through the parking lot <b>surface.</b> <b>Drains</b> and low lying areas for water retention can also be components of a green parking lot.|$|E
50|$|The cave {{system is}} {{contained}} within the Middle Limestone and chiefly developed along the shale partings of the bedding planes.

The cave drains water from north to south but the faulting in the middle inlier is responsible for water locally draining south to north under the normally dry river bed on the surface. This means that in flood conditions water on the <b>surface</b> <b>drains</b> north to south while the water in the large cave passage beneath drains briefly in the opposite direction before turning east and then back south.|$|E
