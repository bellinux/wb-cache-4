The remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar {{was released in}} January 2010 and performed well in theatres, but Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films, including Pelli Chesi Choodu; the company <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the producers who sold {{the rights of the}} negatives to television channels lost control over them. Goldstone added that there were many legal issues over ownership and copyright whenever other producers tried to do something on their own.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s New York State Police responded {{many times to}} the village, which has a {{generally}} low crime rate otherwise, when self-described dissidents reported harassment such as broken windows and graffiti of Hebrew profanity on their property. In one incident, troopers rode a school bus undercover to catch teenage boys stoning it; the boys later stoned a backup police cruiser when it arrived. One of Weider's nephews was among those arrested. He admitted {{that some of the}} village's young men took it upon themselves to act violently against dissidents because they could not bear to hear the grand rebbe criticized, although he <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them were provoked to do so by dissidents.|$|E

He also played a [...] "cheap" [...] Casio-101 on all the tracks and sang for the first time. AllMusic described Frith's singing on the album as [...] "strange high-pitched", and the songs as [...] "pop-like ditties" [...] with a [...] "simple and repetitive" [...] structure. Leonardo Digital Reviews <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the tracks had a [...] "happy-go-lucky" [...] feel to them.|$|E

[...] The comment sparked fresh protests and calls for Chandler's resignation. In response to the controversy, Chandler's personal assistant said [...] "He used the word again in explaining {{that it was not}} intended by him to be a racial slur", and called the Kernel's story [...] "a complete and total distortion." ...|$|E

500|$|Neil Gaiman {{had written}} an episode, {{but it was}} pushed to the next series due to budget {{constraints}} and was replaced with [...] "The Lodger" [...] instead. [...] "The Lodger" [...] was adapted from a comic strip {{of the same name}} writer Gareth Roberts had done for Doctor Who Magazine, although he <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> it started [...] "from scratch" [...] The story was inspired by wishing to see the Doctor in normal, every-day human circumstances, as well as Roberts' enjoyment of stories set on Earth rather than in space. Roberts was interested in doing a television version of the story, but he never mentioned it. However, Moffat was a fan of the comic story and immediately asked to adapt it into an episode when he became showrunner.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Sons of Soul were {{described}} by Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson as often quirky, while Elysa Gardner from Vibe {{said they were}} flirtatious and tender, particularly on ballads such as [...] "Slow Wine" [...] and [...] "(Lay Your Head on My) Pillow"; she felt the group's songwriting throughout the album possessed a [...] "reverent" [...] ethos. Raphael Wiggins was credited {{with the majority of}} the songwriting. Laura Zucker of The Sacramento Bee <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the album was written [...] "solidly in the R tradition of sweet talking and romancing."

Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain {{like the rest of}} us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E

500|$|Walker {{considered}} the compilation to be [...] "an {{almost unheard of}} opportunity to take something you had already released and make it better". Senior designer Mike Wikan <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the content additions were subtle changes, such as streamlining the engines for steady framerates and shorter loading times, and higher resolution textures. Prime had the addition of light bloom, and Echoes had difficulty tweaks to make it [...] "more accessible {{to those who were}} really intimidated early on". For Corruption, the code was examined to find ways to make it run faster and better than in the original Wii release. Besides the changes, the particle and water ripple effects found in the original versions of Prime were reduced, while the word [...] "damn" [...] uttered by the character Admiral Dane in Corruptions original release was also replaced with [...] "no".|$|E
500|$|Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars {{around the}} rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing drew on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of {{contemporary}} punk rock {{in favor of}} melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine established the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd played dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos {{by the time they}} recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. The two traded rhythmic and melodic lines several times on some songs while producing tension. [...] "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and forth, like a jigsaw puzzle", Lloyd <b>said.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> the solos on Marquee Moon followed a pattern wherein Verlaine ran up a major scale but regressed slightly after each step. On [...] "See No Evil", he soloed through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he played in a Mixolydian mode and lowered the seventh by half a step. Lloyd opened [...] "Friction" [...] by playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN Movies {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from Saw VI, but did point out his {{favorite}} and highlight of the film as the [...] "garage trap". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said [...] "The 3D is used {{as you might expect}} it to be – which is to say, this is no James Cameron immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is some fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points". [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He said Saw 3D is [...] "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the film's traps lack the [...] "Rube Goldberg-style cleverness that marked the series". [...] Scheck {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an [...] "exceedingly bland stand-in". He called the visual impact of the 3D [...] "negligible".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} fair reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist for The Star-Ledger, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] was funnier that previous episode and included scenes with good physical comedy involving Leslie, particularly when she spilled the beer bottles; he also praised Andy's [...] "naked crutch chase". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode {{gave a little}} more insight into Leslie's [...] "aspirations about {{wanting to be a}} woman who succeeds in government, which {{is a step in the}} right direction", but Fowler said her constant mistakes and wrong decisions bog down the story. Fowler said the best part of the episode was Andy's subplot, particularly the scene in which he hops down the street naked on his crutches. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade, and said the Amy Poehler character needs to be more fully formed in future episodes. Phipps <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the show's laughs came from supporting characters Andy, Tom and Ron; he also particularly praised Ron's shutdown of Leslie's hearing and his monologues of the ideal government: [...] "One guy, who sits in a small room at a desk. And the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke." [...] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly liked that the episode included a moral crisis of sorts for Leslie, who he described as [...] "a realized character instead of a caricature".|$|E

2500|$|In Illinois, {{proposed}} legislation in 2013 would have defined the term [...] "semi-automatic assault weapon" [...] to mean any semi-automatic firearm {{able to accept}} a detachable magazine, {{but it was never}} brought to a vote. The Illinois State Rifle Association <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the state's firearms owners owned one or more guns that would have been banned under the proposal. The NRA said the proposal would have restricted about 75 percent of handguns and 50 percent of long guns in circulation. As municipalities, Chicago and Cook County bans certain firearms defined as assault weapons and have no provision for legal possession of firearms owned before their laws were passed. [...] Minnesota also defines certain firearms as assault weapons and regulates their sales.|$|E

Further, university officials made statements which affirmed that they were proud of the accomplishments of their sports programs and varsity teams. An athletics director spoke highly of the university's scholarship program; one <b>said</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their student-athletes graduate and have successful careers.
