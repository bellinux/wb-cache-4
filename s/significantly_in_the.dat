Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} <b>significantly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1800s due to {{the commercialization}} and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also increased significantly following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Kurt Grotrian {{left the}} factory {{to serve in}} the German Army. He was soon wounded and taken {{prisoner}} of war. The elder Wilhelm Grotrian died in 1917. Willi Grotrian, his son, led the company but it was greatly reduced in manpower and in orders for pianos. After the war, the company resumed as before, expanding sales in 1920 by establishing a London shop under the brand name Grotrian-Steinweg. The workforce increased to 1,000. In 1924, Grotrian-Steinweg built an unusual piano for microtonal music composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky. The piano had three manuals, and strings tuned a quarter tone apart. By 1927, Grotrian-Steinweg was making about 3,000 pianos annually. This number dropped <b>significantly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s during the Great Depression; fewer than 500 pianos were made in 1931, and the workforce was reduced to less than 200.|$|E

5|$|McCabe married Edna May Linton on 5 February 1935 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and {{the couple}} had two {{children}}, {{a son and a}} daughter, born in 1939 and 1950 respectively. The devout McCabe sent both of his children to Catholic boarding schools even though the family home was nearby. Plagued by ill-health in his middle age, McCabe’s fitness was further hindered by his feet, which prevented him from exercising. He thus gained a lot of weight, and heavy smoking wore down his body, as did the large amount of people who wanted to meet him.

40|$|Introduction. Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{occurs as}} a result of autodigestive activation of pancreatic proenzymes, within the parenchyma of the glands. Objective. The goal of the work was to establish possible connection of etiology and severity of the acute pancreatitis and biohumoral parameters, ultrasound and CT. Methods. The study included 273 patients with pancreatitis, classified by Ranson’s score, according to degree of severity and etiology, whose biohumoral parameters were correlated with each other, and with the ultrasound and CT findings. Results. The values of amylase and ALT were <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> severe form of pancreatitis and biliary etiology compared to etilic (p< 0. 05). The ratio of AST/ALT was <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group of etilic compared to biliary etiology (p< 0. 05). LDH was <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> severe form group compared to moderate form of pancreatitis (p< 0. 01). Cholesterol was <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group of biliary compared to the group of etilic pancreatitis (p< 0. 05). There was a negative low correlation between the value of calcium ions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plasma and CT analysis (p= 0. 05). Low degree negative correlation between the value of calcium ions and ultrasound analysis was established (p= 0. 0001). Conclusion. There was a negative correlation between the level of ionized calcium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood and the degree of the acute pancreatitis by the Balthazar score. Mean value of alpha amylase, total value of cholesterol and ALT were <b>significantly</b> higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group of biliary compared to the group of etilic acute pancreatitis.
