40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} project {{was to examine the}} process of developing a data sharing framework between different public sector organizations. Design / methodology / approach: A two year case study of a data sharing project between a UK fire and rescue service, local council, NHS primary care trust and a police force was undertaken. Findings: It is important to carefully determine the requirements for data sharing, to establish data sharing agreements, to have <b>secure</b> <b>arrangements</b> for data sharing, and to ensure compliance with data protection legislation. Research limitations / implications: Data sharing between public sector organizations can operate effectively if appropriate care is taken when creating data sharing agreements between partner organizations. Practical implications: Data sharing can assist in reducing duplication of effort between public sector organizations, and can reduce costs and enable more co-ordinated provision of public services. Social implications: Data sharing can assist in identifying citizens who might otherwise have been overlooked to relevant organizations. Data sharing can also assist in reducing risks associated with individuals and promote more independent living. Originality / value: The detailed analysis of a data sharing case study identified the need for a systematic data sharing framework. Such a framework is proposed and illustrated with practical examples of specification, implementation and evaluation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present {{measures}} related to the load securing on European level. The road transport plays significant role in Europe. With the increasing volume of goods carried by road the number of vehicles are increasing and also the number of accidents involving trucks. The appro-priate load securing increases the safety of road freight transport. European Best Practice Guidelines on Cargo Securing for Road Transport issued by European Commission are the first document on European level offering the load securing information. There is also a lack of load securing training for truck drivers in most of the EU member states. In most member states the load securing is not the part of the training to obtain truck driving licence. The di-rective 2003 / 59 /EC on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers shall improve the situation. The education of truck drivers from load securing began since September 2009. The standard EN 12195 - 1 offers calculation base to design load <b>securing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> There were cases when it has created unreasonable demands for load securing. The standard has been revised and finally published in May 2011. However, still the differences between the designs according to the EN 12195 - 1, methods using in Nordic countries, Germany and according to the IMO/ILO/UN ECE Gu-idelines on packing of cargo transport units exists.

40|$|An accelerometer, {{mounted to}} a {{structure}} near an explosion to measure elasto-plastic deformation, can be excited at its resonant frequency by impulsive stresses transmitted within the structure. This results in spurious high peak acceleration levels {{that can be}} much higher than acceleration levels from the explosion itself. The spurious signals also have higher frequencies than the underlying signal from the explosion and can be removed by a low pass filter. This report assesses the performance of four accelerometer and filter assemblies. The assessment involves measurements of the response of a mild steel cylinder to an underwater explosion, in which each assembly is mounted onto the interior surface of the cylinder. Three assemblies utilise a piezoresistive accelerometer in which isolation is provided mechanically. In the fourth assembly, a piezoelectric accelerometer, with a built-in filter, incorporates both mechanical and electronic filtering.

40|$|As the United States {{continues}} its transition into a postindustrial society, we are slowly {{moving away from}} the standard work arrangements that characterized the early post-World War II era towards less <b>secure</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Examining changes in workers’ perceptions of insecurity is important because these perceptions often condition their actions within the labor market. Recent events like the Great Recession also reflect a changing economic landscape and highlight the need for a closer look at workers’ perceived insecurity. In addition to using a social structure of accumulation (SSA) framework, this dissertation distinguishes three dimensions of subjective economic insecurity: perceived job precarity, perceived skill precarity, and perceived financial precarity. Two research questions are considered by this research. First, how have U. S. workers’ perceptions of economic insecurity changed during the late postwar era, especially in the initial stage of spatialization and the aftermath of the Great Recession? Second, what factors have contributed to these changes in U. S. workers’ subjective economic insecurity? These questions are addressed by analyzing GSS data from the cumulative file, which covers the entirety of the late postwar period, and the Quality of Working Life Module, which covers the emergence of the spatialization SSA (2002, 2006, and 2010). The findings indicate that the dimensions of subjective economic insecurity are empirically distinct. After controlling for unemployment, both perceived job and financial precarity sharply increase {{over the course of the}} late postwar period whereas perceived skill precarity trends slightly downward. The flexible turn in employment relations is positively associated with perceived job precarity but not perceived skill or financial precarity. These results indicate that workers are responding to the shifting employment relationship in a very significant way. During the spatialization SSA, characteristics of security and control tend to be negatively associated with perceived job and financial precarity, whereas characteristics of uncertainty and conflict are positively associated. This is in contrast to the results for perceived skill precarity, which are more varied. These findings suggest that the notion of job security may be becoming less important than a worker’s ability to manage their own career across multiple jobs, firms, and geographical locations...|$|R
