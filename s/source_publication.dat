50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of his university education in Tübingen, Leipzig, and Göttingen, Brackmann joined, {{at the age of}} twenty-seven, the staff of MGH (Monumenta Germaniae Historica), the leading German <b>source</b> <b>publication</b> for medieval documents. He was appointed professor of history at Königsberg in 1913, Marburg in 1920, and Berlin in 1922. In 1929 he became the director general of the Prussian Privy State Archives, in Berlin-Dahlem. In connection with accepting the position he advocated {{for the establishment of a}} special Institute for Archival Sciences and Historical Training (Preußisches Institut für Archivwissenschaft), to provide for the professional training of archivists; the institute, which came under the administration of the state archives, opened in Berlin-Dahlem in May 1930. Brackmann, in his capacity as director general of the archives, simultaneously served as the archival institute's first director, until his retirement in 1936. During his term at the archives he retained an honorary professorship at the University of Berlin.|$|E

Aside from these, Time-Llife reissued in the time-span 1999-2000 an illustrated commemorative version of Shelby Foote's The Civil War: A Narrative (14 volumes [...] - [...] the original three-volume work was, save for a few maps, not illustrated). Additionally, a stand-alone title, An Illustrated History of the Civil War (...) , was released in 2000 as a, summarizing, general history of the war, and, like Voices and A Narrative, again making use of the considerable pictorial archive the publisher had accumulated for the main series, including their own commissioned maps.|$|E

40|$|For the {{generation}} of contemporary databases of bioactive compounds, activity information is usually extracted from the scientific literature. However, when activity data are analyzed, <b>source</b> <b>publications</b> are typically no longer taken into consideration. Therefore, compound activity data selected from ChEMBL were traced back to thousands of original publications, activity records including compound, assay, and target information were systematically generated, and their distributions across the literature were determined. In addition, publications were categorized {{on the basis of}} activity records. Furthermore, compound promiscuity, defined as the ability of small molecules to specifically interact with multiple target proteins, was analyzed in light of publication statistics, thus adding another layer of information to promiscuity assessment. It was shown that the degree of compound promiscuity was not influenced by increasing numbers of <b>source</b> <b>publications.</b> Rather, most non-promiscuous as well as promiscuous compounds, regardless of their degree of promiscuity, originated from single publications, which emerged as a characteristic feature of the medicinal chemistry literature...|$|R
