40|$|In this {{retrospective}} case series, {{we report}} the spectrum and outcomes of aggressive posterior {{retinopathy of prematurity}} (APROP) in infants ≥ 1500 g birth weight. Twenty-nine eyes of 15 infants are included. All infants were referred from level I or II nurseries, received <b>supplemental</b> unmonitored <b>oxygen</b> for prolonged duration (> 1 week) and had multiple systemic co-morbidities. Of the 29 eyes, 10 (34. 5 %) had zone 1 and 19 (65. 5 %) had posterior zone 2 disease. Twenty-five (86. 2 %) eyes had flat neovascularization and 4 (13. 8 %) eyes had brush like proliferation. We noticed large vascular loops in 10 (34. 5 %) eyes. After confluent laser photocoagulation, 22 (75. 9 %) eyes had a favorable outcome. The study concludes that APROP in heavier (≥ 1500 g birth weight) premature infants occurs mostly in posterior zone 2 with flat neovascularization and atypical features like large vascular loops. <b>Supplemental</b> unmonitored <b>oxygen</b> for prolonged duration and multiple systemic co-morbidities could be a contributing factor...|$|R
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{was first}} described by Northway in 1967, who outlined {{the conditions that}} would lead to the diagnosis.

5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. <b>Supplemental</b> <b>oxygen</b> exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting <b>supplemental</b> <b>oxygen</b> use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevention}} of oxygen toxicity depends {{entirely on the}} setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects.

This double-blind experiment {{examined the relationship between}} blood oxygen levels and cognitive performance when oxygen was inspired for 2 min at different times relative to a simple word recall task, forward digit span and backward digit span. Transient hyperoxia, measured by haemoglobin-bound oxygen, was evident following oxygen inspiration. Neither forward nor backward digit span was affected by oxygen administration. Word recall (12 min following word presentation) was enhanced when oxygen was administered 5 min prior to, immediately before or immediately following word presentation; but not 10 min prior to, 5 min following nor 10 min following, word presentation. These data suggest that oxygen administration can selectively enhance aspects of cognitive performance and support a hypothesis whereby <b>supplemental</b> blood <b>oxygen</b> is sequestered by neural mechanisms involved in memory consolidation...|$|R
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and {{is of concern}} to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the retina.

5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with <b>supplemental</b> <b>oxygen</b> and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} was {{not observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of <b>supplemental</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.|$|E

Although the effects of hypoxia on blood flow have been extensively studied, the hyperoxic regime between normoxia and 100 % inspired oxygen has been only intermittently studied. Subjects were studied at four levels of hyperoxia induced during a single session while perfusion was measured using arterial spin labelling MRI.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Moderate {{sedation}} for gastrointestinal endoscopy {{has traditionally}} been provided by the endoscopist. Controversy has ensued over safe and efficient sedation practice as endoscopy has increased in numbers and complexity. AIM: To evaluate the safety of ketamine sedation given by non-anesthesiologist during gastrointestinal endoscopy in children. METHODS: A prospective study of 100 paediatric patients with gastrointestinal symptoms who were a candidate for upper or lower gastrointestinal endoscopy in paediatric endoscopy unit at Abo El-Reesh paediatric hospital, Cairo university. All children were > 2 years old and weighed > 6 kg. The analysis was performed in terms of sedation-related complications. RESULTS: A total 100 paediatric patients including 53 males and 47 females with mean age of 5. 04 years {{were involved in the}} study. All children were medicated with ketamine with a mean dose of 3. 77 mg/kg. No complications occurred in 87 % of cases.

40|$|AbstractAir in the {{epidural}} {{space is}} called pneumorachis. The usual mechanism of pneumorachis is air diffusion from the mediastinal tissue layers through the inter-vertebral foramen. Alternatively, air can diffuse directly after spine traumas (e. g., blunt deceleration with vertebral dislocation) or medical procedures. Several mechanisms could explain pneumomediastinum and pneumorachis after cocaine sniffing. Passive apnea and/or cough that occur after sniffing can cause intra alveolar hyper-pressure, {{which is responsible}} for alveolar rupture and air diffusion. Another mechanism is alveolar wall fragility and rupture induced by repeated cocaine sniffing, in turn causing air diffusion to the mediastinum, sub-cutaneous tissues and the epidural space. The diagnosis is usually made on Chest tomography scan. Management consists in close monitoring {{in the intensive care unit}} to detect aggravation of pneumomediastinum and pneumorachis, which would require surgical management. <b>Supplemental</b> nasal <b>oxygen</b> can be given to accelerate nitrogen washout. We present a case of a 28 years old male who presented to the emergency department for chest pain directly after sniffing cocaine.

We aimed to associate preoperative characteristics with long-term mortality, and create a predictive nomogram, which was then externally validated on an independent cohort (697 patients) who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. ResultsWe pooled the results of 412 patients undergoing endovascular repair of infrarenal and juxtarenal aneurysm who were high risk (average Glasgow aneurysm scores of 72. 8 [SD 10. 4]). Despite anatomic differences, there were no statistically significant differences in perioperative or long-term outcomes between infrarenal and juxtarenal aneurysms (log rank test, P =. 5). Data from this group (64 % infrarenal aneurysms and 36 % juxtarenal aneurysms) were randomly and evenly split into a model development and test group. Independent predictors of mortality included in the model are age, aneurysm diameter, history of peripheral artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or congestive heart failure, requirement for <b>supplemental</b> home <b>oxygen,</b> and use of salicylates. Internal validation reveals good calibration and discriminative ability (c-statistic 0. 68 [95 % confidence interval 0. 65 - 0. 71]). External validation confirms good calibration.
