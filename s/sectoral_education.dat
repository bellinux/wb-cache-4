This research report confirms whether or not this situation is the case. It also looks at the way the developers of the assessment tools for the unit standards and qualifications have potentially altered their methods of practice or alternatively, adopted a different philosophical stance to comply with INSETA requirements. Triangulated research was conducted using a defined set of respondents from a local perspective. The findings showed that no one respondent clearly displayed a particular philosophical standpoint and that, in every case, his or her assessment tool development methodology was in line with INSETA required practice...|$|E

This is especially true for a developing country such as South Africa that needs to address macro socio-economic challenges such as poverty and unemployment. The Senior Management Staff (SMS) in the public sector have a pivotal role to ensure that the public sector is managed effectively. The reason for this qualitative study was to identify the standards that key management practices should comply with, to benchmark the applied practices of the Department of Labour (DoL) and <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Education</b> and Training Authorities (SETAS) against these standards and to recommend guidelines of how these practices could be improved. In addition the improvement of management practices would advance the implementation of strategies and policies and service delivery in the public sector. The guidelines proposed, based on the identified weaknesses should also improve the degree of compliance of the management practices. The improvement in compliance should thus ensure a more effective public sector, which delivers a better service to all citizens and contribute effectively to the sustainable socio-economic growth and development in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{conducts a}} review of the {{literature}} on skills shortages in South Africa. It is demonstrated that different Government departments have different views concerning the definition of skills shortages. This is largely due to the omission in any official government literature of tying the concept of “skills shortages” to productivity. There is also a complex and frequently overlapping institutional architecture that undermines the effective administration of skills development. An important example of this is that the link between providing skills training and accrediting individuals with a qualification that acknowledges this training is very poorly administered, highlighting poor coordination between the Department of Labour and Department of Education. Among <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Education</b> and Training Authorities (SETAs), there is also under-performance on their mandate to provide skills training for the unemployed – an activity that is flagged in this review simply because of the strong public good nature to this activity and the fact that only SETAs are institutionally empowered to effect this change. A variety of policy recommendations are made with respect to both closed- and open-economy solutions to skills shortages. A key point is that immigration legislation must be relaxed in order to help solve the pervasive skills constraints in South Africa. South Africa: skills, training, education, SETAs...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the role}} of changes in informal/formal relative employment, wage levels and wage inequality in explaining increasing wage dispersion in Mexico during the 1987 - 1993 period. From 1987 to 1993, the variance of the log of hourly wages for Mexican workers {{increased by more than}} 50 per cent. Using data from the Encuesta nacional de empleo urbano we find that this increase in the overall wage dispersion was mainly driven by increasing wage dispersion in the formal sector coupled with a faster growth in formal sector employment as a percentage of total employment. However, compression in the distribution of wages within the informal sector contributed to substantially slowdown the increasing overall wage inequality. About 60 per cent of the 1987 - 1993 4. 65 percentage point reduction in the informal sector share of total employment is explained by changes in the structure that determines sectoral employment; the rest is explained by changes in the composition of the labour force, particularly increases in the <b>sectoral</b> <b>education</b> gap and a change in the regional relative share of sectoral employment. Also, from 1987 to 1993 the sectoral wage ratio increased from 0. 59 to 0. 63. It seems that a relative improvement in unobserved skills in the informal sector helped to close the wage differential but this effect was partially offset by an increase in the relative prices of both observed and unobserved skills, as well as increases in relative observed skills in the formal sector, particularly education. ...|$|E
40|$|A major {{aspect of}} {{employment}} growth {{is discussed in}} relation to economic growth. This paper deals with {{the question as to}} whether the relationship between economic and employment growth, subsumed under the idiom Verdoorn's Law, holds true at the sectoral level. For this reason, the German labor market is divided into regional functionally delineated labor markets. The employees are differentiated into <b>sectoral</b> affiliation, <b>education,</b> national status and part-time employment. The economy is split into six sectors. The labor demand function is derived from the cost-function of companies, and factor prices (interest rates and wages) are considered. It is evident that the construction sector still has intense connections to the labor market concerning output changes. This cannot be verified in the finance, insurance and service sector. Part-time work increased during the economic crisis. The elasticity to factor-prices holds true for most types of employment. It is found that, regional labor market performance is directly linked to industrial structure. The fixed an random-effects estimations used here deliver satisfying results to most investigations.

40|$|Magister Artium (Human Ecology) - MA(HE) A theory-based {{evaluation}} {{has been}} conducted with an improvement-orientated purpose on the Social Auxiliary Worker (SAW) Training Programme for an accredited provider to improve and continue to implement their own SAW Training Programmes. Theory-driven evaluations are essential for distinguishing between the validity of programme implementation and the validity of programme theory. Addressing the social needs of communities through social development and transformation is a top priority for the South African Government. South Africa faces a shortage of Social Work Practitioners (SWPs) due to emigration, as well as insufficient numbers of university graduates. This shortage has left the current SWPs with severe workload pressures. The South African Department of Social Development (DSD) initiated, in 2004, the training of Social Auxiliary Workers (SAWs) to serve as assistants to the SWPs. The SAW qualification initiative has been developed as a course accredited with the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) at the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) level 4. Providers of SAW training courses are accredited by the Health and Welfare <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Education</b> and Training Authority (HWSETA) and by the South African Council for Social Services Professions (SACSSP). The empirical {{part of the study}} was conducted in two stages. The first stage consisted of a clarificatory evaluation, wherein a step-by-step logical participatory process was followed for the clarification and development of the programme theory. This process resulted in logic models and a theory-of-change model against which the evaluation questions for the study were developed. These questions assessed the need for the SAW training programme - and for the SAW training programme planning and design. It was found that there was a need for SAW training programmes and that the SAW training programme had been designed to address this need. The second stage consisted of an implementation evaluation. This was done by means of a data matrix using the evaluation aspects for each of the objectives developed during the clarificatory evaluation. Data gathering was done by means of content analysis, focus group workshops and questionnaires. Data interpretations, conclusions and judgements were made with regard to each of the objectives and consolidated in a table format which indicated the outputs and outcomes, implementation results- and a judgement and recommendation for each objective. It was found that a standardised and structured process was followed most of the time, but that the knowledge and skills training elements, particularly in their practical application, left room for improvement. The study illustrates the advantages of a theory-based evaluation that assists with programme planning and modification, knowledge development and the planning of evaluation studies...|$|E

Linkages are imperfect, at best; and often contain weaknesses and fault points. These weaknesses apply within developing countries, within institutions in the aid community, and within universities. This paper sets out to characterize five such domains: (1) the policy design domain (in which broad visions for growth, social, political, or cultural direction are developed); (2) the macro economic management domain (usually represented by the ministries of finance and economy); (3) the <b>sectoral</b> domain (<b>education,</b> health, agriculture etc.); (4) the issue domain (environment, poverty, private sector, gender etc.); and (5) the community/enterprise domain (NGOs, businesses, local administration, project actors etc. Varying perspectives are illustrated {{through the use of}} fictional characters, half from developing countries, half from the “development professions”. The point is that development requires all these different perspectives to operate in parallel fashion rather than in competition. This will require all sides to make a more concerted effort to bridge the practical and conceptual barriers and hence achieve better understanding and more solid results.

This is the first study that explicitly analyzes the role played by spatial effects to explain website adoption for the European case. A set of instruments and techniques commonly used in the spatial econometrics framework is employed to test the hypothesis that proximity matters when explaining Internet adoption by firms. Results show that firms in physically adjacent regions register a similar degree of Internet adoption, confirming the presence in this context of positive spatial dependence. Nevertheless, the spatial effects detected are mainly constrained by national borders. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, population density, <b>sectoral</b> composition, and <b>education</b> are positively related to geographic distribution of Internet adoption in the enlarged European Union. In addition, regional disparities in Internet adoption were found to be less important than territorial inequalities in GDP per capita. Copyright (c) 2009 Copyright the Authors.

The initial driver for establishing the Ourimbah campus was the need to provide a tertiary education precinct on the Central Coast, but this was expanded into a concept that would provide "improved educational opportunities and maximum educational benefits {{for the people of the}} region" by incorporation of VTE and Community College partners on the same site; then by extending the partnership to conceive of the Gosford and Wyong TAFE campuses as part of a set of three campuses forming an educational community precinct and building strong synergies between courses and credentials through strong links to business and industry. The Central Coast region is characterised by an increasing population and economic growth but low education participation rates. The development of seamless pathways is one of the key policies and achievements of the campus, constructed on the basis of joint planning of programs and the development of articulation arrangements appropriate to the region, with just under 1, 000 TAFE students offered entry into the University of Newcastle in 2007.

The thesis {{is the result of}} four years' work in mathematical education in Papua New Guinea. The first two years were spent in setting up a new Mathematics Education Centre at the University of Technology, Lae. A broad brief enabled the author to seek out the most crucial needs for the country and these appeared to lie in the area of basic number skills. Assessments of the situation and contributions to a changing attitude are described. This part of the thesis concludes with a critique of the role of a Mathematics Education Centre in a Third World country.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{highlight}} wage trends and patterns in the South African labour market through examining wage premia and wage differentials. The analysis utilises data from the October Household Survey of 1995. Findings show that the regular race, gender and educational differentials arise when looking at median wages, with the racial wage gap being more severe than the gender wage gap. One of the key reasons for the racial wage differential, specifically between that of Africans and Whites, is the higher rate of return on education for White workers. The higher rates could be due to unofficial discrimination; a perception that degrees from historically white universities are of a higher quality than degrees from historically black universities; and the accumulation of human capital by White workers in areas of high demand by firms. There also appears to be a racial wage cleavage between Africans and Coloureds on the one hand and Asians and Whites on the other. Significant wage premia exist for skilled workers in the labour market and these are borne out in the percentile differentials of race, gender and <b>education.</b> <b>Sectoral</b> wage data show that high skills-intensive sectors yield higher levels of wage inequality than low skills-intensive sectors. Findings from a tentative international comparison show that, relative to most developed countries, South Africa has high levels of wage inequality.

This process got {{an important role in the}} major research topics in economic and social geography, thanks to the high innovation capacity of the sector, the new forms of organizing economic activities and the discussed spatial and social effects of the development. The rising ICT sector and new elements of information society implied a special interest not only from basic research, but even applied research areas, for example the emerging role of ICTs in regional development and regional policies and some <b>sectoral</b> policies (economy, <b>education,</b> health etc.).

This paper assesses whether that requirement was implemented fully and effectively. The analysis concludes that the requirements were implemented fully, as a Strategy and <b>sectoral</b> guidelines for <b>education</b> were presented to the Board of Directors within the required timeframe. The assessment {{of the extent to which}} the documents represent an effective response to the IDB- 9 mandate is more complex. The emphasis on "investing in people" is highly relevant to the Region, though the diagnoses and analyses in specific sectors as well as of country needs and priorities are uneven. The depth of the Bank's experience and expertise in the social sectors and the lessons to be gained from its previous experience are not fully reflected in the Strategy. The Results Framework, prepared for the IDB- 9 Report prior to the Strategy, does not adequately reflect the priorities proposed, and targets could be met even if the priorities within each sector are not implemented. In addition, the Strategy does not identify specific actions to meet its objectives. The 2012 - 2015 Action Plan, prepared in response to a request from the Board, details some of these actions, but it falls short of identifying staffing and budgeting requirements and intermediate milestones for monitoring. Further dissemination of the Strategy and broader discussion of its contents, both internally and externally, would help make the strategy more relevant, and updating the Action Plan would help to guide future implementation. In addition, an effort by the Board and IDB Management to lay out clear guidelines for future strategy exercises would help to clarify expectations and ensure a more meaningful and effective strategy setting process for IDB and its borrowing countries. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between fiscal decentralisation and poverty. The thesis consists of four parts. First part reviews the related literature addressing different aspects of fiscal decentralisation and poverty and highlighting the research gap that this thesis intends to address. It also explains the possible channels through which fiscal decentralisation potentially affects poverty. Second part describes the political economy, fiscal decentralisation and poverty in Pakistan. It underlines that fiscal policy decisions in Pakistan are made to reflect many vested interest groups and institutions that may be failed to provide basic social services. Additionally, it discusses the development of federalism and fiscal decentralisation in Pakistan and shows that how the vertical and horizontal resource distribution affect {{the social and economic}} development of the provinces. This part also discusses various approaches, measurements and trends of poverty in Pakistan. Third part presents a systematic relationship between fiscal decentralisation and poverty both theoretically and empirically. The theoretical framework implies that if the federal transfer rate is larger, then the decentralisation measure will be greater. Since a larger federal transfer rate reduces poverty, poverty and expenditure decentralisation are expected to be negatively related. In addition to the model, there is an extensive empirical study on Pakistan to look at the impact of fiscal decentralisation on poverty besides investigating the potential channels through pro-poor sectoral outcomes. Ordinary Least Squared, Fixed and Radom Effect Models and Generalised Method of Moment Instrumental Variables methodology is used on simple time series as well as panel datasets covering four provinces of Pakistan over the period from 1975 to 2009. The empirical results suggest a strong relationship between expenditure decentralisation and poverty – proxy alternatively by headcount poverty, poverty gap, severity of poverty and the human development index. Both rural and urban poverty reduction have statistically significant relationship with expenditure decentralisation. The results also reveal that decentralisation improves pro-poor <b>sectoral</b> outcomes of <b>education,</b> health and agriculture that consequently affect poverty. The last part illustrates the effectiveness of the devolution reforms by transferring fiscal, political and administrative authorities to local governments on certain social and economic sectors that are believed to be pro-poor. The evidence shows that the devolution significantly changes the size and magnitude of investment on many social and economic sectors. In all provinces, the investment increases in sectors such as education, healthcare, agriculture, water management, water supply and sanitation, rural development and the civil work. Since these services are strongly associated with local needs, it is reasonable to conclude that the devolution implicitly enhances the living standard of the local communities, especially the poor. ...|$|R
