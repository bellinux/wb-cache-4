5|$|The Comet's second fatal {{accident}} occurred on 2 May 1953, when BOAC Flight 783, a Comet 1, registered G-ALYV, crashed in a severe thundersquall six minutes after {{taking off from}} Calcutta-Dum Dum (now Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport), India, killing all 43 on board. Witnesses observed the wingless Comet on fire plunging into the village of Jagalgori, leading investigators to suspect <b>structural</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Witnesses to {{the crash}} were in {{universal}} agreement that the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found with the separated engine, other than its supporting pylon, leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free of the airframe and struck the engine. Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a <b>structural</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It {{was caused by a}} large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of <b>structural</b> <b>failure.</b> Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E

5000|$|The Board {{also had}} the {{following}} opinion on structural sufficiency:"During the first series of tests (July 21-24) the Huckins design (PT-69), the Philadelphia design (PT-8) and the Higgins design (PT-6) completed the open sea endurance run without structural damage. The Higgins 70 (British) boat did not complete this run because of engine trouble. The Higgins 76 (PT-70) and boats of the Elco 77 (PT-20 Class) developed <b>structural</b> <b>failures</b> even under moderate weather conditions prevailing. In the interval {{between the first and}} second test periods the PT-70 was repaired and an effort made to eliminate the causes of the <b>structural</b> <b>failures.</b> However, during the second endurance run, which was made in a very rough sea for this size boat, <b>structural</b> <b>failures</b> again occurred in PT-70. PT-69 and PT-21 experienced <b>structural</b> <b>failures</b> during the second run though these were much localized as compared with those found on PT70. The Board is of the opinion that certain changes in design are required to enable PT-69 and boats of the PT-20 Class to carry safely their military loads in rough weather." ...|$|R
5|$|After the crash, the North Tower burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M. Although {{the impact}} itself caused extensive structural damage, the long-lasting fire ignited by jet fuel was {{blamed for the}} <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> of the tower. In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed. Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an investment bank on floors 101–105 of the World Trade Center One, lost 658employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer.|$|E
5|$|Category4 hurricanes tend {{to produce}} more {{extensive}} curtainwall failures, with some complete <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for many weeks.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two {{intermediate}} stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> in the rudder and vertical stabilizer following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which found any evidence of a collision.|$|E

40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>failures</b> occur {{from time}} to time, {{as seen from the}} recent (January 2006) rash of roof collapses in Germany, Poland, and Russia. However, many {{engineering}} and engineering technology students are not made aware of these failures in their analysis or design courses. In the author’s structural analysis and design courses, students are required to research specific <b>structural</b> <b>failures,</b> and to report on these failures, detailing the causes of failure - illustrated with pictures and free-body diagrams, and any lessons learned. Articles on several <b>structural</b> <b>failures</b> are posted regularly on the course website to draw the students’ attention to these failures and their consequences, as well as any lessons learnt; discussions of these failures on the course website discussion forum is also strongly encouraged. Our hypothesis is that studying specific <b>structural</b> <b>failures</b> has a positive impact on students’ learning experiences. To verify this hypothesis, an end-of-term student survey was conducted in two structural design courses where failure case studies were used. Analysis of the survey results indicates a positive impact of failure case studies on students’ educational experiences and awareness of ethical issues. The use of failure case studies in more engineering technology courses is also recommended...|$|R
50|$|<b>Structural</b> {{integrity}} and <b>failure</b> is {{an aspect of}} engineering which deals with {{the ability of a}} structure to support a designed load (weight, force, etc...) without breaking, and includes the study of past <b>structural</b> <b>failures</b> in order to prevent failures in future designs.|$|R
5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered a <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> in flight {{that caused the}} tail section to shear off. Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two crewmen subsequently perished on the ground because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable to eject, died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered. This {{was one of several}} incidents caused by failure of the vertical stabilizer.|$|E
5|$|On 15May 1930, barely {{two weeks}} after delivery, one of the Bulldogs crashed due to <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> while {{performing}} an inverted loop; the pilot parachuted to safety, the first time an RAAF member had done so in an emergency. In September 1931, Fighter Squadron began flight testing the prototype Wackett Warrigal general-purpose biplane; testing was still under way when the aircraft's undercarriage collapsed during landing, putting off its service trials until the following January.|$|E
5|$|The mall {{was plagued}} by {{structural}} problems and leaks throughout its history. It underwent a partial <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> on June 23, 2012, when a 12m x 24m (39'-by-79') segment of the rooftop parking deck collapsed into the building, crashing through the upper level lottery kiosk adjacent to the food court and escalators to the ground floor below. More than 20 people received non-life-threatening injuries and two {{people died in the}} collapse. An investigation and class action lawsuits into the collapse are ongoing and the mall has been demolished.|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{crossed the}} Trinity River and dealt F1or greater damage to {{over a hundred}} homes in the {{adjacent}} subdivision. Some roofs sustained partial roof loss and many large trees either lost limbs or were toppled. At the intersection of West Sixth Street and University Drive, the tornado abruptly turned east from its initial southeast heading, bringing it over the Linwood subdivision at around 6:22p.m. CST (00:22UTC). The homes in the neighborhood were mostly small, wood-framed structures on pier or beam foundations, making them highly vulnerable to the tornadic winds and resulting in widespread <b>structural</b> <b>failure.</b> A {{survey conducted by the}} Wind Damage and Engineering Program at Texas Tech University later concluded that many of the buildings that suffered total <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> did so due to structural deficiencies rather than the strong winds associated with the tornado. The tornado then passed over a Montgomery Ward distribution center, causing roof damage to the complex and overturning numerous parked trucks; one person was killed while trying to reach shelter after a truck fell on them. Another person was killed after being struck by a collapsing brick wall. Together, these two fatalities represented the only deaths associated with the Fort Worth tornado and the overall tornado outbreak. Several nearby metal buildings were toppled before the tornado once again crossed the Trinity River, entering Fort Worth's central business district.|$|E
5|$|Three {{buildings}} in the World Trade Center collapsed due to fire-induced <b>structural</b> <b>failure.</b> The South Tower collapsed at 9:59a.m. after burning for 56minutes in a fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 and the explosion of its fuel. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28a.m. after burning for 102minutes. When the North Tower collapsed, debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building (7WTC), damaging it and starting fires. These fires burned for hours, compromising the building's structural integrity, and 7WTC collapsed at 5:21p.m. The {{west side of the}} Pentagon sustained significant damage.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe {{commenced}} seaplane operates to Værøy from 1965; {{five years}} later the first helicopter services were introduced. Planning of an airport started in the late 1960s, but unfavorable weather conditions prolonged finding a suitable location. The decision to build the airport was taken in 1984, construction began the following year and the airport opened on 1 June 1986. The fatal Widerøe Flight 839 accident took place on 12 April 1990, in which heavy wind caused <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> of a Twin Otter. The airport has been closed since; helicopter services commenced in 1993 and Værøy Heliport opened in 1997.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E
5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, Salvage Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> when the hull breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew {{along the main}} runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which the starboard wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} was 6.4 on {{the moment}} magnitude scale, {{with a maximum}} perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. However, most of the intensity measurements were consistent with an overall maximum intensity of VII (Very strong), and only the damage to a single structure, the Imperial County Services building in El Centro, was judged to be of intensity IX. Several comprehensive studies on the total <b>structural</b> <b>failure</b> of this building were conducted {{with a focus on}} how the building responded to the earthquake's vibration.

5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered <b>structural</b> <b>failure,</b> leading to roof collapses.|$|E
