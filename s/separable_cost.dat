30|$|In this paper, we {{model the}} problem of joint power control and {{beamforming}} in CR MIMO-BCs as a noncooperative game. Note that the noncooperative game theory for economists has been extensively investigated {{in terms of how}} rational players do not cooperate and interact in order to reach their goals. Lately, noncooperative game theory has also been widely applied to communications system. For example, in [27], joint Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) codeword and power adaptation was formulated as a separable game in MIMO CR networks, with two corresponding subgames, i.e., the power control subgame and the codeword control subgame, being played. Furthermore, we also formulate separable games 1 to solve {{the problem of}} joint power control and beamforming. Based on the proposed noncooperative separate game model, <b>separable</b> <b>cost</b> functions for beamforming and power control parameters are also derived, showing that these cost functions are convex. Furthermore, we use the convex theory of the noncooperative game to investigate the best response strategies as well as existence of the Nash equilibrium solutions. The best response strategies of users are then obtained by constrained minimization of the user cost function subject to constraints on user SINR and beamforming vector. The corresponding algorithm is derived using a game-theoretic approach in which <b>separable</b> <b>cost</b> functions with respect to beamforming and power are defined, such that joint beamforming and power adaptation is formulated as a separable game.|$|E

In this paper we show that for symmetric digraphs strong Hamiltonicity is a necessary condition for SC-Hamiltonicity. As a surprising consequence, we prove that the symmetric digraph obtained from an undirected SC-Hamiltonian graph by edge duplication need not be SC-Hamiltonian. This settles a conjecture of Kabadi and Punnen. We then show that an undirected graph on an even number of nodes having an edge that appears in every Hamiltonian cycle cannot be SC-Hamiltonian. Using this we establish that multiple subdivision of an edge need not preserve SC-Hamiltonicity, disproving a previous claim. Further, we identify other necessary conditions for SC-Hamiltonicity and obtain new classes of SC-Hamiltonian graphs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a machine-job assignment problem with <b>separable</b> convex <b>cost.</b> A {{major source of}} difficulty with solving the problem using relaxation methods is that optimal solutions to its continuous relaxations are highly fractional as they are typically found {{in the interior of}} the relaxation due to the convex cost function. Here we give a polynomial-size conic quadratic reformulation of the problem so as to strengthen the bounds from its continuous relaxation. Of particular interest, we prove that the conic strengthening avoids all non-extreme solutions of the initial polyhedral relaxation; thus, it eliminates the source of difficulty of having a convex cost function. This property is important not only for improving the bounds, but also for making polyhedral inequalities that cut off fractional extreme points of the initial relaxation applicable. The results in the paper are sufficiently general so that they can also be applied to other mixed 0 - 1 optimization problems with <b>separable</b> convex <b>cost</b> functions. Our computational results on the machine-job assignment problem with controllable processing times demonstrate that the proposed conic reformulation is very effective for solving the problem to optimality...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of minimizing a strictly convex, possibly nondifferentiable cost subject to linear inequality constraints. We consider a dual coordinate ascent method that uses inexact line search and essentially cyclic order of coordinate relaxation. We show, under very weak conditions, that this method generates a sequence of primal vectors converging to the optimal primal solution. Under an additional regularity assumption, and assuming {{the domain of the}} cost function is polyhedral, we show that a related sequence of dual vectors converges in cost to the optimal cost. Alternately, we show that if the constraint set has an interior point in the domain of the cost function then this sequence of dual vectors is bounded and each of its limit point(s) is an optimal dual solution. We also show, for the special case where the cost function is strongly convex, that the order in which the coordinates are relaxed may become gradually asynchronous.

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a game-theoretic {{approach}} {{for the purpose of}} deriving the problem of joint beamforming and power control in cognitive radio (CR) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels (CR MIMO-BCs), where the primary users (PUs) coexist with the secondary users (SUs) and they share the same spectrum. The cognitive base station (CBS), which is equipped with multiple antennas, is capable of transmitting data to the SU’s multiple-antenna receiver by employing the technology of beamforming. The proposed approach is an application of separable games, which are formally stated by the subgames of beamforming and power control. Furthermore, based on the model of noncooperative separate games, <b>separable</b> <b>cost</b> functions for the parameters of beamforming and power control are also proposed, showing that these cost functions are convex. Therefore, the convex theory of a noncooperative game can be employed to investigate the best response strategies as well as existence of Nash equilibrium solutions.

Numerical results verify both the convergence and the tracking properties of the proposed algorithm for variant scenarios.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two {{distributed}} algorithms to compute an equilibrium, that is optimal {{with respect to}} strictly convex and <b>separable</b> <b>cost</b> functions, for controlled traffic flow dynamics over networks under constant exogenous inflows. The dynamics is modeled in continuous time by the Cell Transmission Model and a non-FIFO Dynamic Network Loading Model, with traffic control. The two algorithms are adaptations of the alternating direct method of multipliers (ADMM) and the accelerated dual descent (ADD) method from network flow optimization literature. When the demand and supply inequality constraints in the uncontrolled dynamics are relaxed to be independent over links, the resulting feasible set is convex if the demand and supply functions are concave, thereby imparting convexity to the optimal equilibrium selection problem. Each point in the feasible set is an equilibrium for the original dynamics under appropriately designed control. For the ADMM method, explicit expressions for the primal update show that no auxiliary variables are necessary. Convergence analysis for the primal variables is also provided. The standard ADD method is extended to also incorporate non-negativity constraints on the density and flow variables, and demand and supply inequality constraints.

The presented algorithm uses only local and neighbourhood communication to simultaneously find the mismatch between power generation, line loss and loads, to calculate nodal voltages, and to minimize distributed costs, leading to a completely distributed solution of the global problem.
