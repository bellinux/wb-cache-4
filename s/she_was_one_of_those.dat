500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Windsor based Peggy on Violet Kray, mother of the infamous East End gangsters, the Kray twins; however Windsor has denied this. Instead, she claims that Peggy is based on women she has seen in East End pubs and her own mother: [...] "women whose hair is great and their outfits are more Walthamstow market, they get it wrong slightly...Some things I've done with Peggy is from my Mum. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> East End snobs.

[...] In a 2009 radio {{interview}} with Dale Winton, Windsor said three people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor Mike Reid, who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.|$|E

As he passed out, several well-dressed girls patted his shoulder, while one ran her fingers through his hair".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often-cited parts of Anatoly Kuznetsov's {{documentary}} novel [...] is the testimony of Dina Pronicheva, an actress of the Kiev Puppet Theatre, and a survivor. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> ordered to march to the ravine, {{to be forced to}} undress and then be shot. Jumping before being shot and falling on other bodies, she played dead in a pile of corpses. She held perfectly still while the Nazis continued to shoot the wounded or gasping victims. Although the SS had covered the mass grave with earth, she eventually managed to climb through the soil and escape. Since it was dark, she had to avoid the torches of the Nazis finishing off the remaining victims still alive, wounded and gasping in the grave. She was {{one of the very few}} survivors of the massacre and later related her horrifying story to Kuznetsov. At least 29 survivors are known.|$|E

[...] "Some of the songs have a definite sort of ambient quality to them," [...] said producer Jimmy Jam. Jam added [...] "There's some house stuff, which there always is [...]" [...] "There {{is going to be}} some more guitar-flavored things" [...] "happy up-tempo songs, the very funky tunes, the very sensual, sexy ballads." [...] Dallas Austin considered it [...] "easily the most sexy thing she's done." [...] "To me, this is her Dirty Mind," [...] Austin explained. [...] "It's a really sexy record, but not in a sensual way. It's bold, it's fun, it's really positive. Nobody's sad, nobody's mad. It's just really fun songs where she happens to be talking frankly about sex." [...] The sensual direction originated from the aura Jackson exuded to Austin while recording. [...] "Guys won't {{know what to do with}} themselves after this," [...] said Austin, laughing at the prospect. [...] "It's one of the best records she's made."
