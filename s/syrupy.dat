5|$|The episode {{featured}} the penultimate {{appearance of the}} alien black oil; it would appear for a final time via flashback in the series' finale. Visual effects for the black oil were created with molasses, chocolate syrup, and computer-generated imagery (CGI). A scene showing black oil {{coming out of a}} worker's eyes, ears, and mouth was mostly filmed on a visual effects stage. Nine takes were needed to get the <b>syrupy</b> mixture to spill correctly.|$|E

25|$|The Cape cobra is {{regarded}} as one of the most dangerous species of cobra in all of Africa, by virtue of its potent venom and frequent occurrence around houses.

25|$|The {{most common}} source of phosphoric acid is an 85% aqueous solution; such {{solutions}} are colourless, odourless, and non-volatile. The 85% solution is a <b>syrupy</b> liquid, but still pourable. Although phosphoric acid {{does not meet}} the strict definition of a strong acid, the 85% solution is acidic enough to be corrosive. Because of the high percentage of phosphoric acid in this reagent, {{at least some of the}} orthophosphoric acid is condensed into polyphosphoric acids; for the sake of labeling and simplicity, the 85% represents H3PO4 as if it were all in the ortho form. Dilute aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid exist in the ortho form.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 TCB, a band {{based in}} the Washington area, created a spinoff sound from go-go called bounce beat. Bounce beat is a heavier version of its {{ancestor}} that relies on timbales, drums, keyboards and bass to form its signature sound. At a time when bands like Backyard, UnCalled 4, and Raw Image were moving the genre toward a more driving sound by using a more forceful “breakdown” beat, bounce beat seems, in retrospect, like a natural progression. Still, the music was initially dismissed by all but a core of believers. It took fans time to realize TCB’s innovation wasn’t a rejection of “traditional” go-go, but a shift. Instead of paying homage to the genre’s early greats by copying their style, bounce beat built on a strong foundation and showed that the music still had more ideas to explore, limited only by percussive innovation and imagination. Fans of bounce beat, like the sound itself, tend to be much younger than the traditional go-go crowd. The rototom-dependent subgenre was initially maligned—some called it “noise,” others argued that it wasn’t go-go at all. Criticism of bounce beat was similar to what was said about the trap rap bubbling in other cities around the same time: It was blasted for its sometimes suggestive lyrics, its thwacking beat, its tempos that vacillated between <b>syrupy</b> and frenetic. But over time, bounce beat made inroads.|$|E
500|$|Although Shields feared a {{critical}} panning, reviews of Loveless were almost unanimously favourable. [...] "An album without parallel", wrote Andrew Perry in Select. [...] "Its creative inspiration defies belief. Though 'To Here Knows When' is pretty well the weirdest {{track of the}} eleven, that glorious distortion gives a fair signal of what to expect – the unexpected. Everything you hear confounds your idea of how a pop song should be played, arranged and produced." [...] "The instrumental 'Touched' is especially startling", noted Martin Aston in Q, [...] "like a drunken fight between a <b>syrupy</b> Disney soundtrack and an Eastern mantra. All in all, Loveless amounts to a virtual reinvention of the guitar." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Moaning Lisa" [...] finished 34th {{place in the}} weekly ratings for the week of February 5–11, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 13.8. It was the highest rated show on the Fox Network that week. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "Certain scenes of this, the most <b>syrupy</b> of Simpsons episodes, sent viewers raised on the later seasons scurrying to the bathroom. Yes, the final moments may give you goosepimples, and are {{a world away from}} the anti-schmaltz normally associated with the series, but there is still much to recommend here. In fact, the Homer–Bart subplot is more successful than the main storyline; Homer's nightmare about their relationship is genuinely disturbing." ...|$|E
500|$|Leslie Uggams {{said that}} she was in the film in July 2015, portraying Blind Al. Tim Miller stated that Jed Rees portrays [...] "The Recruiter", and [...] "did a good job of being creepy and <b>syrupy</b> sweet." [...] Miller {{explained}} that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film because, as a fan of the character, he had never felt that Cudmore's version was accurate to the comics and wanted to show the character as [...] "this monstrous guy". Andre Tricoteux had been cast in the role, providing motion reference on set and the voice. In December, the voice of Colossus was revealed to have been recast, with Stefan Kapičić taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the album}} was a success at {{establishing}} the Doors in the pop market, it {{was rejected by the}} group's original audience and the underground scene, particularly for the album's use of horns and strings. The underground press was less than complimentary, with David Walkey, writing in New York's East Village Other, stating {{the album was}} [...] "badly messed up by the <b>syrupy</b> arrangement of Paul Rothchild and could be renamed, 'The Rothchild Strings Play the Doors'". Another scathing review by Miller Francis Jr. of The Great Speckled Bird expressed disdain for the Doors' attempt at art rock, feeling The Soft Parade [...] "comes on so pretentious, like something written rather than something sung". Rob Cline of Northwest Passage questioned why a band like the Doors needed to record with violins and trombones when the group was [...] "best when getting it on straight and hard as witness to their first two albums".|$|E
500|$|On {{the review}} of album, an editor for Billboard {{magazine}} wrote that [...] "listener will enjoy while listening to" [...] the song. David Browne, writing for Entertainment Weekly provided an ironic review, commenting that Fonsi has [...] "a nice voice, but he didn't get in [...] way." [...] Orlando Sentinel editor Perry Gettelman was not impressed along with [...] "El Beso del Final" [...] and [...] "Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti", writing that [...] "She seems equally fond of acrobatic trills and low, sex-kittenish moans" [...] which Parry referred to them as [...] "ballands". Kurt B. Reighley Wall of Sound called [...] "Si No Te Hubiera Conocido" [...] a [...] "sweet, <b>syrupy</b> duet" [...] and stated that it [...] "starts out charming enough but eventually devolves into the International Shouting Contest." [...] In the United States, [...] "Si No Te Hubiera Conoci" [...] peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs and 22 on the Latin Pop Songs charts.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic editor Andre Barnes {{views the}} mixtape's music as {{distinct}} from East Coast hip hop, calling it [...] "sonically out of place, recasting the feel of East Coast hip-hop into a quintessential, albeit progressive southern aesthetic with its country funk and cosmic, <b>syrupy</b> backdrops." [...] Jon Caramanica calls Live. Love. ASAP [...] "placeless and universal, an album that sounds {{as if it has}} ingested the last 20 years of hip-hop’s travels and would be comfortable anywhere." [...] Caramanica notes characteristics of various hip hop scenes other than that of New York's scene, including [...] "chewy, slowed-down homages to Houston" [...] and [...] "nods to New Orleans and Atlanta and the Bay Area and everywhere else hip-hop is made." [...] Alvin Aqua Blanco of HipHopDX writes that the music's grooves [...] "generally stay on the DJ Screw side of the BPMs". Consequence of Sound editor Mike Madden notes its musical dynamic as [...] "Southern flavors crossbreed with plenty of cloudy ambient-rap moments" [...] and views that the cadences of the beats consequently [...] "dictate" [...] ASAP Rocky's rapping style.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Kenneth E. Rathburn of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "Both {{versions}} of 'God Help the Outcasts' offer {{a level of}} mid-road quality {{that came to be}} expected after the Disney Renaissance," [...] writing of Mollenhauer's, [...] "The film version seems to limp around a bit while delivering more of that emotional punch needed as we transition to the second act," [...] while Midler's [...] "has that credits vibe we all know and love from Disney films" [...] which [...] "keeps us sticking around when we'd otherwise abandon the theater." [...] However, Rathburn concluded, [...] "said version is a little detached for the sake of thematic relevance." [...] Jack Smith of BBC Online gave the song a very unfavorable review, writing, [...] "The sentiments of 'God Help The Outcasts' ... are spoiled by <b>syrupy</b> production," [...] describing Midler's rendition as [...] "overwrought." [...] Plugged In observed, [...] "One heartwarming scene finds Esmeralda praying selflessly on behalf of the world's outcasts." [...] However, [...] "such moments are overshadowed by simmering passions, a shapely heroine and dark elements likely to upset." ...|$|E
500|$|... "She" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Pitchforks Scott Plagenhoef commented that while Goblin [...] "could have used an editor", [...] "the highs are very high: [...] "She" [...] work as standalones {{away from the}} album as a whole." [...] Source writer Kazeem commented [...] "Tyler links up with fellow breakout star of the OFWGKTA, Frank Ocean, where the in demand crooner spits a couple of better-than-it has-any-right-being 16 bars, while seamlessly weaving into a haunting hook." [...] Craig Jenkin's Prefix magazine mused that the [...] "jazzy chord progression and <b>syrupy</b> vocals from Odd Future associate Frank Ocean sneakily conceal its stalker vibe and crass lyrical conceit." [...] AbsolutePunks Ian Walker praised Ocean on the track, writing: [...] "his verse and chorus showcase both sides of his expertise, as he can write both hip-hop and R influenced vocals with ease. While “She” tends {{to get lost in}} the midst of heavier tracks like “Yonkers” and “Transylvania,” it deserves a ton of recognition for leaning a bit more towards a mainstream sound Odd Future isn't known for while staying true to their original vision." ...|$|E
500|$|Fever {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Fever received an average score of 68 based on 15 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". Jason Thompson from PopMatters gave the album an extremely positive review and praised the conception {{and production of}} the album, calling it a [...] "perfect album of gorgeous dance music" [...] and claiming that [...] "there probably won't be a better album like it all year long". Chris True from AllMusic also gave it an acclaimed review and enjoyed the simple disco and dancepop music of the album, {{saying that there is}} [...] "not one weak track, not one misplaced <b>syrupy</b> ballad to ruin the groove". Alex Needham from NME positively reviewed the album and noted that while the album lacks depth, it is [...] "as effervescent as a foot spa" [...] and that through the album, Minogue [...] "shows the upstarts how it's done". Dominique Leone from Pitchfork Media gave it a favourable review and praised its simple and [...] "comfortable" [...] composition, terming it a [...] "mature sound from a mature artist, and one that may very well re-establish Minogue for the VH1 generation".|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{explained}} in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her {{at the time was}} [...] "Unleashed". She described the episode's production, [...] "The props people had these big buckets of earth worms, but they were thicker and meatier and longer. They had teeny little bitty faces... So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, <b>syrupy</b> stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun. The guy was such a trooper." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{reviewing}} [...] "Ensign Ro" [...] for Tor.com, DeCandido described Michelle Forbes as [...] "stellar" [...] {{and called}} Ro [...] "one of TNGs best recurring characters". He also {{added that the}} character was [...] "a bit of piss and vinegar {{to add to the}} <b>syrupy</b> mix of homogeneity that the TNG cast tends to be". In his review of [...] "Preemptive Strike", he said that the Ro character arc [...] "comes full circle: once again making a decision that puts her on the outs with Starfleet." [...] He praised Forbes again, saying that she [...] "inhabits the character so completely, from her awkwardness at the reception in her honor to her playing the role of rebel, to her pain at thinking about her father... to her decision to betray Starfleet and the Enterprise." [...] He did criticise the episode for not wrapping up the Riker-Ro relationship {{in the same way that}} closure had been given to her friendship with Picard. Zack Handlen reviewed [...] "Ensign Ro" [...] for The A.V. Club, and described Ro as [...] "terrific" [...] and said that the role represented [...] "one of the rare times that TNG has managed to have a frustrated character who doesn't immediately seem overly hateful or falsely confrontational". But he criticized the manner in which her opinion changed to be more favourable of Picard and the Enterprise, as he felt that Guinan's intervention was detrimental to the plot.|$|E
500|$|Blogger Andrew Nosnitsky of hip hop blog Cocaine Blunts wrote, [...] "while it's a very {{personal}} and honest affair there's also something, well, not quite good about it. The early buzz about B {{was that he was}} making outsider art and England is probably the closest he comes to that standard. He has ideas about what the creation of spoken word poetry and ambient music entails but it's quite clear he hasn’t taken a ton of time to study those forms." [...] David Morris of Tiny Mix Tapes said that although the album is [...] "conceptually daring" [...] and a showcase for Lil B's [...] "poetic, philosophical streak", he called the musical backing [...] "utter garbage" [...] and [...] "pure, unstructured noodling". Morris blamed what he saw as a misguided effort to be [...] "left-field and trendy" [...] on Lil B's internet hype and coverage in the indie rock press. The Quietus praised the album as [...] "baffling, flawed but utterly engrossing", and said Lil B's flow is [...] "more measured but no less dexterous than his contemporaries, and the pace of his eloquent, brooding verses lend themselves well to the alien, frosted glass synth sounds and <b>syrupy</b> electronics that form the majority of the backing tracks here. Rain In England comes across like the work of some rap savant, a man whose inner filter has been disabled, creating something which may polarise but which is, at least, utterly distinctive." [...] Daniel Levin Becker wrote in Dusted that, despite its unconventionality, the album is [...] "irredeemably bad".|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Life Is People received an average score of 86, based on 21reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek stated that [...] "Fay performs these songs {{as if they}} were living things, independent of his inner world. His reverence for them makes the listening experience one of great emotional depth. Life Is People brims with compassion, vulnerability, and tenderness. It is not a comeback record but a late continuation, a great work of art." [...] Drew Litowitz of Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "little has changed. Fay's songs sound as if they've simply been hanging out in the ether for all these years, just waiting to be put to tape...Life Is People makes a strong argument for why Fay deserves recognition, and not just by those in the know." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick called the album a [...] "belated triumph" [...] which [...] "unfolds with the assurance of an old master still burning with the desire to tell his tales", saying that it was [...] "so much stronger than the latter-day works of many of Fay's contemporaries." [...] Critic Tom Hughes of The Guardian was less complimentary, noting that the album was [...] "not without a few <b>syrupy</b> moments, {{and it would be a}} push to recommend it over the old records" [...] but concluded that [...] "there are some fine songs here." [...] Andy Gill, writing for The Independent, said that [...] "Fay has finally created the masterpiece that will secure his reputation" [...] and added that Life is People was [...] "truly, the album of a lifetime." ...|$|E
500|$|Tender Mercies {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Richard Corliss of Time {{declared it}} the [...] "best American {{movie of the}} new year". Carol Olten of The San Diego Union-Tribune declared Tender Mercies the best movie of 1983, and [...] "the most poignant, but forthright, film of the year, with a brilliant performance by Robert Duvall". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals {{with all of these}} things in equal measure. Still, the absence of a single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively {{small price to pay for}} the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined." [...] She also praised Beresford's direction, which she said lent the movie a light touch. The Times Canby wrote, [...] "In all respects Tender Mercies is so good that it has the effect of rediscovering a kind of film fiction that has been debased over the decades by hack moviemakers, working according to accepted formulas, frequently to the applause of the critics as well as the public." [...] Leonard Maltin gave it three out of four stars, applauding Duvall in particular and describing it as a [...] "winning but extremely low-key film", though he characterized Foote's screenplay as [...] "not so much a story as a series of vignettes". David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor praised the film for its values, for underscoring the good in people and for avoiding flashiness and quick cuts in favor of a subtle and deliberately paced story, while maintaining a PG rating and omitting sex, drugs and violence. He also felt, however, that it tended toward melodrama on a few occasions and that the soundtrack had [...] "a bit of <b>syrupy</b> music ... especially at the end".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite a [...] "potentially gimmicky tone", the episode provided [...] "a {{lot of fun}} moments along with a little emotional content as well. The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly, and that occurred here; it avoided becoming too <b>syrupy</b> and featured just enough emotion to make an impact. It also contained some great bits, like Bart and Lisa’s karaoke performance of the 'Theme from Shaft'. It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess's [...] "This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but {{soon it will be}} hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Again, a playful dig at racial stereotypes. Homer comes over as a reasonable man who wants to live his last day in style, and the closing twist is easily as good as the farewells leading up to it." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said that the episode is [...] "rich with sentimentality and Homer's expression of love for his family as he fears that his time is up." [...] He also commented that while all of the chalkboard gags on the show are [...] "funny", this episode [...] "features a true gem" [...] as Bart writes [...] "I will not cut corners" [...] once and then puts ditto marks below. Ed Potton of The Times wrote: [...] "The writers offer black humour by the bucketload, but the grim reality of Homer's fate is never in doubt; his eventual collapse is deeply affecting. A great example of [...] fierce satire being offset by a potent emotional core." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said {{the first half of the}} episode has [...] "fun skewering Japanese restaurants and such, while the second half is reasonably successful at emphasizing character while sustaining the comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of everything in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being <b>syrupy,</b> while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E

2500|$|In Indonesian cuisine, {{which is}} similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to {{fermented}} savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally [...] "sweet kecap" [...] in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over medium heat until rather <b>syrupy.</b> A third type, kecap ikan, meaning [...] "fish kecap" [...] is fish sauce similar to the Thai nam pla or the Philippine patis.

But no scientific discovery has proved so ripe for spiritual projection as the theories of quantum physics, replete with their quixotic qualities of uncertainty, simultaneity and parallelism." [...] Wertheim continues that the movie [...] "abandons itself entirely to the ecstasies of quantum mysticism, finding in this aleatory description of nature the key to spiritual transformation. As one of the film’s characters gushes early in the proceedings, 'The moment we acknowledge the quantum self, we say that somebody has become enlightened'.

Robert Rodriguez describes it as [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "a rather <b>syrupy</b> lounge band impression", redeemed by [...] "one of [...] sharper post-Beatles solos". Among Harrison biographers, the song is similarly dismissed for its obvious show tune qualities, Elliot Huntley describing it as [...] "syrupy", while Simon Leng views the composition as a [...] "corny effort" [...] that [...] "trades on Starr's chummy stage persona" [...] and pales alongside the [...] "effortless pop craft" [...] of [...] "Photograph". Leng concludes of [...] "You and Me (Babe)": [...] "Here Harrison was writing with a specific singer in mind, and the song reveals nothing other than his ability to write to order." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inedible or rarely eaten {{parts of}} the garlic plant include the [...] "skin" [...] {{covering}} each clove and root cluster. The papery, protective layers of [...] "skin" [...] over various {{parts of the}} plant are generally discarded during preparation for most culinary uses, though in Korea immature whole heads are sometimes prepared with the tender skins intact. The root cluster attached to the basal plate of the bulb is the only part not typically considered palatable in any form. An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling olive oil (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and roast them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove.

2500|$|The series employs {{various degrees}} of safety or courtesy-related censorship. Vulgar {{language}} is censored, as the show is considered family-friendly and most such language occurs incidentally when the team is surprised or overexcited; at other times there is a deliberate effort to keep the language clean. In addition to the standard bleep, the show often uses a relevant or humorous sound effect. Euphemisms and scientific terminology are used for potentially offensive terms. In the [...] "Peeing on the Third Rail" [...] myth, the show censored the valve used to release urine from the dummy. The names of ingredients used {{in the production of}} hazardous materials and some explosives are usually censored to prevent amateurs from recreating potentially dangerous substances. For example, in the [...] "Hindenburg" [...] special, Savage ignited thermite with a hypergolic mixture of [...] "blur" [...] (a <b>syrupy,</b> pale blue liquid) and [...] "blur" [...] (a dark powder). In a Civil War-themed episode, the ingredients for making a form of homemade black powder were censored in similar fashion.|$|E
2500|$|Candy {{pumpkins}} {{are made}} using {{a similar process}} to make candy corn. The candy corn process and product were created by Géorge Renninger of the Wunderlee Candy Co. in the 1880s and became popular as a treat in the 1920s. Candy pumpkins first were produced in mid 20th century using a process {{similar to that of}} candy corn. Corn syrup, food coloring, honey, and sugar are beaten and heated in large kettles to produce an ultra-sweet syrup. This <b>syrupy</b> mix generically is called [...] "mellowcreme" [...] by confectioners, since the resulting candy has a mellow, creamy texture. The mellowcreme slurry then was divided into two uneven amounts, with the large amount receiving orange food coloring and the smaller receiving green food coloring. A mogul machine brings the two colored mixtures together into a mold made of cornstarch, and the assembly is sent to a separate drying room to dry for 24 to 36 hours. Once dry, the candy is shaken violently to remove excess cornstarch and a final glaze is added to give the candy pumpkin a sheen. Candy pumpkins, acorns and other shapes that are derived from the mellowcreme mixture are often sold with candy corn under the name [...] "harvest mix." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many were {{critical}} about Duffy's {{voice on the}} record. John Bush of Allmusic said that [...] "Duffy's voice [...] has not improved with age, or simply isn't portrayed well here." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that it is [...] "clearly not her most potent weapon", criticising her choice to [...] "build an album out of it." [...] Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine said that [...] "the bigger problem with Endlessly is that Duffy compensates for her lack of a star persona by overdrawing her <b>syrupy</b> rasp, already noted for its acquired tastiness, into a cartoonish oddity." [...] Spin noted that ultimately, it's the vocals that carry Endlessly. There's no whitewashing of the singer's eccentricities, which feel more pronounced here—she can be gruffly nasal (the oft-repeated chorus of [...] "Well, Well, Well" [...] never stops sounding like [...] "whale, whale, whale") while remaining wholly beguiling." [...] However, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly and Will Dean of The Guardian were more complementary, with Dean calling it [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "sweet" [...] and Rosen applauding it for being [...] "smoky and touched with grit."
