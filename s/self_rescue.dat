50|$|As {{the sport}} of canyoneering begins to grow, {{there are more and}} more people looking to learn the skills needed to safely descend canyons. There are several reputable {{organizations}} that are now offering classes of various forms to the public. Most programs have three or four levels of skills. The first level usually is basic rappelling, rope work, navigation, identification of gear and clothing, and basic rappel setups. The second level deals with anchor building and strategies on how to descend various types of canyons. The third level deals with <b>rescue</b> situations, both <b>self</b> <b>rescues</b> and how to rescue others along with wilderness first aid. An optional course often deals with swift water canyons which entails very different techniques to descend canyons that are flowing with swift water.|$|R
50|$|The Vanguard 15 is {{a popular}} one design racing dinghy {{designed}} by Bob Ames. It is a double-handed (two person) monohull sailboat with a sloop rig (one headsail one main sail). Ideally the combined weight of the crew is between 270 lb and 340 lb and both members hike off the boat to keep it flat. Its revolutionary design allows it to plane while sailing upwind in 12 kn of breeze or more. Another of the design features of the boat is to be self bailing or <b>self</b> <b>rescuing</b> meaning that if the shallow cockpit of the boat takes on water, large drains in {{the stern of the}} boat will allow the water to drain via gravity and with no effort by the crew or need for the boat to be moving to drain.|$|R

40|$|The common key intuition {{that freedom}} {{is to do}} what you want to do is very {{attractive}} to compatibilistic accounts of freedom. And as a matter of fact this key intuition has been adopted by most compatibilists from Hobbes till now. Unfortunately, it suffers from serious problems. However, thanks to the real self account of freedom – which is a recent compatibilistic theory developed by Harry G. Frankfurt and refined and extended by various philosophers, most notably (perhaps) by Gary Watson – the key intuition is revived. Or what? In this paper I argue (A) that the real <b>self</b> account's <b>rescue</b> of the key intuition does not succeed because (i) Frankfurt's and Watson's versions of the real self account of freedom are flawed and because (ii) the real self account as such is flawed as well. Furthermore I will argue (B) that the key intuition is not to be rescued by any means whatsoever...|$|R

5000|$|Lex Luthor {{appears in}} JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. In this version, Luthor is based off his [...] "Challenge of the Super Friends" [...] self, leading a smaller {{version of the}} Legion of Doom (Giganta, Sinestro, Riddler and Scarecrow {{are not part of}} the group). He {{attempts}} to reverse Global Warming by inducing ice to grow in the Arctic, thanks to Captain Cold's satellite, in order to lower the level of the world's oceans; with the decrease in water, the world would have to submit to the Legion's rule to get more. Unfortunately, Captain Cold loses his temper when the Super Friends attack the satellite and causes the machine to overload and send down too much power to the Arctic; as a result, Lex becomes trapped in ice. In the 32nd century, Luther is revealed to have been found 500 years earlier and put in a museum dedicated to the Super Friends by the Legion of Super Heroes. Unfortunately, Karate Kid accidentally frees Luthor by hitting the ice's weak point. Lex finds a mystical hourglass that contains a malevolent time entity named Time Trapper; Lex uses him to travel back to his home era. However, after an attempt to prevent Superman from staying on Earth as a baby fails, Lex's past <b>self</b> is <b>rescued</b> by the Super Friends, causing the entire timeline to become moot.|$|R

40|$|The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act of 2006 {{implemented}} {{new regulations}} {{in the underground}} coal mining industry that allow for the certification of non-compressed gas equipment for respiratory protection in underground coal mines. NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Biomedical Research and Engineering Laboratory (BRL) is investigating the potential to expand cryogenic air supply systems into the mining and general industries. These investigations have, so far, resulted in four separate comparison and hardware development programs. The Propellant Handlers Ensemble (PHE) and Level “A” Ensemble Comparison (LAE) : This study compared worker thermal stress while using the industry standard Level A hazardous material handling ensemble as opposed to using the similarly protective Propellant Handler’s Ensemble (PHE) that utilizes a cryogenic air supply pack, known as an Environmental Control Unit (ECU) {{as opposed to the}} compressed air Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) used in the LAE. The research found that, in a 102 °F environment, test subjects experienced significantly decreased body temperature increases, significantly decreased heart rate increases, and decreased sweat loss while performing a standard work routine while using the PHE, compared to the same test subjects performing the same routine while using the LAE. The Cryogenic Refuge Alternative Supply System (CryoRASS) project: The MINER Act of 2006 requires the operators of underground coal mines to provide refuge alternatives that can provide a safe atmosphere for workers for up to 96 hours {{in the event of a}} mine emergency. The CryoRASS project retrofitted an existing refuge chamber with a liquid air supply instead of the standard compressed air supply system and performed a 96 hour test. The CryoRASS system demonstrated that it provided a larger air supply in a significantly smaller footprint area, provided humidity and temperature control, and maintained acceptable oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the chamber for the required amount of time. SCBA and Mine Rescue System (CryoBA/CryoASFS) Another requirement of the MINER Act is that additional emergency breathing equipment must be staged along evacuation routes to supplement the <b>Self</b> Contained/Self <b>Rescue</b> (SCSR) devices that are now required. The BRL has developed an SCBA known as the Cryogenic Breathing Apparatus (CryoBA), that has the ability to provide 2 hours of breathing air, a refill capability, and some cooling for the user. Cryogenic Air Storage and Filling Stations (CryoASFS) would be positioned in critical areas to extend evacuation time. The CryoASFS stations have a significantly smaller footprint and larger air storage capacity to similar compressed air systems. The CryoBA pack is currently undergoing NIOSH certification testing. Technical challenges associated with liquid breathing air systems: Research done by the BRL has also addressed three major technical challenges involved with the widespread use of liquid breathing air. The BRL developed a storage Dewar fitted with a Cryorefrigerator that has stored liquid air for four months with no appreciable oxygen enrichment due to differential evaporation. Testing of liquid breathing air was material and time intensive. A BRL contract developed a system that only required 1 liter of air and five minutes of time compared to the 10 liters of air and 75 minutes of time required by the old method. The BRL also developed a simple and cost effective method of manufacturing liquid air that joins a liquid oxygen tanker with a liquid nitrogen tanker through an orifice controlled “Y” fitting, mixing the two components, and depositing the mixed breathing air in a separate tanker...|$|R

50|$|The Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) is {{a smaller}} {{backpack}} propulsion system {{intended as a}} safety device during space walks. It contains 1.4 kg of gaseous nitrogen, which provides much less delta-v capability than the MMU, roughly 10 feet per second (3 meters per second). However SAFER is less complex, less expensive and simpler to use than the MMU, and the limited delta-v is sufficient for the intended rescue-only task.

It is also possible to travel by snowmobile from Redditt to Manitoba, and to Woodland Caribou Provincial Park. The trails to Manitoba are fairly well maintained, and appropriate for operators of average ability. The trails to Woodland Caribou Provincial Park are single track, rugged, and extremely challenging, with many unpredictable water crossings and are therefore only appropriate for very experienced operators.

50|$|SAFER is {{designed}} {{to be used as a}} self-rescue device if in spite of precautions such as tethers, safety grips, and the robot arm an EVA crewmember gets separated and no vehicles can provide rescue capability. SAFER is worn by every ISS crewmember using an Extravehicular Mobility Unit. SAFER was co invented by former astronaut Joseph Kerwin, Paul Cottingham and Ted Christian under a Lockheed contract to NASA for Space Station Freedom. It was later sponsored by the Space Shuttle Program and developed by Lockheed and NASA personnel. Ralph Anderson was the Shuttle Program Office's Project Manager for the SAFER Development Test Objective (DTO). Cliff Hess was the NASA Project Engineer. The device was developed by the Robotics Division (with its Lockheed staff) of NASA at the Johnson Space Center. The SAFER was the design solution to the Shuttle Program's requirement to provide a means of <b>self</b> <b>rescue</b> should an EVA crewmember become untethered during an EVA.|$|E
50|$|DIR proponents {{consider}} that rescue skills and training {{are necessary for}} all levels of diver, not only to perform a rescue in an emergency, {{but also because the}} training and skills are likely {{to reduce the risk of}} an emergency developing in the first place. Most emergencies are the result of bad planning, inadequate skills and lack of awareness culminating in a situation beyond the control of the diver. <b>Self</b> <b>rescue</b> occurs when the diver pre-empts the development of the emergency by recognising the early stages and taking appropriate action. This is facilitated by the same training appropriate to rescue of another diver. The second way of preventing an emergency is monitoring by an aware and alert buddy, who may pick up signs of impending problems by situational awareness and skilled observation, one of the advantages of the unified team concept and effective communications within the team. Actual rescue, though desirable when necessary, often indicates a failure to manage minor problems and a lack of attention to signs of stress buildup. However, there are also occasions when things do go wrong in spite of good planning and procedures—and good training and well honed skills contribute to a successful rescue effort, rather than a double fatality.|$|E
