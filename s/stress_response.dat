5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a <b>stress</b> <b>response.</b> The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher <b>stress</b> <b>response</b> to environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a <b>stress</b> <b>response</b> that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} about the influence of modus vivendi on <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> and scholastic attainments. 586 grade school students were asked by questionnaire. The first graders and the second graders were answered about modus vivendi. Third, fourth, fifth, and sixth graders did about modus vivendi and <b>stress</b> <b>responses.</b> Scholastic attainments of fourth graders were used for analysis. The following results were obtained: modus vivendi consists of three sub concepts; regular life, tooth brushing and facial cleansing, and guidance before going out. <b>Stress</b> <b>responses</b> consist of two sub concepts; low concentration and aggression. Differences in grades and sex were partially confirmed. The relations between the modus vivendi, <b>stress</b> <b>responses,</b> and scholastic attainments were partially shown. In conclusion, the guidance of the modus vivendi to the grade school student might decrease <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> and improve scholastic attainments. 本研究は 586 名の小学生を対象とした調査から、生活態度と不安・ストレス反応、学力の実態を把握し、これらの関連から、生活態度への指導が不安・ストレス反応と学力に与える影響を検討することを目的としたものである。分析の結果、生活態度は生活リズム、歯磨き・洗顔、家を出る前の指導という 3 つの下位概念からなっていること、不安・ストレス反応は集中力の低さ、攻撃性という 2 つの下位概念からなっていることが明らかにされた。生活態度と不安・ストレス反応については部分的に学年差と性差が確認された。生活態度と不安・ストレス反応、学力の関連より、小学生への生活態度の指導が不安・ストレス反応を低減し、学力を高める可能性が示唆された...|$|R

40|$|Experience {{and memory}} of {{environmental}} stimuli that indicate future stress can prepare (prime) organismic <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> even in species lacking a nervous system. The {{process through which}} such organisms prepare their phenotype for an improved <b>response</b> to future <b>stress</b> has been termed ‘priming’. However, other terms are also used for this phenomenon, especially when considering priming in different types of organisms and when referring to different stressors. Here we propose a conceptual framework for priming of <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> in bacteria, fungi and plants which allows comparison of priming with other terms, e. g. adaptation, acclimation, induction, acquired resistance and cross protection. We address spatial and temporal aspects of priming and highlight current knowledge about the mechanisms necessary for information storage which range from epigenetic marks to the accumulation of (dormant) signalling molecules. Furthermore, we outline possible patterns of primed <b>stress</b> <b>responses.</b> Finally, we link the ability of organisms to become primed for <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> (their ‘primability’) with evolutionary ecology aspects and discuss which properties of an organism and its environment may favour the evolution of priming of <b>stress</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R
5|$|Ustilago maydis is a {{pathogenic}} plant fungus {{that causes}} smut disease in maize and teosinte. Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes such as U. maydis. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the oxidative burst where the plant produces {{reactive oxygen species}} {{at the site of}} the attempted invasion. U. maydis can respond to the oxidative burst with an oxidative <b>stress</b> <b>response,</b> regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant’s oxidative defensive response to infection.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of sows, or groups {{of one or more}} sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine <b>stress</b> <b>response</b> is significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global <b>stress</b> <b>response</b> pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E

Niedzwetzkyana and M. domestica 'Fuji' were generated using the next-generation high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology and compared. A total of 114 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained, of which 88 were up-regulated and 26 were down-regulated in red-fleshed apples. The 88 up-regulated genes were enriched with those related to flavonoid biosynthetic process and <b>stress</b> <b>responses.</b> Further analysis identified 22 genes associated with flavonoid biosynthetic process and 68 genes that {{may be related to}} <b>stress</b> <b>responses.</b> Furthermore, the expression of 20 up-regulated candidate genes (10 related to flavonoid biosynthesis, two encoding MYB transcription factors and eight related to <b>stress</b> <b>responses)</b> and 10 down-regulated genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. After exploring the possible regulatory network, we speculated that flavonoid metabolism might be involved in <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> in red-fleshed apple. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for further enriching gene resources associated with flavonoid synthesis and <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> of fruit trees and for breeding elite apples with high flavonoid content and/or increased stress tolerances...|$|R

5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a <b>stress</b> <b>response</b> state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the identification of}} the tethers between the mitochondrial and ER membranes suggest that the scaffolding function of the molecular elements involved is secondary to other, non-structural functions. In yeast, ERMES, a multiprotein complex of interacting ER- and mitochondrial-resident membrane proteins, is required for lipid transfer at the MAM and exemplifies this principle. One of its components, for example, is also a constituent of the protein complex required for insertion of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins into the lipid bilayer. However, a homologue of the ERMES complex has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. Other proteins implicated in scaffolding likewise have functions independent of structural tethering at the MAM; for example, ER-resident and mitochondrial-resident mitofusins form heterocomplexes that regulate the number of inter-organelle contact sites, although mitofusins were first identified for their role in fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria. Glucose-related protein 75 (grp75) is another dual-function protein. In addition to the matrix pool of grp75, a portion serves as a chaperone that physically links the mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ channels VDAC and IP3R for efficient Ca2+ transmission at the MAM. Another potential tether is Sigma-1R, a non-opioid receptor whose stabilization of ER-resident IP3R may preserve communication at the MAM during the metabolic <b>stress</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} left homeless by Omar {{resided in}} a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200tents holding more than 1,000people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by {{three days after the}} storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work {{by the end of the}} month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic <b>stress</b> <b>response,</b> especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.|$|E

25|$|In {{humans and}} other animals, the adrenocortical hormones are hormones {{produced}} by the adrenal cortex, the outer region of the adrenal gland. These polycyclic steroid hormones {{have a variety of}} roles that are crucial for the body’s response to stress (for example, the fight-or-flight response), and they also regulate other functions in the body. Threats to homeostasis, such as injury, chemical imbalances, infection, or psychological stress, can initiate a <b>stress</b> <b>response.</b> Examples of adrenocortical hormones that are involved in the <b>stress</b> <b>response</b> are aldosterone and cortisol. These hormones also function in regulating the conservation of water by the kidneys and glucose metabolism, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Stress often {{precedes the}} onset of {{physical}} and mental health disorders, leading to costly and extended disability and even increased risk for death. I investigate psychosocial and endocrine precursors to <b>stress</b> <b>responses,</b> specifically examining the causal effects of status-relevant factors that modulate endocrine, affective, and behavioral responses to social-evaluative stressors. For example, while high social status reduces <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> in numerous species, this stress-buffering effect of status may dissipate or even reverse during times of hierarchical instability. Similarly, some research links testosterone to reduced stress system activity, but correlational research indicates that higher testosterone is related to increased <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> in threatening social situations. In each case, the causal influence of these psychosocial (status and hierarchy stability) and endocrine (testosterone) antecedents to <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> was unclear. Results from this work (Chapter 2) reveal that high status in a stable hierarchy buffered <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> and improved behavioral responses to the stressor, but high status in an unstable hierarchy boosted <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> and did not lead to better performance. This general pattern of effects was observed across endocrine (cortisol and testosterone), psychological (feeling in control), and behavioral (competence, dominance, and warmth) responses to the stressor. Further (Chapters 4 & 6), exogenous testosterone treatment caused increased motivated persistence – which can help persevere through stressful encounters – but, once exposed to a stressor, testosterone caused increased cortisol reactivity, increased negative affect, and decreased motivation in <b>response</b> to social-evaluative <b>stress,</b> especially for individuals high in trait dominance. This work provides evidence of the causal effects of psychosocial and endocrine factors on <b>stress</b> <b>responses</b> and demonstrates the importance of considering these status-relevant precursors when investigating stress within social contexts. 10000 - 01 - 0...|$|R

25|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and {{the transport of}} synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several {{endoplasmic reticulum}} chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus – unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a <b>stress</b> <b>response</b> in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection or the over-expression of proteins can lead to endoplasmic reticulum <b>stress</b> <b>response</b> (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading {{to an increase in}} unfolded proteins.
