50|$|A common {{method for}} stump removal {{is to use}} one of the many {{chemical}} stump removal products, so long as immediate results are not needed. These <b>stump</b> <b>removers</b> are mostly made of potassium nitrate (KNO3) and act by rapidly increasing the decay of the stump. After an average of 4-6 weeks, the stump will be rotten through and easily fragmented in manageable pieces. If time is a limiting factor, setting fire to the stump is effective because once the potassium nitrate has been absorbed it acts as an effective oxidizer.|$|R
