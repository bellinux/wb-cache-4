30|$|Recall scores {{gathered}} from drawing the <b>sketch</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> the traversed <b>route</b> was further evaluated to measure {{extent of the}} spatial learning in the participants. Subsequently, {{on the basis of}} recall scores, participants were classified as the best and worst performers within the group. The drawn <b>sketch</b> <b>map</b> allowed for quantifying the recall of spatial relations with the number of recalled shops (R 1), the number of order breaks (R 2), and the percentage of completeness (R 3) as dependent measures. The final score resulted from the agglomeration of the three components with weights of 1, − 1 and 1, respectively. The negative weight associated with R 2 reflected a penalty for each instance of the following errors: E 1 : If the inner and outer peripheries were not conserved or all the elements stacked in a single row; E 2 : If the vertical and horizontal relationships between elements were not maintained; E 3 : Omission of the cornered shops which was either the Art Gallery or Post Office; E 4 : Addition of new elements that were not present in the original map. R 3 considered the block diagram of the spatial layout of the building, wherein the relative positions of all the shops in the building were to be maintained. Only 25 % of the good navigators demonstrated an astute performance, whereas 45 % in the bad navigators exhibited best performance in the retrieval phase. This might suggests that it cannot be presumed that a good navigator would also perform well in terms of memory and the two variables (recall scores and performance scores) can not be linearly correlated.|$|R
