40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of the addition of surfactants <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> lactate (SSL) and sucrose ester (SE) on the functional properties of films produced with polysaccharides mixtures (methylcellulose/glucomannan/pectin in 1 / 4 / 1 ratio, respectively) and gelatin. The films were produced by the casting method and characterized for their water vapor permeability (WVP), mechanical (tensile strength and elongation to break point), morphological and optical properties. Films with low WVP were obtained with surfactants. Addition of SE to the films with polysaccharide/gelatin ratio of 90 / 10 showed improved mechanical properties. Films presented smooth surfaces with micro voids and lumpiness, depending on the surfactant tested. Surfactants increased the opacity of the films by a factor of 1 - 3 %. All film properties were dependent on the surfactant affinity for the biopolymer matrix. SE presented more affinity for biopolymer matrix containing high polysaccharide proportion, and SSL presented more affinity for polymer matrix containing high gelatin proportion. The addition of surfactants decreased the water vapor permeability of the films, increasing their hydrophobic character. National Council of Research and Technological Development (CNPq...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the {{interactions}} between negatively charged <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> 2 -lactylate (SSL) and positively charged chitosan were studied in solution and on oil-water interfaces. Phase diagrams of the SSL/chitosan systems were obtained at both pH 4. 0 and 5. 7 by preparing concentrated solutions and mixing them at different ratios. Optical microscopy revealed that the complexes formed at pH= 4. 0 were smaller than those formed at pH= 5. 7 and {{that the size of}} the complexes decreased as the SSL/chitosan ratio was reduced. Emulsions (10 % w/w oil) were prepared at pH= 5. 7 by using the complexes of a constant SSL concentration (0. 4 % w/w) and at different SSL/chitosan weight ratios. The droplet size of the emulsions that were formed with the complexes was greater than those containing only SSL. Using complexes of low SSL/chitosan ratio as emulsifying agent resulted in the production of emulsions with enhanced viscosity as determined by steady shear rheometry. However, none of the samples showed a gel-like behaviour since in all cases the G’ (storage modulus) was lower that G” (loss modulus). The presence of polysaccharide at the interface resulted in an increased stability of the emulsions subjected to environmental stresses, such as heat treatment and a freeze thawing process...|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} by the Food Chemicals Codex 7th edition, SSL is a cream-colored powder or brittle solid. SSL is currently manufactured by the esterification of stearic acid with lactic acid and partially neutralized with either food-grade soda ash (sodium carbonate) or caustic soda (concentrated sodium hydroxide). Commercial grade SSL {{is a mixture of}} <b>sodium</b> salts of <b>stearoyl</b> lactylic acids and minor proportions of other sodium salts of related acids. The HLB for SSL is 10-12. SSL is slightly hygroscopic, soluble in ethanol and in hot oil or fat, and dispersible in warm water. These properties are the reason that SSL is an excellent emulsifier for fat-in-water emulsions and can also function as a humectant.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to research the effect of different surfactants on the water vapor permeability and physical properties of edible films made from tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum(dHG). The film-forming solution was made from tapioca starch/ dHG {{at a ratio of}} 1. 7 / 0. 3, and with 20 % glycerol as plasticizer based on the weight of starch/dHG. Surfactants used in this study include glyceryl monostearate (GMS), Span 80, Tween 80, lecithin and <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate</b> (SSL) at different concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 25 % of the total solid content). Starch/dHG composite films were obtained by casting. The results implied that the films with GMS showed the best water vapor barrier properties among all films in this study, and the barrier propeties significantly increased with increasing GMS. However, addition of Tween 80 could not improve the water vapor barrier properties of the cassava starch/dHG films. In addition, the thickness of films increased with increasing surfactant, but a decreasing tendency was observed in tensile strength and tensile strain at break. SEM of the starch/dHG/surfactant composite films revealed that the arrangement of surfactants molecules in the film and interaction between surfactant and starch/dHG modified the microstructure of starch/dHG film. In other words, the addition of different surfactants made the water vapor barrier and physical properties of starch/dHG film change significantly. 本實驗研究的目的為探討不同界面活性劑對樹薯澱粉/脫色仙草葉膠(dHG) 可食膜水氣阻隔與物性的影響。樹薯澱粉/dHG 以 1. 7 / 0. 3 的比例形成固形物為 2 %的可食膜溶液，以甘油為塑化劑，食用級乳化劑作為界面活性劑，包含單甘油硬脂酸 (glyceryl monostearate) 、Span 80 、Tween 80 、卵磷脂 (lecithin) 、乳酸硬脂酸鈉 (<b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate)</b> 等五種，濃度為 5 %、 10 %、 20 %、 25 %，並以鑄模法 (casting) 製得樹薯澱粉/dHG/surfactant 複合膜。研究結果發現，添加單甘油硬脂酸(GMS) 對可食膜的水氣阻隔性有最好的效果，並且隨濃度上升有顯著性的增加，其次是乳酸硬脂酸鈉 (SSL) 及卵磷脂 (lecithin) ，但Tween 80 及 Span 80 則對水氣的阻隔並沒有改善。在對樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜物性影響方面，界面活性劑的添加雖然使厚度增加，但一般而言卻降低了可食膜的透明度、抗張強度及抗張形變量。由掃描式電子顯微鏡結果顯示，界面活性劑的添加因其分子排列及與澱粉/dHG 分子的交互作用，造成樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜的細微結構改變，也因此導致樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜的水氣阻隔及機械強度等性質產生變化。摘要	i Abstract	ii 目錄	iii 圖目錄	vii 壹、	前言	 1 貳、	文獻回顧	 3 一、	可食膜 (edible film) 	 3 (一) 	背景及定義	 3 (二) 	可食膜的組成份	 5 1. 	碳水化合物	 5 2. 	蛋白質	 6 3. 	脂質	 6 4. 	塑化劑 (plasticizer) 	 7 二、	可食膜的製備及應用	 8 三、	樹薯澱粉可食膜	 9 四、	仙草葉膠	 11 五、	樹薯澱粉/脫色仙草葉膠 (dHG) 可食膜	 15 六、	界面活性劑	 17 (一) 	HLB值 (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) 	 19 (二) 	臨界微胞濃度 (critical micelle concentration，CMC) 	 20 (三) 	食品上的乳化劑	 20 七、	等溫吸濕曲線 (Moisture sorption isotherm, MSI) 	 22 八、	可食膜的機械性質 (Mechanical Properties) 	 26 九、	水氣透過性質	 30 參、	材料與方法	 33 一、	仙草葉	 33 二、	澱粉	 33 三、	甘油	 33 四、	界面活性劑	 33 (一) 	Tween 80 	 35 (二) 	Span 80 	 35 (三) 	Lecithin	 35 (四) 	Glyceryl monostearate (GMS) 	 35 (五) 	<b>Sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate</b> (SSL) 	 35 五、	脫色仙草葉膠之萃取、化學成分及分子量	 37 (一) 	仙草葉膠之萃取及脫色	 37 (二) 	基本成分分析	 37 1. 	水分含量	 37 2. 	灰份 (ash) 測定	 38 3. 	粗脂肪 (crude fat) 測定	 38 4. 	粗蛋白測定	 39 5. 	粗纖維 (crude fiber) 測定	 39 (三) 	金屬離子含量測定	 40 (四) 	醣醛酸含量測定	 41 (五) 	脫色仙草葉膠分子量分佈	 42 六、	可食膜溶液及可食膜之製備	 43 (一) 	可食膜溶液製備	 43 (二) 	可食膜製備	 44 七、	可食膜性質測定	 44 (一) 	可食膜溶液快速黏度分析	 44 (二) 	厚度測定	 45 (三) 	水分含量	 45 (四) 	等溫吸濕曲線	 46 (五) 	水氣透過性	 47 (六) 	穿刺試驗	 48 (七) 	抗張試驗	 48 (八) 	場發射掃描式電子顯微鏡結構觀察	 49 (九) 	不透明度分析	 49 八、	統計分析	 50 肆、	結果與討論	 51 一、	脫色仙草葉膠化學組成份	 51 二、	快速黏度分析	 54 三、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜外觀	 62 四、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜厚度及含水量	 64 五、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜不透明度分析	 67 六、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜微結構觀察	 72 七、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜等溫吸濕曲線	 76 八、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜水氣透過性(WVP) 	 81 九、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜機械性質	 88 (一) 	穿刺試驗	 88 (二) 	抗張強度試驗	 89 伍、	結論	 99 陸、	參考文獻	 10...|$|E

40|$|Cream liqueurs {{manufactured}} by a one-step process, where alcohol was added before homogenisation, were {{more stable than}} those processed by a two -step process which involved addition of alcohol after homogenisation. Using the one-step process, {{it was possible to}} produce creaming-stable liqueurs by using one pass through a homogeniser (27. 6 MPa) equipped with "liquid whirl" valves. Test procedures to characterise cream liqueurs and to predict shelf life were studied in detail. A turbidity test proved simple, rapid and sensitive for characterising particle size and homogenisation efficiency. Prediction of age thickening/gelation in cream liqueurs during incubation at 45 °C depended on the age of the sample when incubated. Samples that gelled at 45 °C may not do so at ambient temperature. Commercial cream liqueurs were similar in gross chemical composition, and unlike experimentally produced liqueurs, these did not exhibit either age-gelation at ambient or elevated temperatures. Solutions of commercial sodium caseinates from different sources varied in their calcium sensitivity. When incorporated into cream liqueurs, caseinates influenced the rate of viscosity increase, coalescence and, possibly, gelation during incubated storage. Mild heat and alcohol treatment modified the properties of caseinate used to stabilise non-alcoholic emulsions, while the presence of alcohol in emulsions was important in preventing clustering of globules. The response to added trisodium citrate varied. In many cases, addition of the recommended level (0. 18 %) did not prevent gelation. Addition of small amounts of NaOH with 0. 18 % trisodium citrate before homogenisation was beneficial. The stage at which citrate was added during processing was critical to the degree of viscosity increase (as opposed to gelation) in the product during 45 °C incubation. The component responsible for age-gelation was present in the milk-solids non fat portion of the cream and variations in the creams used were important in the age-gelation phenomenon Results indicated that, in addition to possibly Ca++, the micellar casein portion of serum {{may play a role in}} gelation. The role of the low molecular weight surfactants, <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate</b> and monodiglycerides in preventing gelation, was influenced by the presence of trisodium citrate. Clustering of fat globules and age-gelation were inhibited when 0. 18 % citrate was included.

Peak height, side height, width, and length of baked loaves decreased as DDGS quantity increased, however. Baked bread containing SSL had enhanced quality, with increasing dough strength, rate of hydration, mixing tolerance, crumb strength, loaf volume, and shelf life.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ferulic acid esterified with poly(ethylene glycol) {{with three}} {{different}} average molecular weights (200, 400 and 1000 g/mol) was studied in breadmaking. The effects of these antioxidants on the properties of wheat flour dough and bread were analyzed and compared with those obtained with ferulic acid and two commercial surfactants, diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono- and diglycerides and <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate.</b> Farinographic and alveographic methods as well as weight, volume and bread firmness measurements were used for this purpose. RESULTS: Such as ferulic acid, when the PEGylated derivatives were implemented in the dough (5000 ppm), it accelerated its breakdown and decreased its rheological properties. However, it allowed to avoid the important diminution of loaf volume observed when dough supplemented with ferulic acid was baked. That decrease in volume {{was related to the}} inhibition of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae) by the unesterified ferulic acid. Moreover, two of the PEGylated ferulic acids even contributed to an increase of loaf volumes (5 - 6 %) and demonstrated crumb softener properties. CONCLUSION: The addition of ferulic acid in wheat flour dough caused the inhibition of the yeast, which resulted in decreased bread volume. That effect could be avoid by the esterification of ferulic acid with poly(ethylene glycol). Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the amount of protein required to produce amorphous sugar powders through spray-drying. Pea protein isolate {{was used as a}} model plant protein and sodium caseinate was used as a model dairy protein. Powder recovery in a laboratory spray dryer was used as a measure of the ease of spray drying for a given formulation. More than 80 % of amorphous sucrose and fructose was produced with the addition of sodium caseinate, while the pea protein isolate was able to produce only recoveries of less than 50 % of amorphous sucrose. Sensitivity of low molecular weight surfactants has been demonstrated using both ionic (<b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate)</b> and non-ionic (polysorbate- 80) surfactants. Spray-dried powders were subjected to physico-chemical characterisation and dissolution experiments. The maximum solubility of all powders was obtained after 5 min of dissolution. The solubility of the sodium caseinate increased by 6 - 7 % in the presence of fructose and low molecular weight surfactants. The solubility of the amorphous powders of sucrose-pea protein isolate was found to be lower than amorphous powders of sucrose-sodium caseinate and fructose-sodium caseinate. The addition of sucrose in water increased the solubility of the pea protein isolate from 16. 84 % to more than 83 %. The non-ionic surfactant (Tween- 80) has reduced the solubility of sucrose-pea protein isolate-Tween- 80 powders significantly (p < 0. 05) compared to those of sucrose-pea protein isolate-sodium stearoyl lactylate powders. The solubility of sucrose-sodium caseinate powders was comparable to that of pure sodium caseinate, indicating that addition of sucrose into 0. 13 % sodium caseinate does not have any significant effect on the solubility of this protein at this concentration...|$|E
40|$|Coeliac disease (CD) is {{a common}} lifelong {{disorder}} with small bowel malabsorption and gluten intolerance. The only effective treatment for CD is a strict lifelong renunciation of gluten-containing foods. Currently, the cereal products {{designed to meet the}} requirements of CD patients, especially gluten-free bread, are scarce, of low quality and poor flavor. Therefore, preparation of high quality and affordable bread for coeliac patients was the main objective of this study. Three kinds of gluten-free bread were prepared, in which wheat flour was substituted with rice and corn flour at a ratio of 5 : 1, respectively. Gluten was substituted using different hydrocolloids: 1 % xanthan and 1 % carrageenan (Mix A), GFB A; 1 % xanthan and 1 % pectin (Mix B), GFB B; and 1 % carrageenan and 1 % pectin (Mix C), GFB C. These three types of bread were compared to control bread produced from wheat flour (WB). Sponge and dough method with some modifications was used to produce the bread samples with a developed formula (0. 8 % yeast, 4. 0 % sugar, 2 % salt, 7. 0 % shortening, 2. 0 % non-fat dry milk, and 1 % <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate</b> (SSL)). Determination of the chemical composition, rheological properties and physical characteristics, as well as sensory evaluation of the bread samples, was undertaken. Results showed that the moisture content of WB bread (control) was significantly lower than that of all types of gluten-free bread, and {{there was no significant difference}} in ash, protein, and lipid contents among the gluten-free bread samples. GFB A, GFB B and GFB C displayed no significant differences in their specific volumes. The sensory evaluation showed that GFB C received the lowest sensory evaluation score.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryYong-Cheng ShiJon M. FaubionOne {{long-term}} goal of cereal science {{research is to}} increase the shelf life of baked products and one approach to that goal has been the use of emulsifiers. Emulsifiers are surface-active agents, some of which improve specific properties of baked products. Two emulsifiers, <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate</b> (SSL) and oleyl lactylic acid (OLA) are similar in structure, the difference being the acid moiety: stearic versus oleic acid. Widely researched, SSL has found many uses in baked products. However, how OLA interacts with starch/flour in baked products or how that interaction affects product quality is not well understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} understand the interactions between normal wheat starch and these emulsifiers, as well as the differences between SSL and OLA in those regards. The effects of the two emulsifiers on the pasting properties of wheat starch and wheat flour were determined using a MicroViscoAmylograph. Heating at 6 oC/min with increased emulsifier concentration (0 - 2 %) resulted in increased hot paste viscosity and apparent interaction of both emulsifiers with wheat starch. Solid content affected both maximum hot and final viscosity. OLA produced increased maximum hot and final viscosities with increased starch concentration and emulsifier concentrations. For wheat flour, higher concentrations of SSL reduced both maximum hot paste and final viscosities. OLA behaves differently with wheat flour. At lower flour concentrations, higher concentrations of OLA reduced maximum hot viscosity. The effects of SSL on starch were affected by an increased heating and cooling rate (10 oC/min). Heating stage microscopic analysis revealed that the presence of emulsifiers inhibited granular swelling beyond the normal gelatinization temperature (65 oC) in both starch and flour systems. OLA’s effect in this respect was greater than that of SSL. Complex formation between emulsifiers and wheat starch and wheat flour was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). For isolated wheat starch and hard wheat flour, DSC and XRD indicated that OLA complexes to a greater extent than does SSL. For flour, XRD indicated no difference exhibited in the interaction of the emulsifiers with the flours. KEYWORDS: Emulsifiers, Starch, Wheat flou...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of current global {{challenges}} in wheat production with declining grain protein contents, the aim has been to investigate the use of low protein wheat flour in the processing of instant Asian noodles. For this study, Australian Soft (AS) flour was selected as it is of low protein content and low gluten strength and for comparative purposes, a high protein flour (Baker’s) {{was used as a}} control to reflect current commercial practice. A preliminary investigation was carried out to compare commercial instant noodles and samples prepared under laboratory conditions. The noodles made from AS flour had acceptable but slightly higher hardness and stickiness values, less appealing appearance as well as higher fat uptakes compared to a series of commercial instant noodles. Several ingredients were added into the noodle formulation in order to enhance the quality of instant noodles made from AS flour. The ingredients selected were the enzyme microbial transglutaminase (MTGase), emulsifier (<b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate,</b> SSL), modified starch (acetylated potato starch, APS) and gum (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC). The addition of the ingredients enhanced the textural properties of noodles prepared from AS flour. Electron microscopy confirmed the enhanced development of structure within the noodles when MTGase and SSL were incorporated. In terms of colour, marginal visual difference was observed when combinations of APS and CMC were used, with samples showing a slightly dull appearance compared with the control. An inverse relationship was found between fat uptake and the incorporation of MTGase, water and APS. The impact of varying conditions during instant noodle processing was also studied, particularly mixing, resting, number of folds and the parameters of frying. The combination of mixing and resting time had a major impact on hardness while the yellowness (b * value) of the product was enhanced when the mixing time and frying temperature were increased. Combinations of short frying times and low frying temperatures produced noodles with lower fat contents. The feasibility of incorporating common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) into instant noodle formulations to improve the antioxidant properties was investigated. With increased addition of buckwheat flour, noodles made using AS flour produced softer texture. Furthermore whiteness (L * values) decreased and fat uptake was marginally affected. The levels of the antioxidant rutin were measured in the noodles and were found to increase when additional buckwheat flour was added although losses did occur during the last stage of processing. The results of these trials show that various options are available which will enhance the quality attributes of instant Asian noodles made from AS flour. Product formulation and processing variables can be manipulated to enhance texture and colour appeal as well as reduce fat uptake. Common buckwheat flour can also be incorporated at moderate levels. In summary, these findings provide strategies for utilising low protein flour (AS) for making instant noodles. The results represent a sound scientific basis upon which processors can modify noodle formulations or vary processing conditions {{in order to meet the}} preferences of particular consumers for instant Asian noodles...|$|E
40|$|The {{functionalities}} {{of wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) gluten and starch {{vary with the}} food system in which flour is used. Understanding the transformations of these constituents during different production processes is necessary for improving end product quality. In the literature study of this doctoral work, a yeasted dough system rich in sugar and fat is compared with bread, cake and cookie systems based on the relative ratios of their main ingredients. This system provides a model for some sweet bread and waffle systems. When {{compared to the other}} mentioned food systems, the system studied has a relatively low volume of mobile phase consisting of water and sugar. In addition, its mobile phase is more concentrated than that of bread systems, but less concentrated than that of cake and cookie systems. The water level as well as the volume and the composition of the mobile phase are important when considering gluten and starch functionality in the abovementioned wheat based products. The general aim of the experimental part {{of this study was to}} investigate the transformations of wheat flour constituents during dough preparation, fermentation, baking and storage of the system and their impact on final product quality. First, a laboratory scale procedure for preparing waffle systems was designed. Then, the impact of gluten network development during dough making on product quality (i. e. dimensions and firmness) was studied by adding different gluten levels and altering the gluten quality by upfront flour heat treatment. Having a developed protein network allowed dough to retain gas during fermentation. During subsequent baking, dough pieces having such network expanded more and faster. However, the gluten network also contributed to shrinkage once the maximum diameter was reached during baking. The time at which shrinkage occurred probably depended on dough becoming gas continuous and/or starch gelatinization. In addition, it was shown by using redox agents that besides the formation of a developed gluten network during mixing, subsequent polymerization during baking also affects spread behavior and the diameter and firmness of the baked product. Study of the impact of the transient gluten network structure formation during dough mixing on subsequent cross-linking during baking showed that longer mixing times decrease both the rate and extent of gliadin incorporation in the glutenin polymer network. More in particular, the effects observed during baking could mostly be explained by a slower and therefore smaller loss of gliadins extractable in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing medium when longer mixing times were applied. In samples containing the dough strengthener <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate</b> (SSL) both the rate and extent of gluten polymerization during heating were lower than for control samples, regardless of the mixing time. We hypothesized that SSL interacts with gliadin proteins, limits participation of the latter in cross-linking reactions and thereby yields softer products. In addition, during baking, part of the SSL formed amylose inclusion complexes. Thus, besides changing the behavior of gluten proteins, SSL also affected starch characteristics. When combining SSL with maltogenic Bacillus stearothermophilus alfa-amylase (BStA) in a water-starch model system, SSL (partly) hindered and/or delayed starch hydrolysis by the amylase. In contrast, monoacylglycerols (MAG) did not affect the enzyme's activity. We here hypothesized that SSL covers the starch granule surface more effectively than MAG. This then would retard water uptake and delay starch gelatinization. As a consequence, starch hydrolysis by BStA was postponed. Combining BStA with either SSL or MAG yielded softer gels than when adding the enzyme alone. This indicated that the effect of the surfactants is more important than that of the amylase. Adding BStA or SSL to a wheat based model system containing fat but no invert syrup showed that retrogradation influences the evolution of product firmness during storage. Remarkably, when combining BStA with SSL, the enzyme did not impact the evolution of firmness during storage to the same extent than adding it alone did. This indicated that, much as in the starch model system, the effect of surfactants outweighs that of the enzyme. However, further investigation of the impact of structural differences in the network on product firmness seems necessary. Finally, when including invert syrup in the systems recipe, the (high) levels of SSL and/or BStA used had little if any impact on its dough and baking properties. The high sugar concentrations limited the effects of the improving agents. In conclusion, both gluten and starch impacted spread behavior during mixing and baking, and influenced the firmness (during storage) of yeasted dough systems containing high levels of sugar and fat. Altering molecular scale characteristics of the main constituents of wheat flour affected the macroscale dough making, dough, baking and final product properties. Evidently, the present results may provide a basis for reducing sugar and fat content in these systems. Furthermore, they also contribute to understanding flour functionality in similar wheat based food products. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The four {{essential}} {{ingredients in}} wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) bread making are flour, water, yeast, and salt. Wheat flour typically makes {{up more than}} half of the recipe. Its characteristics and functionality, hence, determine bread quality. Its main constituents are starch, water and protein. Flour also contains low levels of non-starch polysaccharides and lipids. Wheat lipids form a complex group of components with varying polarities. They occur as starch internal lipids or as non-starch lipids, with the latter being analysed as either free or bound based on their extractabilities with solvents of opposing polarities. Despite their low levels in wheat flour, wheat endogenous lipids exert a profound role in bread making and product quality. Several hypotheses have been proposed with regard to their action mechanisms during bread making. These include (i) indirect stabilization of gas cells by strengthening the gluten network, (ii) direct stabilization of gas cells by lipids positioning themselves at gas cell interfaces or (iii) a combination of both. However, the methodologies applied to date do not allow to either confirm or reject these hypotheses. Therefore, in this doctoral work, a lipase-based approach was applied to further elaborate on the role of wheat endogenous lipids in the entire bread making process and to understand how they affect bread quality and its evolution over time. Lipases can in situ selectively modify the lipid population without altering other flour constituents. In a first part of this doctoral work, a method to extract, separate and detect endogenous wheat lipids in a single chromatographic run was optimized. This method was then applied to study the lipid (re) distribution in the transition from flour to bread. Profiles obtained with a high pressure liquid chromatograph coupled to an evaporative light scattering detector of free and bound lipid extracts of wheat flour, its derived dough (both during development and fermentation), and of bread made thereof were analysed and compared. This revealed that dough mixing redistributed lipid from the free to the bound lipid fraction, which has already long ago been referred to as lipid binding. Surprisingly, major redistribution of lipids occurred already before the gluten network was optimally developed. That more lipids could be extracted in total from dough than from flour, was related to flour particle disintegration and simultaneous release of previously unextractable (polar) lipids during mixing. Fermentation released triacylglycerols into the free lipid fraction, which was probably due to (extensive) stretching of the gluten network. The baking phase increased the levels of free (mainly unsaturated) lysophosphatidylcholine. This was caused by dissociation of amylose-lipid inclusion (AM-L) complexes in which it originally occurred as well as its replacement by (saturated) free fatty acids (FFA) and (saturated) N-acyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine upon formation of new AM-L complexes during cooling. In a second part, a lipase-based approach was applied to study the role of endogenous lipids in bread making more in depth. Lipase use impacted bread loaf volume (LV) to an extent depending on the lipase type, its applied dosage and the scale of bread making. Lipase hydrolysis of galactolipids and to a lesser extent of phospholipids is important for increasing bread LV. The FFA formed partitioned to the free lipid fraction whereas the lysolipid component(s) remained in the bound lipid fraction. This suggested that polar lipids interact through their hydrophilic head group with other flour constituents (mainly gluten). Improved gas cell stabilization upon use of selected lipases was related to (i) sufficient amounts of lipids favouring the lamellar phase which stabilizes the interface by forming a condensed monolayer, (ii) an overall decrease in the levels of those lipids promoting hexagonal phase II, and (iii) an increase in the levels of lipids favouring the hexagonal phase I. The latter phase can emulsify deleterious non-polar lipids and prevent their adsorption at gas cell interfaces. To further elaborate on the mechanism(s) by which endogenous lipids enhance bread LV, Lipopan F and Lecitase Ultra lipases and diacetyl tartaric esters of mono- and diacylglycerols (DATEM) were selected. The latter was chosen since lipases have been proposed to replace surfactants in baking applications as they can in situ generate surfactants in dough. Our results indicated that a prerequisite for lipid(-like) components to impact dough rheology is their presence at the start of mixing. Surface active components responsible for gas cell (de) stabilization, such as endogenous lipids, can be isolated together with dough liquor (DL) by ultracentrifugation of dough. DL recovered from dough prepared with lipases contained higher lipid levels than that of control dough, because of higher levels of all polar lipid classes being present. Moreover, the larger the increase in the portion of polar lipids in DL (in the order Lipopan F > Lecitase Ultra > control), the larger the bread LV. Differences in bread LV during baking arose from differences in oven rise. Too high lipase dosages induced earlier oven rise termination due to earlier gas cell coalescence. Remarkably, optimal lipase dosages did not alter the duration of the oven rise. The data demonstrated that oven rise strongly depends on starch gelatinization in the outer baking dough layers, which prevented further expansion. This also explained why lipases exerted different effects in terms of bread LV at the different scales of bread making. Lipase or DATEM use yielded a more uniform and fine crumb structure, which was caused by the phenomena also increasing LV. Next to that, lipase use also changed bread crumb texture. Whether or not differences in mechanical properties result from different (swelling) behaviour of the starch granules and/or differences in gas cell stabilization, and thus crumb structure, however, remains unclear. A third part dealt with the impact of endogenous lipids on changes during storage of bread. Addition of the lipases or <b>sodium</b> <b>stearoyl</b> <b>lactylate</b> (SSL) impacted the evolution of bread crumb texture over time to a similar extent and slowed down both the increase in corrected firmness and stiffness and the decrease in resilience when compared to those in control bread loaves. At a molecular level, the lipase or SSL induced delay in amylopectin retrogradation was clearly noticeable in the free induction decay population A as measured with proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Remarkably, after 7 days of storage only Lipolase addition significantly reduced amylopectin retrogradation. AM-L complex formation upon lipase addition was independent of the type and location of the hydrolysed lipids in dough, and was similar to that for SSL addition. Therefore, differences in amylopectin retrogradation were not solely attributable to AM-L complex formation but also to their location. Indeed, those hydrolysis products having the most impact are present in spherosomes and therefore probably more readily form junction zones within the starch network than those lipid components bound to the gluten network. In conclusion, both altering the galactolipid and to a lesser extent the phospholipid fraction as well as the concomitant increases in the levels of lipids promoting the lamellar or hexagonal phase I conformation positively affects bread quality. Improved LV and crumb structure were related to increased gas cell stability which mainly originated from a better direct gas cell stabilisation. In addition, wheat endogenous lipids also affected crumb texture during storage. status: publishe...|$|E
