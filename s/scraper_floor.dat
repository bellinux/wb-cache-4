As with his Les raboteurs de parquet (English title: The <b>Floor</b> <b>Scrapers),</b> Caillebotte did not attempt to show an idealized form of masculinity, but instead depicted a typical 19th-century male.|$|R

50|$|Les raboteurs de parquet (English title: The <b>Floor</b> <b>Scrapers)</b> is an oil {{painting}} by French Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte. The canvas measures 102 x 146.5 cm. It was originally given by Caillebotte's family in 1894 to the Musée du Luxembourg, {{then transferred to}} the Musée du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it {{was moved to the}} Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, and in 1986, it was transferred again to the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the effort}} Caillebotte {{put into the}} painting, it was {{rejected}} by France's most prestigious art exhibition, the Salon, in 1875. The depiction of working-class people in their trade, not fully clothed, shocked the jurors and was deemed a [...] "vulgar subject matter". He was hurt by this rejection, and instead showed it at the second exhibition of the Impressionists, {{with whom he had}} already associated himself, in 1876. He presented it alongside some of his other works, including a [...] from 1876, and his earlier work Jeune homme à sa fenêtre (Young Man at His Window) The images of the <b>floor</b> <b>scrapers</b> came to be associated with Degas's paintings of washerwomen, also presented at the same exhibition and similarly scorned as [...] "vulgar".|$|R
40|$|Handling {{systems can}} {{influence}} the production of biogas and methane from dairy farm manures. A comparative work performed in three different Italian dairy farms showed how the most common techniques (<b>scraper,</b> slatted <b>floor,</b> flushing) can change the characteristics of collected manure. Scraper {{appears to be the}} most neutral choice, as it does not significantly affect the original characteristics of manure. Slatted floor produces a manure that has a lower methane potential in comparison with scraper, due to: a lower content of volatile solids caused by the biodegradation occurring in the deep pit, and a lower specific biogas production caused by the change in the characteristics of organic matter. Flushing can produce three different fluxes: diluted flushed manure, solid separated manure and liquid separated manure. The diluted fraction appears to be unsuitable for conventional anaerobic digestion in completely stirred reactors (CSTR), since its content of organic matter is too low to be worthwhile. The liquid separated fraction could represent an interesting material, as it appears to accumulate the most biodegradable organic fraction, but not as primary substrate in CSTR as the organic matter concentration is too low. Finally, the solid-liquid separation process tends to accumulate inert matter in the solid separated fraction and, therefore, its specific methane production is low...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Impressionists" [...] – {{also called}} the [...] "Independents", [...] "Intransigents", and [...] "Intentionalists" [...] – had broken away from the {{academic}} painters showing in the annual Salons. Caillebotte made his debut in the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876, showing eight paintings, including, Les raboteurs de parquet (The <b>Floor</b> <b>Scrapers)</b> (1875), his earliest masterpiece. Its subject matter, the depiction of labourers preparing a wooden floor (thought to have been that of the artist's own studio) was considered [...] "vulgar" [...] by some critics {{and this is the}} probable reason for its rejection by the Salon of 1875. At the time, the art establishment deemed only rustic peasants or farmers acceptable subjects from the working class. The painting is now at the Musée d'Orsay. A second version, in a more realistic style resembling that of Degas, also was exhibited, demonstrating Caillebotte's range of technique and his adept restatement of the same subject matter.|$|R
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) - and plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Escherichia coli and associated risk factors in dairy herds. One hundred dairy herds were randomly selected and sampled to study the presence of ESBL- and AmpC-producing E. coli in slurry samples. The sensitivity of testing slurry samples for ESBL/AmpC herd status is less than 100 %, especially for detecting herds with a low ESBL/AmpC prevalence. Therefore, whereas herds that tested positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in slurry were defined as positive herds, herds with negative slurry samples were defined as unsuspected. Isolates of ESBL- and AmpC-producing E. coli were further characterized by detection and typing of their ESBL/AmpC gene. At the initial sampling, a comprehensive questionnaire was conducted at the participating farms. The farmers were asked questions about management practices potentially associated with the ESBL/AMPC herd status. Also, data on antimicrobial purchases during 2011 were acquired to evaluate whether the animal-defined daily dose of antimicrobials per year at farm level was associated with the ESBL/AmpC herd status. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between management practices and the ESBL/AmpC herd status. Six months after the initial slurry sampling, 10 positive herds and 10 herds that had an unsuspected ESBL/AmpC herd status during the first visit were resampled. At each farm, slurry samples and feces from 24 individual cows were collected to evaluate within herd dynamics. During the first sampling, ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were isolated from the slurry samples collected at 41 % of the herds. In total, 37 isolates were further characterized, revealing 7 different ESBL genes (blaCTX-M- 1, - 2, - 14, - 15, - 32, - 55 and blaTEM- 52), 1 plasmid-encoded AmpC gene (blaCMY- 2), and 1 chromosomally encoded ampC gene (ampC type 3). The total animal-defined daily dose of antimicrobials per year at farm level was not significantly different between ESBL/AmpC-positive and unsuspected dairy herds. The use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, however, was found to be associated with ESBL/AmpC status, with higher use of these antimicrobials resulting in a significant higher odds to be ESBL/AmpC-positive. Management factors that were associated with a higher odds of being ESBL/AmpC-positive were treatment of all cases of clinical mastitis with antimicrobials, a higher proportion of calves treated with antimicrobials, not applying teat sealants in all cows at dry off, and the use of a <b>floor</b> <b>scraper.</b> This last association, however, was considered a methodological effect rather than a true risk factor. On 5 of the 10 initially positive farms, no ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were cultured from the slurry or any of the individual cow samples collected during the second sampling. In 4 of the initially unsuspected farms, slurry or individual cow samples tested positive during the second sampling. In conclusion, ESBL/AmpC could frequently be cultured from slurry samples collected from Dutch dairy farms and the ESBL/AmpC genes carried by the isolates were consistent with those reported earlier. The use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins appeared to be associated the ESBL/AmpC herd status...|$|R
