40|$|Visualization of {{chromosome}} dynamics {{allows the}} investigation of <b>spatiotemporal</b> chromatin <b>organization</b> {{and its role in}} gene regulation and other cellular processes. However, current approaches to label multiple genomic loci in live cells have a fundamental limitation in the number of loci that can be labeled and uniquely identified. Here we describe an approach we call “track first and identify later” for multiplexed visualization of chromosome dynamics by combining two techniques: CRISPR imaging and DNA sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our approach first labels and tracks chromosomal loci in live cells with the CRISPR-Cas 9 system, then barcodes those loci by DNA sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization in fixed cells and resolves their identities. We demonstrate our approach by tracking telomere dynamics, identifying 12 unique subtelomeric regions with variable detection efficiencies, and tracking back the telomere dynamics of respective chromosomes in mouse embryonic stem cells...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{based on}} {{cell-free}} systems and on in vitro–cultured living cells support {{the concept that}} many cellular processes, such as transcription initiation, are highly dynamic: individual proteins stochastically bind to their substrates and disassemble after reaction completion. This dynamic nature allows quick adaptation of transcription to changing conditions. However, it is unknown to what extent this dynamic transcription organization holds for postmitotic cells embedded in mammalian tissue. To allow analysis of transcription initiation dynamics directly into living mammalian tissues, we created a knock-in mouse model expressing fluorescently tagged TFIIH. Surprisingly and in contrast {{to what has been}} observed in cultured and proliferating cells, postmitotic murine cells embedded in their tissue exhibit a strong and long-lasting transcription-dependent immobilization of TFIIH. This immobilization is both differentiation driven and development dependent. Furthermore, although very statically bound, TFIIH can be remobilized to respond to new transcriptional needs. This divergent <b>spatiotemporal</b> transcriptional <b>organization</b> in different cells of the soma revisits the generally accepted highly dynamic concept of the kinetic framework of transcription and shows how basic processes, such as transcription, ca...|$|R

Sensor systems with multiple feeds that gather multidimensional spatiotemporal data will result in information clusters and overload, {{as well as a}} high cognitive load for users of these systems. To meet future safety-critical situations and enhance time-critical decision-making missions in dynamic environments, and to support the easy and effective managing, browsing, and searching of spatiotemporal data in a dynamic environment, we propose an asynchronous, scalable, and comprehensive <b>spatiotemporal</b> data <b>organization,</b> display, and interaction method that allows operators to navigate through spatiotemporal information rather than through the environments being examined, and to maintain all necessary global and local situation awareness. To empirically prove the viability of our approach, we developed the Event-Lens system, which generates asynchronous prioritized images to provide the operator with a manageable, comprehensive view of the information that is collected by multiple sensors. The user study and interaction mode experiments were designed and conducted. The Event-Lens system was discovered to have a consistent advantage in multiple moving-target marking-task performance measures. It was also found that participants’ attentional control, spatial ability, and action video gaming experience affected their overall performance. ...|$|R

This innovative approach to breach the diffraction limit offers a versatile platform {{to investigate the}} dynamics of individual biomolecules in living cell membranes and their partitioning into cholesterol-dependent lipid nanodomains. Here, we present optical nanoantenna arrays with accessible surface hotspots to study the characteristic diffusion dynamics of phosphoethanolamine (PE) and sphingomyelin (SM) in the plasma membrane of living cells at the nanoscale. Fluorescence burst analysis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy performed on nanoantennas of different gap sizes show that, unlike PE, SM is transiently trapped in cholesterol-enriched nanodomains of 10 nm diameter with short characteristic times around 100 μs. The removal of cholesterol led to the free diffusion of SM, consistent with the dispersion of nanodomains. Our {{results are consistent with}} the existence of highly transient and fluctuating nanoscale assemblies enriched by cholesterol and sphingolipids in living cell membranes, also known as lipid rafts. Quantitative data on sphingolipids partitioning into lipid rafts is crucial to understand the <b>spatiotemporal</b> heterogeneous <b>organization</b> of transient molecular complexes on the membrane of living cells at the nanoscale.

40|$|Background and Objective: Optimal {{targets for}} {{persistent}} atrial fibrillation (persAF) ablation are still debated. Atrial regions hosting high dominant frequency (HDF) {{are believed to}} participate in the initiation and maintenance of persAF and hence are potential targets for ablation, while rotor ablation has shown promising initial results. Currently, no commercially available system offers the capability to automatically identify both these phenomena. This paper describes an integrated 3 D software platform combining the mapping of both frequency spectrum and phase from atrial electrograms (AEGs) to help guide persAF ablation in clinical cardiac electrophysiological studies. Methods: 30 s of 2048 non-contact AEGs (EnSite Array, St. Jude Medical) were collected and analyzed per patient. After QRST removal, the AEGs were divided into 4 s windows with a 50 % overlap. Fast Fourier transform was used for DF identification. HDF areas were identified as the maximum DF to 0. 25 Hz below that, and their centers of gravity (CGs) were used to track their <b>spatiotemporal</b> movement. Spectral <b>organization</b> measurements were estimated. Hilbert transform was used to calculate instantaneous phase. Results: The system was successfully used to guide catheter ablation for 10 persAF patients. The mean processing time was 10. 4 ?±? 1. 5 min, which is adequate comparing to the normal electrophysiological (EP) procedure time (120 ? 180 min). Conclusions: A customized software platform capable of measuring different forms of spatiotemporal AEG analysis was implemented and used in clinical environment to guide persAF ablation. The modular nature of the platform will help electrophysiological studies in understanding of the underlying AF mechanisms. <br/...|$|R

The aim of the present study was to characterize the <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>organization</b> of small intestinal pressure waves using a portable 12 -channel micromanometric system. Small intestinal pressures were recorded from six duodenal (1 cm apart) and six jejunal (1 cm apart) sites after a standard lunch (1892 kJ) and dinner (3305 kJ) and an overnight fast in seven ambulant subjects. Postprandially, the number of isolated pressure waves and the number of pressure wave sequences that spanned 1 and 2 cm decreased over time (P = 0. 04, P = 0. 003, and P = 0. 0001) and were higher after lunch than dinner (P = 0. 04, P = 0. 02 and P = 0. 04), in contrast to the number of long-spanned pressure wave sequences, which remained constant over time and were not influenced by the meal. The number of isolated pressure waves and pressure wave sequences over 1 - 5 cm recorded in the early postprandial period were higher than during the 30 -min period of nocturnal phase II (P < 0. 01).

40|$|In severe hypoxia, {{respiratory}} rhythm is {{shifted from}} an eupneic, ramp-like motor pattern to gasping {{characterized by a}} decrementing pattern of phrenic motor activity. However, {{it is not known}} whether hypoxia reconfigures the <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>organization</b> of the central respiratory rhythm generator. Using the in situ arterially perfused juvenile rat preparation, we investigated whether the shift from eupnea to gasping was associated with a reconfiguration of the spatiotemporal pattern of respiratory neuronal activity in the ventral medullary respiratory network. Optical images of medullary respiratory network activity were obtained from male rats (4 – 6 weeks of age). Part of the medullary network was stained with a voltage-sensitive dye (di- 2 ANEPEQ) centred both within, and adjacent to, the pre-Bötzinger complex (Pre-BötC). During eupnea, optical signals initially increased prior to the onset of phrenic activity and progressively intensified during the inspiratory phase peaking at the end of inspiration. During early expiration, fluorescence was also detected and slowly declined throughout this phase. In contrast, hypoxia shifted the respiratory motor pattern from eupnea to gasping and optical signals were restricted to inspiration only. Areas active during gasping showed fluorescence that was more intensive and covered a larger region of the rostral ventrolateral medulla compared to eupnea. Regions exhibiting peak inspiratory fluorescence did not coincide spatially during eupnea and gasping. Moreover, there was a recruitment of additional medullary regions during gasping that were not active during eupnea. These results provide novel evidence that the shift in respiratory motor pattern from eupnea to gasping appears to be associated with a reconfiguration of the central respiratory rhythm generator characterized by changes in its <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>organization...</b>|$|E

To provide {{insights into the}} <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>organization</b> of the motor output in connection with ground contact forces, we studied adaptation of human gait to steady low-friction conditions. Subjects walked along a slippery walkway (7 m long; friction coefficient approximately 0. 06) or a normal, nonslippery floor at a natural speed. We recorded gait kinematics, ground reaction forces, and bilateral electromyographic (EMG) activity of 16 leg and trunk muscles and we mapped the recorded EMG patterns onto the spinal cord in approximate rostrocaudal locations of the motoneuron (MN) pools to characterize the <b>spatiotemporal</b> <b>organization</b> of the motor output. The results revealed several idiosyncratic features of walking on the slippery surface. The step length, cycle duration, and horizontal shear forces were significantly smaller, the head orientation tended to be stabilized in space, whereas arm movements, trunk rotations, and lateral trunk inclinations considerably increased and foot motion and gait kinematics resembled those of a nonplantigrade gait. Furthermore, walking on the slippery surface required stabilization of the hip and of the center-of-body mass in the frontal plane, which significantly improved with practice. Motor patterns were characterized by an enhanced (roughly twofold) level of MN activity, substantial decoupling of anatomical synergists, {{and the absence of}} systematic displacements of the center of MN activity in the lumbosacral enlargement. Overall, the results show that when subjects are confronted with unsteady surface conditions, like the slippery floor, they adopt a gait mode that tends to keep the COM centered over the supporting limbs and to increase limb stiffness. We suggest that this behavior may represent a distinct gait mode that is particularly suited to uncertain surface conditions in general...|$|E
