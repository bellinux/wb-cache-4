40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of herbal application along meridians for treatment and prevention of asthma by using serum pharmacological test to observe the effects of serum containing herbs against the constriction of tracheal <b>spiral</b> <b>strips</b> induced by acetylcholine chloride (Ach). Methods: Guinea pigs were randomly divided into normal control group, normal saline (NS) application group, aminophylline application group, aminophylline injection group, 1 -day herb application group, 7 -day herb application group and 14 -day herb application group. Asthma was induced by Hutson's method in guinea pigs except the normal control group. Guinea pigs in herb application groups were treated by external application of a compound herbal medicine 60 min once every day. Guinea pigs in NS application group were treated by external application of NS. Guinea pigs in the two aminophylline-treated groups were treated by external application and intraperitoneal injection of aminophylline at a dose of 400 mg/kg, respectively. The guinea pigs were killed and the sera were obtained after 1 -day, 7 -day and 14 -day treatment in the three herb application groups, 7 -day treatment in the NS application group, the aminophylline application and injection groups, respectively. Serum pharmacological method was used to do the experiment, the effects of different sera on the constriction of tracheal strips were observed, and the constriction rates were calculated. Result: The serum containing herbs had an effect in reducing the constriction of tracheal <b>spiral</b> <b>strips</b> induced by Ach, and the effect {{was similar to that}} of the serum obtained from the aminophylline injection group. The constriction rate of the tracheal <b>spiral</b> <b>strips</b> was decreased when herbal application treatment was prolonged within a period of time, and it became stable when herbal application treatment was between 7 - 14 days. The constriction of tracheal <b>spiral</b> <b>strips</b> induced by Ach could be reduced remarkably when it was previously treated by serum containing herbs. Conclusion: The anti-acetylcholine function with a time-dependent effect is one of the mechanisms of herbal application treatment along meridians for asthma, and furthermore, herbal application treatment along meridians might be useful for preventing asthma...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Some basic {{pharmacological}} {{differences between}} isolated human cerebral and digital arteries obtained at postmortem have been studied. <b>Spiral</b> <b>strip</b> responses were measured isometrically and cumulative drug dose-response curves obtained. Contractile responses were sought to norepinephrine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, angiotensin, histamine, KCI, BaCl 2 and prostaglandin F 2 o. Relaxation responses (either by the agonists on their own, {{or in the}} presence of a resting tonus induced by KCI or 5 -hydroxytryptamine) were sought to isoproterenol, histamine, acetylcholine and dopamine. There were no differences between the cerebral or digital arteries in the non-specific responses to KCI or BaClj. Nor were there any differences in the responses to prostaglandin F 2 Q, or in the receptor mediated responses to 5 -hydroxytryptamine or angiotensin. This was in marked contrast to the responses produced by norepinephrine where the maximum response was much larger in digital arteries than in cerebral arteries, although there were no differences in the sensitivity of the 2 vessels to norepinephrine (as measured by the ED 60 values). Relaxation responses were difficult to elicit and very variable with only occasional preparations show-ing relaxation to any of the agonists. These results suggest that the only major pharmacological difference between human digital and cerebral vessels is the number, rather than the sensitivity, of the noradrenergic a-receptors...|$|E

40|$|Spirally cut {{preparations}} of rabbit aorta {{in vitro}} {{respond to the}} application of a brief alternating current (a. c.) stimulus with a repro-ducible two-phase contraction (Furchgott, 1952). During current flow, a rapid primary contraction occurs; on cessation of stimulation, the primary contraction is followed by a slower secondary contraction. Furchgott noted that the secondary contraction was abolished by Dibenamine; accordingly, he suggested that it was caused by the liberation of an “epinephrine-like ” substance in the arterial wall. This suggestion was strength-ened by the finding (Gillis and Yates, 1960) that reserpine, which lowers the catecholamine content of rabbit aorta (Burn and Rand, 1958 a), abolished the secondary contraction of this tissue following a. c. stimulation.

Radioligand binding studies using rabbit cerebral membranes showed that both doxazosin and prazosin were roughly equipotent at displacing [3 H]-prazosin from specific binding sites. However, the lower pA 2 value for doxazosin at alpha 1 -adrenoceptors in isolated thoracic aorta preparations suggests a lower potency compared to prazosin. The dose-related pressor effects of intravenous phenylephrine {{were used to}} assess vascular alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism in vivo. There was a close agreement between alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist potency and maximum hypotensive effects with both doxazosin and prazosin. The alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist effects of doxazosin were more prolonged than those of prazosin. Studies using either radioligand binding or pressor responses to B-HT 920 showed that doxazosin did not show any significant affinity for the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor. Similarly, no direct vasodilator effects were observed either in animals administered angiotensin II or in isolated thoracic aorta <b>spiral</b> <b>strip</b> preparations contracted with potassium. Doxazosin has a longer terminal elimination half-life than prazosin. The pharmacokinetics of doxazosin were linear over the dose range examined. Following pharmacological 'autonomic blockade' and treatment with prazosin, doxazosin did not cause any further fall in blood pressure. These observations suggest that doxazosin, like prazosin, appears to exert its hypotensive action through alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism. The prolonged fall in blood pressure and well sustained alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism after doxazosin raise the possibility of an active metabolite which also has alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blocking properties...|$|E

Julius Caesar allegedly used, in his correspondence, a simple letter substitution method. Each letter of Caesar's message was replaced by the letter that followed it alphabetically by three places.

For this purpose we have collected, and completed when necessary, the various analyses we have previously made separately for early- and late-type galaxies. We find strong evidence of pseudo-bulges in all Hubble types. Pseudo-bulges are disc-like structures formed by secular evolutionary processes in galaxies. Similar to spirals, the early-type disc galaxies (S 0 -S 0 /a) have on average relatively expo-nential bulges with Sersic index n < 2, and 56 per cent of them show disc-like fine struc-tures {{in the region of}} the bulge. For some of the galaxies there is also kinematic evidence of pseudo-bulges. If S 0 -S 0 /a galaxies were once <b>spirals,</b> <b>stripped</b> of their gas, then redis-tributed gas and star formation in the disc would be a natural explanation for all pseudo-bulges in the Hubble sequence.

Albaconol increased the contraction induced by a low dose of capsaicin (10 (- 10) to 10 (- 9) M), but non-competitively antagonized the contraction induced by a high dose of capsaicin (10 (- 8) to 10 (- 3) M).

OUTLINE Cut the skin of an orange along a thin spiral of constant width (fig. 1) and lay it flat on a table (fig. 2). A natural breakfast question, for a mathematician, is which shape the spiral peel will have, when flattened out. We derive a formula that, for a given cut width, describes the corresponding spiral’s shape. For the analysis, we parametrize the spiral curve by a constant speed trajectory, and express the curva-ture of the flattened-out spiral as a function of time. This is achieved by comparing a revolution of the spiral on the orange with a corresponding spiral on a cone tangent {{to the surface of the}} orange (fig. 3, left). Once we know the curvature, we derive a differential equation for our spiral, which we solve analytically (fig. 4, left). We then consider what happens to our spirals when we vary the strip width.

40|$|Abstract Contractility of {{tracheal}} {{smooth muscle}} <b>strips</b> and <b>spiral</b> <b>strips</b> of fourth to fifth generation bronchi was studied in organ baths. The relationship among contractility, airway smooth muscle myosin, and smooth muscle thickness was also examined. The trachea {{was divided into}} three segments, each consisting of 12 - 14 rings. Smooth muscle strips {{from each of the}} three regions (top, middle, and bottom of the trachea) and from fourth to fifth generation bronchi were studied. Acetylcholine (ACh) sensitivity (-log EC 50) was 8. 1, 7. 1, 7. 9, and 6. 1 for the top, middle, and bottom of the trachea and the bronchi, respectively. At P = 0. 01, the EC 50 ACh value of the top of the trachea differed from the EC 50 value of the bronchi. Maximal tension (Tmax) generated in bronchi (3. 2 g) was lower (P less than 0. 01) than in the top (10. 4 g), middle (7. 1 g), and bottom of the trachea (5. 1 g). Differences between trachea and bronchi disappeared when Tmax was corrected for smooth muscle myosin content. Thickness of smooth muscle in bronchi was less (P less than 0. 01) than in the three regions of trachea. Tmax was significantly correlated with airway smooth muscle thickness (r = 0. 56; P less than 0. 05). These results suggest that in mongrel dogs sensitivity to ACh shows a gradient {{from the top of the}} trachea to the bronchi and that Tmax is greater in the trachea than in the bronchi and is significantly correlated with thickness of smooth muscle...|$|R
5000|$|Peranemas basic anatomy {{is that of}} {{a typical}} Euglenid. The cell is spindle or cigar-shaped, {{somewhat}} pointed at the anterior end. It has a pellicle with finely-ridged microtubules (a structure often referred to as [...] "pellicle strips") arranged in a helical fashion around the body. On this type of pellicle, which is shared by many Euglenids, the <b>spiraling</b> microtubular <b>strips</b> are able to slide past one another, giving the organism an extremely plastic and changeable body shape. This permits a type of squirming motility, sometimes referred to as [...] "Euglenoid movement" [...] or [...] "metaboly". [...] When it is not swimming, Peranema can creep along by metaboly, progressing with wavelike contractions of the body, reminiscent of peristalsis.|$|R
40|$|Phenylephrine (PE) causes {{vasoconstriction}} through alpha adrenergic receptors. PE-induced vasodilatation {{has also}} been reported earlier in pre-constricted vessels. Here we demonstrate in <b>spiral</b> <b>strips</b> of goat arteries that addition of PE can decrease tone even from base-line levels (i. e. not pre-constricted) and show that this process requires nitric oxide (NO) and alpha adrenergic stimulation, but is cGMP-independent. Under control conditions, PE caused vasoconstriction, but under conditions where NO levels are higher, as with L-Arginine or sodium nitroprusside, PE decreased vessel tension. L-Arginine/PE combination {{was not able to}} decrease tension when alpha adrenoceptors were blocked with Phentolamine or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was blocked with Nω-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA). Propranolol, a beta blocker, was unable to prevent the reduction in tension by the L-Arginine/PE combination. Adrenaline and noradrenaline (and not isoproterenol) also reduced vessel tension in the presence of L-Arginine. Even when NO levels were not enhanced, relieving NO from having to stimulate the enzyme soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) (either by using sGC blockers, namely ODQ or methylene blue, or by enhancing cGMP levels (with sildenafil) which by negative feedback probably inhibits sGC) led to PE-induced reduction of vascular tension. PMA-phorbol myristate acetate-an agonist which stimulates Protein Kinase C was able to prevent the ability of PE to reduce vascular tension in a high NO environment. Our conclusion is that PE reduces vascular tension through alpha adrenoceptors if there is excess NO availability to activate a putative pathway. Though the reduction of vessel tone by PE is dependent on NO, it is independent of cGMP. Prior treatment with PMA or PE itself can prevent further PE-induced reduction of tension in a high NO environment. The results here suggest, counter-intuitively, that alpha blockers may be of help in the treatment of septic shock where nitric oxide levels are high...|$|R
