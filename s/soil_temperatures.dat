The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent.

5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E

According to research published in the journal Science ("Disappearing Arctic Lakes", June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia.

Below 50 cm (20 in), <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> seldom changes and can be approximated by adding 1.8 °C (2 °F) to the mean annual air <b>temperature.</b> <b>Soil</b> <b>temperature</b> has important seasonal, monthly and daily variations.

L. cuprina can fly up to ten miles looking for food, and can be found on anything ranging from carrion to decaying fruit.

25|$|Mature {{stands of}} white spruce in boreal regions often have {{well-developed}} moss layers dominated by feather mosses, e.g., Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) B.S.G., Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.)

Permafrost development in parts of Alaska, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories is facilitated by the insulative organic layer (Viereck 1970a, b, Gill 1975, Van Cleve and Yarie 1986).

25|$|Mild to {{moderate}} fires burn {{in the forest}} understory, removing small trees and herbaceous groundcover. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns {{of the trees and}} kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates complex early seral forest habitat, or snag forest with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil. Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as climate and topography {{play an important role in}} determining fire severity and fire extent. Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.|$|E
25|$|Colonies {{of the red}} {{imported}} {{fire ant}} have tunneling surfaces that protrude out of the surfaces where workers forage. These areas of protrusion tend to be within their own territory, but greater ant colonisation can affect this. Tunnels are designed to allow effective body, limb and antennae interactions with walls, and a worker can also move exceptionally fast inside them (more than nine bodylengths per second). The holes exit out of any point within the colony's territory, and foraging workers may need to travel half a metre to reach the surface. Assuming the average forager travels 5 m, over 90% of foraging time is inside the tunnels {{during the day and}} rarely at night. Workers forage in <b>soil</b> <b>temperatures</b> reaching 27°C (80°F) and surface temperatures of 12–51°C (53–123°F). Workers exposed to temperatures of 42°C (107°F) are at risk of dying from the heat. The rate of workers foraging drops rapidly by autumn, and they rarely emerge during winter. This {{may be due to the}} effects of soil temperature, and a decreased preference for food sources. These preferences only decrease when brood production is low. In the northern regions of the United States, areas are too cold for the ant to forage, but in other areas such as Florida and Texas, foraging may occur all year round. When it is raining, workers do not forage outside, as exit holes are temporarily blocked, pheromone trails are washed away, and foragers may be physically struck by the rain. The soil's moisture may also affect the foraging behaviour of workers.|$|E

Forest thinning changes <b>soil</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>soil</b> water content, and root density and activity, and thus changes soil respiration. We measured soil respiration monthly and <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> and volumetric <b>soil</b> water continuously in a young ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. Laws. & C. Laws.) plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Cali-fornia from June 1998 to May 2000 (before a thinning that re-moved 30 % of the biomass), and from May to December 2001 (after thinning). Thinning increased the spatial homogeneity of <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> and respiration. We conducted a multivariate analysis with two independent variables of <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> and water and a categorical variable representing the thinning event to simulate soil respiration and assess the effect of thin-ning. Thinning did not change the sensitivity of <b>soil</b> respiration to <b>temperature</b> or to water, but decreased total soil respiration by 13 % at a given temperature and water content. This decrease in soil respiration was likely associated with the decrease in root density after thinning. With a model driven by continuous <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> and water time series, we estimated that total soil respiration was 948, 949 and 831 g C m– 2 year– 1 in the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Although thinning re-duced soil respiration at a given temperature and water content, because of natural climate variability and the thinning effect on <b>soil</b> <b>temperature</b> and water, actual cumulative soil respiration showed no clear trend following thinning.
