40|$|A {{taxonomy}} <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> {{was constructed}} that categorizes <b>situations</b> by means <b>of</b> ratings of one's {{ability to deal}} with those situations. A principal components analysis of self- and other-ratings yielded four components <b>of</b> situations: 1, <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> pleasure; II, <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> individual adversity; III, <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal conflict; and TV <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> social demand. Ratings of being able to deal with a situation were related to ratings on a personality questionnaire. This resulted in a very clear set <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> for each <b>of</b> the Big Five factors of personality. The Big Five differed in kind and in number <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> for which they were able to distinguish the well handling from the less well handling persons. Especially, {{it turned out that the}} so-called temperament-factors, Extraversion, Emotional Stability, and also Autonomy, give rise to more situational differentiation than the so-called character-factors, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Comparing the present situation structure to that obtained in an earlier study, we found that using the same set <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> does not guarantee obtaining the same set <b>of</b> <b>situation</b> components. Different methods of classification yield differences in the resulting classifications. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} how uncertain <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> threat or opportunity influence people’s choices {{to interact with}} their colleagues in an organization. The threat/opportunity lens encompasses two conceptually distinct dimensions, gain/loss and control/limited control, which are hypothesized to produce different patterns of network interaction. Two experimen-tal studies—one involving 158 leaders in a health-care organization and the other involving 129 employees {{in a range of}} smaller establishments—provided support for the proposed con-ceptualization. The studies found that (1) people chose to interact with more network con-tacts in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> loss than in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> gain, (2) those with an internal locus of con-trol chose to interact with more network contacts in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> limited control than in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> control, whereas those with an external locus of control exhibited the opposite response, and (3) the tendency to interact with more network contacts in loss rather than gain was greater for low-ranking actors relative to high-ranking ones.

The Code would also have improved the <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative szlachta and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.|$|E
