40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{long-term}} conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks, the 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement {{calls for the}} establishment of regional fisheries management organizations to manage them. This article studies the potential for cooperation in <b>straddling</b> <b>stock</b> fisheries when the cooperative coalition of countries acts as a Stackelberg leader against the remaining singleton countries. Within the Stackelberg fishing game with several interested parties, the result shows that an increase in the cooperation level leads to an increase not only in the steady-state fish stock, but also in the total rent of the fishery. Further, the outlook for cooperation is better within the Stackelberg game, where the cooperative coalition acts as a leader, than in the Cournot game. At the stable equilibrium of a Stackelberg game, not only is the steady-state fish stock higher, but also the total resource rent, participantsâ€™ rent, and non-participantsâ€™ rent are higher than those of the Cournot-Nash stable equilibrium. The new-entrant issue is a problem for the conservation of fish stock in the Stackelberg game. Self-financed transfers with commitments of the initial stable coalition will increase the level of cooperation.

A two-stage game is applied, assuming ex ante symmetric players and the classical Gordon-Schaefer bioeconomic model.

A key result is that, apart from the case of two players, the grand coalition is not a Nash equilibrium outcome. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} three or more players the only Nash equilibrium coalition structure is the one formed by singletons.

Le Kim Long: «On the shared fisheries in the South China Sea and possible strategies for Vietnam’s fisheries» (manuscript) Since {{the end of the}} 20 th century, many shared fish stocks throughout the world have been found in extreme danger of collapse. There are many calls for cooperation in utilizing and conserving the shared fish resources including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 UN Fish Stock Agreement. This study provides an important rationale for cooperation in utilizing a shared fish stock with several interested parties. The rationale is that an increase in the cooperation level leads to an increase not only in the steady-state fish stock, but also in total rent of the fishery. Moreover, the possibilities for cooperation in utilizing shared fisheries are examined. Some measures are also proposed to improve the cooperation level. According to this study, the prospects of cooperation in utilizing a straddling fish stock are not unlikely if a Regional Fishery Management Organisation (RFMO) forms with a leading role in a Stackelberg game or with an endogenous minimum participation level in a Cournot game. However, if the cost of enforcing RFMO members’ compliance with the terms of the agreement is high enough, there may not be any incentive for fishing countries to establish an RFMO for managing a straddling fish stock. This {{is one of the reasons}} for pervasive over-fishing around the world. For an actual example, the South China Sea (SCS) fishery, which is harvested by about ten countries including Vietnam, will be discussed as an application. An empirical investigation of the profitability and remuneration of an offshore long-line fishery demonstrates slightly above-average earnings even under the current open-access regime. Finally, the study will propose some fishery strategies for Vietnam, which is a country with heavy inshore fishing, the second largest catch in the South China Sea and where large-scale illegal fishing takes place...|$|E

This paper discusses key economic issues at stake {{from the viewpoint of}} a coastal state with important stakes in a <b>straddling</b> <b>stock.</b> The Chilean jack mackerel stock, one of Chile's most important fish resources, is in this category. This stock is currently caught on adjacent high-seas only by a Chilean-flag fleet, and currently {{there is no evidence of}} imminent competition from distant water fishing nations (DWFNs). We argue that ratification of the Agreement could imply negative effects on: (i) coastal states' sovereignty upon management measures within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and (ii) national fishing companies' competitiveness. Despite this, the net cost/benefit balance depends on how binding the threat of DWFNs' fishing competition is expected to be. If the Agreement does go into force, coastal states with important stakes in straddling fish stocks will feel increased pressure to ratify as well. For the case of states that become parties to the Agreement, we discuss pending obstacles for achieving effective fishery management in the adjacent high-seas. We speculate about possible solutions to the 'New Member' and 'Interloper' problems. Regarding the former, enforceable closed access would seem to be legally feasible under the Agreement. In terms of effective enforcement against fishing by illegal interlopers, innovation in enforcement tools would be needed.

Salmon from Canadian and Irish waters demonstrated concentrations (0. 20 ± 0. 14 Bq kg- 1 and 0. 19 ± 0. 09 Bq kg- 1, mean ± s. d., respectively) suggesting similar oceanic feeding distributions during migration.

However, significantly higher concentrations in 1 -sea-winter (1 SW) escapees (0. 43 ± 0. 25 Bq kg- 1) may alternatively suggest feeding within local estuaries. High concentrations in some Canadian 1 SW salmon indicated trans-Atlantic migration. Low concentrations of Canadian multi-sea-winter (MSW) salmon suggested a feeding distribution in the Labrador and Irminger Seas before homeward migration, because those regions have the lowest surface water 137 Cs levels. Estimates of wild Canadian and Irish salmon feeding east of the Faroes (~ 8 oW) were 14. 2 % and 10. 0 % (1 SW, 24. 7 % and 11. 5 %; MSW, 2. 9 % and 0. 0 %), respectively.

40|$|Management of <b>straddling</b> fish <b>stocks</b> {{has been}} noted for its {{political}} complexity. Negotiations frequently falter as each party seeks to focus upon their own individual and shorter-term goals than the collective interest of the sector. Entrenched positions are often only deepened as new entrants participate to establish their own claims to any emergent share of resource. Unsurprisingly, deadlocks are common and typically compromises are reached only after the real period of biological then economic crisis has passed. Examples to illustrate this tendency {{can be found in}} most of the world's oceans and is writ large within the current impasse over blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) in the North Atlantic. The development of this fishery is discussed and it is shown that despite the scope to add value to the resource base through a pattern of exploitation focussed more upon human consumption than fish meal and oil, there seems little incentive to extricate participants from the cycle of demise that has engulfed negotiations so far. In an attempt to consider how such seemingly intractable problems might be resolved, attention is next turned to {{the construction of a new}} model for resource management specifically intended to contend with the problems thrown up by <b>straddling</b> <b>stocks.</b> Central to this is the need to ensure motivation and incentivisation of value chain members in both national economic zones and international waters. It is proposed that a Multinational Resource Cooperative (MRC) is established and would be the key element in the management model. The MRC, on behalf of the national stakeholders, would auction quota so that fish enterprises can purchase quota units defined in terms of species, quantity, catch area and the time of catch. The MRC would also be financed through a quota auction fee as explained below and arrange its own quota control and enforcement services. By auctioning rights to stakeholders the MRC will enable control and enforcement of the TAC; allocations of fair national shares of resource and critically, motivate fish enterprises to devise and implement market-oriented value adding strategies. Adoption of such a scheme should result in a more efficient use of the remaining <b>straddling</b> <b>stocks</b> whilst there is still time to do so. Importantly, the proposed rent distribution mechanism would also shift the focus of negotiations from being dominated by quotas and access rights to more evident pecuniary metrics.
