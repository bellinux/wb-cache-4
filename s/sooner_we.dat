500|$|Joseph Stalin {{implemented}} {{a policy of}} Sovietization to isolate the Byelorussian SSR from Western influences. This policy involved sending Russians from {{various parts of the}} Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Byelorussian SSR government. After Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev continued his predecessor's cultural hegemony program, stating, [...] "The <b>sooner</b> <b>we</b> all start speaking Russian, the faster we shall build communism." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biti {{returned}} to Zimbabwe on 12 June {{and was immediately}} arrested {{at the airport in}} Harare. Before his departure from Johannesburg, Biti said that he had already learned that he would be arrested, but maintained that his only crime was [...] "fighting for democracy". Furthermore, he said that it was necessary for him to return to participate in the MDC's struggle, despite describing it as [...] "a stupid decision" [...] for him to do so. Biti also said on this occasion that talks on a national unity government had collapsed because the MDC insisted on having Tsvangirai as President and excluding Mugabe from the arrangement, while ZANU-PF insisted on Mugabe remaining President. He also expressed disappointment with regional efforts to resolve the situation and doubted that the UN would be able to resolve it, saying that Zimbabweans were [...] "on their own – and the <b>sooner</b> <b>we</b> realise it, the better".|$|E

No <b>sooner</b> did <b>we</b> halt, than our foes dispersed; or, no <b>sooner</b> did <b>we</b> renew the march, than every line of wall, along our route, became a line of hostile muskets. I trust you will do us justice, sir--you know the regiments, and can scarce think they misbehaved." ...|$|R

2500|$|The 1st Marine Division, {{then under}} the command of Major General James Mattis, was one of the two major U.S. land forces that participated in the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq as the land component of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. In December 2002, MajGen Mattis was quoted as saying, [...] "The President, the National Command Authority and the American people need speed. The <b>sooner</b> <b>we</b> get it over with the better. Our overriding principle will be speed, speed, speed." [...] Initially, the division fought through the Rumaila oil fields, feinted an attack towards Basrah then moved north on Iraq Highway 1 to An Nasariyah – a moderate-sized, Shi'ite dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and proximity to nearby Talil Airfield. The division then fought its way to Baghdad and pushed further to secure Tikrit by forming Task Force Tripoli after the fall of Baghdad. The division covered 808 kilometers in 17 days of sustained combat, the deepest penetrating ground operation in Marine Corps history. After the invasion the division settled in to conduct security and stabilization operations in Baghdad, Tikrit, and then in south-central Iraq from May to October 2003. For actions during the war as part of I MEF the division was awarded its 9th Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

6000|$|WILLIE. Very much as usual, I believe. But {{you should}} have been here ten minutes <b>sooner,</b> before <b>we</b> began to read the lessons. (Laughs.) ...|$|R
