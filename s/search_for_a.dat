They begin their journey, but the camel dies in the middle of the desert. They soon find a nearby Comfort Inn, however, in which to stay. They steal a hot air balloon from the hotel premises and make their way to the Vatican City, embarrassing the Pope upon landing, then traveling by train from Switzerland to Munich, and end up in Amsterdam. Upon finally arriving at the BBC Television Centre, Stewie is horrified to learn that the farm is a set, and his beloved characters are merely tired out, disinterested actors. Enraged, Stewie decides to travel back home with Brian to Quahog after getting revenge at the Mother Maggie actress for kicking him by defecating in her shoes. This ordeal also causes Stewie to lose interest in the show.|$|E

5|$|On January 4, 2012, {{the band}} {{announced}} via the band's official website, {{along with their}} other official sources, that Howard Jones had left the band after his nine-year membership with them. In the statement, the band did not disclose {{the reason for this}} decision out of respect for Jones, but simply thanked him for his nine years with the band and wished him well, as well as thanking the fans for their support as they began the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new lead singer; Jones later explained he departed the band to manage his type 2 diabetes which was worsened by a hectic touring lifestyle. Soon after the announcement of Jones's departure, rumors began that Phil Labonte of All That Remains would officially take over lead vocals due to his previous history with the band, although Labonte quickly dispelled the rumor. Many vocalists were considered in the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new one for the band. The band's <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new singer concluded in February with the announcement that original lead vocalist Jesse Leach would return to the band, as the band felt that Leach's energy, as well as his overall comfort and command of both the old and new material, made him the clear choice during auditions. Following Leach's return, the band continued to the process of recording their new album and touring. On April 22, 2012, the band performed Leach's first show since 2002 at the New England Metal and Hardcore Fest.|$|E
