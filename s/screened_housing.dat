Participants recognized that screening stopped mosquitoes (79 – 96 %) and other insects (86 – 98 %) entering their houses.

The standardised method of evaluating crop germplasm for resistance to M. incognita including crop yield was employed. M. incognita caused significant reduction in the yield components of the cowpea variety both in the <b>screen</b> <b>house</b> and under field conditions. Single and combined treatments of Glomus mosseae and organic fertilizer significantly increased the pod weight, grain yield and number of pods per plant of cowpea plants as compared to nematode infected plants. Single treatments of Glomus mosseae and organic fertilizer significantly suppressed root galling; inhibited nematode reproduction and nematode population both in the <b>screen</b> <b>house</b> and under field conditions. The mixture of G. mosseae and organic fertilizer as a treatment was more effective than individual treatments in suppression of M. incognita.

The field experiment was aimed at determining the effectiveness of inter-planting Celosia argentia into sorghum in the suppression of Striga and increasing sorghum yield. The <b>screen</b> <b>house</b> experiment looked at the optimum proportion of C. argentia to be inter-planted into sorghum to effectively suppress Striga and maintain a good sorghum yield. The laboratory study was to quantify the capacity for C. argentia to effect Striga seed germination.

The experimental soils were acid Ultisols with < 4 mg/kg extractable Bray- 1 P. Tilemsi PR from Mali and triple superphosphate (TSP) were applied at 60 kg P ha- 1 (<b>screen</b> <b>house)</b> and 90 kg P ha- 1 (field) to the legume. Legume N-fixed (BNF) was estimated by the 15 N-isotope dilution and δ 15 N natural abundance methods, using Cassia obtusifolia L. as a non-fixing legume reference plant. Without P supply, and under the field conditions, C. micans produced less than 1 tonne of biomass and accumulated 29 kg N/ha. The application of PR-P enhanced legume N by about fourfold over the unfertilised control. There {{was no significant difference between}} the effects of TSP and PR. Phosphorus application mainly affected the total amount of N accumulated rather than the percentage derived from the atmosphere (%N dfa) per se. Furthermore, the cumulative effects of PR-P on the performance of C. micans greatly improved with time in the <b>screen</b> <b>house.</b> This study confirms that Tilemsi PR is an agronomically effective source of P for short-duration legume green manure (GM) even in the first year of its application to acid P-deficient soils in the West African humid zon...|$|R

40|$|Fusarium {{root rot}} (Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases affecting common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Trials to identify sources of resistance to the pathogen were conducted on 147 bean lines at the National Agricultural Research Laboratories (NARL) at Kawanda in Uganda. The bean lines were from various sources including Uganda, South Africa and the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. A pathogen isolate, FSP- 3, was used to produce inoculum for <b>screen</b> <b>house</b> trials through which 46 moderately resistant cultivars were identified. The 46 cultivars were subsequently evaluated in a bean root rot infested field. Data collected included disease severity, colour of hypocotyls, seed size and grain yield, root and shoot weight. Regression analysis showed that field and <b>screen</b> <b>house</b> FRR disease severity data were highly correlated (r= 97 %; P? 0. 01 at 28 DAP data and r= 98 %; P? 0. 01 at 56 DAP). Genotypes differed significantly (P= 0. 05) between 3. 2 (MLB- 49 - 89 A) and 8. 9 (Apac Ongori) in <b>screen</b> <b>house</b> trials and 4. 3 (MLB- 49 - 89 A) and 8. 8 (RWR 2075) under field conditions. Fifteen cultivars were moderately resistant at 28 days after planting with four maintaining this reaction at 56 days after planting under field conditions. Disease resistance was highest among cultivars previously selected for resistance to Fusarium wilt and Pythium root rot indicating presence of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) modifying resistance to more than one root pathogen in some lines. Large-seeded varieties and varieties with green hypocotyls tended to be more susceptible indicating genetic correlation between these traits and resistance to Fusarium root rot.
