40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the role of}} phenazines (PHZ) and lipopeptide surfactants (LPs) produced by Pseudomonas in suppression <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> rot <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> groundnut, caused by the fungal pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii. Methods and Results: In vitro assays showed that PHZ-producing Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain Phz 24 significantly inhibited hyphal growth of S. rolfsii and suppressed <b>stem</b> rot <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> groundnut under field conditions. Biosynthesis and regulatory mutants of Phz 24 deficient in PHZ production were less effective in pathogen suppression. Pseudomonas strains SS 101, SBW 25, and 267, producing viscosin or putisolvin-like LPs, only marginally inhibited hyphal growth of S. rolfsii and did not suppress <b>stem</b> rot <b>disease.</b> In contrast, Pseudomonas strain SH-C 52, producing the chlorinated LP thanamycin, inhibited hyphal growth of S. rolfsii and significantly reduced <b>stem</b> rot <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> groundnut in nethouse and field experiments, whereas its thanamycin-deficient mutant was less effective. Conclusions: Phenazines and specific lipopeptides {{play an important role}} in suppression <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> rot <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> groundnut by root-colonizing Pseudomonas strains. Significance and Impact of the Study: Pseudomonas strains Phz 24 and SH-C 52 showed significant control <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> rot <b>disease.</b> Treatment <b>of</b> seeds or soil with these strains provides a promising supplementary strategy to control <b>stem</b> rot <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> groundnu...|$|R

The AAL toxins {{are members}} of a new class of sphinganine analog mycotoxins that cause cell death in both animals and plants. Here, we report detection of stereotypic hallmarks of apoptosis during cell death induced by these toxins in tomato. DNA ladders were observed during cell death in toxin-treated tomato protoplasts and leaflets. The intensity of the DNA ladders was enhanced by Ca 2 + and inhibited by Zn 2 +. The progressive delineation of fragmented DNA into distinct bodies, coincident with the appearance of DNA ladders, also was observed during death of toxin-treated tomato protoplasts. In situ analysis of cells dying during development in both onion root caps and tomato leaf tracheary elements revealed DNA fragmentation localized to the dying cells as well as the additional formation of apoptotic-like bodies in sloughing root cap cells.

By comparison, no significant effect of the DNAse was detected for biofilm formation by Xc. DNAse effects on biofilm formation or disruption varied among Xcc strains and Xanthomonas species which suggest different roles for eDNA. Variation in the structure of fibers containing eDNA in biofilms, bacterial cultures, and in twitching motility was also visualized by microscopy.

40|$|Rhizoctonia solani Kühn is one or {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} of all pathogenic soil fungi. Its ability to live as a saprophyte in the soil has been shown by Blair (3), and by Roth and Riker (25), and the extremely wide host range of this fungus testifies to its ability {{to carry on a}} parasitic mode of existence. Peltier (23), in 1916, reported that 165 species of plants, arising from all the important families of the dicotyledons, a number of monocotyledons, several gymnosperms, and Eguisetum were more or less subject to attack by this fungus. His list also included most of the floricultural plants, vegetable and field crops, herbaceous plants and many weeds. Undoubtedly this list of host plants has had many additions made to it during the intervening years. Pathogenically R. solani plays a triple role. First, it is the causal organism <b>of</b> root and <b>stem</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> potatoes, beets and other root crops; second, {{it is one of the}} main causes of damping-off among seedlings of many species of plants; and third, it causes a foliage blight of sugar beets (12). The damping-off action of R. solani on flax seedlings causes a thinning out of the stand. This, in itself, need not reduce the final yield appreciably since the survivors would have more available moisture and light resulting in larger and more vigorous plants with increased yield of seed. However, flax is unable to compete successfully with weeds and a thinned out stand gives them a much better opportunity of becoming established and crowding out the surviving flax plants. The result is a loss of seed and a reduction in yield that may discourage further planting of this valuable crop to say nothing of soil contamination by weed seeds. … Work has been done by Sanford (29, 31), Le Clerg (15, 16) and others on R. solani damage to potatoes and sugar beets but there has been little work of an experimental nature devoted to a study of R. solani as a flax seedling parasite.

40|$|The Alternaria <b>stem</b> canker <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> tomato {{is caused}} by the fungal {{pathogen}} Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici and its host-selective AAL-toxins. Resistance to the pathogen and insensitivity to the toxins are conferred by the Asc locus on chromosome 3 L. Sensitivity to AAL-toxins is a relative character; the toxins inhibit development of all tested tomato tissues but susceptible cultivars are much more sensitive than resistant cultivars. In addition to tomato, some other plant and animal species are sensitive to the toxins as well. The likely mode of action of AAL-toxins is interference with sphingolipid biosynthesis by specific inhibition of ceramide synthase activity. To molecularly isolate Asc, transposon tagging and positional cloning strategies are applied. As a first step, transposon insertions and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers are identified in proximity of the Asc locus. Subsequently, the transposons are used to inactivate Asc by insertion mutagenesis, and the RFLP markers are used to identify yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) with tomato DNA inserts. Once an Asc-insertion mutant and/or a YAC encompassing Asc has been obtained, physical isolation and characterisation of Asc will be conceivable. Elucidation of the molecular role of Asc will illuminate the specificity of host recognition by Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici. ...|$|R

CrMVs were widespread with relatively high levels of minor allele frequency (MAF) in western North America.
