5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in <b>such</b> <b>stories,</b> particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that during the Parthian period the court {{minstrel}} (gōsān) recited poetic oral literature accompanied by music. However, their stories, composed in verse form, were not written down until the subsequent Sasanian period. In fact, there is no known Parthian-language literature that survives in original form, since it was written down in the following centuries. It is believed that <b>such</b> <b>stories</b> as the romantic tale Vis and Rāmin and epic cycle of the Kayanian dynasty {{were part of the}} corpus of oral literature from Parthian times, although compiled much later. Although literature of the Parthian language was not committed to written form, there is evidence that the Arsacids acknowledged and respected written Greek literature.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; <b>such</b> <b>stories</b> include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys <b>such</b> <b>stories.</b> The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E
25|$|The {{accuracy}} of <b>such</b> <b>stories</b> is disputed by some modern historians and archaeologists.|$|E

50|$|In his autobiography, {{the comedian}} Billy Connolly wrote of {{his admiration for}} Campbell. In addition, Campbell himself would often tell stories about himself that were self-deprecating and humorous. One <b>such</b> <b>story,</b> from Ian MacKintosh {{concerns}} Alex and his friend Hamish Imlach.|$|R
25|$|Many <b>such</b> <b>stories</b> are told, some of {{them quite}} famous; Gustafva Juliana Cederström, (1746-1801) was widely known {{in the country for}} having served in several professions as a man, and on the {{opposite}} side, there was Lasse-Maja, a man dressing himself as a woman.|$|E
25|$|Staines {{reported}} {{the allegation that}} John Prescott was having an extramarital affair with an MP, and named the woman in question, saying that such rumours had long been shared among Westminster journalists, {{but that he was}} being less hypocritical and breaking the clique by refusing to cover up <b>such</b> <b>stories.</b> The coverage of the Prescott affair drew considerable extra traffic to Staines's blog.|$|E
25|$|Mike McAlary, from 1985 to 1993, bounds {{from one}} New York City {{newsroom}} to another as he achieves career success, covering <b>such</b> <b>stories</b> as the tainted Tylenol {{case and the}} Buddy Boys of the 7-7 scandal. His salary increases as he ascends from being a cub reporter to star crime reporter to star columnist. In 1993, McAlary's suffers a near-fatal auto accident that leaves him physically impaired.|$|E
50|$|Among {{examples}} of <b>such</b> supposed <b>stories</b> include the following.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{of the two}} orderings, [...] "The Adventure of the Retired Colourman" [...] (1926) {{has often}} been {{incorrectly}} identified as the last Sherlock Holmes story written by Arthur Conan Doyle to be published, when the last <b>such</b> <b>story</b> to be published is in fact [...] "The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place" [...] (1927).|$|R

25|$|Hachiko {{is among}} many dogs {{famous for their}} loyalty. <b>Such</b> <b>stories</b> {{are at least as}} old as the ancient Greek Homer's story of Argos. Similar to Hachiko's story is that of the Italian dog Fido, the Scottish dog Greyfriars Bobby, Shep from Fort Benton, Montana USA, Red Dog from Pilbara, Western Australia and {{numerous}} other dogs famous for remaining faithful after the death of their master. In Japan itself, it was not an unprecedented story.|$|E
25|$|Two primary {{characteristics}} {{are seen in}} these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates. These two aspects of the Lilith legend seemed to have evolved separately; there is hardly a tale where she encompasses both roles. But the aspect of the witch-like role that Lilith plays broadens her archetype of the destructive side of witchcraft. <b>Such</b> <b>stories</b> are commonly found among Jewish folklore.|$|E
25|$|As the manhunt for Every {{continued}} in the decade following his disappearance, sightings were frequently reported, but none proved reliable. After {{the publication of a}} fictional memoir in 1709, which claimed Every was a king ruling a pirate utopia in Madagascar, popular accounts increasingly took on a more legendary, romantic flavor (see In contemporary literature). Although <b>such</b> <b>stories</b> were widely believed to be true by the public, they had no basis in reality. No reliable information about Every's whereabouts or activities emerged after June 1696.|$|E
50|$|One <b>such</b> <b>story</b> {{was that}} German {{soldiers}} were deliberately mutilating Belgian babies by cutting off their hands, in some versions even eating them. Eyewitness accounts told of having seen a similarly mutilated baby. As Arthur Ponsonby later pointed out, in reality a baby {{would be very}} unlikely to survive similar wounds without immediate medical attention.|$|R
5000|$|The {{alternate}} history story P.'s Correspondence (1846) by Nathaniel Hawthorne, {{considered the}} first <b>such</b> <b>story</b> ever published in English, includes the notice [...] "Whittier, a fiery Quaker youth, {{to whom the}} muse had perversely assigned a battle-trumpet, got himself lynched, in South Carolina". The date of that event in Hawthorne's invented timeline was 1835.|$|R

25|$|The British {{historian}} C. R. Boxer {{noted the}} great effect that Pessoa's actions had {{on how the}} Japanese see Portuguese people. According to Boxer, the event apparently gave the Japanese an exaggerated impression of the fighting qualities of the Portuguese, as well as appealing to the Japanese samurai code due to Pessoa's rather un-Christian act of suicide. As <b>such,</b> <b>stories</b> of the event were told and retold again over the next hundred years, often in an exaggerated and wildly inaccurate manner, and found themselves embedded as part of local folklore.|$|E
25|$|Werewolf fiction {{denotes the}} {{portrayal}} of werewolves and other shapeshifting man/woman-beasts, in the media of literature, drama, film, games, and music. Werewolf literature includes folklore, legend, saga, fairy tales, Gothic and Horror fiction, fantasy fiction and poetry. <b>Such</b> <b>stories</b> may be supernatural, symbolic or allegorical. A classic American cinematic example of the theme is The Wolf Man (1941) and in later films joins with Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula, {{as one of the}} three famous icons of the modern day horror. However, werewolf fiction is an exceptionally diverse genre with ancient folkloric roots and manifold modern re-interpretations.|$|E
25|$|The {{historians who}} relay <b>such</b> <b>stories,</b> principally Tacitus and Suetonius, wrote some 70 {{years after the}} events in an {{environment}} hostile to the imperial line to which Messalina had belonged. Suetonius' history is largely scandal-mongering. Tacitus claims to be transmitting 'what was heard and written by my elders' without naming sources other than the memoirs of Agrippina the Younger, who had arranged to displace Messalina's children in the imperial succession and was therefore particularly interested in blackening her predecessor's name. It {{has been argued that}} what passes for history is largely a result of the political sanctions that followed her death.|$|E
50|$|Thakurmar Jhuli is {{the most}} classic {{collection}} of Bengali children's folk-tales and fairy-tales, which was compiled by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder in 1907. There we can find many different categories of supernatural entities (such as Rakkhosh) featuring in different <b>stories.</b> Other <b>such</b> <b>story</b> collection from the same author are Thakurdadar Jhuli (1909), Thandidir Tholay (1909) and, Dadamoshayer Tholay (1913).|$|R
5000|$|After {{retiring}} from football, Rahn {{started his own}} car dealership in Essen-Altenessen, along Altenessener Street.

One <b>such</b> <b>story</b> involves a discussion he once had with a friend regarding his car dealership: ...|$|R
5000|$|This episode, {{along with}} [...] "Utopia" [...] and [...] "Last of the Time Lords", are treated in several sources as a three-part <b>story,</b> the first <b>such</b> <b>story</b> in the revived series of Doctor Who. However, Russell T Davies {{has said that}} he regards [...] "Utopia" [...] as a {{separate}} story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and even stage performances. In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of <b>such</b> <b>stories,</b> and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.|$|E
25|$|Natchez oral {{literature}} {{has been documented}} by John R. Swanton, and Mary Haas both of whom worked with Watt Sam in 1907 and the mid 1930s respectively. Traditionally the Natchez had certain stories {{that could only be}} told during the winter time, and many of these stories revolved around the theme of cannibalism. Protagonists in <b>such</b> <b>stories</b> would encounter cannibals, trick cannibals, marry the daughters of cannibals, kill cannibals, and be eaten by cannibals. In these stories Natchez storytellers would employ a special speech register when impersonating the cannibal characters. This register was distinct from ordinary Natchez by substituting several morphemes and words for others.|$|E
25|$|Many {{patients}} who have had the surgical procedure report their improvements on social media websites such as structured patient databases and YouTube. <b>Such</b> <b>stories</b> are only anecdotal evidence of efficacy, and do not constitute a scientific proof of {{the efficacy of the}} treatment since, for example, those who have had a positive result are more prone to post their cases than those who had little or no improvement, and the reported improvements in patients' condition {{can be attributed to the}} placebo effect. Patients' reasons for not publishing negative results may include embarrassment about the money spent in the procedure without effect and the negative reaction they expect from other people with MS. Caution has been recommended regarding patients' self-reports found on the web.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{only the}} second time in the classic series' history that there was a pre-credits sequence. Castrovalva (1982) was the first <b>such</b> <b>story.</b> Subsequently, Time and the Rani (1987) and Remembrance of the Daleks (1988) also {{featured}} pre-credits teasers.
