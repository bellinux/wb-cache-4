40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an information theoretic approach for the <b>accounting</b> <b>classification</b> process. We propose a matrix formalism and an algorithm for calculations of information theoretic measures associated to <b>accounting</b> <b>classification.</b> The formalism {{may be useful}} for further generalizations and computer-based implementation. Information theoretic measures, mutual information and symmetric uncertainty, were evaluated for daily transactions recorded in the chart <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> a small company during two years. Variation in the information measures due the aggregation of data in the process <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>classification</b> is observed. In particular, the symmetric uncertainty {{seems to be a}} useful parameter for comparing companies over time or in different sectors or different accounting choices and standards.

40|$|What we {{know today}} as double entry {{bookkeeping}} is traceable to a man called Luca Pacioli, {{the author of the}} world’s first printed book-keeping treatise. As the origin of all subsequent book-keeping treatises throughout Europe, Luca Pacioli’s book-keeping tract is not only the source <b>of</b> modern <b>accounting,</b> but also ensured that the medieval Venetian method itself survived into our times. However, this study is aimed at critically examining the emergence of the double entry <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> by reviewing what past scholars and researchers have done in relation to the subject matter. This is to say that a comprehensive review <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> literature in relation to double entry <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> was carried out to do justice to this study. And it was gathered that double entry bookkeeping existed amongst the early Italian merchants before Pacioli came into the scene. But the practice prior to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was rather crude because there were no formally documented principles to be followed. So the outburst of Pacioli in the fifteenth century recorded a landmark in the development <b>of</b> this all-embracing <b>accounting</b> <b>system.</b> The first ever published treatise about double entry bookkeeping was that of Luca Pacioli in his book titled “Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita”. This book became the road map for the development <b>of</b> double entry <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> Therefore, away from the conclusions of the majority of authors and scholars in the accounting literature that Luca Pacioli is the father <b>of</b> <b>accounting,</b> he should rather be referred to as the father <b>of</b> modern <b>accounting,</b> having laid the milestone for the codification, development, preservation, and sustenance <b>of</b> double entry <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting...</b>|$|R
