40|$|The {{finite element}} method is widely applied for the {{determination}} of contact and bending stresses in gear drives. It {{is based on the}} finite element model of the gear drive that is built by the discretization of the pinion and gear teeth and usually {{does not take into account}} the supporting components of the gears, as shafts, their bearings, or the gear case. Such components have an important influence in the formation of the bearing contact due to their deformations under load. Recently, some improved models have been proposed for finite element analysis of gear drives including their shafts.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when standard spur gears are in mesh is the appearance of edge contact on the gear tooth surfaces caused by misalignments. Those misalignments are caused partially by deflections of gear supporting shafts. As {{a result of an}} edge contact, a non-favorable condition of the bearing contact occurs, yielding high level of contact stresses. An intensive research and many practical solutions have been directed to modify the gear tooth surfaces in order to avoid edge contact. An innovative procedure is proposed here for: (1) determination of errors of alignment caused by <b>shaft</b> <b>deflections,</b> (2) compensation of predicted <b>shaft</b> <b>deflections</b> during generation of spur gears, and (3), obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors for the design load. A finite element model of a spur gear drive that comprises pinion and gear supporting shafts is used for the determination of errors of alignment along a cycle of meshing. Compensation of misalignments caused by <b>shaft</b> <b>deflections</b> in gear generation is then accomplished by modification of pinion tooth surfaces whereas the gear tooth surfaces are kept unmodified. Additional modifications of pinion tooth surfaces may be required for obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors. The effect of several misalignment compensations in the reduction of contact stresses has been investigated. Postprocessing of load intensity functions and loaded transmission errors is included. The developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} how shaft stiffness affects clubhead speed and how it alters clubhead orientation at impact. For the first time, a 3 D, six-segment forward dynamics model of a golfer and club was developed and optimized to answer these questions. A range of shaft stiffness levels from flexible to stiff were evaluated at three levels of swing speed (38, 45 and 53 m/s). At any level of swing speed, the difference in clubhead speed did not exceed 0. 1 m/s across levels of shaft stiffness. Therefore, {{it was concluded that}} customizing the stiffness of a golf club shaft to perfectly suit a particular swing will not increase clubhead speed sufficiently to have any meaningful effect on performance. The magnitude of lead deflection at impact increased as shaft stiffness decreased. The magnitude of lead deflection at impact also increased as swing speed increased. For an optimized swing that generated a clubhead speed of 45 m/s, with a shaft of regular stiffness, lead deflection of the shaft at impact was 6. 25 cm. The same simulation resulted in a toe-down <b>shaft</b> <b>deflection</b> of 2. 27 cm at impact. Using the model, it was estimated that for each centimeter of lead deflection of the shaft, dynamic loft increased by approximately 0. 8 degrees. Toe-down <b>shaft</b> <b>deflection</b> had relatively no influence on dynamic loft. For every centimeter increase in lead deflection of the shaft, dynamic closing of the clubface increased by approximately 0. 7 degrees. For every centimeter increase in toe-down <b>shaft</b> <b>deflection,</b> dynamic closing of the clubface decreased by approximately 0. 5 degrees. The results from this thesis indicate that improvements in driving distance brought about by altering shaft stiffness are the result of altered clubhead orientation at impact and not increased clubhead speed...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of estimating noise radiating from a gearbox {{is essential to}} achieve valid design solutions in shorter timeframes and to limit the testing phase, especially in those industrial fields, such as automotive, helicopter and wind turbine industry, with a strong demand for gear noise reduction. This paper presents a methodology for the calculation of gear bearing forces, useful for the acoustic analysis of gearboxes and applicable to spur as well as helical parallel gear systems. The methodology {{is based on the}} implementation of a procedure for the computation of the dynamic transmission error (DTE) in a multibody environment. The DTE is obtained from the static transmission error (STE), i. e. the static relative displacement between meshing teeth, which is variable along the mesh cycle. The adopted multibody technique enables to overcome the principal drawbacks of FEM, achieving good computational efficiencies, and of analytical models, avoiding to lump the system in one or few degrees of freedom. These goals are reached by means of a user-defined force element, acting as teeth meshing force, which stems from the integration of the multibody software, LMS Virtual.

40|$|Clipper Windpower, in {{collaboration}} with United Technologies Research Center, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation, developed a low-cost, deflection-compliant, reliable, and serviceable chain drive speed increaser. This chain and sprocket drivetrain design offers significant breakthroughs {{in the areas of}} cost and serviceability and addresses the key challenges of current geared and direct-drive systems. The use of gearboxes has proven to be challenging; the large torques and bending loads associated with use in large multi-MW wind applications have generally limited demonstrated lifetime to 8 - 10 years [1]. The large cost of gearbox replacement and the required use of large, expensive cranes can result in gearbox replacement costs on the order of $ 1 M, representing a significant impact to overall cost of energy (COE). Direct-drive machines eliminate the gearbox, thereby targeting increased reliability and reduced life-cycle cost. However, the slow rotational speeds require very large and costly generators, which also typically have an undesirable dependence on expensive rare-earth magnet materials and large structural penalties for precise air gap control. The cost of rare-earth materials has increased 20 X in the last 8 years representing a key risk to ever realizing the promised cost of energy reductions from direct-drive generators. A common challenge to both geared and direct drive architectures is a limited ability to manage input <b>shaft</b> <b>deflections.</b> The proposed Clipper drivetrain is deflection-compliant, insulating later drivetrain stages and generators from off-axis loads. The system is modular, allowing for all key parts to be removed and replaced without the use of a high capacity crane. Finally, the technology modularity allows for scalability and many possible drivetrain topologies. These benefits enable reductions in drivetrain capital cost by 10. 0 %, levelized replacement and O&M costs by 26. 7 %, and overall cost of energy by 10. 2 %. This design was achieved by: (1) performing an extensive optimization study that deter-mined the preliminary cost for all practical chain drive topologies to ensure the most competitive configuration; (2) conducting detailed analysis of chain dynamics, contact stresses, and wear and efficiency characteristics over the chainÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs life to ensure accurate physics-based predictions of chain performance; and (3) developing a final product design, including reliability analysis, chain replacement procedures, and bearing and sprocket analysis.

Golfers are used extensively for equipment testing and development, however, they are inconsistent in performance and they tire. Golf swing simulation devices overcome these shortcomings producing consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for golf research conducted by manufacturers governing bodies and academic institutes. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested {{to ensure that the}} swing motions provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. An extensive 3 D kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum model of the swing along with ball launch and <b>shaft</b> <b>deflection</b> data. A technique for generating golf robot motion commands from the kinematic swing data was then developed using interpolation algorithms to increase the continuity of command derivatives. Six golfers' swings with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially availablem odem golf robot and a bespokem otion control system. Quantitative data captured from 20 golfers were compared using gender and skill classifications. All golfers were found to perform consistent swing motions and the kinematic sequencing of joint segments supported the summation of speed principle. Higher skill rated golfers were found to perform swings with greater consistency, faster clubhead speeds at impact, faster down swings and greater delayed wrist releases. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data and a feed-forward control enables in dividual golfer's swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability. The capability for golfers' swings to be replicated accurately using a mechanical device provides new impetus for both clubfitting methodologies and optimisation of swing technique. However, the boundary constraint of the club at the robot's gripping mechanism was found to provide poor representation of golfers' grip, and consequently, the first bending mode of the club was excited during simulations and resultant <b>shaft</b> <b>deflection</b> and ball launch data correlated less well with the golfers' data.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of spiral vibration (Newkirk-effect) may {{be observed in}} various types of rotating machinery. It {{is caused by a}} vibration-induced hot spot on the shaft surface, which is generated by friction. Spiral vibration with a forward rotating unbalance vector occurred at a hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator. From tests with the running generator the carbon brushes sliding on the slip rings were identified as the hot spot location. Potential modifications were studied using hot spot stability analyses with a rotor dynamic model of the generator shaft. The applied method, introduced by Schmied, allows the handling of general systems. It uses a hot spot model based on Kellenberger’s thermal equation between the <b>shaft’s</b> thermal <b>deflection</b> and its displacement. In the case of slip rings, the hot spot is caused by friction from the carbon brushes. The stability threshold is determined as a function of rotor speed and the ratio of added to dissipated heat. Three different relations between the added heat and the shaft vibration were modelled: heat input proportional to the shaft displacement, to the shaft velocity and to the shaft acceleration. The model with the heat input proportional to the velocity was found to be the most suitable variant. This was confirmed by comparison with measurements. Finally, a modification was selected based on the calculation results and successfully implemented.

When the driveshafts have different length and excessive torque is applied, the longer half shaft flexes more than the shorter one. However, this is a short term transient effect. To avoid fatigue failure, the amount of drive <b>shaft</b> torsional <b>deflection</b> must necessarily be small. Effects due to one wheel spinning more slowly than the other are usually negligible. Equal lengths of the driveshafts, in the case of no asymmetric suspension deflection due to roll or bump, keep the drive shaft angles equal. The main component of torque steer occurs when the torques in the driveshaft and the hub are summed vectorially, giving a resultant torque vector around the steering pivot axis (kingpin). These torques can be substantial, and in the case of shafts making equal angles to the hub shafts, will oppose one another at the steering rack, and so will cancel. These torques are strongly influenced by the position of the driveshaft universal joint (CV joint) in relation to the steering axis, however due to other requirements such as achieving a small or negative scrub radius an optimum solution is not generally possible with simple suspension configurations such as MacPherson strut.|$|R
