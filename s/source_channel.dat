A typical physical recording console has a pan control for each incoming <b>source</b> <b>channel.</b> A pan control or pan pot (short for [...] "panoramic potentiometer") is an analog knob or slider with a position indicator which can range continuously from the 8 o'clock when fully left to the 4 o'clock position fully right.

5000|$|The M6 format {{has largely}} {{replaced}} the earlier ‘M3’ standard {{in which the}} sum and difference attenuation is only 3dB. This M3 format is designed to give a more accurate indication {{of the level of}} the summed mono signal when working with conventional stereo material. The premise is that in summing two signals of similar level but carrying non-phase-coherent sounds (ie. typical stereo material), the result averages 3 dB more than either <b>source</b> <b>channel</b> (rather than 6dB more). The M3 standard means that true stereo material can be peaked to 6 in both channels, with the M meter also showing 6. However, dual-mono sources can only be peaked to 5.25 in each channel to keep the M meter at 6.|$|E
50|$|In {{the above}} {{equation}} Aij(f) {{is an element}} of A(f) - a Fourier transform of MVAR model coefficients A(t), where aj(f) is j-th column of A(f) and the asterisk denotes the transpose and complex conjugate operation. Although it is a function operating in the frequency domain, the dependence of A(f) on the frequency has not a direct correspondence to the power spectrum. From normalization condition it follows that PDC takes values from the interval 0,1. PDC shows only direct flows between channels. Unlike DTF, PDC is normalized to show a ratio between the outflow from channel j to channel i to all the outflows from the <b>source</b> <b>channel</b> j, so it emphasizes rather the sinks, not the sources. The normalization of PDC affects the detected intensities of flow as was pointed out in. Namely, adding further variables that are influenced by a source variable decreases PDC, although the relationship between source and target processes remains unchanged. In another words: the flow emitted in one direction will be enhanced in comparison to the flows of the same intensity emitted from a given source in several directions.|$|E
