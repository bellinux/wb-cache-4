The central pair of Spaceseats are slightly angled for those travelling with a colleague or partner, and the two arm rests can form a single table for shared in-flight dining. The pairs of outboard Spaceseats on either side are angled to enhance privacy for solo flyers. The seats are built around a hard shell so the passenger in front cannot recline into {{the space of the}} person sitting behind.

50|$|Renault Design Central Europe presented, at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, {{a concept}} car named Dacia Duster. This concept vehicle was a 5-door SUV with rear suicide doors for easy access, that {{addressed}} {{the needs of}} families, with a roomy cabin in a compact package and a large 470 L trunk. The engine emission level was 139 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer {{and it had a}} fuel consumption of 5.3 l/100 km. The Dacia Duster was the first concept car developed by Dacia, in collaboration with the Renault Design Technocentre. The Duster normally has four seats but can be converted into a two-seat car, the passenger <b>seat</b> <b>slides</b> under the driver's seat and the right back <b>seat</b> <b>slides</b> under the left back seat freeing an extra room of 2000 L ideal for a bicycle.|$|E

40|$|Eutectoid steel strips are {{designed}} {{for the production of}} parts for intensive use such as clutches, <b>seat</b> <b>slides,</b> and springs as they exhibit excellent strength levels and wear resistance. These properties arise from the unique morphology of lamellar pearlite which can be considered as a self-laminated nanoscale composite. However, a spheroidization annealing step is nowadays necessary to improve the cold forming properties before further cold rolling steps. This thesis is aimed at improving the tensile ductility of the hot rolled products of eutectoid composition in order to eliminate the intermediate annealing step. Two strategies are proposed. The first is to transpose the concept of controlled rolling developed for HSLA to eutectoid steels. Through a strict adjustment of the austenite processing and of the cooling strategy, it is possible to improve the ductility of the final lamellar microstructure. The way the processing parameters influence the hot deformation of austenite, the eutectoid transformation and of the subsequent spheroidization annealing is deeply investigated. It is found that refinement and pancaking of austenite is beneficial as it reduces the pearlite block size improving the total tensile elongation. Accelerated cooling is of paramount importance to achieve fine Interlamellar spacing (ILS), which lead to high strength levels and accelerate spheroidization during subsequent annealing. The second approach involves intercritical or warm deformation. Warm processing of eutectoid steels is first explored by torsion testing and then up-scaled to a pilot rolling-line. The interactions between thermomechanical parameters, rolling forces generated and microstructural evolution are carefully scrutinized. During concurrent hot deformation, spheroidization of cementite takes place almost instantaneously in both torsion and rolling. The restoration processes occurring in the ferrite matrix depends on the strain path and the strain rates. Low strain rates (0, 1 s− 1) and simple shear promotes the formation of a recrystallized-like HABs network of about 3 μm in size. Plane strain compression and high strain rates (10 s− 1) leads to the formation of a typical recovered dislocation substructure (LABs) of 1 μm in size. During annealing, no recrystallization occurs and the LABs substructure remains stable. This substructure influences drammatically the mechanical properties: the strength is very high and the work-hardening behavior is poor due to high recovery rate in the region close to the LABs. However, due to the presence of spheroidized cementite particles the ductility of warm rolled eutectoid steels is higher than that of ultra fine grained low carbon steels.

50|$|Early {{governance}} {{of the sport}} in Australia {{was done by the}} Rowing Council with supporting from the Australian Rowing Association.

50|$|The second {{option is}} where both {{the seat and}} the foot {{stretcher}} slide on a rail. This is analogous to both the <b>seat</b> <b>sliding</b> on the boat, and the boat sliding relative to the rower, on the water. The relative movement of seat and flywheel {{are similar to the}} result of the rower moving at steadier average speed while the boat's speed varies much more relative to the rower.

50|$|Six {{or seven}} seats come as {{standard}} in most markets. The Viano {{can be turned}} into an eight-seat people carrier by fitting two three-seater benches in the rear. All rear <b>seats</b> <b>slide</b> in 1-inch (2.5 cm) increments, recline and can be turned to face one other. They can also be folded down or removed completely to increase the load capacity. A rear folding table is standard in six- and seven-seat layouts. The rear seats cannot be folded into the floor like on some rivals.|$|R
40|$|Rowers {{sit on a}} <b>seat</b> that <b>slides</b> {{relative}} to the boat/ergometer. If a rower lifts him or herself from this <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> at any time, the seat will move away from under them and the rowing action is disrupted. From a mechanical perspective, {{it is clear that}} the need for the rower to remain in contact with the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> at all times imposes position-dependent constraints on the forces exerted at the oar handle and the footstretcher. Here we investigate if the mechanical power output during rowing, which is strongly related to these forces, might be improved if the contact with the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> was of no concern to the rower. In particular, we examine if elimination of these constraints by strapping the rower to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> leads to an increase in performance during the start on a standard rowing ergometer. Eleven well-trained female rowers performed 5 -stroke starts in normal and strapped conditions. Handle force, vertical seat force, footstretcher force, and handle kinematics were recorded, from which mechanical power and work output were calculated. Most of the relevant mechanical variables differed significantly between the normal and strapped conditions. Most importantly, mechanical power output (averaged over the 5 -stroke start) in the strapped condition was 12 % higher than in the normal condition. We conclude that strapping a rower's pelvis to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> allows more vigorous execution of the stroke phases, resulting in a substantial improvement in performance during the start of ergometer rowing...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{strapping}} rowers to their <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> on performance during 75 m on-water starting trials was investigated. Well-trained rowers performed 75 m maximum-effort starts using an instrumented single scull equipped with a redesigned <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> system, both under normal conditions and while strapped to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat.</b> Strapping rowers to their <b>sliding</b> <b>seat</b> resulted in a 0. 45 s lead after 75 m, corresponding {{to an increase in}} average boat velocity of about 2. 5 %. Corresponding effect sizes were large. No significant changes were observed in general stroke cycle characteristics. No indications of additional boat heaving and pitching under strapped conditions were found. The increase in boat velocity is estimated to correspond to an increase in average mechanical power output during the start of on-water rowing between 5 % and 10 %, which is substantial but smaller than the 12 % increase found in a previous study on ergometer starting. We conclude that, after {{a very short period of}} adaptation to the strapped condition, single-scull starting performance is substantially improved when the rower is strapped to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Sculling {{involves}} a seated rower who pulls on two oars or sculls, {{attached to the}} boat, thereby moving the boat in the direction opposite that which the rower faces.

Boats in which the rowers are coordinated by a coxswain {{are referred to as}} a [...] "coxed" [...] pair/four/eight. Sometimes <b>sliding</b> <b>seats</b> are used to enable the rower to use the leg muscles, substantially increasing the power available. An alternative to the <b>sliding</b> <b>seat,</b> called a <b>sliding</b> rigger, uses a stationary seat and the rower moves the oarlocks with his feet.
