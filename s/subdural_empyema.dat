50|$|Bacterial or {{occasionally}} {{fungal infection}} of the skull bones or air sinuses can spread to the subdural space, producing a <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema.</b> The underlying arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces are usually unaffected, but a large <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema</b> may produce a mass effect. Further, a thrombophlebitis may develop in the bridging veins that cross the subdural space, resulting in venous occlusion and infarction of the brain. With treatment, including surgical drainage, resolution of the empyema occurs from the dural side, and, if it is complete, a thickened dura {{may be the only}} residual finding. Symptoms include those referable to the source of the infection. In addition, most patients are febrile, with headache and neck stiffness, and, if untreated, may develop focal neurologic signs, lethargy, and coma. The CSF profile is similar to that seen in brain abscesses, because both are parameningeal infectious processes. If diagnosis and treatment are prompt, complete recovery is usual.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that surgery is the best treatment for chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH), {{the extent of the}} surgical intervention is not well defined. METHODS: The less invasive surgical technique of bedside percutaneous subdural tapping and spontaneous haematoma efflux after twist drill craniostomy under local anaesthesia was prospectively analysed in 118 adult patients, 99 with unilateral and 19 with bilateral CSDH. RESULTS: The mean number of subdural tappings was 3. 2. Ninety two of the patients with unilateral CSDH were successfully treated by up to five subdural tappings, 95 % of the patients with bilateral CSDH were successfully treated by up to 10 subdural tappings. The mean duration of inpatient treatment was 12 days. In 11 patients (9 %) the treatment protocol had to be abandoned because of two acute subdural bleedings, two <b>subdural</b> <b>empyemas,</b> and seven cases of insufficient haematoma efflux and no neurological improvement. The only significant predictor for failure of the described treatment protocol was septation visible on preoperative CT. CONCLUSIONS: The described therapy protocol is-apart from a purely conservative treatment-the least invasive presently available surgical technique for treating chronic subdural haematoma. Its results are comparable with other modern treatment protocols. Thus, it can be recommended in all patients as a first and minimally invasive therapy, especially in patients in a poor general condition. Patients with septation visible on preoperative CT should be excluded from this form of treatment...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Complications in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) from acute otitis media (AOM) and chronic otitis media (COM) are {{becoming}} fewer, although they still represent a challenge for early recognition, adequate treatment, and satisfactory results. This retrospective study analyzed clinical data and therapeutic options in 33 patients with intracranial involvement resulting from otitis media. Important clinical features of intracranial complications and the sequence of the most efficient therapeutic maneuvers are discussed. METHODS: Charts of six patients with AOM and 27 patients with COM associated with CNS complications were analyzed for clinical presentation, imaging, and therapeutic approach. RESULTS: Ages ranged from 6 months to 79 years, with no gender predilection. Persistent fever, headache, and purulent otorrhea were the main symptoms. Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common microorganisms in COM, and Pneumococus and Haemophilus were the most common microorganisms in AOM. Nineteen patients (58 %) presented with more than 1 CNS complication, resulting in a total of 56 complications, including 26 cases of otogenic brain abscess, 21 cases of meningitis, 5 cases of lateral sinus thromboses, two cases of <b>subdural</b> <b>empyemas,</b> 1 case of epidural empyema, and 1 case of meningocele. Surgical interventions included craniotomy and drainage of the abscess (n = 17), open mastoidectomy with abscess drained through the mastoid (n = 10), open mastoidectomy alone (n = 8), and closed mastoidectomy (n = 2). Twelve patients who underwent craniotomy had subsequent mastoidectomy for recurrent abscess. At the 6 -month, 66 % of patients presented without sequelae, 24 % presented with sequelae, and 9 % died. CONCLUSION: Early identification and prompt clinical and surgical intervention with mandatory drainage of the middle ear (primary disease), was essential for better outcome.

5000|$|Anaerobes {{are able}} to cause all types of {{intracranial}} infections. These often cause <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema,</b> and brain abscess, and rarely cause epidural abscess and meningitis. The origin of brain abscess is generally an adjacent chronic ear, mastoid, or sinus infection [...] oropharynx, teeth [...] or lungs. Mastoid and ear or infections generally progress to the temporal lobe or cerebellum, while facial sinusitis commonly causes frontal lobe abscess. Hematogenous spread of the infection into the CNS often occurs after oropharyngeal, dental, or pulmonary infection.

50|$|Pott's puffy tumor, first {{described}} by Sir Percivall Pott in 1760, {{is a rare}} clinical entity characterized by subperiosteal abscess associated with osteomyelitis. It is characterized by an osteomyelitis of the frontal bone, either direct or through haematogenic spread. This results in a swelling on the forehead, hence the name. The infection can also spread inwards, leading to an intracranial abscess. Pott's puffy tumor {{can be associated with}} cortical vein thrombosis, epidural abscess, <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema,</b> and brain abscess. The cause of vein thrombosis is explained by venous drainage of the frontal sinus, which occurs through diploic veins, which communicate with the dural venous plexus; septic thrombi can potentially evolve from foci within the frontal sinus and propagate through this venous system. This type of chronic osteomyelitis of the frontal bone is confused with acute sub-periosteal abscess of the frontal bone, which presents as a discrete collection over the frontal sinus.|$|E

40|$|<b>Subdural</b> <b>empyema</b> is a {{relatively}} rare condition that carries a high mortality if not treated adequately. The experience at Groote Schuur Hospital over 8 years from 1979 to 1986 was reviewed. 47 cases of <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema</b> following on contiguous or distant infection, or where the source was not known, were included in this study. <b>Subdural</b> <b>empyema</b> following cranial operation, head trauma~, or meningitis was excluded. Computer Tomographic scanning facilitated early diagnosis and pinpointed subdural collections, and was used postoperatively, to locate residual subdural pus, which was then drained. The results indicate that an aggressive approach using modern radiological techniques to guide surgical procedures, vastly improves the outcome from <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema.</b> The mortality rate was only 8, 5 %, while 72, 3 % of our patients were cured and returned to pre-disease activity. The availability of Computer Tomographic scanning {{in the management of}} <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema</b> improves the outcome of patients treated with burrhole drainage and diminishes the need for craniotomy. Rare cases may even be managed with antibiotics only.

Patients and Methods: Seventeen infants with post-meningitic <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema,</b> diagnosed using trans-fontanelle ultrasound alone and treated with subdural tapping over a 31 -months period, were studied. Results: Eleven patients presented with grades II and III Bannister and William grading for level of consciousness in intracranial <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema.</b> Aspirate from 7 (41. 2 %) patients were sterile.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Subdural</b> <b>empyema</b> {{represents}} a loculated infection between the dura and the arachnoid. It {{has been described}} either intracranially or in the spinal canal, the latter localization being quite rare. While treatment guidelines for a single (either brain or spinal) localization of a <b>subdural</b> <b>empyema</b> {{are more or less}} established, its management when a massive involvement of CNS is evident {{represents a}} challenge. METHODS: The authors describe a unique case of a 65 -year-old woman having a massive involvement of the entire CNS with multiple localizations, both intracranial and spinal. Early diagnosis was obtained through brain CT scans followed by cranio-spinal contrast enhanced MRI scans. Patient was treated with external ventricular drainage and suboccipital craniectomy, while on antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Patient's neurological condition gradually improved. By the end of the eighth hospital week, she was discharged without any neurological deficit.
