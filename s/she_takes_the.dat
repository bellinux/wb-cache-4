60|$|Leaving the house, {{with the}} {{children}} after her, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> filled bucket to the dust-heap, and emptied it in a hollow place among the rubbish, about half-way up <b>the</b> mound.

5|$|By {{the second}} verse, pink {{elephants}} float over the girl's bed and an animated fairy version of Madonna {{emerges from the}} picture and winks. <b>She</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> little girl through another picture, displaying mythological and fairytale beings such as dragons, princes and unicorns {{as well as a}} castle where Madonna dances with the moon. An underwater scene with mermaids and fish follows, then a parade of all the girl's toys around her room. As the song wraps, the fairy taps on the girl and causes her to yawn.

5|$|Ciocia {{writes that}} {{with half the}} novel taking place in {{theatrical}} settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, {{she is able to}} reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch's claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with Tipping the Velvet.|$|E

They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E

At Castle, Volkoff says goodbye to Mary before being returned to custody.|$|E

She pursues her nephew to Aksum itself and destroys his palace in the city.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop.

She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them.

25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{aspect of}} the Mami Wata deities is their connection to healing. If someone comes down with an incurable, languorous illness, Mami Wata often takes the blame. The illness is evidence that Mami Wata has taken {{an interest in the}} afflicted person and that only she can cure him or her. Similarly, several other ailments may be attributed to the water spirit. In Nigeria, for example, <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> blame for everything from headaches to sterility.|$|E
