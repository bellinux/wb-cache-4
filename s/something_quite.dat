She then traded as a merchantman before in 1810 receiving a letter of marque. She then did <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> unusual: she made a voyage to Africa where she captured five slave ships. After this Dart returned to normal trading, this time with South America. However, in 1813 as she was returning to London from Buenos Aires she stopped at Pernambuco, where she was condemned as unseaworthy.|$|E

25|$|At first, Rilke had a {{difficult}} time in Paris, an experience that he called on {{in the first part of}} his only novel, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. At the same time, his encounter with modernism was very stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved with the sculpture of Rodin, then the work of Paul Cézanne. For a time, he acted as Rodin's secretary, also lecturing and writing a long essay on Rodin and his work. Rodin taught him the value of objective observation and, under this influence, Rilke dramatically transformed his poetic style from the subjective and sometimes incantatory language of his earlier work into <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> new in European literature. The result was the New Poems, famous for the “thing-poems” expressing Rilke's rejuvenated artistic vision. During these years, Paris increasingly became the writer's main residence.|$|E
25|$|Virginia Woolf {{is taking}} her walk while {{thinking}} of ideas for her novel. She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway {{to have had}} one true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented {{a time when she}} was not afraid to go against the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> trivial, a representation of what her life has become and what has been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs.Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia feels about being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond.|$|E
25|$|In {{internal}} politics, Magnus {{carried out}} a great effort to modernise the law-code, which gave him his epithet law-mender. These were adopted at the Things in the years 1274 (Landslov) and 1276 (Byloven). In 1274 he promulgated the new national law, a unified code of laws {{to apply for the}} whole country, including the Faroe Islands and Shetland. This replaced the different regional laws which had existed before. It was supplemented by a new municipal law (a law for the cities) in 1276, and a slightly modified version was also drawn up for Iceland. A unified code of laws for a whole country was at this time <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> new, which had until then only been introduced in Sicily and Castile. His code introduced the concept that crime is an offense against the state rather than against the individual and thus narrowed the possibilities of personal vengeance. It increased the formal power of the king, making the throne the source of justice. The municipal law gave the cities increased freedom from rural control. A specific section fixed the law of succession to the throne, in accordance with the arrangements laid down by King Håkon Håkonsson in 1260.|$|E

25|$|However, all Equidae in North America {{ultimately}} became extinct. The {{causes of}} this extinction (simultaneous with the extinctions {{of a variety}} of other American megafauna) have been a matter of debate. Given the suddenness of the event and because these mammals had been flourishing for millions of years previously, <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> unusual must have happened. The first main hypothesis attributes extinction to climate change. For example, in Alaska, beginning approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants. The other hypothesis suggests extinction was linked to overexploitation by newly arrived humans of naive prey that were not habituated to their hunting methods. The extinctions were roughly simultaneous {{with the end of the}} most recent glacial advance and the appearance of the big game-hunting Clovis culture. Several studies have indicated humans probably arrived in Alaska at the same time or shortly before the local extinction of horses. Additionally, it has been proposed that the steppe-tundra vegetation transition in Beringia may have been a consequence, rather than a cause, of the extinction of megafaunal grazers.|$|E
500|$|On Thursday, 10 March 1300 (Julian calendar), {{wardrobe}} {{accounts of}} King Edward I of England included refunds to one John de Leek of monies {{that he had}} paid out to enable Prince Edward to play [...] "creag and other games" [...] at both Westminster and Newenden. Prince Edward, the future Prince of Wales, was then aged 15. It {{has been suggested that}} [...] "creag" [...] was an early form of cricket. However, creag could have been <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> different. Creag is possibly an early spelling of the word craic here taken as an Irish word meaning fun, entertainment, or enjoyable conversation. This sense of the word crack is found in Irish English, Scottish English, and Geordie in North East England. In Ireland the spelling craic is now more common than crack.|$|E

500|$|Serializing tokens {{are used}} to prevent {{concurrent}} accesses from other CPUs and may be held simultaneously by multiple threads, ensuring that only one of those threads is running at any given time. Blocked or sleeping threads therefore do not prevent other threads from accessing the shared resource unlike a thread that is holding a mutex. Among other things, the use of serializing tokens prevents many of the situations {{that could result in}} deadlocks and priority inversions when using mutexes, as well as greatly simplifying the design and implementation of a many-step procedure that would require a resource to be shared among multiple threads. The serializing token code is evolving into <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> similar to the [...] "Read-copy-update" [...] feature now available in Linux. Unlike Linux's current RCU implementation, DragonFly's is being implemented such that only processors competing for the same token are affected rather than all processors in the computer.|$|E
500|$|In 1912 Ravel {{had three}} ballets premiered. The first, to the orchestrated and {{expanded}} version of Ma mère l'Oye, {{opened at the}} Théâtre des Arts in January. The reviews were excellent: the Mercure de France called the score [...] "absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature". The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall, London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year. The Times praised [...] "the enchantment of the work... the effect of mirage, by which <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> real seems to float on nothing." [...] New York audiences heard {{the work in the}} same year. Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs, danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales, which opened at the Châtelet in April. Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June. This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete.|$|E
500|$|In Gilbert's 1874 burlesque, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the {{character}} Hamlet, {{in his speech}} to the players, sums up Gilbert's theory of comic acting: [...] "I hold {{that there is no}} such antick fellow as your bombastical hero who doth so earnestly spout forth his folly as to make his hearers believe that he is unconscious of all incongruity". Robertson [...] "introduced Gilbert both to the revolutionary notion of disciplined rehearsals and to mise-en-scène or unity of style in the whole presentation – direction, design, music, acting." [...] Like Robertson, Gilbert demanded discipline in his actors. [...] He required that his actors know their words perfectly, enunciate them clearly and obey his stage directions, which was <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> new to many actors of the day. A major innovation was the replacement of the star actor with the disciplined ensemble, [...] "raising the director to a new position of dominance" [...] in the theatre. [...] "That Gilbert was a good director is not in doubt. He was able to extract from his actors natural, clear performances, which served the Gilbertian requirements of outrageousness delivered straight." ...|$|E

It was, 'What if you’d made different decisions?' That made it for us a much more fun puzzle."

500|$|Bacon {{said that}} chance played a {{significant}} role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas [...] "in a bad mood of drinking... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing." [...] He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that [...] "perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces, and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years.|$|E

[...] Ali Larter missed seven episodes of filming the television show Heroes in order to appear in the film. Before Wentworth Miller was cast as Chris Redfield, actor Johnny Messner auditioned for the role. Having never played the Resident Evil video games, Miller began preparing for the role by searching the internet for images of Chris Redfield. Much to his surprise, he noticed how muscular the character was; with only three weeks to prep before shooting, he knew it was impossible to increase his muscle mass to that extent. He was shown video footage of the games and saw how he was visually different, especially in the first game. He did cardio to build up endurance. [...] Miller described his interpretation on the character from the video game as, [...] "He's definitely capable and heroic, but there's also <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> innocent. He was still freshly scrubbed, in a way, {{at the beginning of this}} horrifying journey." [...] He described his take as the character in the film, [...] "My Chris has been walking down this particular road for quite some time. The edges are sharper, and they’re way more jagged." ...|$|E

Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to shake things up and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mostly positive reviews commending Burke's vocals and {{the mainstream}} R/pop feel {{and production of}} the song. Matthew Chisling of Allmusic called the track [...] "the most brilliant, perfect mainstream pop single of 2009", commending the song's synthesized beat and larger-than-life chorus, and Flo Rida's rap, stating that it made Burke [...] "the prime UK import for the North American market". Popjustice called the song [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "phenomenal", commending the song's [...] "Womanizer"-like intro and the chorus’s strong melodic topline. The review praised Burke's vocals, calling them [...] "Whitneyish in parts" [...] and compared them to Donna Summer. Although the review noted the song was not built for Burke's extreme vocals, it said, [...] "that there's <b>something</b> <b>quite</b> exciting about an incredible singer being forced to follow a very strong and melodic topline instead of going all over the show." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com also said the song was reminiscent of Donna Summer, and said, [...] "Big international success seems a real possibility as Burke steps into the battle for R diva crown." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy said the song complimented Burke's [...] "sass and all-around performance skill" [...] rather than a ballad would, and called the song [...] "fun", pulling off a [...] "minor pop miracle- turning a cameo by Flo Rida into a good thing". Alexis Petrids of The Guardian noted although some may see the single as [...] "generic", and [...] "currently pop's factory-default setting", he ascertained the song was [...] "a superior example of the type, furnished with an effortlessly unshakeable chorus". Although Harry Guerin of RTÉ noted the production and formula of the music was a flaw of the album, he noted that that technique worked in [...] "Bad Boys". Simon Price of The Independent was more critical of the song, calling it a [...] "pale imitation" [...] of Britney Spears' [...] "Womanizer".|$|E
