2500|$|Recently, Dodger Stadium {{has been}} more neutral with respect to home runs. The stadium does depress doubles and triples quite a bit, due to its uniform outfield walls and {{relatively}} small [...] "corners" [...] near the foul poles. However, the extremely short outfield walls near the foul poles also make some balls that would bounce off the wall in other parks go for home runs. With some expansion of the box <b>seat</b> <b>area</b> {{and the removal of}} significant foul territory, the ballpark has become more neutral, favoring neither pitchers nor hitters. Baseball-Reference's Park Factor measurement of 102 for the 2006 and 2007 seasons is evidence of this.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 September 1946, de Havilland officially put {{together}} a design team consisting of Fred Buller, Dick Hiscocks, Jim Houston and W. Jakimiuk, led by Phil Garratt. The new aircraft {{was designed to be}} all-metal (unlike older designs, like the famous Noorduyn Norseman), using [...] "steel from the engine to the firewall, heavy aluminum truss frames with panels and doors throughout the front <b>seat</b> <b>area,</b> lighter trusses toward the rear and all monocoque construction aft". At the time, de Havilland Canada was still a British-owned company and there were plans to fit the evolving design with the British de Havilland Gipsy engine. As a result of its comparatively limited power, the wing area was greatly increased in order to maintain STOL performance. When Pratt & Whitney Canada offered to supply war-surplus [...] Wasp Junior radial engines at a low price, the aircraft ended up with extra power as well as the original long wing. The result was unbeatable STOL performance for an aircraft of its size.|$|E
