40|$|The {{development}} of an ultrasound based Transdermal drug delivery device (or sonophoresis) has received increased attention {{over the past few}} years. Meaningful enhanced carrying of model drugs such as mannitol and insulin has been determined using commercial <b>sonicators.</b> However, its practical use is hampered by its large size and weight of the common ultrasound transducer devices. In this project work, a remote controlled drug delivery system (sonophoresis device) with a flat flextensional ultrasound transducer was proposed. It is clearly known that low frequency ultrasound can be used to enhance transdermal drug penetration which is known as sonophoresis. Scientifically, acoustic cavitations outcome in the creation of defects in the stratum corneum allows accelerated absorption of currently applied molecules. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a low cast optimized remotely controlled sonophoresis device with variable resonant frequency for studying Transdermal drug delivery in vitro. Following acoustic validation, 21. 75 kHz ultrasound was applied for different durations (range: 5 s to 1 min) using three different modes (10 %, 33 % or 100 % duty cycles). The simulation result of first resonance frequency was found to be comparable to that of the experimental result. In comparison with the other types of sonophoresis device, it has a simple structure and its fabrication process is easy and inexpensive...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the influence of}} acoustic streaming induced by low-frequency (24 kHz) ultrasound irradiation on mass transfer in a two-phase system. The main objective is to discuss the possible mass transfer improvements under ultrasound irradiation. Three analyses were conducted: i) experimental analysis of mass transfer under ultrasound irradiation; ii) comparative analysis between {{the results of the}} ultrasound assisted mass transfer with that obtained from mechanically stirring; and iii) computational analysis of the systems using 3 D CFD simulation. In the experimental part, the interactive effects of liquid rheological properties, ultrasound power and superficial gas velocity on mass transfer were investigated in two different <b>sonicators.</b> The results were then compared with that of mechanical stirring. In the computational part, the results were illustrated as a function of acoustic streaming behaviour, fluid flow pattern, gas/liquid volume fraction and turbulence in the two-phase system and finally the mass transfer coefficient was specified. It was found that additional turbulence created by ultrasound played the most important role on intensifying the mass transfer phenomena compared to that in stirred vessel. Furthermore, long residence time which depends on geometrical parameters is another key for mass transfer. The results obtained in the present study would help researchers understand the role of ultrasound as an energy source and acoustic streaming {{as one of the most}} important of ultrasound waves on intensifying gas-liquid mass transfer in a two-phase system and can be a breakthrough in the design procedure as no similar studies were found in the existing literature...|$|R
40|$|Correlating gene {{expression}} with cell behavior is ideally {{done at the}} single-cell level. However, this is not easily achieved because {{the small amount of}} labile mRNA present in a single cell (1 - 5 % of 1 - 50 pg total RNA, or 0. 01 - 2. 5 pg mRNA, per cell) mostly degrades before it can be reverse transcribed into a stable cDNA copy. For example, using standard laboratory reagents and hardware, {{only a small number of}} genes can be qualitatively assessed per cell. One way to increase the efficiency of standard laboratory reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions (i. e. standard reagents in microliter volumes) comprising single-cell amounts of mRNA would be to more rapidly mix the reagents so the mRNA can be converted to cDNA before it degrades. However this is not trivial because at microliter scales liquid flow is laminar, i. e. currently available methods of mixing (i. e. shaking, vortexing and trituration) fail to produce sufficient chaotic motion to effectively mix reagents. To solve this problem, micro-scale mixing techniques have to be used. A number of microfluidic-based mixing technologies have been developed which successfully increase RT reaction yields. However, microfluidics technologies require specialized hardware that is relatively expensive and not yet widely available. A cheaper, more convenient solution is desirable. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate how application of a novel 'micromixing' technique to standard laboratory RT reactions comprising single-cell quantities of mRNA significantly increases their cDNA yields. We find cDNA yields increase by approximately 10 - 100 -fold, which enables: (1) greater numbers of genes to be analyzed per cell; (2) more quantitative analysis of {{gene expression}}; and (3) better detection of low-abundance genes in single cells. The micromixing is based on acoustic microstreaming, a phenomenon where sound waves propagating around a small obstacle create a mean flow near the obstacle. We have developed an acoustic microstreaming-based device ('micromixer') with a key simplification; acoustic microstreaming can be achieved at audio frequencies by ensuring the system has a liquid-air interface with a small radius of curvature. The meniscus of a microliter volume of solution in a tube provides an appropriately small radius of curvature. The use of audio frequencies means that the hardware can be inexpensive and versatile, and nucleic acids and other biochemical reagents are not damaged like they can be with standard laboratory <b>sonicators...</b>|$|R

Once cooled, the solution is poured into a larger flask and the thick precipitate, an insoluble solid, that is formed is scraped out. From there, ethanol is added to coagulate the particles, or change the particles to a solid state. Most of the supernatant, the liquid lying above a layer of the precipitate, is then poured out so that the remaining liquid can be centrifuged, or separated. After the process of centrifugation, the particles are placed back in water and forced through a syringe filter to remove unnecessary particles in the solution. Next, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is added as a binder and the entire mixtures is homogenized. The solvents are allowed to evaporate until the ink has a desired viscosity. or thickness.|$|E

Dual staining reduced serious background fluorescence, particularly when used for silt-, clay-, and detritus-rich sediments, and allowed us to distinguish bacteria from other objects during both counting and sizing. Within the studied samples, the number of bacterial cells ranged from 0. 20 × 109 to 3. 54 × 109 g of wet sediment− 1. With the cleaner and <b>sonicator</b> treatments, the bacterial numbers {{for all of the}} sites initially increased with dispersion time and then became constant. For the homogenizer treatments, the highest bacterial numbers were observed with the shortest (0. 5 - to 2 -min) treatments, and the counts then declined steeply as the homogenization time increased, indicating that cell destruction occurred. The cleaner treatment had the possibility of insufficient dispersion of bacteria for fine-grain sediments. Within the studied samples, the bacterial biovolume ranged from 0. 07 to 0. 22 μm 3. With the cleaner and <b>sonicator</b> treatments, the biovolume peaked during the shorter dispersion time. This pattern was caused not by cell destruction but by the incremental portion of dispersed small cells. We concluded that with the cleaner and <b>sonicator</b> treatments, the longer dispersion time reflected the real size spectrum and was preferable for accurate estimation of mean bacterial biovolumes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For {{application}} in a portable transdermal drug-delivery system, novel transducers {{have been designed}} to enhance insulin transmission across skin using ultrasound. Previous research has shown transdermal delivery of insulin across skin using commercial sonicators operating at 20 kHz with intensities ranging from 12. 5 to 225 mW/cm 2.

To obtain this intensity range, a cymbal transducer design was chosen because of its light, compact structure and low resonance frequency in water. To increase the spatial ultrasound field for drug delivery across skin, two arrays, each comprising of four cymbal transducers, were constructed. The first array, designated the standard array, used four cymbals transducer elements in parallel. A second array (named the stack array) used four cymbal transducers that used stacked piezoelectric discs to drive the titanium flextensional caps. Under similar driving conditions, the standard array produced intensities comparable to those achieved using a commercial <b>sonicator.</b> I...|$|E
