5|$|The {{kings and}} queens regnant of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (divinitus) to cure by {{touching}} or <b>stroking</b> <b>the</b> diseased. This special aptitude {{was thought to be}} evidence of God's high esteem of the two monarchies, though they never agreed upon whose predecessors the ability was first conferred. In England, Saint Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess the healing power of the royal touch. The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to Philip I (r. 1059–1108) or even Robert II (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch. They insisted that the first English monarch to claim the ability was Henry I (r. 1100–1135), and that his touching was a politically influenced imitation of the gift granted exclusively to French monarchs.|$|E

25|$|This time though, the openers began solidly {{putting on}} 50 {{for the first}} time in the series. When Ramesh was dismissed, Ganguly sent in VVS Laxman. Rahul Dravid had been {{struggling}} for runs for a while and Laxman had been <b>stroking</b> <b>the</b> ball well before his unfortunate dismissal. Interestingly, Laxman had been asked to open the innings in this match but had refused. He seemed to pick up from where he had left off, batting serenely, and at times aggressively – a reminder that there were no demons in the pitch. Das departed, unfortunate to hit the stumps with his heels while having executed an immaculate pull shot to end a promising partnership with Laxman. Tendulkar soon followed, for a second failure in the match but Laxman found a willing ally in Sourav Ganguly. The pair set about repairing the damage done raising a hundred for the 4th wicket, but just when it seemed India would end the day with some semblance of balance, McGrath induced an edge that was lapped up gleefully by Gilchrist to dismiss Ganguly 2 runs short of a deserved half century. Out came Rahul Dravid, with scorecard reading 232/4. Laxman duly completed a hundred in Dravid's company.|$|E

Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy <b>stroking</b> <b>the</b> hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: [...] "It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible.

A brace from Bergkamp and a debut goal scored by Kanu – dumming the goalkeeper inside the penalty box and {{shooting}} past {{the middle of the}} net, meant the club now picked up 27 points out of a possible last 33. A 2–0 win against Everton was followed by another 2–0 win, at home to Coventry City. Arsenal drew 0–0 with Southampton on 3 April 1999, which left the team four points behind league leaders Manchester United. A 1–0 victory against Blackburn Rovers three days later, helped them move a point behind first position.

GameSpy's Gerald Villoria thought the tradeoffs between both versions made them equally enjoyable. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com assured readers in his review that the less physically demanding gameplay of the DS version made the game accessible for extended periods of time. Fitch further stated that in nearly [...] "every case, events [...] far more enjoyable on the DS" [...] due to the requirement of the human body's finer motor skill abilities to control the characters. However, Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson noted {{that the lack of}} physical demand reduced the players' engrossment with the game. Craig Harris of IGN had a similar opinion, stating, [...] "Rapidly drumming the controllers is far more challenging than quickly <b>stroking</b> <b>the</b> touchscreen."

40|$|M. A. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compile a psychological information program on stroke, and to provide this psychological information to the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. <b>The</b> emotional status of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was evaluated during the intervention. The final goal {{of this research was}} to give a phenomenological description of the experiences of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. <b>The</b> method for collecting data was 1) to evaluate the emotional status of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient with <b>the</b> POMS (Profile Of Mood State) inventory before he was exposed to the content of the psychological information program on <b>stroke.</b> 2) <b>The</b> spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was then introduced to the psychological information program, and any questions which arose were answered. 3) A follow up appointment was arranged for ten days later. During this appointment the POMS inventory was administered again to assess the spouse's emotional status after exposure to the psychological informationprogram on stroke. Any further questions were answered. Within a framework of identified themes a phenomenological description of the experiences of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was given. The most important experiences were identified as confusion, anxiety, tension, rage, frustration, tiredness, and feelings of not being motivated and depression. The phenomenological themes were "Om-te-wees (Dasein) ", "Die wereld", "In-die-wereld-wees", "Om-ingegooi-tewees- in-die-wereld", "Angs as basiese ingesteldheid tot die wereld" and "Liggaamlikheid". The current research was motivated after a thorough study of <b>the</b> literature on <b>stroke.</b> <b>The</b> literature survey revealed a deficiency in terms of availability of information on <b>stroke</b> to <b>the</b> spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient after <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> has occured. <b>The</b> literature survey disclosed that the focus of research has been on <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. Research identified the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient as <b>the</b> primary caretaker. Therefore {{it is important that the}} spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient will have access to psychological information on stroke to assist them during their tasks of caretaking. Certain variables influenced theresults of the present research project. These variables were 1) the time when the psychological information was provided to the subjects, 2) the emotional status after <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> had occurred, and 3) the extent of information the subjects received from other resources. During the current research project the subjects confirmed the value of the availability of psychological information on <b>stroke.</b> <b>The</b> psychological information on stroke is important in assisting the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient during their tasks of caret•king.

2500|$|Peter May won the toss for {{the third}} time in a row and again decided to bat {{regardless}} of the ill-omens as the wicket looked easy going and was expected to take spin. Stonewaller Trevor Bailey who had been promoted in the batting order from 6 to 3, then 2 and was now asked to go in first with Arthur Milton. They were both out for 8 to Ian Meckiff and Alan Davidson and England were 23/2. Once again the England opening partnership had failed and Bailey, a considerable stumbling block for the bowlers down the order had been sacrificed at the top of the order. Tom Graveney (33) and Peter May (42) restored the innings as the fast bowlers found little swing, but Benaud kept them on for over an hour and May edged a ball past Neil Harvey at slip. With the shine taken off the new ball the pacemen were taken off and the spinners brought on, Richie Benaud getting turn almost at once and appealed for leg before wicket against May, but it was turned down. Keith Slater's first Test wicket was May after he had been hit for 4 and 2 and the captain looked in fine form, Slater getting the ball to hang back and it was hit where Benaud had placed Ken Mackay in the covers a few balls before, where he took a fine catch. Graveney edged Benaud just past Harvey which he managed to take for another stunning catch and Dexter was l.b.w. offering no stroke to Slater (2/40) and England were 98/5. The debutant Roy Swetman joined Colin Cowdrey to a great ovation from the 50,000 in the stands and survived a difficult catch to Harvey and another to Colin McDonald who had replaced [...] "The Claw" [...] at leg-slip, both chances off Benaud. The young wicket-keeper used his feet to go down the wicket, so when he padded up he could not given l.b.w., and began to make some runs with Cowdrey <b>stroking</b> <b>the</b> ball through the covers. After tea the vice-captain (34) gave Harvey another catch off Benaud, but Swetman and Tony Lock saw England safely to stumps with 190/6. The next day's start was delayed to past tea because of rain, made worse by the inadequate covering of the infield. When they finally resumed Benaud was spinning the ball more than ever and declined to take the new ball. Lock was out l.b.w. to Mackay, who ended Swetman's fine innings of 41 with another great catch off Benaud. Harvey also accounted for Jim Laker when he knocked the ball up into the air on the first attempt and ran five yards to catch it. Seeing the end was near Fred Trueman scattered the close fielders with a few powerful strokes and heaved the ball into the stands, but he was caught by Burke off Benaud to give the Australian captain 5/83 and England were out for 219. The first day was watched by John Mills and Trevor Howard, who were acting in Australia at the time.
