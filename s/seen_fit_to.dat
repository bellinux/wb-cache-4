5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the Labour Party {{broke out of}} the Comintern. Subsequently the Communist Party {{broke away from the}} Labour Party. The local chapter of the Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the Communist Party in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E

25|$|Although Force Recon {{has never}} {{been part of the}} United States Special Operations Command, their {{missions}} slightly differentiate themselves from other United States Special Operations Forces units. Colloquially, they are specialized in all tactical areas of warfare. Force Recon will train with other Special Operations forces, such as, United States Navy SEALs, United States Army Special Forces, and United States Air Force Pararescue, in order to master all skill sets. The Marine Corps has <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> train versatile specialists rather than specialists in individual areas of combat.|$|E
25|$|Rather, Frankfurter said, the {{constitutional}} and the interpretative issues were ripe for review. Frankfurter {{pointed out that}} during oral argument before the Supreme Court, the federal government claimed that the district court had misread and misinterpreted its claims. The district court, Frankfurter said, had three times argued {{that the government had}} admitted that Section 304 abridged rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. However, that was not the admission of the government, federal attorneys said. If the court had misinterpreted the government's position, Frankfurter concluded, the case should be remanded for further proceedings rather than adjudicated. However, since a majority has <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> grant certiorari, Frankfurter reluctantly agreed to concur in the majority opinion.|$|E

25|$|Mannock visited Biggin Hill, an aerodrome {{situated}} on high ground near Croydon. At {{the time this}} was used for carrying out wireless experiments under Major H T B Childs. It is not known if Mannock participated in these tests. Save for one Sopwith Pup, the aerodrome had no aircraft for some time until 141 Squadron took residence with Bristol F.2 Fighters to protect against Zeppelin and Gotha G.V air raids. The squadron arrival coincided with Mannock's posting to 74 Squadron at London Colney. The formation was formed in July 1917 at Northolt as a Training Depot Squadron (TDS) and then Training Squadron (TS). It was <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> promote the unit to combat operations and give Mannock a position of senior flight commander in February 1918.|$|E
500|$|Fanciful {{tales of}} peers with {{whimsical}} privileges circulate, {{such as that}} of the right to wear a hat {{in the presence of the}} Sovereign. [...] The most persistent example of such a legend is that of the Kingsale hat. According to the fable, John de Courcy, Earl of Ulster, obtained from King John the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. Though the tale is untrue—de Courcy was never made an earl and did not receive such a privilege—several authorities on the peerage have <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> repeat it. A 19th-century edition of Burke's Peerage suggests the origins of the privilege: ...|$|E

The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> print; they were published by Schocken Books in 1948 as , including additionally The First Long Train Journey, written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka's [...] "A Novel about Youth", a review of Felix Sternheim's Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald, his essay on Kleist's [...] "Anecdotes", his review of the literary magazine Hyperion, and an epilogue by Brod.|$|E

500|$|Section 9A(3)(d) {{allows the}} court to {{consider}} [...] "any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament". Under this provision, material relating to the original Act may be looked at in interpreting an amendment. However, {{it would not be}} wise to set a precedent for the unregulated use of original material in construing a subsequent amendment. After all, it is not a rule that Parliament must legislate consistently with past legislation. On the contrary, subsequent legislation must, where inconsistent with its predecessor, prevail over it. The objective of the court is not to construe all legislation as if Parliament was in some way bound by its intentions when it first passed the Act. It is to construe why Parliament has <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> amend that Act {{in the light of the}} inadequacies that the passage of time has revealed or new needs carried by the tide of progress.|$|E
500|$|On October14, 1949, {{after the}} defense rested their case, the judge gave the jury {{instructions}} {{to guide them}} in reaching a verdict. He instructed the jury that the prosecution was not required {{to prove that the}} danger of violence was [...] "clear and present"; instead, the jury should consider if the defendants had advocated communist policy as a [...] "rule or principle of action" [...] with the intention of inciting overthrow by violence [...] "as speedily as circumstances would permit". This instruction was in response to the defendants, who endorsed the [...] "clear and present danger" [...] test, yet that test was not adopted as law by the Supreme Court. The judge's instructions included the phrase [...] "I find {{as a matter of law}} that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil..." [...] which would later be challenged by the defense during their appeals. Belknap (1994), p 221. [...] Redish, p 87. [...] One instruction from Medina to the jury was [...] "I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress had a right to prevent, to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution." [...] After deliberating for seven and one-half hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts against all eleven defendants. The judge sentenced ten defendants to five years and a $10,000 fine each ($ in [...] dollars). The eleventh defendant, Robert G. Thompsona veteran of World WarIIwas sentenced to three years in consideration of his wartime service. Thompson said that he took [...] "no pleasure that this Wall Street judicial flunky has <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> equate my possession of the Distinguished Service Cross to two years in prison."

2500|$|Donovan argued Smiley's {{case before}} the justices. Late fees, he said, were not {{interest}} whatever the Comptroller's regulation said since they were fixed amounts and did not vary based on the money owed or schedule of payments.

For {{more than a hundred}} years, he noted, OCC had not <b>seen</b> <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> define specifically what kind of payments were considered interest. Yet, coincidentally, only when a case turning on that issue appeared headed to the Supreme Court did it see a need to do so.|$|E

Congress and the administrative agencies have authority over the discipline and efficiency of the public service. When actions of civil servants in the judgment of Congress menace the integrity and the competency of the service, legislation to forestall such danger and adequate to maintain its usefulness is required.
