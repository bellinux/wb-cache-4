60|$|The Pussum lay in her bed, motionless, her round, {{dark eyes}} like black, unhappy pools. He {{could only see}} the black, {{bottomless}} pools of her eyes. Perhaps she suffered. The sensation of her inchoate suffering roused the old <b>sharp</b> <b>flame</b> in him, a mordant pity, a passion almost of cruelty.|$|E
60|$|And an obstinacy in him {{made him}} {{put his arm}} round her and draw her to the shadow. She submitted: let him try what he could do. Let him try what he could do. He leaned {{against the side of}} the stack, holding her. The stack stung him keenly with a {{thousand}} cold, <b>sharp</b> <b>flames.</b> Still obstinately he held her.|$|R

50|$|Baragon (not to be {{confused}} with the Toho monster of the same name): Appears in episode 49. Powers include flight, swimming, yellow eye beams, a double sided trident, spiked steel hair from the dragon head that can form a large pincer claw, mouth lava and <b>flames,</b> <b>sharp</b> talons, spike missiles from the side heads, a barbed machete, and a bladed nasal horn. Appears in Super Robot Wars Compact 2 and Impact.|$|R
60|$|Just as Hazard was boasting of the {{innocuous}} {{character of}} a volcano, that near them fired a gun, as the men afterwards called it, casting into the air a large flight of cinders and stones, accompanied by a <b>sharp</b> flash of <b>flame.</b> All the lighter materials drove away to leeward, but the heavier followed the law of projectiles, and scattered in all directions. Several stones of some size fell quite close to the schooner, and a few smaller actually came down on her decks.|$|R
60|$|Is its flame quenchless? and {{are those}} gates {{that keep the}} way indeed {{passable}} no more? or is it not rather that we no more desire to enter? For what can we conceive of that first Eden which we might not yet win back, if we chose? It was a place full of flowers, we say. Well: the flowers are always striving to grow wherever we suffer them; and the fairer, the closer. There may, indeed, have been a Fall of Flowers, as a Fall of Man; but assuredly creatures such as we are can now fancy nothing lovelier than roses and lilies, which would grow for us side by side, leaf overlapping leaf, till the Earth was white and red with them, if we cared to have it so. And Paradise was full of pleasant shades and fruitful avenues. Well: what hinders us from covering {{as much of the}} world as we like with pleasant shade, and pure blossom, and goodly fruit? Who forbids its valleys to be covered over with corn till they laugh and sing? Who prevents its dark forests, ghostly and uninhabitable, from being changed into infinite orchards, wreathing the hills with frail-floreted snow, far away to the half-lighted horizon of April, and flushing the face of all the autumnal earth with glow of clustered food? But Paradise was a place of peace, we say, and all the animals were gentle servants to us. Well: the world would yet be a place of peace if we were all peacemakers, and gentle service should we have of its creatures if we gave them gentle mastery. But so long as we make sport of slaying bird and beast, so long as we choose to contend rather with our fellows than with our faults, and make battlefield of our meadows instead of pasture--so long, truly, the Flaming Sword will still turn every way, and the gates of Eden remain barred close enough, till we have sheathed the <b>sharper</b> <b>flame</b> of our own passions, and broken down the closer gates of our own hearts.|$|R
40|$|Pyramid <b>sharp</b> {{pyrolysis}} <b>flame</b> is a {{new method}} for carbon nanotubes synthesis. Oxy-acetylene flame outside the frustum of pyramid sharp reactor provides the necessary high temperature circumstance for carbon nanotubes synthesis, while inside the interior mixture of CO, H 2, He, and iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) 5) is heated. CO is used {{as the source of}} carbon, Fe(CO) 5 as the source of catalyst precursor. Special structure of the frustum of pyramid sharp reactor makes the oxy-acetylene flame folded gradually above the reactor. And it meets the condition that the interior mixture which has reacted initially under high temperature and will flow out of reactor avoids exposing to air completely and burning abundantly. Immersing a sampling substrate into the incomplete burning flame can gain carbon nanotubes. By adjusting the distance between the oxy-acetylene flame jet and the synthesis area, achieved the purpose that just changing one factor of synthesis or pyrolysis temperature while the other one constant, then respectively studied the effects of them on experimental. The perfect synthesis temperature in experimental is about 595 ℃, while the pyrolysis temperature is about 1000 ℃. Carbon nanotubes have attracted extensive attention in scientific field since they were discovered by Iijima [1]. Due to their unique structure and physical properties, carbon nanotubes have bee...|$|R
40|$|Lean limit {{flames of}} H 2 -CH 4 -air {{mixtures}} stabilized inside a tube with an inner diameter of 30  mm in a downward flow are studied experimentally and numerically. A transition from bubble-like flames, {{with a long}} decaying skirt, to cap-like <b>flames</b> with a <b>sharp</b> visible <b>flame</b> edge at the bottom is observed as the lean flammability limit is approached. This transition is accompanied by formation of a secondary weak flame front inside the cap-like flame. The CH* chemiluminescence distribution of the studied flames is recorded and the velocity field of the lean limit flames is measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The flame temperature field is measured utilizing the Rayleigh scattering method. Numerical prediction with a mixture-averaged transport model and skeletal mechanism for CH 4 qualitatively reproduces the above experimentally observed phenomena. The presence of negative flame displacement speed for the entire {{leading edge of the}} cap-like flames is numerically predicted and experimentally demonstrated. The secondary weak flame front is located in a region with reverse upward flow of the recirculation zone, which is found to support the propagation of the leading edge with a negative flame displacement speed. Furthermore, radiative heat loss has a significant influence on the lean flammability limit of the cap-like flames...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pyramid <b>sharped</b> {{pyrolysis}} <b>flame</b> is a {{new method}} for carbon nanotubes synthesis. Oxy-acetylene flame outside the frustum of pyramid sharped reactor provides the necessary high temperature environment, while CO is used {{as the source of}} carbon, iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) 5) as the source of catalyst precursor in reactor. Inside, the mixture of CO, H 2, and Fe(CO) 5 will burn incompletely after initial reaction under high temperature. Immerging a sampling substrate into the incomplete burning flame can gain carbon nanotubes. Field emission scanning electron microscope and High resolution transmission electron microscopy were used to illustrate the results of experimental. By adjusting the distance between the oxy-acetylene flame jet and the synthesis zone, the purpose that only changing one factor of synthesis or pyrolysis temperature while the other one constant was achieved, then respectively studied the effects of them on experimental. The best synthesis temperature in experimental is about 590 °C and pyrolysis temperature is about 1000 °C. Effects of sampling time were also studied. 300 s is economic for carbon nanotubes synthesis. Synthesis process of carbon nanotubes was discussed starting from the sampling time. The first 60 s is the time for the temperature rise of sampling substrate. After the decalescence and thermal dissipation of substrate is balance, the temperature of substrate is fixed, and the main synthesis phase of carbon nanotubes begin...|$|R
