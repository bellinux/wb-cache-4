40|$|There {{has always}} been a desire to develop {{industrial}} processes that minimize the resources they use, and the wastes they generate. The problem is when new guidelines are forced upon long established processes, such as <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> operations. This means instead of integrating an emission reduction technology into the original design of the process, it is added on after the fact. This significantly increases the costs associated with treating emissions. In this work the ultimate goal is the design of an “add-on” abatement system to treat emissions from <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> processes with high destruction efficiency, and lower costs than systems in current use. Since emissions from processes that utilize solvent based coatings are primarily comprised of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the treatment of these compounds will be the focus. VOCs themselves contain a significant amount of energy. If these compounds could be destroyed by simultaneously extracting the energy they release, operational costs could be substantially reduced. This thesis examines the use of model-based design to develop and optimize a VOC abatement technology that uses a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) for energy recovery. The model was built using existing HYSYS unit operation models, and was able to provide a detailed thermodynamic and parametric analysis of this technology. The model was validated by comparison to published literature results and through the use of several Design of Experiment factorial analyses. The model itself illustrated that this type of system could achieve 95 % destruction efficiency with performance that was superior to that of Thermal Oxidation, Biological Oxidation, or Adsorption VOC abatement technologies. This was based upon design criteria that included ten year lifecycle costs and operational flexibility, as well as the constraint of meeting (or exceeding) current regulatory thresholds...|$|E
40|$|Coatings {{are used}} to enhance {{appearance}} and assure functional requirements. High performance and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing are the main requirements, leading to increased use of pre-primed automotive sheet in recent years. Costs may be significantly reduced if the conventional electrophoretic primer is eliminated or its usage reduced. Conductive primers also offer the advantage of welding facility. The behaviour of two conductive pre-primers applied on galvannealed steel was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Before pre-priming a nonchrome pre-treatment was applied. Pre-primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness and pre-primer 2 is a very thin water based primer filled with graphite. The behaviour of two finish coat systems was also studied. These finish coats were applied on not primed and pre-primed galvannealed steel sheets. Two activation treatments were used, a conventional zinc phosphate and an experimental one. Finish coat system 1 included a powder intercoat, a waterborne <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> and a clear coat, and finish coat system 2 included the same powder intercoat, a <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> and a clear coat. Formability capabilities of pre-primers were evaluated through cupping and stone chipping tests. To evaluate corrosion protection, these samples were submitted to a cyclic corrosion test (CCT). Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with associated X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To evaluate the performance of finish coats, the samples were also submitted to the same cyclic corrosion test, and the paint coating adhesion was evaluated, before and after exposure, by cross-cut test method. Both pre-primers applied with a low thickness seem to be good alternatives to the conventional electrophoretic primers. In agreement with results previously obtained for preprimed electrogalvanized steel substrate, submitted to CCT, electrochemical studies showed that less protection was achieved by primer 2. Regarding finish coats better adhesion was verified for the one with waterborne <b>base</b> <b>coat,</b> a more environmentally convenient system. Both finish coats presented good anticorrosive behaviour, without significant defects on undamaged areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} of an inorganic-organic (I/O) separator, which demonstrated improved flexibility, reduced cost, production feasibility and improved cycle life was developed. Substrates to replace asbestos and waterbased separator coatings {{to replace the}} <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> coatings were investigated. An improved fuel cell grade asbestos sheet was developed and a large scale production capability for the <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> I/O separator was demonstrated. A cellulose based substrate and a nonwoven polypropylene fiber substrate were evaluated as replacements for the asbestos. Both the cellulose and polypropylene substrates were <b>coated</b> with <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> and water based coatings to produce a modified I/O separator. The <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> coatings were modified to produce aqueous separator coatings with acceptable separator properties. A single ply fuel cell grade asbestos with a binder (BTA) was produced. It has shown to be an acceptable substrate for the <b>solvent</b> and water <b>based</b> separator coatings, an acceptable absorber for alkaline cells, and an acceptable matrix for alkaline fuel cells. The original <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> separator (K 19 W 1), using asbestos as a substrate, was prepared...|$|R
40|$|A Comparison of Solvent and Water-Borne Alkyd Coatings Abstract Conventional <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> alkyd {{coatings}} {{have gone}} out of favor due to concerns over volatile organic compound (VOC) content. However, due to recent focus on renewable raw materials, alkyds are making a comeback in waterborne form. Water based alkyd coatings are known to have poor shelf stability and corrosion resistance, as well as other problems during the formulation process. This project focused on comparing solvent borne to two types of water-borne alkyds, water reducible alkyds and alkyds emulsions. The purpose was to understand the differences between the three types of alkyds in terms of their production and final properties. It was ultimately hoped that the formulations used for this project would prove to solve the problems normally experienced by waterborne alkyds. After testing several chemical and physical properties, it was determined that the solvent borne alkyd coatings performed better than both water based systems in corrosion resistance, accelerated weathering, and shelf stability but the water reducible and emulsion alkyd coatings performed similarly to the solvent borne alkyd in gloss, contrast ratio, and durability. The VOC emissions for all three alkyd types were as expected; the solvent borne had the highest emission at 253 g/L, followed by water reducible with 166 g/L, and emulsion with 34 g/L. The History of VOC Regulations in the United States Abstract In another <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> alkyd <b>coating</b> focused project within my research group, the question of the how volatile organic compound (VOC) regulation in the United States (U. S.) evolved came up. It quickly became apparent that no comprehensive answer to this question existed. Part two of this project is an attempt to answer this question in a comprehensive manner. VOC regulations started in California in the late 1970 s, and paints and coatings became a nationally regulated emission source by the 1990 s. The U. S. government limited harmful emissions, such as smog and compounds contributing to ozone depletion, through Clean Air Acts. The first Clean Air Act was enacted in 1965, but it wasn’t until the Clean Air Act of 1990 that VOC emissions became a focus. VOCs are not inherently hazardous but are a source of concern because they serve as a precursor to the formation of damaging ground level ozone. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established the minimum VOC emission limits in the Architectural and Industrial Maintenance (AIM) federal rule, but each state or state subdivision can enforce stricter limits within their borders. The strictest limits are set by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) in Southern California, but other entities exist. This report thoroughly documents the history of VOC regulation in the United States by collecting, combining, organizing, and summarizing information gathered from various industries and government publications, agency members, and industrial and academic professionals...|$|R
40|$|The Electrochemical Noise Method (ENM) {{monitors}} the small potential and current fluctuations that occur naturally in electrochemical cells. It {{is the least}} intrusive of all electrochemical techniques in regular use. This paper reviews recent work using the Electrochemical Noise Method to investigate waterborne and <b>solvent</b> <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> systems. The coating systems were investigated on the substrate both as intact coatings and as scribed coatings. In general, the former has corroborated previous work where Rn values of > 1 x 107 ohms/cm 2 were indicative of protection. In the scribed work the level of protection afforded at the exposed metal surface by the coating was correlated directly with the Noise Resistance value. Also detached films were examined in a novel test cell {{that can be used}} to simulate different conditions. Results show that the ENM has useful applications in the laboratory for monitoring the accelerated testing of coatings and to investigate environmentally-friendly inhibitive pigments. The technique could be adapted for in-situ monitoring of structures in the field and a new experimental technique has been devised to enable measurements to be made on electrically connected substrate area...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of aluminum (Al) mass fraction {{on the performance of}} an epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating.</b> The conductivity increased and IR emissivity and gloss decreased with increased Al mass fraction. When the Al mass fraction was decreased from 40 % to 30 %, the adhesion and impact strength of epoxy-lacquer based coatings increased and were grade 1 and 50 [*]Kg·cm, respectively. When the Al mass fraction was decreased to 10 %, the mechanical properties of epoxy-lacquer based coatings decreased. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of coatings showed that epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> with 30 % Al mass fraction has the best corrosion resistance and the lowest porosity. The epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> with the best stability was that of 30 % Al mass fraction.

40|$|Water uptake by {{multilayer}} films {{plays an}} important role in their performance. Individual layers may consist of different polymeric phases. Understanding the water uptake in such systems requires knowledge of the water distribution, its state in the polymer, and influence on the polymeric phases.

40|$|Water {{transport}} in polymer coatings is a {{key process}} in their failure. Mostly, such systems are composed of multiple layers to meet the required specifications. Understanding water transport requires a model that relates the kinetics with {{the properties of the}} layers. In this article a theoretical model for water transport in two-layered coatings is formulated and verified. The model considers systems consisting of a hydrophobic top coat and a hydrophilic <b>base</b> <b>coat.</b> It describes the process {{on the basis of the}} top coat permeability and the <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> sorption isotherm, which define the timescale and the driving force of transport. The systems of interest had a <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> sorption isotherm, which indicated that sorption is a process of clustering of water. The non-linear isotherm shape resulted a timescale for uptake and drying of days and hours, respectively. The model is verified with NMR imaging of water transport and gravimetry. Practically, the results mean that it is sufficient to measure the top coat permeability and the <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> sorption isotherm to understand water transport kinetics in such systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
