This program proved {{to be such a}} success that it was temporarily discontinued in 1938, due to peak enrollment being reached. In this time, Kolbe took note of the school’s need to expand, and, with the budgetary assistance of an increasing enrollment and slight raise in tuition, set to work appealing for a separate building for the library, as well as additional student use buildings and campus ground, including an athletics field. In addition to these improvements to the Institute Kolbe was responsible for increased research and the display of the Drexel Institute's Collections.|$|E

The study part is based on seven interviews in two schools in Södertälje, five with teachers and two with assistant principals. The conclusions of our essay {{are based on the}} results of our study. Result: The study shows that the two discourses “national self-understanding” and “the democratic credot” still lives and compete with each other. School 2 has a more monoculture perspective where the teachers emphasize the Swedish languages as a condition for students to get through their schooling. School 1 is more interested to emphasize the multicultural where the intercultural perspective is something that is clearer. But still none of the two schools have a working mother tongue education, though School 1 concentrates on to give their teacher’s education in these subjects so that they get knowledge and realise the importance for bilingual students to development their mother tongue so that they can development their second language. It can be a consequence that the “national self-understanding” stills exits <b>and</b> that <b>student</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> therefore decide not to not have a mother tongue education because they think that’s the way to get “better” in the Swedish language...|$|R
