5|$|Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in {{exchange}} for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does <b>so</b> <b>first.</b> Bruce's childhood friend, assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world {{and learn how to}} confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard, who trains him {{as a member of the}} League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard.|$|E

He then went to Kartosuro to attempt to rescue his son, but was told to clear a path to Demak by the Dutch officials there. After stalling, Notokusumo agreed to do <b>so,</b> <b>first</b> travelling to Semarang. However, upon his arrival in Semarang he was arrested by the new chief of the army, Hugo Verijsel, with 's blessing. Verijsel then took 300 Dutch soldiers and 500 natives to clear the area around Kartosuro, but was stopped in Salatiga when he and his troops came under attack from the armies of three temenggung; Verijsel retreated to Ampel.|$|E

Upon discovering that the restaurant doesn't belong to Yusef, he reveals to Afia that Yusef started the fire involving Zainab. Afia then tells Yusef she knows he started the fire and threatens to tell Zainab if he does not do <b>so</b> <b>first.</b> Yusef admits to Zainab that he started the fire and kicks him out of the house, she later forgives Yusef however. Yusef and Zainab then marry.|$|E

25|$|In December 1919, the Bureau of Ordinance {{pressed for}} the {{restoration}} of full armament for these ships. C replied with three reasons not to do <b>so.</b> <b>First,</b> restoring full armament to ships of their then-current age was not justifiable. Second, since they would serve in peacetime, their current armament would suffice. Finally, even with their 6-inch gun ports closed, they were wet ships in North Atlantic winter seas; Captain W.C. Cole, who had formerly commanded the Pennsylvania-class cruiser USS Frederick (formerly USS Maryland), remembered seeing men up to their waists in water. Whatever medium-caliber guns had been restored after the war were removed by the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|A further {{element of}} this process was made public on October 12, 2005, when various press {{agencies}} revealed that JAXA, the Japanese space agency, had been officially approached by Russia {{to participate in the}} project. JAXA {{has made it clear that}} they are more likely to join the project if ESA does <b>so</b> <b>first,</b> which was in doubt after ESA members rejected a study for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project in December 2005. The addition of Japan would make Kliper a truly multinational project, potentially combining the rugged reliability of Russian launchers with Japanese computer technology. A greater pan-national consensus would have allowed for a lighter funding burden on each participant as well.|$|E
25|$|This axiomatization is complete, {{meaning that}} every Boolean law s= t is provable in this system. One first shows by {{induction}} on {{the height of}} s that every Boolean law for which t is atomic is provable, using R1 for the base case (since distinct atoms are never equal) and A1 and R3 for the induction step (s an application). This proof strategy amounts to a recursive procedure for evaluating s to yield an atom. Then to prove s= t in the general case when t may be an application, use {{the fact that if}} s= t is an identity then s and t must evaluate to the same atom, call it u. <b>So</b> <b>first</b> prove s= u and t= u as above, that is, evaluate s and t using A1, R1, and R3, and then invoke R2 to infer s= t.|$|E

25|$|Jaffer and Dravid began India's innings by {{successfully}} {{negotiating a}} tricky period of three overs prior to lunch. They did not score any runs in this period. Lee was controlled and bowled two short balls at Jaffer before trapping {{him with a}} low, swinging, yorker. Replays revealed that Lee had bowled a no ball by overstepping the bowling mark, but the umpire did not gave it a no ball <b>so</b> <b>first</b> Indian wicket fell to poor umpiring. India were now 1/8. Laxman and Dravid consolidated {{the fall of the}} early wicket and batted steadily, although Dravid survived a catch from another no ball, this time from Johnson. Dravid was defensive while Laxman wristily pushed the ball to the cover and midwicket boundaries. At the end of the 15th over, a Johnson over that went for 19 runs, India were 1/69 and Laxman was on 45 from only 31 balls.|$|E
25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when {{pointing to a}} person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There {{is nothing in the}} sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need you to go to the store and you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, <b>so</b> <b>first</b> and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Woodville {{was born}} about 1437, {{possibly}} in October, at Grafton Regis, Northamptonshire. She was the first-born {{child of a}} socially unequal marriage that had briefly scandalised the English court. Her father, Sir Richard Woodville, was merely a knight {{at the time of}} her birth. The Woodvilles, though an old and respectable family, were genteel rather than noble; a landed and wealthy family that had previously produced commissioners of the peace, sheriffs, and MPs rather than peers of the realm. Sir Richard's own father had made a good career in royal service, rising to become chamberlain to the Duke of Bedford. Sir Richard followed his father into service with the duke, and <b>so</b> <b>first</b> met his wife Jacquetta of Luxembourg. The daughter of Peter of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, and Margaret de Baux, she had been married to the Duke of Bedford in 1433 at the age of 17. The duke was significantly older than Jacquetta of Luxembourg, his second wife, and he was in ill health. He died in 1435, leaving Jacquetta of Luxembourg a childless, wealthy widow. She was required to seek permission from King Henry VI before she could remarry. But in March 1437, it was revealed that she had secretly married Sir Richard Woodville, who was far below her in rank and not considered a suitable husband for the lady still honoured as the king's aunt. The couple was fined £1000, but this was remitted in October of the same year.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Sweden was instigated by King Gustav I (1523–60) {{and within}} the half century {{following}} his death had become established as a Lutheran state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself {{under the control of}} the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of Gustav III (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do <b>so</b> <b>first</b> registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in praxis means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of cuius regio, eius religio one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.|$|E
