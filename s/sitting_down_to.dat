5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
5|$|Neighbours was {{immediately}} bought by Seven's rival Network Ten. The new network {{had to build}} replica sets when it took over production after Seven destroyed the original sets to prevent the rival network obtaining them. Ten began screening the series with episode 171 on 20 January 1986. In 1986, the series was bought by the BBC {{as part of their}} new daytime schedule in the United Kingdom. Neighbours made its debut on BBC1 on 27 October 1986 starting with the pilot episode. It soon gained a loyal audience and the show became particularly popular with younger viewers, and before long was watched by up to 16million viewers - more than the entire population of Australia at the time. In 1988 Neighbours became the only television show to have its entire cast flown over to the UK to make an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance in front of the Queen. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and the seventh longest running serial drama still on the air in the world. In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary and over twenty former cast members returned for a special episode, which saw them <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> watch a documentary about Ramsay Street. At the Logie Award ceremony that year, the show was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.|$|E

25|$|In 1899 {{the station}} manager, Mr T. Cahill and his stockmen were {{attacked}} by Aborigines {{while they were in}} camp while out mustering. The men had been mustering in an area where a man known as Paddy the Lasher had been murdered two years earlier, and once they had made camp and were <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a meal several spears were thrown at them, hitting none of the men. The party made to defend themselves and the attackers scattered. Later the same year the homestead was burned to the ground also blamed on Aborigines who had been pretty troublesome on the station lately.

500|$|Columnist Leonard Pitts of The Miami Herald {{described}} his difficulty <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> read a book, {{in which he}} felt like he [...] "was getting away with something, like when you slip out of the office to catch a matinee". Technology evangelist Jon Udell admitted that, in his [...] "retreats" [...] from the Internet, he sometimes struggled to settle into [...] "books, particularly fiction, and particularly in printed form". He found portable long-form audio to be [...] "transformative", however, because he can easily achieve [...] "sustained attention", which makes him optimistic about the potential to [...] "reactivate ancient traditions, like oral storytelling, and rediscover their powerful neural effects".|$|E

After <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> discuss their relationship, Mark explained to Paige {{that he had been}} undercover and was investigating Dakota, who kissed him.

500|$|A UGO Networks {{columnist}} {{was concerned}} that the expensive pilot {{would be hard to}} translate into weekly episodes, but [...] "after <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> watch Fringes second episode, [...] "The Same Old Story", my concerns have vanished. Fringes second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without sacrificing any of Fringes eleven-herbs and spices. In fact, the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X-Files is even better defined in the first weekly-episode. I'd struggled to find the word to describe it, and the winner is 'condensed'. [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] has all of the sense of mystery, discovery, and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller, more combustible space." [...] Another UGO writer, Alex Zalben, later compared [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Død Kalm". Zalben concluded that [...] "Fringe wins this one, just for having a slightly less stupid explanation." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams {{describes}} version 1.0 {{having an}} Adventure mode {{that would be}} a regular role-playing game, with changing plots and ordering subordinates to perform various tasks. Fortress mode would have a closer relationship with the outside generated world through war, trade and diplomacy. The world being bigger; he envisions the game to have many more features like magic, a tutorial, and a better interface. According to him, a tutorial is a burden because of the additional need of updating it and interface improvement is not a major priority till then—citing numerous existing fan-made applications for improving the game's interface. He said of version 1.0, [...] "sitting down with a fresh DF world would be like <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> read a middling fantasy author you haven't read before, but with all the extras that being a video game provides, including the ability to write your own sequels." [...] Modern in-game technologies and 3D graphics were fan requests Adams said he would never implement, yet showing ambivalence about the latter if the task was easy enough.|$|E

500|$|American Beauty {{follows a}} {{traditional}} narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky {{from the middle}} of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Jacqueline Furby says that the plot [...] "occupies no time [...] all time", citing Lester's claim that life did not flash before his eyes, but that it [...] "stretches on forever like an ocean of time". Furby argues that a [...] "rhythm of repetition" [...] forms the core of the film's structure. For example, two scenes have the Burnhams <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester's new-found assertiveness. Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly [...] "voyeuristic and exhibitionist" [...] scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment.|$|E
500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] <b>Sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian and the Evening Times {{highlighted}} the Star Stories parody as the [...] "pick of the day". Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, [...] "There's everything you {{ever wanted to}} know about the world's number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> make him look taller". He characterized the parody as, [...] "A toned down version of real life, then." [...] Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as [...] "equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious". He commented, [...] "This is as close to must-watch television as you're likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display." [...] In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re-runs, McDonald wrote, [...] "I don't care if it's been shown several times before, {{this is one of the}} shows which you just have to see again." [...] Anila Baig of The Sun {{highlighted the}} show as [...] "Best Spoof", and wrote, [...] "pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise [...] is subjected to some serious mocking. We follow his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as [...] "the best gag in the whole episode". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, [...] "Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a tinnie like a good Sheila." ...|$|E

Around one minute into the track the camera pans back to reveal {{the rest of the}} Super Furry Animals <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the left of Rhys. Guitarist Huw Bunford is sat on the floor playing an acoustic guitar {{while the rest of the}} group are sat on three metal seats which are connected together. Two aliens are seen walking from the spacecraft towards the band while drummer Dafydd Ieuan pours some of the Martian sand through his hands. When the aliens arrive, one of them, with a bald head, sunglasses and pointy ears, places his left hand on Rhys's right shoulder. Rhys turns around and looks at the other alien who has one eye in the centre of a large round face and is wearing a blue hoodie. The alien smiles at Rhys who then turns around and looks up to see the Earth in the sky above. Ieuan and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are also shown looking at the Earth before the camera moves behind them to reveal hundreds of aliens stood in front of several minaret-like towers, waving at the group. The band are shown picking up a suitcase and guitar before walking towards the spaceship as the song finishes. The aliens were designed by regular Super Furry Animals collaborator Pete Fowler, who acted as [...] "creative advisor" [...] for the video. According to Rhys the aliens were animated by the same special effects team that worked on [...] Rhys has stated that he considers his performance in the video to be [...] "wooden" [...] as he was forced to take painkillers during the shoot due to a [...] "stiff neck".|$|E

The difference is that the latter have a one-pointed object in focus with complete awareness directed to that object – the meal or the target, respectively.
