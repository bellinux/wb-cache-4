The <b>spotted</b> <b>seabass</b> breeds {{at various times}} based on geography; in the Mediterranean it generally spawns from January until March whereas in the English Channel and other northern areas this range is from March until May.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>seabass,</b> Dicentrarchus punctatus, is {{a species}} of {{temperate}} bass native to marine and brackish waters of the coastal eastern Atlantic Ocean from the English Channel to the Canary Islands and Senegal, {{as well as through}} the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

40|$|The cage {{fish farming}} model is {{becoming}} popular in Kerala after its {{success in a}} nearby tiny island where farmers, mostly women, have reaped mega harvest of fish varieties such as pearl <b>spot,</b> <b>seabass</b> and tilapia. Guided by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) here, the farmers in Pizhala Island took to the model an year ago and their success has inspired the institute to popularise it {{in other parts of}} the state. CMFRI said even the non-farming community in the state had turned to the less expensive model attracted by the story of farmers in Pizhala island...|$|R
40|$|The Central Marine Fisheries Research Instituteâ€™s (CMFRI) {{cage farming}} {{initiatives}} started yielding results with a mega fish harvest of pearl <b>spot,</b> <b>seabass</b> and tilapia. Around 100 farmers, including women groups in Pizhala island near here, participated in cage farming enterprises {{under the guidance}} of CMFRI. The bumper catch assumes greater importance {{at a time when the}} capture fisheries are undergoing a stagnation period. The farming was started seven months ago by stocking the fish seeds in cages made of GI pipes with the size of four-metre each width and length and six-metre depth. During the harvest done prior to the Christmas, the farmers got the seabass with an average weight of 3. 5 kg and pearl spot with 250 g...|$|R
40|$|A {{tiny island}} village in Kerala's scenic backwaters {{is in the}} limelight for {{ushering}} in a fish farming revolution. The farmers, including women's groups in Pizhala island near Kochi, yielded a mega harvest of pearl <b>spot,</b> <b>seabass</b> and tilapia in cage culture. Around 100 farmers took part {{in as many as}} 60 cage farming enterprises under the guidance of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) in Pizhala Island in Kadamakkudi Panchayat. The farming was started seven months ago by stocking fish seeds in cages made of GI pipes with the size of four metre each width and length and six metre depth. "During the harvest done prior to Christmas, the farmers got seabass with an average weight of 3. 5 kg and pearl spot weighing 250 grams," a CMFRI official said. He said CMFRI's Mariculture Division gave training and technical guidance to farmers at various stages, from the stocking period to the harvest, to make the enterprise a grand success...|$|R
50|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>seabass</b> {{generally}} {{lives in}} brackish water at depths below approximately 30 meters. It generally lives in subtropical waters, {{ranging from the}} coast of Brittany in the north to the coast of Africa and the Canary Islands {{in the south and}} also encompassing almost all of the coastline of the eastern Mediterranean Sea and going as far west as the Azores.|$|E
50|$|The sea slug Chelidonura fulvipunctata was {{originally}} described from waters around Japan and is {{widespread in the}} eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific. It was first identified in the Mediterranean in 1961 and {{was seen in the}} Red Sea in 2005, most likely as a result of anti-Lessepsian migration. In addition, a survey of polychaete worms in the southern Suez Canal found six species that were regarded as anti-Lessepsian migrants. Among the fish species that have been confirmed as anti-Lessepsian migrants are Solea aegyptiaca, Mediterranean moray Murea helena, comber Serranus cabrilla, European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, and <b>spotted</b> <b>seabass</b> Dicentrarchus punctatus.|$|E
