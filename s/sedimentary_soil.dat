25|$|About {{two-thirds of}} Florida {{occupies}} a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Florida has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, approximately , {{not including the}} contribution of the many barrier islands. It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soil.</b> Florida has the lowest high point of any U.S. state. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. The American alligator, American crocodile, Florida panther, and manatee can be found in Everglades National Park {{in the southern part of}} the state.

25|$|The {{municipality}} has rolling hills, {{mountain ranges}} and flatlands.

Altitude varies from 1,900 to 2,460 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at mountains called El Buey, Pie de Gallo, El Patol, El Nabo, and El Paisano. The city proper is on a plain at 1,900 meters. There is only one river, the Querétaro River, which carved the La Cañada. There are numerous streams, many of them seasonal, and fresh water springs near the mountain areas. The climate is temperate and semi-dry in which the summers can be hot, with high up to 36C in May and June. Freezing temperatures are possible in the winter.|$|E

25|$|The Bengal {{soil profile}} {{impacted}} the famine in two ways. First, {{the soil in}} eastern Bengal, in combination with abundant irrigation from monsoon rains, was unique {{for its ability to}} grow large amounts of high quality jute. This gave Bengal an effective monopoly on a cash crop. Jute of lesser quality was grown in smaller quantities in western Bengal, but eastern Bengal was the clear-cut center of jute production. During the famine, jute-producing districts suffered higher mortality rates. Second, the sandy soil of eastern Bengal and the lighter <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soil</b> of the Sunderbans tended to drain more rapidly after the monsoon season than the laterite or heavy clay regions of western Bengal. As a rule, malaria epidemics lasted approximately one month longer in the areas with slower drainage. This problem was {{compounded by the fact that}} soil exhaustion created the need for large tracts in western and central Bengal to be left fallow; eastern Bengal had far fewer fallow fields. Flooded fallow fields are one key breeding place for malaria carrying mosquitoes, which was the biggest killer during the famine.|$|E

40|$|Non-linear {{stress-strain}} {{characteristics and}} stiffness-strain relationships of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soils</b> and sands at small strains {{have been reported}} by many researchers. However, research work {{on the behavior of}} residual soils at small strains has rarely been reported. A key aspect of small strain soil behavior is its influence on ground response around many underground structures attributed to the variation of its shear stiffness with shear strain level. In this paper, the use of three internal semiconductors to measure stress-strain response of completely decomposed granite (saprolites) at small strains is reported. It is found that the stress-strain characteristics and the stiffness-strain relationships are highly non-linear. Shear stiffness decreases significantly as shear strain increases. The behavior of the granitic saprolites at small strain does not seem to behave significantly different as compared with other <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Several {{unreinforced}} masonry {{buildings in}} downtown Napa suffered exterior damage {{as a result}} of the earthquake. Sixteen buildings were red tagged following the event and one hundred sixty eight were yellow tagged. Although the magnitude of the primary event was considered only moderate, shaking was intensified in the City of Napa and surrounding area due to the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soil</b> on the floor of the valley. [...] The earthquake caused an interruption of power to approximately 10,000 Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers.

50|$|Caves in Batadomba lena, 460 m {{above sea}} level {{in the foothills of}} Sri Pada (Adam's Peak), have also yielded several {{important}} ancient remains.

Excavations of the seventh stratum in the following year produced further human remains along with charcoal and 17 geometric microliths, i.e. 1-4 cm long triangular, trapezoid or lunate stone tools made of flint or chert that form, among other artifacts, the end points of hunting weapons such as spears and arrows. Radiometric tests on the charcoal placed the tools to around 28,500 BP.|$|E
50|$|The {{coastline}} of the Gulf of Maine {{is predominantly}} rocky and scenic; {{the only significant}} coastal developments {{are located in the}} Boston, Portsmouth, Portland and Saint John metropolitan areas. The effects of glaciation are responsible for stripping <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soil</b> away from the coastline, therefore the gulf lacks the sandy beaches found to the south along the Eastern Seaboard. The underwater features of the seabed sculptured during the lower sea levels of the ice ages make the gulf a semi-enclosed sea bounded to the south and east by underwater banks. Georges Bank in particular, on its southern end, protects the Gulf of Maine waters from the Gulf Stream. Gulf of Maine waters are more strongly influenced by the Labrador Current, making the gulf waters significantly colder and more nutrient-rich than those found to the south. Undersea valleys in the central basin can reach depths of 1,500 feet (500 m) while undersea mountains rise up 800 feet (266 m) from the sea floor, almost reaching the surface in some locations, or even exceeding it, creating islands.|$|E

Also on the Baker road, but much closer to town, just past the Interstate, are the Strawberry Hills, good for short hikes and climbs. The highest point in the vicinity is Signal Butte (3,051 feet / 929.94 meters above sea level), said to have been used by Native Americans for communication, but used for decades by radio and sometimes TV antennas. Signal Butte lies at the edge of an area of badlands, a striking arid vista of eroded <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soil,</b> sporting multi-colored layers exposed by the erosion. The land contains sandstone formations in the midst of sagebrush and cedar trees growing in a soil that turns to gumbo when wet. Airport Hill is the elevated bluff of the north bank of the Yellowstone River, and Paragon Pit is a remote area of the north bank opposite of Fort Keogh frequented by teenagers over the years. 12 Mile Dam spans the Tongue River and attracts teens in the summer for water sport. Being shallow, the Tongue River is often used for tubing. The former Fort Keogh once boasted an Air Force radar station and still houses a state Extension Experiment Station. Near the highway is the site of a state fish hatchery, and nearby, a double humped butte is known locally as [...] "Camelback". Miles City lies {{at the mouth of the}} north flowing Tongue River as it empties into the eastward flowing Yellowstone River.

40|$|Acceso restringido a texto completoVolcanic {{activity}} {{results in}} a wide range of soil types with very unusual characteristics, the most remarkable of which are volcanic ash clays containing the clay minerals allophane and imogolite. In addition to these soils, volcanic activity often produces the special environmental conditions that result in the formation of diatomaceous soils, namely, water rich in dissolved silica. These soils consist of individual particles containing intraparticle voids filled with water, resulting in a very unique porous particle morphology that is quite different than stereotypical <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soils.</b> This paper presents a series of careful laboratory tests on samples of both materials found in Chile. These tests demonstrate that soils weathered from volcanic ash develop yield pressures that are similar to the preconsolidation pressure of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>soils.</b> This type of soil also shows a dramatic change in properties due to drying. In addition, diatomaceous soils and those containing allophane have very low densities, in spite of which they develop remarkably high shear strength. The need for their properties to be properly understood and taken into account in geotechnical design, especially seismic design, is emphasized, since the location of these soils generally coincides with earthquake activity, which, like volcanic activity, arises from tectonic plate interaction...|$|R
