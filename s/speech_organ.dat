5000|$|It has a {{function}} in speech as well. In many languages, the uvula {{is used to}} articulate a range of consonant sounds, known as uvular consonants. The voiced uvular trill, written [...] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is one example; it is used in French, Arabic and Hebrew, among other languages.

40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{explains the}} principle of the human speech production {{with the aid of a}} Linear Predictive Vocoder (LPC vocoder) and the use of interactive learning procedures. The components of the human <b>speech</b> <b>organ,</b> namely the excitation and the vocal tract parameters, are computed. The components are then fed into the synthesis part of a vocoder which finally generates a synthesised speech signal. The user can replay the signal and compare it with the reference speech signal. For visual comparison, the reference speech signal and the reconstructed speech signal are depicted in both, the time and frequency domain. For the reconstructed signal, also the pitch frequency contour is graphically presented and the user can directly manipulate this contour. The main advantage of the tutorial are its numerous interactive functions. The tutorial is based on HTML pages and Java applets and can be downloaded from the WWW. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of fluctuations of speech wave, i. e., pitch, amplitude, and waveform, {{is a subject}} of growing interest for improvement {{in the quality of}} synthesized voice. However, little information with respect to the sound source itself in speech production is available, since it is difficult to measure fluid and acoustic motions within the larynx. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to clarify the relationship between unsteady motion within the larynx and generated speech wave. We numerically simulate speech production in a non-pathological <b>speech</b> <b>organ</b> based on our proposed glottal source model. The simulation shows waveform fluctuations in glottal jet velocity and pressure waves within the larynx caused by unsteady fluid motion. In order to investigate the unsteady motion effects on phonation, a harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR) in terms of measures of the waveform fluctuations is estimated by varying lung pressure. The HNR decreases with the lung pressure. The HNR of pressure wave indicates the greatest fluctuation near the glottis, although the HNR does not show the fluctuation faraway distance from the glottis. This result suggests that the unsteady vortex motions within the larynx do not greatly affect speech waves radiating from the mouth...|$|E
40|$|Today, noise {{reduction}} methods are nearly ubiquitous although often not noticed by laymen. Cellular phones, some hands-free headsets and ear-phones offered by some airlines during long haul flights all utilize {{noise reduction}} algorithms. However, {{there are some}} situations in everyday life where ordinary noise reduction algorithms do not suffice; situations where the surrounding noise sound pressure level is too high to be efficiently attenuated by ordinary algorithms. Personal communication is then partly or totally prohibited by this noise. Examples of such situations may be motorcycle riding or attending a concert. In addition, many occupations, foremost industrial work, expose people to very high sound pressure levels. Still, these {{people need to be}} able to communicate safely. This report describes a technique where an ear-mic, i. e. a small microphone for communication purposes, is placed inside the auditory canal where it picks up bone conducted speech from the user's <b>speech</b> <b>organ.</b> The report describes three different approaches and usage areas: First, a basic approach where combination effects of an ear-mic and a pair of Active Noise Control (ANC) equipped ear-muffs are investigated. Second, this approach is used to improve a speech recognition system. The third approach is to connect a well-known noise reduction algorithm - the spectral subtraction - in cascade with the previously described ear-mic/ANC-solution in order to achieve extreme noise suppression...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{long-term}} goal of LPP {{is to achieve}} an integrated model of phonetics and phonology. It also works on applications to clinical phonetics and language learning. LPP has recently assembled a research platform for investigating the behavior of each <b>speech</b> <b>organ</b> involved in speech production. The platform is elaborated by a joint effort between engineers, phoneticians and clinicians. It provides tools to investigate various phenomena of coordination and compensation across speech organs that are observed {{in the production of}} speech by normal or pathological speakers, foreign language learners, and singers. The paper described the instrumentation techniques, both conventional and new, that are currently used at our laboratory for investigating the behavior of the speech organs involved in speech production. The examples that were provided highlight the innovative value of the multisensory platform for phonetic studies. The first example combined fi berscopic and aerodynamic data for the study of nasality; the second combined photoglottography, pneumotachography and intraoral pressure measurements for the study of glottal articulation. Both illustrate the benefit of using several exploratory techniques in parallel, suggesting that data based on a single technique can be misleading. Research issues in phonetics and phonology include patterns of synchronic variation and evolutionary paths (in particular prosodic influences over the realization of segments) and typological patterns of phoneme distributions and phonotactic constraints (in particular recurrent asymmetries within sound systems). Progress in analyses and models requires the study of physiological, articulatory, acoustic, aerodynamic and perceptual parameters...|$|E
40|$|It is an {{appealing}} {{notion that the}} movements of the speech organs may at some level in the control chain be initiated by step commands. Clearly, many muscular movements, not only in the speech apparatus, can be described as responses of an inertial system to a more or less complex set of step forces. The inertia is then not only mechanical but also due to neural propagation and other delays. The <b>speech</b> <b>organ</b> movements are eventually manifested in the appearance and movements of the formants in the speech wave. The experiment to be described here is a drastic shortcut across the whole set of nonlinear transformations from imaginary stepwise muscular excitations, over movements and area functions to the speech wave. Thus the principle here used is to operate with the formant parameters themselves as being well behaved step responses. Of course one may then not hope for more than a moderate approximation to the natural speech, but the method is very well suited for a technical implementation of a synthesis by rule system. The setup for the experiment coasists of a CDC 1700 computer interfaced with the OVE I 11 serial formant synthesizer and various equipment for operator control and monitoring. The initial work is to build up a library of typical formant frequency and excitation level values. For this purpose the operator works with a handle that can be moved over a plane surface. The handle has two sensors to convey its location to the computer which plots a mark at the pertinent coordinates on a display oscilloscope. The plot on the oscilloscope shows as a time-frequency diagram the synthesis parameters in the stylized square wave form shown in Fig. 111 -A- 1. A set of program control commands are displayed {{at the edge of the}} plot. By pointing at these using the handle the operator can initiate such things as to insert, delete, or move data points, and select parameters to display. ...|$|E
40|$|A signal {{can be said}} to be any {{information}} bearing unit or action carrying a message from a sender to a receiver. This definition covers a vast number of human and non-human actions, ranging from flirtation to satellite communication. This thesis deals with increasing the quality {{of one of the most}} ubiquitous human-to-human signals: Speech. Surrounding noise is a severe obstacle to relaxed speech communication. Cars, industry and many everyday machines emit high noise levels that render personal communication difficult, degrade our mental and physical ability and may cause nausea, vertigo, fatigue and temporary or permanent hearing loss. Indeed, exposure to noise of a high sound pressure level is a major contributor to often irreversible sensorineural hearing impairment, i. e. Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). This doctoral thesis deals with three different approaches for facilitating human speech communication. First, methods for adaptively controlling acoustic feedback — commonly denoted "howling" — in hearing aids are developed and subsequently evaluated. Howling is a very common problem in hearing aids and a stable and robust feedback eliminator would serve many hearing aid users. The proposed method detects tonal components, i. e. howling, in the signal path of the hearing aid. If such a component is detected, the feedback control system invokes different countermeasures to adaptively cancel the howling. Second, a method for speech quality and intelligibility enhancement is described. Instead of focusing on noise suppression, the method acts as a speech booster: Frequency bands containing a usable amount of speech energy are boosted. All other frequency bands remain unchanged. This results in an increased Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the elimination of background artefacts which may be present in some other noise reduction algorithms. Furthermore, speech distortion is kept to a negligible level. Finally, a compact receiver unit, based on bone conduction, is designed and evaluated. The unit is placed inside the external auditory canal of a user and picks up bone conducted speech from the user's <b>speech</b> <b>organ.</b> This solution, in combination with a pair of active hearing protectors, yields several advantages and allows the user to reliably communicate in environments where extremely high sound pressure levels are present...|$|E

40|$|ENGLISH: Language is {{the most}} {{important}} thing used by human being. Human being is the perfect creation of God. In this world, every human being has weaknesses because there is no body perfect except God. Concerning this fact, God creates Human being with different characteristics and types since she or he was born. The characteristic of no perfection also refers to human’s speech system which is categorized as speech or language disorder. Speech or language disorder refers to a language disability which causes the difficulties of understanding and expressing language. These problems also experienced by woman who suffers of Cerebral Palsy (CP). Cerebral Palsy is a spectrum of chronic movement disorder affecting body and muscle coordination. These disorders are usually caused by damage to one or more areas of the brain. The movement problems can vary from barely noticeable to extremely severe which also influence the movement of <b>speech</b> <b>organ.</b> This research uses descriptive qualitative method study to investigate the problem of language phenomenon in a movie. Therefore, this study aims to get the understanding of the phenomenon in the Skallagrigg movie that is Cerebral Palsy using expressive language disorder. The character of Cerebral Palsy is Esther who has been successful in his life as the disabilities woman. Therefore, the researcher is interested in observing in order to find out the kind of language disorder and the Esther’s experience. The researcher collected the data by analysis, observe, and describe the utterances that can be found in “Skallagrigg” movie. The result of this study show that Esther’s utterances have some kinds of speech and language disorder namely articulation disorder (from the manner of articulation), phonological disorder (substituting, failure, and omitting sound), voice disorder (improperly, talking too long, and unnatural pitch), and stuttering (dysfluency and pauses). The result also shows that articulation disorder is mostly found. The result also shows that Esther’s experience are angry, happy, serious and underestimated condition. Finally, after analyzing the language of cerebral palsy in kinds of language disorder speaker, the researcher and the readers are expected to know about the kinds of language disorder. Besides, this study can lead for the next researcher that is psycholinguistic researchers who have interest to language disorder, especially in Cerebral Palsy (CP) it is better do field research in real conversation...|$|E

Manner of articulation refers to {{the manner in which}} the <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. pulmonic, implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream. The concept is primarily used for the production of consonants, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as voicing and nasalization. For any place of articulation, there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several homorganic consonants.|$|R
