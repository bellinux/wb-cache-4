25|$|Finally, {{some have}} also claimed this {{argument}} fails {{to account for}} Jason Marsh's point on natural nonbelief in early humans. Since there was quite plausibly <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> natural nonbelief in early humans, then it doesn't make much sense to say that said nonbelief is self-deceptive. That's because natural nonbelief entails nonresistant nonbelief.|$|E
25|$|The biblical {{concept of}} righteousness {{was rooted in}} the covenant-making God who had ordered {{creation}} for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern {{for the poor and}} needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31). Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy. Satan {{raises the question of whether}} there is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.|$|E

25|$|Some {{hold the}} view that {{informal}} logic is not a branch or subdiscipline of logic, or even {{the view that}} there cannot be <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> informal logic. Massey criticizes informal logic {{on the grounds that}} it has no theory underpinning it. Informal logic, he says, requires detailed classification schemes to organize it, which in other disciplines is provided by the underlying theory. He maintains that there is no method of establishing the invalidity of an argument aside from the formal method, and that the study of fallacies may be of more interest to other disciplines, like psychology, than to philosophy and logic.|$|E
25|$|In {{cooperation}} with the literary scholar , DAS GEDICHT initiated a widely followed debate on, “Is there <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a European poem?” Alongside translations from English, Spanish, or Classical Greek authors, the magazine regularly features German-language poetry from outside Germany, such as Austrian, Swiss, and Luxembourgian poetry. DAS GEDICHT has also often been the root of productive altercations among aesthetic positions and has facilitated debate among poets. Looking at the question – short poem or long poem – many prominent German poets engaged in critical exchange {{within the realm of}} the magazine: Durs Grünbein, , and Jürgen Becker. The critic and member of the Group 47, , dedicated a larger portion of his radio broadcast, in order to give this debate a national audience.|$|E

500|$|The Stoics {{admitted}} {{between the}} good and the bad a third class of things – the indifferent (adiaphora). Of things morally indifferent, the best includes health, and riches, and honour, and the worst includes sickness and poverty. Chrysippus accepted that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to the preferred indifferent things as [...] "good", but the wise person, said Chrysippus, uses such things without requiring them. Practice and habit are necessary to render virtue perfect in the individual – in other words, there is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> moral progress, and character has to be built up.|$|E
500|$|Debs {{was noted}} {{by many to}} be a charismatic speaker who {{sometimes}} called on the vocabulary of Christianity and much of the oratorical style of evangelism – even though he was generally disdainful of organized religion. It has been said, that Debs was what every socialist and radical should be; fierce in his convictions, but kind and compassionate in his personal relations. As Heywood Broun noted in his eulogy for Debs, quoting a fellow Socialist: [...] "That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> the brotherhood of man. And that's not the funniest part of it. As long as he's around I believe it myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Conduct {{books have}} {{traditionally}} been viewed by scholars as an integral factor {{in the creation of}} a bourgeois sense of self. The conduct book [...] "helped to generate the belief that there was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a 'middle class' and that the modest, submissive but morally and domestically competent woman it described was the first 'modern individual'". By developing a specifically bourgeois ethos through genres such as the conduct book, the emerging middle class challenged the primacy of the aristocratic code of manners. However, conduct books simultaneously constricted women's roles, propagating what has been called [...] "the angel in the house" [...] image (alluding to Coventry Patmore's poem of that name). Women were encouraged to be chaste, pious, submissive, modest, selfless, graceful, pure, delicate, compliant, reticent, and polite.|$|E

Throughout the night, as Kawaguchi's men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses, Edson remained standing about [...] behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123, exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts. Said Marine Captain Tex Smith, who was in position to observe Edson {{for most of the}} night, [...] "I can say that if there is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> one man holding a battalion together, Edson did it that night.

500|$|Upon release, Sheryl Crow {{received}} general acclaim {{from most}} music critics. Eric Weisbard of Spin praised the album's production, {{stating that the}} record [...] "goes much further" [...] than its predecessor and that its [...] "bigger beats and dirtier guitar/keyboard effects [...] well with Crow's literate hippie-chick persona". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated similar pros, commenting: [...] "If there's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a professional lo-fi album, Sheryl Crow is it." [...] He also noted Crow's louder and more assured singing, concluding that she [...] "doesn't expose that much of herself [...] she's an emotional centrist. But at the very least, she's building a bridge to a lasting career". Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J.D. Considine praised Crow's vocals, especially on [...] "If It Makes You Happy", which he felt was probably the album's best song.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "Pixar's ninth {{consecutive}} wonder", {{saying it was}} imaginative yet straightforward. He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones, and that {{the main difference between}} the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter declared that WALL-E surpassed the achievements of Pixar's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date. He said it had the [...] "heart, soul, spirit and romance" [...] of the best silent films. Honeycutt said the film's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL-E's romantic leanings. He praised Burtt's sound design, saying [...] "If there is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> an aural sleight of hand, this is it." ...|$|E

500|$|Lurie {{argued that}} Taft {{did not receive}} the public credit for his {{policies}} that he should have. Few trusts had been broken up under Roosevelt (although the lawsuits received much publicity). Taft, more quietly than his predecessor, filed many more cases than did Roosevelt, and rejected his predecessor's contention that there was <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "good" [...] trust. This lack of flair marred Taft's presidency; according to Lurie, Taft [...] "was boring—honest, likable, but boring". Scott Bomboy for the National Constitution Center wrote that despite being [...] "one of the most interesting, intellectual, and versatile presidents... a {{chief justice of the}} United States, a wrestler at Yale, a reformer, a peace activist, and a baseball fan ... today, Taft is best remembered as the president who was so large that he got stuck in the White House bathtub," [...] a story that, despite Taft's fondness for bathtubs, is not true. Taft similarly remains known for another physical characteristic—as the last president with facial hair to date.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{admitted}} that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song [...] "evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna." [...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard not to feel that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, wondering if there is <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we heard it all before, she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't mean we don't {{want to hear it}} again." [...] In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single [...] "SexyBack".|$|E
500|$|Also in 1996, Murphy began {{studying}} law at University College Cork (UCC), but he failed {{his first year}} exams because, as he put it, he had [...] "no ambitions to do it". Not only was he busy with his band, but {{he has said that}} he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of , directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, also starring Irish American comedian, Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career. Nonetheless, he began to move away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, [...] "I think there's <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{hearing from}} {{immigrants}} how European strikers had used this tactic during prolonged strikes, Haywood {{decided to take}} the gamble in Lawrence, a first in American Labor history. [...] He and the IWW used announcements in socialist newspapers to solicit host families, then screened strikers to see who might be willing to send their children into the care of strangers. [...] On February 10, 1912, the first group of [...] "Lawrence Strike Children" [...] bid tearful goodbyes to their parents and, with chaperones to guide them, boarded a train for New York. [...] The children arrived safely in Manhattan that evening where they were taken to a Labor hall. [...] They were soon lavished with food and clothes and would stay in New York another seven weeks. [...] Despite their excellent treatment, officials in Lawrence and elsewhere were shocked by the move. [...] "I could scarcely believe that the strike leaders would do <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> this," [...] Lawrence mayor Michael Scanlon said. [...] "Lawrence could have very easily cared for these children." [...] Though also denounced in the press, the children's exodus gained widespread publicity and made the city of Lawrence look bad. [...] While police and the mayor allowed smaller contingents of children to leave on two more occasions, plans were made to crack down).|$|E
500|$|Amy Benfer of Salon.com {{wrote in}} 2010 that, {{according}} to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008, meaning that [...] "the slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture", and that {{if there had been}} <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "Juno effect", it would have caused pregnancies to go down, not up. She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too? So, now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won't necessarily contaminate the rest of them, it's time to stop worrying and ask {{what we can do to}} help." ...|$|E
