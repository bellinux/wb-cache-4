50|$|The 1980s saw a minor {{revival of}} {{stereoscopic}} photography when several point-and-shoot <b>stereo</b> <b>cameras</b> were introduced.

2500|$|Something not {{generally}} {{known by the}} public {{is the fact that}} roughly 70% of the war's documentary photography was captured by the twin lenses of a <b>stereo</b> <b>camera.</b> The American Civil War was the first war in history, whose intimate reality would be brought home to the public, not only in newspaper depictions, album cards and cartes-de-visite, but in a popular new 3D format called a [...] "stereograph" [...] or [...] "stereocard." [...] Millions of these cards were produced and purchased by a public eager to experience the nature of warfare in a whole new way.|$|E
2500|$|More than 20 {{years after}} the Viking 1 images were taken, a {{succession}} of spacecraft visited Mars and made new observations of the Cydonia region. These spacecraft have included NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (1997–2006) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (2006-), and the European Space Agency's Mars Express probe (2003-). In contrast to the relatively low resolution of the Viking images of Cydonia, these new platforms afford much improved resolution. For instance, the Mars Express images are at a resolution of 14 m/pixel (46ft/pixel) or better. By combining data from the High Resolution <b>Stereo</b> <b>Camera</b> (HRSC) on the Mars Express probe and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) on board NASA's Mars Global Surveyor it has been possible to create a three-dimensional representation of the [...] "Face on Mars".|$|E
2500|$|Jacob Frank [...] "Jay" [...] Coonley (1832–1915) New York Ambrotypist, Coonley was {{originally}} a landscape painter who early on learned the trade from George N. Barnard. He managed Edward Anthony's stereoscopic print shop until 1862, taking assignments in Pennsylvania, New York and Washington D.C. When war erupted, Coonley remained in Washington, photographing generals soldiers, statesman and the like. In 1862 he briefly moved to Philadelphia {{to open the}} portrait gallery partnership of Coonley & Wolfsberger. Six month later, Coonley was back in New York managing Clarke's Union Gallery, corner of Broadway and Bleecker St. In 1864, he was awarded a contract by Quartermaster General Montgomery Meigs, for photographic work {{along the lines of}} the railroads in US. possession, in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. During this time, Coonley also produced the Nashville series for Edward Anthony. Coonley was also very likely responsible for at least fourteen photos archived at the Library of Congress, depicting the April 14, 1865, Fort Sumter Flag-Raising Ceremony, though he's cited as the author of just one. The photographic evidence suggests the Anthony Co. photographer used a <b>stereo</b> <b>camera</b> with a drop-shutter, utilizing two camera locations inside the fort. The only view inside Fort Sumter that actually depicts the garrison flag being raised is the work of photographer William E. James. From 1865 to 1871 Coonley managed C.J. Quinby's Charleston, S.C. gallery, with George N. Barnard joining as a partner in 1868. [...] Coonley is known to have operated a business at 78 Broughton Street, Savannah, Georgia, dealing in Chromos, engravings and paintings, as well as manufacturing frames and publishing of stereoviews and photographs. Some years later,Cooley spent time in Nassau, Bahamas, at the request of Governor-General, Sir William Robinson. He returned to New York in 1881 and took a position as operator for J.M. Mora. In 1886 Coonley returned to Nassau, establishing a successful business there until 1904, when he sold out and returned to New York. Seventy-two year old Coonley would continue to spend his winters in the Bahamas. A December 1915 article on his death published in the New York Evening World stated that Coonley, who had been an invalid for some time, died after attempting suicide.|$|E

30|$|Stereo {{correspondence}} is {{a challenging}} {{field of research}} in term of software and hardware implementation [18]. It has {{to respond to the}} high demand of real-time execution and frame rates in many domains like machine vision and navigation. Passive stereo vision also suffers from matching failure on low-textured regions and repetitive patterns [23]. Projecting a texture on the scene drastically improves the stereo matching. Projector-based systems became serious competitors to passive <b>stereo</b> <b>cameras.</b> However, the main drawback of such IR-projector-based sensors is their inability to work outdoors and their power consumption. Authors of [24] also showed the degradation of the 3 D reconstruction at different times of the day. The stronger the illuminance, the poorer the quality of the resulting 3 D map. Thus, passive <b>stereo</b> <b>cameras</b> keep on being employed for outdoor applications related to navigation [25] whereas active ones are leading the indoor application usage. Examples of commercially available active <b>stereo</b> <b>cameras</b> are the Microsoft Kinect 3 and the Asus Xtion 4.|$|R
