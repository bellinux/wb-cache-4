25|$|His {{father is}} just a name, which occurs in various forms, e.g., Entifidich in the Poppleton manuscript, Enfidaig, Amfredech, Anfudeg, and as Amfodech in the French king-list {{embedded}} in the Scalacronica. The list in National Library of Scotland MS, Advocates' 34.7.3, <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Taran was the brother of King Nechtan m. Der-Ilei, which could mean that Taran's mother was the Pictish princess Der-Ilei. However, the latter list is problematic and places the reign of King Bridei m. Der-Ilei, Nechtan's brother, after Nechtan; on the other hand, the list {{is one of those}} that is aware that Bridei was the son of Dargart, indicating access to material not available to some of the other lists.|$|E
25|$|The second {{interpretation}} is that Chen's actions were primarily intended to placate his core supporters rather than provoke a crisis. People who subscribe to this interpretation {{point out that}} Chen's early efforts to moderate his pro-independence position did not create a positive reaction either from the PRC or from his anti-independence opponents on Taiwan. He also alienated some pro-independence supporters. Therefore, Chen was forced {{to take a more}} assertive approach both as a negotiation tactic with the PRC and to keep support from his core supporters. This strategy is consistent with the oft-stated position that Taiwan would only seek independence as a preemptive measure in the face of evidence of PRC military aggression. However, even this interpretation provokes unease among many people, especially among policy makers in the PRC and the United States. The first problem is that this interpretation makes Chen seem like an old-style Taiwan politician that <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whatever pleases people. The second, more serious problem is the fear that through misunderstanding and misinterpretation, Chen may have provoked a war without intending to do so, as the PRC has repeatedly claimed that any progress towards independence would provoke war.|$|E

[...] This place has been identified by some Assyriologists with the land of Mash, a district between Judea and Babylonia, and the traces of nomadic or seminomadic life and thought found in and [...] give some support to the hypothesis. Heinrich Graetz, followed by Bickell and Cheyne, conjectures that the original reading is המשל ("Ha-Moshel," [...] = [...] "the collector of proverbs"). The true explanation is still uncertain.|$|E
2500|$|This most {{eccentric}} and haunting {{of modern}} epics {{is driven by}} oilman Daniel Plainview, who, {{in the hands of}} actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel—plus, what I think is the performance of the new century—There Will Be Blood stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows—and the more it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism. Awfully good! ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} sources after Gildas name Arthur as the victor of the Battle of Mount Badon, at which the Saxons were routed and their invasions halted for many years. Historians regard it as a {{probable}} historical event. [...] Gildas's Latin is somewhat opaque: he does not name Arthur, or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss Ambrosius Aurelianus as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior, but <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> some time passed between Ambrosius's victory and the battle of Badon. He also tells {{us that he was}} born in the same year as the battle (which he describes as taking place [...] "in our times" [...] and being one of the latest - and greatest - slaughters of the Saxons) and that, {{at the time of his}} writing, a new generation born after the battle of Badon, has come of age in Britain.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Benjamin Sommer of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America read [...] and [...] {{to teach}} that God punishes {{children}} for their parents’ sins {{as a sign}} of mercy to the parents: When sinning parents repent, God defers their punishment to their offspring. Sommer argued that other Biblical writers, engaging in inner-Biblical interpretation, rejected that notion in [...] and Psalm [...] Sommer argued that [...] for example, quoted [...] which was already an authoritative and holy text, but revised the morally troubling part: Where [...] taught that God punishes sin for generations, [...] maintained that God does not contend forever. Sommer argued that [...] and [...] similarly quoted [...] with revision.

2500|$|Critics of DeLillo {{argue that}} his novels are overly stylized and intellectually shallow. In James Wood's review of Zadie Smith's 2000 novel White Teeth, he {{dismissed}} {{the work of}} authors like Dellilo, Wallace, and Smith as [...] "hysterical realism". Bruce Bawer famously condemned DeLillo's novels insisting they weren't actually novels at all but [...] "tracts, designed to batter us, again and again, with a single idea: that life in America today is boring, benumbing, dehumanized...It's better, DeLillo <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in one novel after another, to be a marauding murderous maniac – and therefore a human – than to sit still for America as it is, with its air conditioners, assembly lines, television sets, supermarkets, synthetic fabrics, and credit cards." [...] George Will proclaimed the study of Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra as [...] "sandbox existentialism" [...] and [...] "an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship." [...] DeLillo responded [...] "I don't take it seriously, but being called a 'bad citizen' is a compliment to a novelist, at least to my mind. That's exactly {{what we ought to}} do. We ought to be bad citizens. We ought to, in the sense that we're writing against what power represents, and often what government represents, and what the corporation dictates, and what consumer consciousness has come to mean. In that sense, if we're bad citizens, we're doing our job." [...] In the same interview DeLillo rejected Will's claim that DeLillo blames America for Lee Harvey Oswald, countering that he instead blamed America for George Will. DeLillo also figured prominently in B. R. Myers's critique of recent American literary fiction, A Reader's Manifesto.|$|E
