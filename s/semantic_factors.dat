40|$|In the Brno {{approach}} {{to the theory of}} Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP), four factors have been identified to work in mutual cooperation in rendering the final functional perspective of an utterance: actual linear arrangement of sentence elements, their dynamic semantic functions (the <b>semantic</b> <b>factor),</b> context, and – in spoken discourse – prosodic features. In a discussion of the <b>semantic</b> <b>factor,</b> Jan Firbas briefly describes in his monograph of 1992 the operation of the so-called suggestive semantic clue. Since this term has received little attention elsewhere, the author of the present paper attempts to show that it represents one of the fundamental concepts in FSP analysis in that it is not only closely attached to the important concept of semantic homogeneity, but also an FSP signal (or an FSP factor?) capable of contributing significantly to the correct resolution of the communicative functions of sentence elements...|$|R

5000|$|In {{database}} and information retrieval theory {{the distinction between}} concepts and relations and the classification of relations into different types was also developing at this time. The “relation operators” for example of J. Farradane published in papers dating back to 1966 included such notions as space/time factors, dimensional relations, causation (or functional dependence) and association. An attempt was made by Perry, Kent and Berry to break down subjects into <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> (reminiscent of earlier work by J.Kaiser (1915) and S. R. Ranganathan (1933) in their work on library classification systems) but was abandoned due to the immense complexity of relations involved even for the simplest subjects.The advent of computer technology was of revolutionary importance in allowing these general ideas to be taken forward. The earliest models in electronic database managements systems (DBMS), the hierarchical and network models, were superseded in 1970 when E.F.Codd proposed the “relational model” which was then developed and transformed into the database programming language SQL (Structured Query Language). Eugen Wüster, in what he called terminology science, also drew on the important distinction between concepts and relations and, borrowing ideas from David Hume (see above) regarding types of relation, set out his findings in his General Theory of Terminology (1974). Further work on Wüster’s concept systems and concept relations was published in 1994 by Anita Nuopponen [...] and taken up {{in the preparation of}} ISO 12620 Data Categories and in the further development of data categories in 1999 by researchers at Brigham Young and Kent Universities in the USA.

40|$|Introduction 1 Preparing {{an index}} or {{concordance}} for an analytic {{language in which}} each word has only one <b>semantic</b> <b>factor</b> is a simple task easily automated in a computer system. However, most natural languages are rather synthetic, i. e., they have other words which contain more than one <b>semantic</b> <b>factor.</b> The English word `DOGS' for example has two factors. We may refer to these words as complex. Usually {{one of the factors}} is lexical while the rest are grammatical. A linguist may use lists of `complex words' according to their grammatical factor. For example, according to the plural indication. He or she may even be interested in derivative words that have a common constituent, such as ject in subject, project or inject, where each word has an independent lexical entry. However, in most cases {{we would like to have}} lists of words, including `complex words', which are gathered in groups according to t...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{semantic}} underpinnings {{of the distinction}} between two syntactic types of "manner of movement" verbs in Levin (1993), namely the RUN and ROLL classes. According to Levin's (1993) and Levin & Rappaport's (1995) work on unaccusativity, a <b>semantic</b> <b>factor</b> of "internal causation" should be the trigger for the classification of a movement verb as intransitive (=not-unaccusative), and hence for its belonging to the RUN class. We point out empirical problems for this characterisation, mainly coming from the different readings of the German verb fliegen (fly). From a comparison with other semantically similar verbs, we conclude that the semantic description which underlies the class distinction should be refined: instead of "internal causation", the crucial <b>semantic</b> <b>factor</b> is described here as "inherent specification for a momentum of movement". This result indicates that forces, and relations between forces, have {{to be part of the}} semantic description of the manner component in movement verbs...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} between (strongly) distributive sentences in two typologically different languages, i. e. Romanian and Chinese is proposed. It {{is argued that}} the same factors, namely the inherent properties of the quantifiers more than the c-command relations obtaining between them constrain the possible interpretations of distributive sentences. The importance of the two factors is relatively different: in Romanian, the <b>semantic</b> <b>factor</b> cannot be superseded by the configurational one, whereas in Chinese c-command is at least equally important, thus partially confirming the isomorphism thesis...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} from adult pronoun comprehension suggests that <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> such as verb transitivity affect referent salience and thereby anap- hora resolution. We tested whether the same <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> influence pronoun comprehension in young children. In a visual world study, 3 -year- olds heard stories {{that began with}} a sentence containing either a high or a low transitivity verb. Looking behaviour to pictures depicting the subject and object of this sentence was recorded as children listened to a subsequent sentence containing a pronoun. Children showed a stronger preference {{to look to the}} subject as opposed to the object antecedent in the low transitivity condition. In addition there were general preferences (1) to look to the subject in both conditions and (2) to look more at both potential antecedents in the high transitivity condition. This suggests that children, like adults, are affected by <b>semantic</b> <b>factors,</b> specifically semantic prominence, when interpreting anaphoric pronouns...|$|E
40|$|Two {{decades after}} its inception, Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) {{has become part}} and parcel of every modern {{introduction}} to Information Retrieval. For any tool that matures so quickly, it is important to check its lore and limitations, or else stagnation will set in. We focus here on the three main aspects of LSA that are well accepted, and the gist of which can be summarized as follows: (1) that LSA recovers latent <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> underlying the document space, (2) that such can be accomplished through lossy compression of the document space by eliminating lexical noise, and (3) that the latter can best be achieved by Singular Value Decomposition. For each aspect we performed experiments analogous to those reported in the LSA literature and compared the evidence brought to bear in each case. On the negative side, we show that the above claims about LSA are much more limited than commonly believed. Even a simple example may show that LSA does not recover the optimal <b>semantic</b> <b>factors</b> as intended in the pedagogical example used in many LSA publications. Additionally, and remarkably deviating from LSA lore, LSA does not scale up well: the larger the document space, the more unlikely that LSA recovers an optimal set of <b>semantic</b> <b>factors.</b> On the positive side, we describe new algorithms to replace LSA (and more recent alternatives as pLSA, LDA, and kernel methods) by trading its l 2 space for an l 1 space, thereby guaranteeing an optimal set of <b>semantic</b> <b>factors.</b> These algorithms seem to salvage the spirit of LSA as we think it was initially conceived...|$|E
