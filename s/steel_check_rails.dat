40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer simulation approach on the catch effect of debris flow {{for an open}} type <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dam by the 3 -dimentional distinct element method (3 -D DEM). First, the 3 -D DEM is developed {{in order to examine}} the catch effect of debris flow for an open type <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dam. Second, the hydrodynamic test is performed to investigate the catch effect of the debris flow for a model check dam. Finally, a computer simulation by the proposed 3 -D DEM is carried out in order to compare with the hydrodynamic test results and the catch effect is confirmed by the beam slit interval of a <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dam...|$|R
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was a wheel rim which broke and damaged the train six kilometres south of the accident site. The wheel rim penetrated the carriage floor and lifted the <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> {{of a set of}} points close to Eschede station. The broken-off <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> then forced the point blades of the following set of points to change direction, and the rear cars of the trainset were diverted to a different track. They hit the pillars of a street overpass, which then collapsed onto the tracks. Only three cars and the front powerhead passed under the bridge, the rest of the 14-car train jackknifed into the collapsed bridge.|$|R

50|$|Railway {{trackage}} has guard <b>rails</b> (aka <b>check</b> <b>rails)</b> {{to guide}} wheels through possible catch points on turnouts or diamonds.

50|$|The viaduct was {{the most}} {{substantial}} single structure on the line. It is sharply curved, necessitating the provision of a <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> in its active railway days. In 1953 extensive repair work was undertaken in which the opportunity was taken to raise the parapet and add metal railings on top.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ordinary}} LSWR {{permanent way}} was used, with [...] rails, {{but in the}} tubes longitudinal timbers were used instead of cross-sleepers. The sharp curves had <b>check</b> <b>rails.</b> Cross-bonds paralleling the running rails electrically were provided every 100 ft and between tracks at the cross passages. The track gauge was the standard 4 ft.|$|R
50|$|In {{railroad}} use, guard <b>rails</b> or <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> {{are placed}} parallel to regular running rail along areas of restricted clearance, {{such as a}} bridge, trestle, or tunnel. These {{have the effect of}} keeping the wheels of rolling stock in alignment in case of derailment. It also helps to minimize damage to the structure and allow easier post-accident cleanup.|$|R
30|$|In {{the various}} life cycle processes, CO 2 {{emissions}} were greatest during the production processes for materials and fuel {{for all types}} of check dam, with 75  % of the emissions for all-wood timber check dams and over 90  % of those for hybrid timber, concrete, and <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams emitted during this process.|$|R
25|$|Turnouts, {{also known}} as points and switches, are the means of {{directing}} a train onto a diverging section of track. Laid similar to normal track, a point typically consists of a frog (common crossing), <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> and two switch rails. The switch rails may be moved left or right, {{under the control of}} the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.|$|R
5000|$|In 1894 {{he succeeded}} James Johnson as the {{locomotive}} {{superintendent of the}} Great North of Scotland Railway, where he continued to develop the 4-4-0 type for that railway and {{was responsible for the}} new locomotive works at Inverurie which replaced the unsatisfactory premises at Kittybrewster. He was chairman of the Association of Railway Locomotive Engineers in 1912 and was interested in flange and <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> dimensions.|$|R
50|$|The frog {{end of the}} {{switched}} crossing, despite {{still having}} a gap in one rail, is less problematic in this regard. The outer rail is still continuous, the wing rail (the part that turns out, after the frog gap) provides a gradual transition, and the <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> avoids the possibility of points splitting. This {{can be seen in}} how, under examination, the wing rail has a wider polished section, showing how the wheel load is transferred across the gap.|$|R
5000|$|... {{there is}} only one platform, but there is space for a second which would make {{possible}} a more intensive service on the Sunshine Coast Line. To the east of the station, Colne Junction is the western extremity of a triangle which gives access towards Colchester station to the west and Hythe station to the east. The curve to the north from Colne Junction to East Gates Junction is sharp, with a continuous <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> which necessitates slow passage.|$|R
50|$|Derailers are {{electrically}} powered. They {{have traditionally}} been regarded as the ultimate safeguard in preventing vehicle access and are fitted to tracks approaching the depot. However, derailers do have drawbacks - they can result in significant damage to infrastructure and Traction and Rolling Stock {{in the event of}} a derailment (which can be costly and extremely disruptive to operations) and in some cases, can be innefective or restrictive (they cannot be fitted in close vicinity to <b>check</b> <b>rails,</b> for example).|$|R
30|$|For {{comparison}} with other measures of reducing CO 2 emissions [24], the marginal abatement costs of switching from concrete check dams to all-wood timber check dams would come to a similar amount to improvements to the urban automotive driving environment (the use of intelligent transport systems), for example. If (c) all-wood timber check dams without a front apron and only steel bars were used instead of <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams, this would cost around the same amount as using gas turbine combined-cycle power generation. These costs are around 4 – 38 {{times greater than the}} marginal abatement cost of 15 thousand yen/t-CO 2 (54 thousand yen/t-C) for using thinnings or logging residues as an energy source to reduce CO 2 emissions (average emission factors for all power sources) [24], suggesting that switching from concrete or <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams to timber check dams would not constitute a cheap means of reducing CO 2 emissions compared to other methods for reducing CO 2 emissions. Further cost reduction measures, as well as political support such as subsidy systems, are required for the use of timber in check dams.|$|R
5000|$|A guard <b>rail</b> (<b>check</b> <b>rail)</b> {{is a short}} {{piece of}} rail placed {{alongside}} the main (stock) rail opposite the frog. These exist {{to ensure that the}} wheels follow the appropriate flangeway through the frog and that the train does not derail. Generally, there are two of these for each frog, one by each outer rail. Guard rails are not required with a [...] "self-guarding cast manganese" [...] frog, as the raised parts of the casting serve the same purpose. These frogs are for low-speed use and are common in rail yards.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the nine}} 9F's {{to have survived}} into {{preservation}} {{two members of the}} class have run on the mainline in preservation, no 92203 Black Prince & 92220 Evening Star. Due to the engines flangeless centre driving wheels and the worry that the raised <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> on modern pointwork may cause a derailment the class alongside other 2-10-0 locomotives are presently banned from operating on the mainline including the Esk Valley Line from Battersby to Whitby which is used by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway on their Grosmont to Whitby trains alongside the regular passenger services on the route.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} efficiency, all-wood timber check dams are the most expensive, whereas concrete check dams are the cheapest, with all-wood timber check dams being expensive at 241  % {{of the cost of}} concrete check dams. However, it is possible to reduce the cost of all-wood timber check dams to around 60  % of its current level by changing the construction method and materials. Hybrid timber check dams are 132  % of the costs of concrete check dams, and slightly less expensive than <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams, and can therefore be competitive with them in terms of cost.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} gauge Bala and Festiniog Railway opened from [...] to Llan Ffestiniog on 1 November 1882 and work began on converting the F&BR's narrow gauge line to Blaenau to {{standard gauge}}. During conversion a third rail {{was provided to}} enable the narrow gauge trains to continue operation until conversion was complete. Narrow gauge operation ceased on 5 September 1883. In some cases the third rail was removed and in others it was moved along sleepers to serve as <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> on curves. The formal standard gauge opening was on 10 September 1883, at which time the physical Festiniog and Blaenau Railway ceased to exist.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} each {{separate}} life cycle process, CO 2 emissions were greatest from the production processes for material and fuel {{for all types}} of check dam, accounting for 75  % of the total in all-wood timber check dams and over 90  % of the total in the other types. Focusing on a breakdown of the emissions during the material and fuel production processes, timber, which is used in large quantities in all-wood timber check dams, accounts for over 60  %, and connectors for over 20  %. Steel accounts for over 80  % of hybrid timber <b>check</b> dams and <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams. Concrete accounts for over 90  % of concrete check dams, irrespective of the use or otherwise of timber forms. This shows that for <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams and concrete check dams, almost all the CO 2 emissions produced during the construction of check dams are generated during the production process for their main materials. The CO 2 emissions per dam volume from the concrete-dam construction process used in this study and that from a previous study [9] were 8.2 and 18.4  kg-CO 2 /m 3, respectively; i.e., the emissions were smaller for this study. This is mainly because this study used manpower to build the forms, while the previous study assumed the use of a machine (rough-terrain crane) for the same task. Had the present study also used a machine, the emissions would have increased up to 16.0 (= 8.2  +  7.8) kg-CO 2 /m 3, which is not significantly different from those obtained in the previous study.|$|R
50|$|After the {{war years}} the Balloons were {{neglected}} slightly {{in place of the}} new Coronation Cars, as they were considered old fashioned and too slow to load. Blackpool Corporation soon changed its mind after experiencing the temperamental nature of the Coronations and the Balloons began to make a comeback in the late 1950s. In 1958 <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> was installed through to Fleetwood, a requirement to allow the Balloons to operate to Fleetwood and the Balloons increasingly began to appear on market-day specials, as they were useful for moving the large crowds travelling north. The Balloons continued to run their normal Squires Gate service until its closure in 1961 and following this the entire class solely worked on the promenade service.|$|R
50|$|A {{derailment}} {{occurred on}} 23 January 1894: the 6 p.m. passenger train from Weymouth to Abbotsbury hauled by Armstrong standard good locomotive no 52 running tender first was negotiating the sharp curve between Upwey Junction and Upwey stations. The leading (in {{the direction of}} travel) coupled wheels derailed to the right, by the flange climbing the high rail. The Parliamentary plans showed the curve to be 12 chains radius, {{but there was a}} short section at 8½ chains. The locomotive class had a relatively long rigid wheelbase, at 15ft 8ins and there was no <b>check</b> <b>rail.</b> The driver was found to be working regular shifts of 14 hours 5 minutes on six days a week, although this was not contributory to the accident.|$|R
40|$|WO 200198769 A UPAB: 20020403 NOVELTY - A {{linear array}} of {{ultrasonic}} test heads (6) are positioned {{on the inside}} of the track rail (4), adjacent the contact surface (3) of the rail cooperating with the running surface (2) of the rail vehicle wheel (1). Each test head emits ultrasonic waves which are fed to the rail vehicle wheel via the contact surface, and receives the reflected waves, with the test heads inclined at an oblique angle to the longitudinal axis of the rail. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM for a rail vehicle wheel testing method is also included. USE - The testing device is used for <b>checking</b> <b>rail</b> vehicle wheels for detecting fractures etc. ADVANTAGE - The device allows rapid testing of each rail vehicle wheel during its passages along the rail track...|$|R
30|$|Focusing on the {{relative}} proportions of material and construction costs, for concrete check dams material costs accounted for 57  % and construction costs for 44  %. In contrast, the corresponding figures were 80 and 20  % for all-wood timber check dams, 89 and 11  % for hybrid timber check dams, and 83 and 17  % for <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams. Material costs accounted for {{a high proportion of}} direct construction costs for the three types of check dam other than those made of concrete, and the cost of material procurement was a factor driving up direct construction costs. Attempting to reduce material costs will therefore be a more effective cost-cutting measure than improving construction efficiency to keep down direct construction costs.|$|R
50|$|Between a large, tiered modern {{cutting of}} {{shotcrete}} (known as Moggill's Wall {{and not of}} cultural heritage significance) and the entrance to Tunnel 3 (144.5 km), a steep, high and long rock face incorporates a number of features. The rock face runs parallel to a large section of <b>check</b> <b>railed</b> curving track. The face begins with a wall of pick-faced, cut and dressed stone extending approximately seven metres high and wide. As the face increases in height, large sections of concrete rendering surround numerous areas of pick-faced exposed rock. Set in among eroded sandstone at various heights are sections of cut and dressed and mortared stone work. Small tufts of vegetation are scattered along the face. Directly outside the entrance to Tunnel 3, a high cutting of steep rock has extensive pick facing and a section of stone walling along its base.|$|R
50|$|Gelli Felen Halt {{was opened}} by the LMS on 6 September 1933. It was {{situated}} {{to the west}} of the twin-bore Gelli Felen Tunnel (Down 386 yd; Up 352 yd) from which the station was reached on a sharp left-hand curve where flangeless 0-8-4T locomotives had in the past derailed. At this point the line ran along the sheer rock face of the cutting side which was reinforced with engineering brick. Gelli Felen railway halt was in an isolated location on a 1 in 38 gradient on a sharp curve requiring <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> to prevent derailment. Short staggered platforms were provided with a barrack-like brick huts as passenger shelters. To the west of the station there had been a signal box, crossover and siding but these had gone by 1931; the signal box was opened on the Up side in 1898 and was known as Gellavalln.|$|R
50|$|The Main Range Railway {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} sections of line for enginemen during the steam era on the Queensland Railways. Despite the advent of more powerful locomotives during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the combination of sharp curves, steep grades and tunnels created difficult conditions for crews. Railway workers needed to ensure adequate supplies of coal and water to negotiate the crossing and banking engines were employed between Murphy's Creek and Toowoomba to assist ascending trains. On curved sections of track inner <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> were laid to minimise the possibility of derailment after 1897. Sandboxes were placed along the line to assist wheel traction. Despite being a difficult stretch of railway to work, the Main Range line has been relatively free of major disasters. Of the fatal incidents that have occurred, the worst was the Murphy's Creek collision (1913) when six men were killed.|$|R
30|$|In {{light of}} these {{problems}} with previous studies, {{in the present study}} we designed check dams to prevent the same volume of sediment runoff in the same location to ensure consistency of functional units, and investigated concrete check dams, which have a long track record of construction, <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams, and the two types of timber check dams developed in Akita Prefecture (all-wood timber and hybrid timber). We then carried out a comparative evaluation of life cycle CO 2 emissions, and investigated the effectiveness of timber check dams in reducing CO 2 emissions compared with non-timber check dams. We also analyzed the economic efficiency of each type of check dam, with the aim of conducting a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account economic as well as environmental perspectives, and considered the advantages of and issues with timber check dams.|$|R
30|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>check</b> dams (Fig.  1 d) are {{generally}} made by constructing an external frame from steel and bolts, and packing {{it with a}} filler consisting of rubble of roughly 150 – 200  mm in diameter. The structural body itself is lighter in weight than that of concrete check dams, {{and the fact that}} its components are fastened together with bolts make the dam body a flexible structure {{with a high degree of}} resilience to exposure and submersion. As putting the structural components together mainly involves assembling the steel components and pouring in rubble, without the curing period required for concrete, this type is suited for use when short-term installation is required, such as in times of disaster, and when filling materials such as pebbles and boulders are easily obtainable. It should not be used, however, if there is a risk of a landslide or other impact load.|$|R
30|$|The {{maintenance}} and management process {{is divided into}} inspection and repair stages. We assumed that inspections would be performed once every 5  years {{for a total of}} 10 times for timber check dams, and once every 10  years for a total of 5 times for concrete or <b>steel</b> <b>check</b> dams. CO 2 emissions during inspections were calculated in terms of the gasoline consumption of a light van (1500  cm 3) used by the staff carrying out the inspections. Based on interviews with staff of the Akita Prefecture Management Office, the distance from the Management Office to the dam location was set as 15  km each way, and the time required as 30  min. This was used to calculate gasoline consumption according to the Chisan and Forest Road Manual, Quantity Surveying and Construction Volume [15] and CO 2 emissions were then calculated according to the same method used for the fuel production and combustion processes, as described above.|$|R
