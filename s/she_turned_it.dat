But the crew insisted and kept contacting her for two months, and she agreed when she saw the Telugu version of the movie. Tamil director, S. Shankar, was impressed with her performance in the Parker Pen commercial and decided to cast her in a leading role in his 2003 Tamil film Boys. Genelia was selected among 300 girls, who had auditioned for the movie. She signed three movies simultaneously in three different languages, Tujhe Meri Kasam (Hindi), Boys (Tamil), and Satyam (Telugu).|$|E

She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, The Grass Is Greener (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, Marriage on the Rocks (1965). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! offered her a fee comparable to that paid {{to the rest of the}} cast combined, but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon.|$|E

25|$|Years later, Stanwyck {{earned her}} third Emmy for The Thorn Birds. In 1985 she made three guest {{appearances}} in the primetime soap opera Dynasty prior to the launch of its short-lived spin-off series, The Colbys, in which she starred alongside Charlton Heston, Stephanie Beacham and Katharine Ross. Unhappy with the experience, Stanwyck remained with the series for only one season (it lasted for two), and her role as Constance Colby Patterson {{would prove to be}} her last. Earl Hamner Jr. (producer of The Waltons) had initially wanted Stanwyck for the lead role of Angela Channing in the 1980s soap opera Falcon Crest, but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down and the role went to her best friend, Jane Wyman.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Hill revived {{his musical}} version of The Phantom of the Opera. This time though, {{he wanted to}} add {{the kind of music}} that would have been heard at the Opéra Garnier in the late 19th century. Consequently, he {{discarded}} the modern score by Ian Armit and wrote original English lyrics that told Gaston Leroux’s tale. By placing them to opera arias by Gounod, Offenbach, Verdi, Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, and Boito, he created a musical that reflected the era in which the original novel was written. This updated version of The Phantom of the Opera was produced in a joint production by the Newcastle Playhouse and the Theatre Royal Stratford East, and premiered at the Newcastle Playhouse on 3 April 1984, before shortly moving to the Theatre Royal Stratford East. In between, the show had two very brief runs at the New Tyne Theatre in Newcastle and the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton - neither of those productions did very well. When the show got the Theatre Royal Stratford East, Sarah Brightman, who created the role of Christine in the Lloyd Webber version, was famously asked to perform the role of Christine in the 1984 cast but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down, leaving the role for the opera singer Christina Collier.|$|E

After the Cars recorded their own version, which they did not use on any of their albums, Lauper decided to cover it.

Other actresses such as Tabu, Shilpa Shetty, Urmila Matondkar, Aishwarya Rai, Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor were offered the role but also turned it down. Aditya Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan noticed Rani Mukerji's beauty and acting talent in Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat, and suggested her to Karan Johar. He thus signed her, giving a boost to her career. [...] Saif Ali Khan, Ajay Devgan and Chandrachur Singh were initially offered the role of Aman, but they all turned it down, thus prompting Johar to rope in Salman Khan.|$|E
500|$|Ellen Page as Ariadne, a {{graduate}} student of architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth, daughter of King Minos, who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur. Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a [...] "perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond her years". Page said her character acts as a proxy to the audience, as [...] "she's just learning about these ideas and, in essence, assists the audience in learning about dream sharing". Evan Rachel Wood was Christopher Nolan's first choice to play Ariadne, but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down. Before Ellen Page was offered and accepted the role, Nolan considered casting Emily Blunt, Rachel McAdams, Taylor Swift, Emma Roberts, Jessy Schram, and Carey Mulligan.|$|E

[...] When Brock's Monument opened in 1831, Secord learned the new Lieutenant-Governor, John Colborne, intended to give the keys to the widow of a member of the monument committee who had died in an accident. [...] On 17 July 1831, Secord petitioned Colborne to honour Maitland's promise, and included another certificate from FitzGibbon attesting her contribution to the war. [...] She wrote that Colonel Thomas Clarke had been told by Maitland, [...] "it was too late to think of [...] Mrs. Nichol as I have pledged my word to Mrs. Secord that as soon as possible she should have the key."

500|$|... "Since U Been Gone" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Kelly Clarkson from her second studio album, Breakaway (2004). The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald, was released as the lead single from Breakaway {{two weeks before the}} album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock and power pop power ballad that infuses electronic sound with a mixture of soft and loud alternative rock sound. Martin originally wrote [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] with Pink in mind but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down. It was then given to Hilary Duff but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to give it to her. Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her sense of relief with the end of her troubled relationship.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, O'Hara played Claire, the {{daughter}} of the musketeer, Athos in At Sword's Point, which according to her showed the [...] "new Maureen O'Hara". [...] The film had actually been made in 1949 but was not released until 1952. The role was the most physically demanding of her career, doing her own stunts and training in the art of fencing for six weeks under the Belgian-born fencing master, Fred Cavens. [...] She disliked director Lewis Allen and producer Howard Hughes, whom she thought was [...] "cold as ice". The critic from The New York Times appreciated O'Hara's swordsmanship in the film, stating that she was [...] "snarling like a Fury, impales her opponents as though she were threading a needle." [...] O'Hara next played Irish immigrant Australian-based cowgirl, Dell McGuire, in Lewis Milestone's drama Kangaroo (1952), set during the drought of 1900. Kangaroo is noted for being the first Technicolor film to be shot on-location in Australia, mostly shot in the desert near Port Augusta. Although O'Hara disliked the production, she found the Australians extremely welcoming. The Australian government offered her a plot of land during the production to own permanently but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down for political reasons only to later discover that there were significant oil reserves on the land.|$|E
500|$|Another {{complication}} emerged, when Wasikowska had to {{drop out}} of the film because of a scheduling conflict. Haynes then approached Rooney Mara, who had been offered the role of Therese after completing the 2011 film The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Mara said that although she loved the script and wanted to work with Blanchett, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down as she felt exhausted and unconfident. By the time Haynes came on board she was [...] "in a much different head space" [...] and signing on to the project was [...] "a no brainer at that point." [...] In August 2013, it was reported that Mara had replaced Wasikowska. Sarah Paulson was cast as Abby, a close friend of Carol, and Kyle Chandler was cast as Harge, Carol's husband, in January 2014. The following month, Cory Michael Smith was cast as Tommy, a traveling salesman, and Jake Lacy joined the cast as Richard, Therese's boyfriend. In April 2014, John Magaro was cast as Dannie, a writer at The New York Times. Carrie Brownstein then joined the cast in the role of Genevieve Cantrell, a woman Therese meets. Carter Burwell was hired to compose the music for the film, and Edward Lachman, who had previously collaborated with Haynes, served as the director of photography.|$|E

500|$|Several notable actors made guest {{appearances}} {{throughout the}} second season of Homicide. Robin Williams appeared in [...] "Bop Gun" [...] as Robert Ellison, the husband of a slain woman tourist. Levinson previously directed Williams in the films Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Toys (1992). Although Williams was primarily known for his comedic work, the Homicide producers and Williams himself consciously decided to remain true to the original script, rejecting the idea of adding humor or jokes to the episode. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] also featured a 13-year-old Jake Gyllenhaal, son of the episode's director Stephen, {{in one of his}} earliest acting performances; he played Matt, the young son of Robert Ellison. Wilford Brimley portrayed the bed-ridden and suicidal Harry Prentice in [...] "See No Evil", Isaiah Washington played murder suspect Lane Staily in [...] "Black and Blue", and Adrienne Shelly portrayed S fashion store owner Tanya Quinn in [...] "A Many Splendored Thing". Julianna Margulies appeared in the last two episodes of the season as Linda, a waitress who starts dating Bolander.

500|$|The episode {{featured}} guest appearances by Isaiah Washington, {{who went}} on to play Preston Burke on the medical drama series Grey's Anatomy, and Julianna Margulies, who started her long-running lead role as nurse Carol Hathaway on the medical drama series ER a few months after [...] "Black and Blue" [...] aired. She was cast in the part after having worked with Fontana on the unaired pilot of Philly Heat, an ABC miniseries he worked on about members of the Philadelphia Fire Department. Fontana offered Margulies a recurring role on Homicide, but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> down in favor of ER. Michael S. Kennedy, an actor from Richmond, Texas, reprised his role of Lt. Jimmy Tyron from the previous episode, [...] "". A struggling actor, Kennedy received a call from a casting director he knew, {{in the middle of an}} all-night Virginia Beach shoot for a small role in , giving him one day's notice of the audition for Homicide. He so enjoyed working on the show that he wrote a Homicide script himself, with the Tyron character playing a major part, although it was ultimately never used.

500|$|The episode {{marked the}} final {{appearance}} by Jon Polito, {{who had been}} a regular cast member since the series debuted, but was dismissed reportedly because NBC officials were unhappy with his weight and physical appearance and did not believe he appealed to audiences. The departure was not amicable, as Polito publicly criticized the direction Homicide had taken in the second season and claimed he voiced concerns about the recent scripts to Fontana and Menaul. [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] featured the second of two guest appearances by actress Julianna Margulies as Linda. A few months later, Margulies started her long-running lead role as nurse Carol Hathaway on the medical drama series ER.
