The digital serial signal is first fetched into PCM multiplexer where it is mapped to the corresponding E 1 (2  Mbit/s) time division multiplexed signal. Subsequently, the resulting E 1 frames are then packetized and sent through Ethernet control LAN to the opposite PCM demultiplexer where the same but reverse processing is done finally sending a signal into the opposite protective relay. The challenge of this setup is to assure very timely delivery of the control information between protective relays even in the cases of potential failures of Ethernet network itself. The tolerance of Ethernet network to faults is assured using widespread per VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol potentially extended by 1 + 1 PCM protection as a valuable option...|$|E

The advantage of multithreading include greater throughput, more {{efficient use of}} CPU such that it cannot remain idle for long time, better system reliability, improved performance on multiprocessor computer. The use of Real Time Operating Systems (RTOSs) became an attractive solution to simplify the design of critical real-time embedded systems for safety constraints. Due to their demanding strict attention to rules and procedures,constraints such as highspeed, low voltage operation and battery-power dependence, because of sudden up and down of voltages, flow of current these systems are frequently causes transient faults. External conditions, such as Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), HeavyIon Radiation (HIR) as well as Power Supply Disturbances (PSD) can also cause transient faults.

Thus these systems are becoming true SoC (System-on-Chip) designs. This development is making traditional {{design and implementation}} methods limited and insufficient. Implementing an interconnect structure of a complex SoC {{is one of the}} issues which cannot be solved without new methods and solutions.

Data transfers between communicating components are implemented using high-speed <b>serial</b> <b>communication</b> <b>lines</b> and asynchronous block interfaces, which themselves form IP for flexible interconnect implementation. ...|$|R

The message was transmitted from the receiving console to the sending console, character by character, punching a second paper tape at the sending console. Cross-office connections, and their readers and punches, were slightly faster than external connections, to limit congestion {{to the edges of}} the network. Each sending console also consisted of a paper tape punch and reader. Output from each sending console was transmitted via outgoing lines to other switching centers or to destination teleprinters.
