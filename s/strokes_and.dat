5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic <b>strokes,</b> <b>and</b> blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and Matchbox Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, and the success of some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The <b>Strokes</b> <b>and</b> Arcade Fire.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} clarify the {{validity}} of self-reported <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> myocardial infarction (MI) among Japanese population, because information on the validity, particularly on the sensitivity, of self-reported cardiovascular disease is limited and may differ among countries. Study Design and SettingUsing the 10 -year follow-up questionnaire <b>and</b> a <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> MI registry in the Japan Public Health Center–based prospective Study (JPHC Study) cohort (n = 91, 186), we calculated sensitivity and positive predictive values of self-reported <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> MI incidence over 10 years. ResultsSensitivity of self-reported incident stroke was 73 %, and that for MI was 82 %. Positive predictive values were 57 % for <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> 43 % for MI. The supplemental inclusion of self-reported angina pectoris increased the sensitivity of MI to 89 %, but attenuated the positive predictive value to 18 %. Sensitivity of self-reported stroke was highest for subarachnoid hemorrhage (88 %), but did not differ greatly among other stroke subtypes, affected sites or size. ConclusionSelf-reported <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> MI seem sensitive enough to use for exclusion of <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> MI at baseline in Japanese cohort studies. However, self-report has too many false positives {{to be used as}} the only criterion for incident <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> MI...|$|R

5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, <b>strokes,</b> <b>and</b> erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|In April 1964 Monteux {{conducted}} {{his last}} concert, {{which was in}} Milan with the orchestra of Radiotelevisione italiana. The programme consisted of the overture to The Flying Dutchman, Brahms's Double Concerto and Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. Unrealised plans included his debut at The Proms, and his 90th birthday concert, at which he intended to announce his retirement. In June 1964 Monteux suffered three <b>strokes</b> <b>and</b> a cerebral thrombosis {{at his home in}} Maine, where he died on 1 July at the age of 89.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, al-Jamri was {{released}} {{along with other}} opposition activists.

5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic <b>strokes,</b> <b>and</b> decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle contraction and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power <b>strokes</b> <b>and</b> muscle contraction.|$|E

40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} {{assessed}} the associations between sleep duration <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> subtypes. We examined whether sleep duration {{is associated with}} mortality from total <b>stroke,</b> ischemic <b>stroke,</b> <b>and</b> hemorrhagic <b>stroke</b> in a population-based cohort of Japanese men and women. Methods: Subjects included 12 875 men and 15 021 women aged 35 years or older in 1992, who were followed until 2008. The outcome variable was stroke death (ischemic <b>stroke,</b> hemorrhagic <b>stroke,</b> <b>and</b> total <b>stroke).</b> Results: During follow-up, 611 stroke deaths (354 from ischemic stroke, 217 from hemorrhagic <b>stroke,</b> <b>and</b> 40 from undetermined stroke) were identified.

5|$|The {{sunflowers}} {{were painted}} {{to decorate the}} walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush <b>strokes,</b> <b>and</b> their contrast against often dark backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, <b>strokes,</b> <b>and</b> other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|After her defeat, Dallas {{worked in}} private {{business}} {{after her husband}} suffered several <b>strokes</b> <b>and</b> was forced to retire. Initially, she worked as an associate editor at the Philadelphia Daily News. In 1959, she was hired as an investment banker at Dehaven & Townsend, Crouter & Bodine. As in politics, {{she was one of}} a few women working in a male-dominated profession. When her husband died, Dallas moved out of their Chestnut Hill home to a retirement community in Delaware County, but continued working until the age of 76. She also remained active on several charitable boards including serving as a commissioner of Valley Forge State Park (now Valley Forge National Historical Park) and in the nonpartisan watchdog group, the Committee of Seventy. She died on January 13, 1983, and was buried alongside her husband in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of <b>strokes</b> <b>and</b> other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, <b>strokes</b> <b>and</b> deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E

Acuña commented that Oreiro mastered the basic techniques more quickly than most beginner boxers. For this training, Oreiro temporarily gave up her vegetarian diet. Another plot required the characters to fly a Piper Tomahawk airplane and make an emergency landing. This was risky filming, and Arana and Oreiro did not use stunt doubles for it. The scene, which was {{the first of its kind}} in a daily Argentine telenovela, required four professional pilots, five special effects experts, and two additional aircraft used for filming the main aircraft from the outside.

5|$|In 1959, {{the couple}} {{purchased}} a house together located on Burlington Crescent in Toronto, near Edith's clinic and lived there until their retirement. In 1965, both women retired and sold their Toronto home, {{moving to the}} farm house owned by the Fraser family in Burlington, Ontario. The farm was located in a very scenic setting on the Niagara Escarpment, near the Bruce Trail. Fraser, who enjoyed gardening, tended the ground and Williams, who was a fine cook, enjoyed cooking for their frequent guests. Having become interested in mountaineering, Williams enjoyed mountain-climbing and both women enjoyed taking excursions which allowed them to be outdoors. In their archives are many photographs taken with groups of women on camping and canoe trips. Williams suffered a severe stroke {{near the end of}} 1976 and never fully recovered from it requiring repeated hospitalizations at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Fraser drove in daily from Burlington to visit Williams. She died in 1979, after a series of additional <b>strokes</b> <b>and</b> Fraser returned to the home in Burlington where she remained until three weeks before her death, when her family placed her in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|There {{were only}} two matches between the First and Second Tests. Loxton took a total of 2/29 and scored only 17 against Northamptonshire, and was rested against Yorkshire. Brown made a century in the latter match, and Australia fielded an {{unchanged}} team for the Second Test at Lord's and completed another victory. As the tour reached its halfway point, the Victorian began to make an impression. In the next county game, his opening partnership with Neil Harvey scored the 122 runs needed to beat Surrey in only 58 minutes, Loxton making 47. He also took a total 3/90 for the match, bowling 43 overs as Bradman allowed his main bowlers to recuperate after the previous Test. In the following match against Gloucestershire he contributed an unbeaten 159 including four sixes, as Australia made their highest score for the summer, 7/774 declared. The all-rounder's innings involved a series of powerful <b>strokes</b> <b>and</b> he was particularly noted for using his feet to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard. The Gloucestershire bowler had been touted as a possible Test selection, because the other England bowlers had failed to contain Australia’s batsman {{in the first two}} matches, but his chances of selection were ended by the tourists’ assault at Bristol.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Studies on the {{epidemiology}} of <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> transient ischemic attack (TIA) {{are very}} limited in Asian elderly populations. We investigate the prevalence, risk factors, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities of <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> TIA in community-dwelling Korean elders. Methods—Standardized face-to-face interviews, neurological examinations, and physical examinations {{were conducted in}} 714 randomly sampled community-dwelling Korean elders aged 65 years. Diagnoses of <b>stroke</b> <b>and</b> TIA were made according to the World Health Organization criteria. Results—Age- and education-standardized prevalences of <b>stroke,</b> TIA, <b>and</b> cerebrovascular disorder (implying stroke or TIA) were estimated to be 10. 1 %, 8. 9 %, and 15. 4 %, respectively, in Korean elders. Hypertension and current smoking {{were associated with the}} risk of stroke, whereas atrial fibrillation, high diastolic blood pressure, high serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hypertension were associated with the risk of TIA. Cerebrovascular disorder was associated with the risk of major depressive disorder, vascular dementia, and nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment (P 0. 05).
