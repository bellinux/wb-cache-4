5|$|Nemegt sediments {{preserve}} large river {{channels and}} <b>soil</b> <b>deposits</b> that indicate {{a far more}} humid climate than those suggested by the underlying Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers. The rock facies of this formation suggest the presence of mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The Maastrichtian {{stage in}} Mongolia, as {{preserved}} in the Nemegt Formation and at Nogon-Tsav, was characterized by a wetter and more humid climate compared with the semi-arid environment {{preserved in the}} earlier, underlying Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations. Nemegt sediments preserve floodplains, large river channels and <b>soil</b> <b>deposits,</b> but caliche deposits indicate periodic droughts. This environment supported a more diverse and generally larger dinosaur fauna than in earlier times. Kurzanov reported that other theropods, including Tarbosaurus, ornithomimosaurs and therizinosaurs were discovered at the same locality, but these remains have never been reported in detail. If the Nogon Tsav fauna {{was similar to that}} of the Nemegt Formation, troodontid theropods, as well as pachycephalosaurs, ankylosaurids and hadrosaurs would also have been present. Titanosaurian sauropods were also potential prey for predators in the Nemegt.|$|E
5|$|The three known Deinocheirus {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of}} the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago. The rock facies of the Nemegt Formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Such large river channels and <b>soil</b> <b>deposits</b> are evidence of a far more humid climate than those found in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts occurred. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>deposits</b> are {{affected}} by the mechanism of transport and deposition to their location. Soils that are not transported are called residual soils—they exist at the same location as the rock from which they were generated. Decomposed granite is a common example of a residual soil. The common mechanisms of transport are the actions of gravity, ice, water, and wind. Wind blown soils include dune sands and loess. Water carries particles of different size depending on the speed of the water, thus soils transported by water are graded according to their size. Silt and clay may settle out in a lake, and gravel and sand collect {{at the bottom of a}} river bed. Wind blown <b>soil</b> <b>deposits</b> (aeolian soils) also tend to be sorted according to their grain size. Erosion at the base of glaciers is powerful enough to pick up large rocks and boulders as well as soil; soils dropped by melting ice can be a well graded mixture of widely varying particle sizes. Gravity on its own may also carry particles down from the top of a mountain to make a pile of soil and boulders at the base; <b>soil</b> <b>deposits</b> transported by gravity are called colluvium.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the natural}} {{resources}} in the Salween basin remained unexploited until the twentieth century as well. Prior to extensive logging activity in the upper watershed, the Salween's flow varied much less between the rainy and dry seasons, allowing for fertile riverbanks fed by <b>soil</b> <b>deposits</b> from the river. With the clear-cutting of the forests during the 20th century, specifically in 1997, soil began to erode away in great amounts and was unable to hold water, thus lowering the river's baseflow during the dry season and causing floods of greater size during the monsoon. The erosion has also made the Salween very silty. The construction of logging roads made it even easier for Burmese interests to enter the area, exploiting other resources and severely damaging the native way of life. Although strict limitations have been imposed on logging, illegal practices continue, including one in 2009 involving the discovery of teak logs floating in the river on the Thailand-Burma border.|$|E

500|$|Three {{locations}} between Spitak and Nalband (to the west) {{that were}} within several kilometers of the fault were examined for ground disturbances and each site was scrutinized {{for the effects}} of liquefaction. The first site was on the highway that linked the three most damaged cities and was adjacent to a tributary of the Pambak river where the water table was close to the surface. The highway's embankment failed, and though the site was repaired immediately, the resulting damage to the highway caused considerable delay in getting people and supplies {{into and out of the}} area following the disaster. Numerous sand boils were seen in the region northwest of Spitak including within [...] of the failed embankment. A second site that was close to the fault, also near the Pambak river and with similar <b>soil</b> <b>deposits,</b> did not experience liquefaction, though it would have experienced the same high peak ground accelerations as the failed highway embankment.|$|E

[...] In some North American states and provinces, there are laws to protect these important archaeological and historical sites.

2500|$|The petroform {{sites in}} Wisconsin are being studied more closely, {{and can be}} dated more easily because of <b>soil</b> <b>deposits</b> over centuries. [...] Many other sites have no layers of soil {{deposited}} around the petroforms. [...] Forested areas and soil cover have partially protected many of the petroforms in Wisconsin and Minnesota. [...] In [...] many areas across the prairies, large circular medicine wheels were made as astronomical devices, directional maps, and for ceremonial use. [...] Some of these medicine wheels are large, and many were destroyed for agricultural needs by clearing the grasslands of any rocks. [...] Some are intact, {{such as in the}} Turtle Mountains, and other sandy, rocky, or more remote areas that had less crop farms and settlements. [...] Mound building was also associated in some way with petroform use. [...] Petroforms originally predated the use of mounds and other human-made earthen works that required more time and effort. [...] Although mound building could have originally been necessary and practical to provide some higher ground during floods. [...] There is some speculation that larger mounds would have served as dikes and defensive fortifications, including providing higher ground to keep watch.|$|E
