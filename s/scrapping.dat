5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Lorraine {{served as}} a gunnery {{training}} ship in Toulon. She was then used as a barracks ship until February 1953, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for <b>scrapping</b> at {{the end of the}} year. She was broken up for scrap outside Toulon the following year. Bretagne remained at the bottom of Mers-el-Kébir until she was raised for <b>scrapping</b> in 1952 and broken up.

40|$|By {{means of}} a ‘Cycle of Matter’ model a {{comprehensive}} <b>scrap</b> cycle can be estimated for a region, country or continent. The model covers <b>scrap</b> flows between the three main actors defining the cycle, i. e. <b>scrap</b> users, <b>scrap</b> generators and <b>scrap</b> dealers. The ‘Cycle of Matter’ incorporates the generation and use of three types of <b>scrap,</b> i. e. home <b>scrap,</b> prompt <b>scrap</b> and obsolete <b>scrap.</b> It allows for a better assessment {{of the impact of}} government policies regarding <b>scrap</b> recycling {{in various parts of the}} <b>scrap</b> cycle. This paper presents the main results of a detailed study of the national <b>scrap</b> recycling industry of a developing country, Tanzania. The <b>scrap</b> flows in the ‘Cycle of Matter’ model were estimated on the basis of specially tailored surveys amongst <b>scrap</b> users, producers and traders, and on the basis of secondary data and coefficients derived from the literature. The paper demonstrates that the model is a powerful tool for the analysis of the <b>scrap</b> cycle. The study reveals that Tanzania possesses large surpluses of <b>scrap.</b> These surpluses are increasing over time. The <b>scrap</b> users — foundries and steel mills — are not capable of utilising all available <b>scrap.</b> Large quantities of <b>scrap</b> are thus either dumped in the environment or transferred abroad. Foundries and steel mills will only be able to make better use of existing <b>scrap</b> surpluses if they succeed in upgrading their quality of their production processes...|$|R
40|$|Besides iron ore, {{the main}} raw {{material}} {{of iron and}} steel production is steel <b>scrap.</b> This paper presents the quality and sources of creation the iron and steel <b>scrap</b> and estimation of their creation in the future.

Alloyed steel <b>scrap</b> known composition can often be used as an addition to a metal charge for steel production of the desired composition. Considering the steel <b>scrap</b> formation, the three major groups are elaborated: own <b>scrap</b> or circulation <b>scrap,</b> processing <b>scrap</b> and amortization <b>scrap.</b> The balancing model for estimating of steel <b>scrap</b> creation is based on the calculating the coefficients of the generation circulation, processing and amortization <b>scrap,</b> which are used as the basis for successful modelling...|$|R

5|$|Magnificent {{remained}} at Devonport until August 1917, {{serving as an}} overflow ship. In August 1917, she began a refit at Harland & Wolff in Belfast for conversion to an ammunition ship. When her refit was completed in October 1918, she was transferred to Rosyth for service as an ammunition store ship. Magnificent {{was placed on the}} disposal list on 4 February 1920, but continued to serve as an ammunition store ship at Rosyth until April 1921. She was sold for <b>scrapping</b> on 9 May 1921. <b>Scrapping</b> began at Thos W Ward Inverkeithing the following year.|$|E

40|$|Economy-wide <b>scrap</b> rates {{could be}} {{estimated}} if economy-wide original values {{of fixed assets}} and investment data were available, but they are not. Therefore, <b>scrap</b> rates are estimated based on subsets of the whole economy where the necessary data to do so are available. <b>Scrap</b> rates can be calculated from two independent combinations of the accounting identities presented in the paper. Depreciation-based <b>scrap</b> rates One way to calculate <b>scrap</b> rates is {{to make use of}} depreciation rates. With cumulative depreciation from equation (1) and depreciation from equation (5), <b>scrap</b> values (the original value of decommissioned fixed assets) follow in equation (4); <b>scrap</b> rates are obtained by inserting the <b>scrap</b> value in equation (3).

50|$|<b>Scrap</b> {{reporting}} - This can be {{the most}} difficult area to maintain with any integrity. Start with isolating the <b>scrap</b> by providing <b>scrap</b> bins at the production site and then record the <b>scrap</b> from the bins on a daily basis. One benefit of reviewing the <b>scrap</b> on site is that preventive action can be taken by the engineering group.|$|R
5|$|On 21 November 2008, the {{two ships}} left Portsmouth {{for the last}} time for Aliağa, Turkey under tow. <b>Scrapping</b> took place in the same yard which was <b>scrapping</b> the Tuxedo Princess, a former ferry and {{floating}} nightclub that had been berthed underneath the Tyne Bridge. Following a decommissioning ceremony at Cardiff city hall, her bell was removed and is now mounted in the north aisle of St John's Parish Church in Cardiff.

40|$|Cellular solids were {{processed}} from machined <b>scraps</b> of {{a medium}} carbon steel by sintering.

The flow stress in the plateau region for the cellular solid made of the as-machined <b>scraps</b> was higher than that of the one made of the annealed <b>scraps.</b> Clearly, the bonding strength between <b>scraps</b> was increased by the high dislocation density in the as-machined <b>scraps...</b>|$|R
40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{experimentation}} which took place at a cable manufacturing company. The thesis describes and summarizes the various strategies and techniques that has been applied and practiced for <b>scrap</b> reduction. DMAIC and Six Sigma Technology has been proven very help full {{in order to reduce}} <b>scrap</b> to a major extent. DMAIC help to identify areas in process where extra expense exist, identify the biggest impact factor related production expenses, introduce appropriate measurement system, optimize process and reduce production cost and time. Many issues were detected by the production, such as a lack of a unified procedure for documenting <b>scrap,</b> as well as cable manufacturing concerns suggested by new and experienced operators. Another concern was how best to focus on insulated wire <b>scraps,</b> the reason for <b>scraps</b> and how to correct such things and prevention. The research task of accurately measuring the <b>scrap</b> by improving <b>scrap</b> logistic proved to be very successful in order to measure <b>scrap</b> accurately. A statistical approach has been taken to find the factors affecting the <b>scrap.</b> ^ The results indicate a precise way for <b>scrap</b> reduction. The results starts from the plant level <b>scrap,</b> in comparison with the <b>scrap</b> in previous months in this year. ...|$|R

40|$|Consumer {{electronic}} equipment (brown goods), such as television sets, radio sets, and video recorders, are most common.

A comparison of TV <b>scrap,</b> personal computer <b>scrap,</b> and printed circuit boards <b>scrap</b> shows that the content of non-ferrous metals and precious metals in TV <b>scrap</b> is much lower than in personal computer <b>scrap</b> or printed circuit boards <b>scrap.</b> It is expected that recycling of TV <b>scrap</b> will not be cost-effective by utilizing conventional manual disassembly. The result of particle shape analysis indicates that the non-ferrous metals particles in TV <b>scrap</b> formed as a variety of shapes, it is much more heterogeneous than for plastics and printed circuit boards.

40|$|The <b>scrap</b> metal {{industry}} {{is part of}} the broader recycling industry that involves the collection,separation and processing of materials for manufacture into raw materials or new products. The demand for <b>scrap</b> metal is a derived demand – based on the demand for steel because <b>scrap</b> metal is an input to steel production. Steel demand in turn is based on demand by construction,manufacturing and other industrial sectors. Hence prices for <b>scrap</b> metal are a function of prices for steel. <b>Scrap</b> metal is an international commodity market – Australia is essentially a price taker and prices are set in global markets based on demand and supply factors. Prices of <b>scrap</b> metal in Australia are essentially set by the world price. Estimates of the sensitivity of Australian (or even global) <b>scrap</b> metal prices to global economic conditions are difficult to find. Nonetheless, one implicit estimate for Australia is that a 1 per cent fall in demand for <b>scrap</b> metal results in a fall in domestic <b>scrap</b> metal prices of 0. 46 per cent. Nonetheless estimates of the price sensitivity of <b>scrap</b> metal to demand and global economic conditions can be highly volatile. Evidence suggests global <b>scrap</b> metal prices regularly halve and double over the period of 18 - 24 months. ...|$|R
