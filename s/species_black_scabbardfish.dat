50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is of {{economic}} importance to fisheries associated with {{countries of the}} Iberian Peninsula, and especially with the Madeira Islands where they are prized for food. The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is also fished around areas of Iceland, France, Ireland and around some areas around the Canary Islands. Because of its good flesh quality, it usually fetches high prices. The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> fish, along with the crab {{are the two most}} sought after sea products for consumption in the Madeira Islands and Portugal and therefore play a huge economic role in these locations. In areas in Portuguese waters the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> has traditionally been caught by line gears. In the NE Atlantic around the areas of France and Ireland the fish are caught by trawlers. The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> has high economic value in areas such as Portugal, it is the most important deep-water fish exploited, and landings of the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> increased from 2700 tonnes per year between the years of 1988 and 1993 and around the year of 2000 and increased to 2900 tonnes in landings obtained in the year of 2007. In the last decade alone landings of the black scabbard fish have increased to about 6000 tonnes, 3000 tonnes in Madeira and 3000 tonnes in mainland Portugal.|$|R

40|$|The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is a {{deep water}} species of high {{commercial}} interest in the NE Atlantic. Specimens were collected from commercial trawls {{to the west of}} the British Isles and from longliners operating near Madeira between September 2008 and May 2010. Stomach content analysis was confined to samples from the northern area, because of a high number of empty stomachs from Madeira. Stable isotope analyses identified that <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> feeds on <b>species</b> with epipelagic and benthopelagic affinities. For the west of British Isles, the ?N values were significantly different between seasons suggesting a change in the diet throughout the year. <b>Black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> have higher ?N and ?C values compared with other co-occurring benthopelagic feeders and lower nitrogen values than the true benthic predators and/or scavengers. Comparison with stable isotope analysis in samples from Madeira indicated that <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> feed at a similar trophic level and has the same trophic niche width in both areas, assuming similar baseline isotope compositions. The diet in the northern area comprised fish (68 % N), crustaceans (22 % N) and cephalopods (15 % N) with blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) constituting 40 % of the prey. Seasonal shift in diet was observed, with a predominance of blue whiting (70 %) in the first quarter of the year, shifting to a more diverse diet in the remainder of the year. These results indicate that the diet of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is closely linked with the seasonal migration of blue whiting and that they likely select prey in proportion to availability. This study demonstrates that the combined used of both methods can elucidate the trophic ecology of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> in situations where conventional methods alone provide insufficient data...|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is bathypelagic by day but moves upwards in {{the water}} column at night to feed at middle depths on crustaceans, {{cephalopods}} and other fishes, mostly grenadiers, codlings (family Moridae) and naked heads (family Alepocephalidae). The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> coexists spatially with aphanopus intermedius Parin, which is a species commonly known as the intermediate scabbardfish. The narrow, elongated body of the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> along with its pointed head and long dorsal fin, are adapted for fast swimming. This fish has a large terminal mouth with large fang like teeth for efficient predation. In order to camouflage well, it has a coppery-black coloration with an iridescent tint. The fish’s large eyes which have a diameter of 1/5-1/6 of the head length, are of such a large size to facilitate sight in low light. They become sexually mature at a length of about 80 cm. Both the eggs and the larvae are pelagic, drifting with the plankton. In general, the size distribution moves towards higher values from north to south of the NE Atlantic. Eggs and larval stages of this fish are unknown and juvenile fish are rarely caught. Juveniles, however, are reported to be mesopelagic. The life cycle of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is unknown, but the most common hypothesis is that one single stock undertakes a large scale clockwise migration around the NE atlantic. Spawning is restricted to certain areas including Madeira, the Canary Islands, and possibly further south. The juvenile <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> stay to feed and grow for a few years in the fisheries south of the Faroe Islands and the west of the British Isles. Afterwards, the juveniles then move south towards mainland Portugal and even further south to the spawning areas. The most recent studies indicate that the maximum age of the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> from Madeira was about 14 years and the maximum age in Mainland Portugal was about 12 years. As opposed to most shelf demersal and pelagic commercial fish, the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> exhibit a slow growth rate in adults. This slow growth rate results from energy investment of growth and reproduction.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the NE Atlantic in differing stages of growth through its life. This fish performs a clockwise migration during its life cycle driven by reproduction and feeding habits. The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> spawns near the Madeira Islands and the Canary Archipelago during the months of October through December. It has been hypothesized that they then head north to cooler waters where they will feed and grow. Upon reaching adulthood, they will then move south again to the waters off Portugal until they are of reproductive maturity age when they will then return to their spawning grounds. There is some debate on the spawning areas of the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish.</b> Though the Madeira spawning area is well known, {{there may be some}} other spawning areas off the northwestern coast of Africa as mature females have been found in this region during the reproductive time of its life cycle.|$|R
40|$|The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is a {{deep water}} species that {{supports}} commercial fisheries across a large area of the NE Atlantic shelf. The life history of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is poorly understood and a major unresolved issue is population structure. In this study it was used a combination of methodologies to get further knowledge in the life history and population structure of A. carbo over its wide distribution range in the Northeast Atlantic. The new knowledge acquired during this study, will increase our ability to better manage this species in the NE Atlantic. It has been postulated that fish caught {{to the west of}} the British Isles are pre-adults that migrate further south (to Madeira) for spawning, implying a single panmictic population. In this study, specimens of Aphanopus carbo were sampled between September 2008 and May 2010 from two different areas: NW Scotland (French trawlers and deep water surveys) and Madeira Islands (longliners commercial landings). Geographical differences in reproductive state of scabbardfish were evident, supportive of a north-south migration theory. In the northern area, all specimens found were immature, while in Madeira all maturity stages were observed. In Madeira, spawning occurred during the fourth quarter, with peak maturity in October (males) and in November (females). The age of this species has proven difficult and has led to different and contradictory age and growth estimates. For this study, we used two reading interpretations to determine age and estimate the growth parameters. To the west of the British Isles, specimens reached a lower maximum age and had a higher growth rate than those caught off Madeira. These differences are consistent with the theory of a single population of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> in the NE Atlantic, highly segregate, with smaller, immature and younger fish caught {{to the west of the}} British Isles and bigger and mature caught in Madeira Islands. The feeding ecology showed strong evidence that the diet of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is associated with the spawning migration of blue whiting, which may support a northerly feeding migration theory for <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish.</b> The stable isotope analyses in the muscle of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> identified that <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> feeds on <b>species</b> with epipelagic and benthopelagic affinities. Comparison with stable isotope analysis in Madeira samples indicated that <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> feed at a similar trophic level and has the same trophic niche width in both areas, assuming similar baseline isotope compositions. Otolith stable isotopes (oxygen - δ 18 O and nitrogen - δ 15 N) analyses were used as a tool to clarify migratory behaviour. Otolith isotope ratios can provide insight into whether adults caught around Madeira fed in an isotopically depleted northerly ecosystem (NW Scotland) during their pre-adult period and then migrate towards south to spawn. Overall, the results support a south-north migration of pre adult fish from spawning areas around Madeira and a north-south migration from the west of Scotland to the spawning areas. Given its life cycle there is an urgent need that the management process recognizes the existence of a continuous widely distributed stock of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> between the west of the British Isles and Madeira. The results highlight large scale dispersal in this species which needs to be treated as a highly migratory species and be managed as a single population...|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> stock {{structure}} is still unknown in European waters where, {{due to the}} scarcity of biological information, the ICES considers {{that there is a}} single stock unit. This study is the final outcome of a scientific project that applies a holistic approach to research on the population structure of the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> and aims to define the most appropriate strategy for the conservation of this resource in southern NE Atlantic waters. The factors studied include life history parameters, otolith shape analysis, parasites, landings-and-effort data and contaminants. Sampling was conducted between 2005 and 2007 in three areas of the southern NE Atlantic: mainland Portugal, Madeira and the Azores. The mainland and the Azores have an established commercial fishery, whereas the Azores has only an exploratory fishery. The majority of results indicated the existence of different stocks of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> in the study area. Of the 8 parameters, 6 were in agreement with separate stocks between the mainland and Madeira, 5 were in agreement with separate stocks between the mainland and the Azores, and 4 were in agreement with separate stocks between Madeira and the Azores...|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is a {{suitable}} host for the parasite Anisakis. This is mainly {{due to the}} fishes’ diet of infected hosts such as crustaceans (euphausiids, copepods and amphipods), fish and cephalopods. This parasite is a nematode {{that is capable of}} entering the hosts stomach wall or intestines. Scientists can and have used these parasites to track where the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> has traveled. The parasite Anisakis is commonly used for tracking since they are prevalent in waters nearby Portugal and the Madeira Islands. A study has been conducted on the infectivity of the Anisakis app. Larvae (Nematoda: Aniskidae) in the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> near Portuguese waters. The three regions that were observed in the study was the mainland coast of Portugal, Madeira, and Azores. The mainland and Madeira regions were observed throughout four seasons by scientists and the Azores was observed in two seasons. In all fish observed all were infected by Anisakis L3 larvae. Consumption of raw or under cooked black scabbard fish can result in health complications for humans. The only reliable treatment for a human affected with Anisakiasis is the removal of the nematodes through endoscopy, or surgery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The biology, ecology, and {{dynamics}} of the deep-sea teleost <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> in the northeast Atlantic are reviewed. The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> is a commercial bathypelagic species found in the NE Atlantic mostly from Iceland to the Canary Islands and Western Sahara, at depths from 800 to 1300 m. The spatial structure of its population is still uncertain, although the existence of one single stock that migrates around the NE Atlantic driven by feeding and reproduction {{is the most likely}} hypothesis consistent with available data. This review is based on data from commercial fisheries off the Faroe Islands, Hatton Bank, the west of the British Isles, and Portugal (mainland, Azores, and Madeira) and from Icelandic and Scottish scientific surveys collected between 1988 and 2012. Spawning of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> occurs around Madeira and the Canary Archipelagos during {{the last quarter of the}} year. According to the migratory hypothesis, eggs, larvae, and possibly juveniles move north to areas from south of Icelandic and Faroe Islands to the west of the British Isles where they remain for some years to feed and grow. Then, they move south to the area off mainland Portugal, where they reach the size of first maturity but do not reproduce, and later move further south to the spawning grounds.

40|$|Gonads of the NE Atlantic <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> were {{examined}} {{to give an}} insight into the reproductive biology of this species. It was concluded that <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> had determinate fecundity because: (i) a distinct hiatus in oocyte size was observed between pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes; (ii) vitellogenic oocytes increased in size during the spawning season; (iii) the number of vitellogenic oocytes did not increase during the spawning season; and (iv) the intensity of atresia was low in pre-spawning and spawning ovaries. Fecundity estimates ranged from 73 to 373 oocytes g- 1 female. Comparison of developing ovaries from mainland Portugal and Madeira revealed that those from Madeira were more advanced in development, with more cortical alveoli stage oocytes and a higher gonadosomatic index. Starting in July, the reproductive development of all females from mainland Portugal {{was interrupted by a}} generalised atresia of developing oocytes. Completion of gametogenesis and spawning only occurred for fish from Madeira but some fish from this area also failed to complete oocyte development due to mass follicular atresia of vitellogenic oocytes.

40|$|The {{variability}} in otolith contour shape of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo) from Portuguese waters was analysed for stock discrimination purposes.

50|$|Despite having huge {{market value}} {{and a strong}} hold in the typical Southern European diet, there are several health risks {{associated}} with consumption of the black scabbardish due {{to the presence of}} several toxic metals found within the fish including lead, mercury, and cadmium.

However, according to standards set by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agricultural Organization, as long as the liver is not consumed there are no real health risks in consuming the Black Scabbardish {{as long as it is}} done in moderation. 'The levels of toxic metals found in the fish were as follows...Liver: between 2.37 mg/kg and 4.5 mg/kg of mercury foundSkin: between 0.36 mg/kg and 0.59 mg/kg of mercury found. 0.11 mg/kg of cadmium found.muscles: 0.9 mg/kg mercury found. 0.09 mg/kg maximum candmium levels found.In every sample, the lead found was less than 0.10 mg/kg. <b>Black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> are known hosts to Anisakis.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to follow the seasonal chemical changes and to study the effect of culinary treatments on the nutritional value of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo). The proximate chemical composition of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (BSF) landed in Sesimbra (Portugal) was followed for one year. The nutritional quality (proximate chemical composition, amino acid and fatty acid profiles, cholesterol and minerals) of raw, fried and grilled BSF was evaluated in one period of the year. BSF is a semi-fatty species, the protein content was 15 - 17. 5 % and the most abundant amino acids were glutamic acid, aspartic acid and lysine. The dominant fatty acids were monounsaturated (66 %), followed by saturated (19 %) and polyunsaturated (10 %) ones. Potassium, phosphorus and sodium were the most abundant minerals. Some dehydration occurred in cooked BSF but fat content was the most affected nutrient, particularly in fried fish. These results may suggest that the absorption of frying oil led to important changes in the fatty acid profile, and particularly in the linoleic acid level. The highest protein losses were recorded in fried BSF. In general, the nutritional quality of grilled fish seemed to be more balanced than that of fried fish...|$|R
40|$|The <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo) is a benthopelagic species widely {{distributed}} across the NE Atlantic, {{where it is}} admitted to perform a clockwise migration throughout its life cycle stimulated by feeding and reproduction. To overcome the limitations of direct observation of this species, fatty acids profile (FA) and δ 15 N and δ 13 C stable isotopes (SI) were analyzed in the muscle tissue of the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> and related with diet and maturity. Specimens were collected in four geographic areas in the NE Atlantic: Iceland, {{the west of the}} British Isles, mainland Portugal, and Madeira. For all areas, the FA profile was related with the different phases of the reproductive cycle and with diet, whereas the SI were related with diet, environmental characteristics, such as latitude and depth, and particulate organic matter (POM). Stomach content of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> caught off mainland Portugal was analyzed and the most frequent prey item identified was the lophogastrid crustacean Gnathophausia zoea, followed by the cephalopod Mastigotheutis spp. and the teleost Rouleina maderensis. For specimens from Iceland and the west of the British Isles, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were the most important FA, followed by polyunsaturated (PUFA) and saturated FA (SFA), whereas for specimens from mainland Portugal and from Madeira the sequences were PUFA>MUFA>SFA and PUFA>SFA>MUFA, respectively. Immature specimens from the first three areas were found to be accumulating oleic acid which is an intermediate product of the metabolic pathway that transforms SFA to MUFA and these into PUFA. Specimens caught off Madeira were mature and showed a significant prevalence of ARA and DHA which are PUFA with an important role in reproduction. δ 15 N was significantly higher in the muscle of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> from Madeira, whereas δ 13 C was significantly lower in specimens from Iceland. The low isotopic ratios as well as the prevalence of certain fatty acid trophic markers (FATM) connected specimens from Iceland with small prey. Results indicated that the spatial differences in physiological aspects of this species are related with diet and prey availability in Madeira, mainland Portugal, and the west of the British Isles, as well as variations in the baseline values of the primary production that are related with latitude and depth, mainly in Iceland. The allometric effect of each area[U+ 05 F 3]s size ranges over δ 15 N supports the existence of ontogenic differences in the black scabbardfish[U+ 05 F 3]s diet.

This occurrence may be due to the areas lacking intrinsic and extrinsic factors that condition the maturity process in these areas. According to recent studies, developing females are dominant from April to August, and the reproduction period lasts from September to December with a prevalent number of pre-spawning and spawning females during this period. From December to March the majority of females are post-spawning. As for developing males their presence in seen throughout the year, however, mainly from March to August. Pre-spawning males are more abundant from July to November. Similar to the females, post-spawning males are prevalent from December to April. Generally, developing females are prevalent in Madeiran waters around spring and their reproductive cycles continue in this area, whereas mainland Portugal females begin to suffer from a generalized atresia from July on.|$|R
40|$|Aphanopus carbo, <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> {{specimens}} from 3 Portuguese regions (the mainland, Madeira and the Azores) during four (mainland and Madeira) or two (Azores) {{seasons of}} the year were examined {{for the presence of}} Anisakis. All the fish examined (n= 287) were infected with Anisakis L 3 larvae (prevalence = 100 %). Significant geographical differences in intensity were found: the Azores showed the lowest mean intensity value (53. 7) and Madeira the highest one (253. 9). The intensity of infection was positively correlated with the host length in specimens of Sesimbra and Madeira. Significant seasonal differences in intensity were found in the studied regions. The very high values in prevalence and intensity strongly suggest that the consumption of raw or undercooked black scabbard fish is a potential risk for human health...|$|R
5000|$|Like most seamounts, they attract fish. Over 175 {{species have}} been found there, {{including}} splendid alfonsino, black cardinal fish, <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish,</b> and wreckfish. Trawl fishing during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in approximately 20,000 tons of fish being harvested. [...] As a result, the seamounts were closed to demersal fishing (collecting fish {{near the bottom of}} the ocean, as opposed to pelagic fishing, collecting fish near the surface) beginning 1 January 1997. The original ban was supposed to be lifted 31 December 2010, but was extended until 31 December 2020. Almost a decade into the ban, a 2005 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution survey found that two of the peaks, Kükenthal and Yakutat, had been stripped bare of both corals and bottom-dwelling animals. However the survey, which covered both the Corner Rise and New England Seamounts, found 270 species of invertebrates and crustaceans, including 70 species unique to the Corner Rise Seamounts.|$|R
500|$|The {{first known}} {{bigeye sand tiger}} was a female [...] long caught off Madeira in April 1941, on a {{longline}} set for <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo). The specimen was mounted and later {{formed the basis for}} a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist Günther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae. He named the species noronhai in honor of Adolfo César de Noronha, the late Director of the Funchal Museum. Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias, which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family. When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias, the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox). Until more specimens were examined in the 1980s, some authors speculated that this species represented an extreme variant of the smalltooth sand tiger. Other names for this shark include black sand tiger, oceanic sand tiger, and bigeye ragged-tooth shark.|$|R
40|$|The WKAMDEEP met at IMEDEA (UIB/CSIC) in Esporles, Spain from 21 to 25 Octo-ber 2013 {{to review}} age {{determination}} methods and growth patterns of several deep-water fish species {{in order to}} pave the way for solid input data of future age-based assessments for these species. The species dealt with by the Group were: tusk (Brosme brosme), ling (Molva molva), blue ling (Molva dypterygia), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), greater silver smelt (Argentina silus), <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo) and black-spotted sea bream (Pagellus bogaraveo). All relevant information was collated in species-specific annexes, in order to have a protocol which was easy to consult and use for each species. The main report sums up the discussions in the group and presents results from the small WebGr-exchanges of each species made prior to and during the meeting. The body of the report is found in the species-specific annexes, which describe the general biological knowledge of growth and longevity for each species, review available ageing protocols, identify any unresolved problems with interpretation and recommend future actions...|$|R
5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|R
40|$|As human {{exploration}} and harvesting {{moves to the}} high seas, ecological understanding of the deep sea has become a priority, especially in those commercially exploited species whose life cycle, habitat use, and demographic structure remain poorly understood. Here we combine otolith trace element and stable isotope analyses with microsatellite data to investigate population structure and connectivity in the migratory deep-sea <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo), sampled along a latitudinal gradient spanning much of the known species range in the Northeast Atlantic. In each sampled life stage, otolith trace element and oxygen isotope compositions are similar among fish from different capture locations, but otolith compositions vary greatly between life stages. Oxygen isotope compositions indicate ontogenetic migrations from relatively warm water conditions during larval growth to cooler waters with increasing age. Analysis of microsatellite DNA also suggests lack of genetic structure among the areas sampled. The multidisciplinary approach employed collectively suggests that A. carbo individuals undergo an ocean-scale ontogenetic migration, beginning with spawning in southern, warm-water Macaronesian areas (potentially dominated by Madeira), followed by {{a large proportion of}} immature fish moving to and feeding on the continental slope in northern areas. The results lend the first conclusive evidence for defining the life-history circuit of this species and the perception of its stock structure across the North Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|Total mercury (THg), cadmium (Cd) {{and lead}} (Pb) {{concentrations}} were investigated in muscle, liver and gonad tissue of <b>black</b> <b>scabbardfish</b> (Aphanopus carbo) {{from the southern}} northeast Atlantic at three Portuguese locations: the mainland and the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the comparison of metal levels between geographic locations. Other factors such as size, sex and sexual maturity were also investigated. The median concentrations (mg/kg ww) of THg showed a decreasing trend in the order liver>muscle>gonad. Cadmium levels decreased in the order liver>gonad>muscle and Pb levels decreased in the order gonad>liver>muscle. According to the EU limits, the concentration observed in some specimens, particularly those of THg, raises some food safety concerns. In all the tissues the concentrations of each toxic metal differed between locations. In particular: i) THg concentrations in specimens from Madeira were significantly higher than those from the Azores and the mainland; ii) Cd levels in specimens from the mainland were significantly higher than those from Madeira and the Azores; and iii) for all analysed tissues Pb levels were significantly higher in specimens from the Azores than in those from the mainland. The differences in toxic metal levels between locations were further discussed in relation to aspects of species dynamics and the influence of the main environmental features at each location...|$|R
