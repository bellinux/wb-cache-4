Additional value to plywood materials can be added by incorporating it into laminates with specific properties as enhanced crashworthiness, sound/vibration absorption, heat transfer insulation and electromagnetic shield properties. This work is related to increase plywood crashworthiness or impact properties. Therefore laminates have been made of one and three veneer birch plywood joined with thermoplastic polymer to different types of glass fibre and natural <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Incorporation of thermoplastic polymer with melting temperature close to plywood processing temperature allows unite plywood and laminates manufacturing. Also thermoplastic polymer increases vibration and impact absorption while <b>fibre</b> <b>fabric</b> materials enhance strength properties. In this research polyethylene is preferred as processing temperature of it is close to plywood, however for biodegradable composite polylactide is preferred. Implementation of natural <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics</b> and biodegradable polymer is of interest making fully biodegradable composite, therefore exclude problems with materials accumulation in waste disposals. In this study experimental impact response evaluation of plywood/PE/fabric laminates has been performed using INSTRON 9250 HV drop-tower.

Therefore, an experimental program was developed to evaluate the mechanical damaging effect on short corbels behaviour by using strain gauges. According to this program, five reinforced concrete corbels were tested under a three-point bending up to failure. Three of them were damaged at 45, 65 and 90  % of their ultimate load. After the specimens were repaired with carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the loading was conducted till their failure. The fourth corbel which was not damaged. It was strengthened and tested until its collapse. The last one is the reference specimen corbel which was not reinforced. The test results with corbel specimens which were strengthened and unstrengthened are given. The significance to member performance is also explained. The measured load versus strain was too measured in the same way (with precision strain gauges) for others materials such as composite <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics,</b> steel bar and concrete at the cross section of corbel. The study shows that the composite <b>fibre</b> <b>fabrics</b> using bonding technique could be a convenient and effective strengthening method for concrete structures. Thus, steel reinforcement and carbon fabrics played a major role in the repair of corbels.

This paper {{illustrates}} investigations {{regarding the}} infiltration {{process of the}} thixotropic cast-alloy AlSi 7 Mg 0, 3 into laminated <b>fibre</b> woven <b>fabrics</b> by Fluid-Structure Interaction Analysis (FSI). As results of such FSI-Analysis {{on the one hand}} the kinematical behaviour of the reinforcement due to the infiltration process on the macroscopic and microscopic level on the other hand fluiddynamical effects of the regarded alloy are achieved. Thus in the run-up to timeconsuming and cost-intensive experiments, informative bases like fluidic optimizing of the cavity or the configuration and insertion of the reinforcement component can be numerically developed. Furthermore a reliable prediction of transient permeability of the <b>fibre</b> <b>fabric</b> is possible, which effects the infiltration process significantly. Numerical input data such as rheological parameters characterizing the behaviour of partial solidified alloys have been conducted. Therefor basic rheological tests of the aluminium cast-alloy AlSi 7 Mg 0, 3, like `HYSTERESIS TESTS´, `SHEAR RATE JUMP TESTS ´ and detection of `STATIC ´ and `DYNAMIC YIELD POINTS ´ and the `DIFFERENTIAL STRUCTURAL PARAMETER ´ have been conducted.
