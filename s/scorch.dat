5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were <b>scorch</b> marks on her side.|$|E
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf <b>scorch,</b> also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Phantoms saw heavy {{action in}} the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and are kept {{operational}} by overhaul and servicing from Iran's aerospace industry. Notable operations of Iranian F-4s during the war included Operation <b>Scorch</b> Sword, an attack by two F-4s against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor site near Baghdad on 30 September 1980, and the attack on H3, a 4 April 1981 strike by eight Iranian F-4s against the H-3 complex of air bases in the far west of Iraq, which resulted in many Iraqi aircraft being destroyed or damaged for no Iranian losses.|$|E
50|$|Nurungji (hangul: 누룽지) or <b>scorched</b> rice is a {{traditional}} Korean food made of <b>scorched</b> rice. After boiling and serving rice, a thin crust of <b>scorched</b> rice will usually {{be left in the}} bottom of the cooking pot. This yellowed <b>scorched</b> state is described as 'nureun' (눌은) in Korean and nurungji derives from this adjective.|$|R

25|$|Instead of painting, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to <b>scorch</b> an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a <b>scorch</b> mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object – thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.|$|E

25|$|After the {{occupation}} of Norway by Nazi Germany, mining continued under German administration until January 1942. As part of Operation Nordlicht in October 1944, Kirkenes was scorched, causing extensive damage to the mining company's infrastructure. Most of the facilities were bombed, and what was not bombed was burnt or blasted. A notable exception was the two power stations, which the Germans {{did not have time}} to <b>scorch.</b> Sydvaranger was hindered from starting its reconstruction until the damages had been priced, which was completed in September 1945.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Trunk Pacific dock stood {{just north}} of Colman Dock {{at the foot of}} Marion Street. The {{original}} dock was built in 1910 as the largest wooden pier on the West Coast. It was not there for long. On July 30, 1914, it was swept away by an explosion and massive fire. The cause has never been determined. Five people died and 29 more were injured. The flames were hot enough to <b>scorch</b> several parts of Colman Dock, but the fire department managed to contain the fire largely to the one pier. A replacement dock was promptly built, and survived until 1964, when it was replaced by waiting area for automobiles boarding ferries at the new ferry terminal.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the {{struggle}} are explicit in the Bibliotheca: realizing {{that he could not}} defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew Iolaus for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by Athena) of using a firebrand to <b>scorch</b> the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. The Hydra's one immortal head was cut off with a golden sword given to Heracles by Athena. Heracles placed the headstill alive and writhingunder a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius, and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood. Thus his second task was complete.|$|E
25|$|However, Falena's {{grip on the}} runes {{has gone}} {{somewhat}} awry. Two {{years prior to the}} start of Suikoden V, residents of Lordlake rioted and charged the East Palace, near the capital of Sol-Falena. In the confusion, the Dawn Rune, which was housed there, was stolen. Lordlake had previously been considered the most loyal of all the towns to the royal government and granted special privileges. With this seeming act of high treason by Lordlake, Arshtat took the Sun Rune upon herself, normally stored in Sol-Falena's palace on a pedestal, and used the Rune's power to <b>scorch</b> Lordlake's vegetation, wildlife, and river, killing its leader Lord Rovere in the process. Since bearing the Sun Rune, the normally compassionate Arshtat has grown more and more erratic in behavior, prone to mood swings and wild fits of vengeance.|$|E

500|$|The {{species that}} {{is causing the}} most {{impediment}} to restoration is the Old World climbing fern (Lygodium microphyllum), introduced in 1965. The fern grows rapidly and thickly on the ground, making passage for land animals such as black bears and panthers problematic. The ferns also grow as vines into taller portions of trees, and fires climb the ferns in [...] "fire ladders" [...] to <b>scorch</b> portions of the trees that are not naturally resistant to fire.|$|E

However, the technique created from the combination of Naruto and Sasuke's wind and fire elements, respectively, is also named a <b>Scorch</b> Style technique by Minato Namikaze, though it might be attributed to it being a combination of two elemental natures and not due to being a genetic attribute.|$|E

5000|$|Guoba ( [...] , , , lit. [...] "pan adherents"), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} mi guoba ( [...] , lit. rice guoba) is a Chinese food ingredient consisting of <b>scorched</b> rice. Traditionally guoba forms during the boiling of rice over direct heat from a flame. This {{results in the}} formation of a crust of <b>scorched</b> rice {{on the bottom of the}} wok or cooking vessel. This <b>scorched</b> rice has a firm and crunchy texture with a slight toasted flavour, and is sometimes eaten as a snack.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scorching</b> {{is similar}} to glazing except {{that it is not}} used to polish the stock. Instead, <b>scorching</b> does what it implies: as the {{temperature}} of the die heating plate is increased beyond a normal temperature range, a <b>scorched</b> effect is created in the embossed image, which results in an antique or shaded appearance. It is best to use a lighter colored stock for this procedure in order to provide a unique two-toned appearance. Caution should be used in requesting this effect, since it is easy to burn the stock if too much heat is used. If <b>scorching</b> occurs too close to the printed copy, it can interfere with the clarity of the printed copy; however, this may be the effect that is desired for a particular application.|$|R

In [...] "Trickery Treat", Paige experiences guilt over her inability to prevent the massacre of the magic community instigated by Christy. Leo is also shown as still coping with Christy's betrayal. He keeps a <b>scorch</b> mark left by Christy {{on one of the}} manor's walls as a reminder to Piper that the house is no longer a [...] "danger-free zone", and that she is not invincible. In the [...] issue [...] "The Heavens Can Wait", Prue Halliwell reveals that Billie and Christy were not destined to be powerful enough to confront the Charmed Ones. She explains that her bond to the Charmed Ones prophecy, extending even after her death, restricted her sisters from reaching their true powers and made them vulnerability to the Triad's plot with Billie and Christy. Christy does not make a physical appearance in either instance.|$|E

Vidya described her character as [...] "an epitome of grey" [...] and a departure from the conventional portrayal of women in cinema. In preparation for her part, she undertook professional training to speak in the local Uttar Pradesh-dialect. The feature as well as her performance received critical acclaim. Anupama Chopra of NDTV stated, [...] "Vidya Balan's smoldering looks <b>scorch</b> the screen even as her eyes hint at tragedy.
