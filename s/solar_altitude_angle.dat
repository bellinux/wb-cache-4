40|$|To {{comply with}} {{insolation}} requirements of some countries [1, 2], recommendations {{have been made}} on several graphical methods for estimating {{the shadow of a}} building or its features cast by sunlight on other features or buildings on the drawing paper [3, 4]. These methods use a series of graphs for estimating the solar shadow. To many architects, these methods are not easy to apprehend and are time-consuming for implementation. Furthermore, many projection lines will have to be drawn on the drawing paper, causing likely confusion and difficulty in identifying each line. Also, separate sheets of pre-drawn graphs have to be produced for different latitudes. There are now software developed for architects and students [5] to help them design for fenestration and obtain solar shading masks, and for obtaining solar shadows for buildings. In the learning process of a person, however, physical tools do maintain their contribution, and complement learning with the computer software. In pursuing this complementing contribution of the physical tools, a physical universal-solar-chart shadowplotter has been invented. This tool performs as a universal solar chart [6] for relating the latitude, day, apparent solar time, solar azimuth angle, and <b>solar</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>angle,</b> for any latitude selected. Also it enables an efficient plotting of the shadow of an object, such as the corner of a house, cast by the sun light on the ground, when the solar azimuth angle and <b>solar</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>angle</b> are known. In fact, these angles can also be found by the tool. This paper reports on the principles of design and operation of this tool. This tool however is first seen in its patented form [7], which does not contain sufficiently illustration of the principles to the normal architectural science readers. Therefore this paper serves the elaboration purpose. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Availability {{of solar}} {{radiation}} {{in the urban}} environment is determined {{to a great extent}} by urban geometry, namely how densely built-up an area is and how the given built volume is distributed spatially within the site. This paper explores relationships between urban geometry and solar availability on building façades and at the pedestrian level, with implications for buildings’ passive potential and outdoor thermal comfort, respectively. The study was based on the morphological and solar analysis of 24 urban forms of London, covering a wide range of built density values found across the city. Two aspects of solar availability were investigated at the neighbourhood scale, through statistical analysis: i) the relationships between urban geometry variables and solar availability indicators in different time periods, and ii) the seasonal solar performance of urban forms’ façades and ground. Apart from the strong, negative effect of density, the analysis revealed that solar availability on ground and façades is significantly affected by urban layout. Mean outdoor distance, site coverage, directionality and complexity were the most influential for the solar performance of open spaces; whilst building façades were mostly affected by complexity, standard deviation of building height and directionality. However, direct solar irradiance on ground and façades was found to be influenced by different variables in January and July, which is attributed to the different <b>solar</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>angles.</b> Related to that, urban forms have been identified that present higher irradiance values in January and lower in June when compared to others. Considering temperate climates, these examples highlight the potential for enhancing the seasonal solar performance of existing and future urban developments. Finally, the seasonal effect on solar availability appears to be much more pronounced for ground with its mean direct irradiance value increasing on average by a factor 15, from January to July, while for façades the increase is only by a factor 2. 6...|$|R

The cryogenic frostpoint hygrometer (CFH) gives the RS 92 accuracy above the 700 mb level; the ARM microwave radiometer gives the RS 92 accuracy in the lower troposphere; and the ARM SurTHref system gives the RS 92 accuracy at the surface using 6 RH probes with NIST-traceable calibrations. These RS 92 assessments are combined using the principle of Consensus Referencing to yield a detailed estimate of RS 92 accuracy from the surface to the lowermost stratosphere. An empirical bias correction is derived to remove the mean bias error, yielding corrected RS 92 measurements whose mean accuracy is estimated to be +/- 3 % of the measured RH value for nighttime soundings and +/- 4 % for daytime soundings, plus an RH offset uncertainty of +/- 0. 5 %RH that is significant for dry conditions. The accuracy of individual RS 92 soundings is further characterized by the 1 -sigma "production variability," estimated to be +/- 1. 5 % of the measured RH value. The daytime bias correction should not be applied to cloudy daytime soundings, because clouds affect the solar radiation error in a complicated and uncharacterized way...|$|E
40|$|Reflective roof {{coatings}} {{keep the}} roof cooler by minimizing solar absorption and maximizing thermal emission. Keeping {{the surface of}} the roof cooler allows less heat to be conducted into the interior of the building which reduces the cooling load in air-conditioned buildings and improve comfort conditions in non-air conditioned buildings. A number of cool white materials, compatible with most roofing products, are available on the market. To appeal to homeowners, special cool “color” products have been developed to match the dark colors of conventional residential roofs but are highly reflective in the invisible near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. Although many studies highlight the benefits of cool white coatings on roof membranes of low-slope roofs, knowledge of NIR reflective coatings on asphalt shingles of steep slope roofs remains limited. The intent of this exploratory study is to present a process {{that can be used to}} evaluate the perceived and actual benefits of NIR coatings field-applied to asphalt shingles on single-family houses. The proposed process can be applied to a large sample of homes and occupants in a future study. A questionnaire was designed to attempt to evaluate occupants’ perceived benefits in regards to their indoor environment and occupant satisfaction following applications of NIR coatings. Along with subjective data collection, a field-experiment was developed to objectively compare the thermal performance of an NIR reflective field-coated asphalt shingle roof system with that of a conventional asphalt shingle roof system. Questionnaire results indicated that occupants did not perceive any significant changes to their indoor environment but were satisfied overall with the application and appearance of the roof coating. Additionally, 50 % of occupants stated that their monthly energy costs somewhat decreased after the application. Interestingly, 63 % of respondents experienced some form of roof leak following the coating application. Among those who experienced roof leaks, 100 % of the roofs were 10 years or older. Field results showed that the coated roof surface was 2 to 5 ℉ cooler than the uncoated roof surface at midafternoon. Statistical testing for correlation between coated roof surface temperature and external conditions revealed that relative humidity was negatively correlated with coated roof temperature, while <b>solar</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>angle</b> was positively correlated with coated roof temperature. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop a model for predicting the surface temperature of the coated asphalt shingle roofs from the ambient temperature, sky conditions, dew point temperature, relative humidity, solar altitude and azimuth angle.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} design constraints and potential of applying the remote source solar lighting {{system to the}} enclosed lift lobbies of high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. No natural light is usually provided to these lift lobbies, which depend on electric lighting for illumination. The application of conventional light pipes requires minimum 3 m headroom and is not feasible to be applied in the high-rise residential buildings of 2. 8 m floor height in Hong Kong.

The modelling exercise was furthered by analysing one-year measured hourly irradiation data, for five tilted surfaces, for Lerwick (6 P 08 ”). The optimum values of the coeficients for Lerwick {{were found to be}} near those reported earlier for Easthampstead (51 ” 2 YN). The approach of separating sunlit surfaces from shaded ones and distinguishing between overcast and non-overcast sunlit surfaces was found to be fruitful again. A statistical test was employed for the validation of the isotropic and the presently proposed model for Lerwick. The isotropic model proved to be quite inadequate. The model now proposed was found to be adequate for the three cases although the plot between measured and computed sloped irradiation showed that the model for sunlit surfaces under non-overcast conditions could be further improved by incorporating the change of turbidity over the year. A similar plot prepared with Easthampstead data for an inclined surface reconfirmed the validity of the model established earlier.

40|$|This thesis deals with- {{various aspects}} of {{broadband}} horizontal solar irradiance. Quality control of measured datasets are identified and analysed. It was found that solar irradiance datasets may contain significant errors. These sources of errors were divided in two categories, the inherent instrument errors and operation related errors. Methods of assessing {{the quality of the}} datasets were evaluated and found to be unsatisfactory. A new method was hence developed to quality control the solar irradiance data. The quality control procedure consists of two tiers of tests. The first tests are physical tests that identify and remove data points that are physical impossibilities. The second tier tests consist of the creation of a mathematical envelope of acceptance in a sky clarity index domain. This envelope of acceptance is based on multiples of standard deviations of the weighted mean of clearness index to diffuse ratio. The available datasets in this study were thus quality controlled to remove any obvious outliers. Modelling the solar resource is an important tool for engineers and scientists. Such models have been developed since {{the second half of the}} 20 th century. Some models rely on one or two meteorological parameters to estimate the solar irradiance, while other models are more complex and require a far greater number of points. Two of these models have been analysed and evaluated. The two models are all-sky, broadband solar irradiance models. The first model analysed is the Meteorological Radiation Model, or MRM. This model is in fact a sunshine based model, with atmospheric turbidity taken into account as well. The beam irradiance component was found to be acceptable given the number of inputs required by the model. Any extra parameters would increase the complexity of the model, without noticeable improvements. The regressions were modified to take into account sunshine fraction banding. However the diffuse irradiance was identified as one which had the potential III for improvement. Thus, in the present work an attempt has been made to develop improved models. The new model was found to be far superior to the older, original model, thus the name Improved Meteorological Radiation Model, IMRM. The second type of model investigated is the cloud based radiation model. This type of model is simple to use and rely on regressions between irradiation, <b>solar</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>angle</b> and the cloud cover. Careful analysis of the cloud distribution reveals certain flaws in the current regressions. New regressions were formulated and the result was a model superior to all its predecessors. Clear-sky modelling is important for maximum load calculations; however, there is no method of extracting with accuracy clear-sky broadband data. Clear-sky identification techniques were evaluated and a new method was devised. These new datasets were used on four clear-sky models, MRM, Page's Radiation Model, PRM, Yang's radiation model and Gueymard's REST 2 model. It was found that using this new method of extracting extremeclear- sky data, the models performed better than when using quasi-clear-sky data. Solar radiation modelling is not an end by-itself, it must serve a purpose for engineers in their applications. Napier University has installed a 160 m 2 photovoltaic facility in 2003. A 27 -year solar radiation dataset was available for Edinburgh, to do feasibility calculations for the project; however this dataset contained gaps in the data. The cloud radiation model developed in this study was utilised to this end. In addition a complete life cycle analysis was performed on the project, and it was found that with an average efficiency at around 12 %, the facility will payback its embodied energy in eight years, and based on a relatively conservative forecast of energy prices, the financial payback is set at under 100 years.

40|$|Low-concentration solid {{dielectric}} {{compound parabolic concentrator}} (dCPC) and its variations {{have been}} widely regarded as an attractive solution {{to reduce the cost}} of a photovoltaic (PV) system, particularly for building-integrated application. Different from a mirror CPC, a dCPC allows the light beyond its acceptance angle to penetrate through its lateral surface. This escaped light could be actually used for daylighting, so the dCPC offers a potential for combined PV and daylighting application suitable for the atrium buildings or large green houses. In the modern buildings, an advanced daylighting system such as prismatic panels is used to balance between harvesting daylight and preventing excessive solar heat gain. In contrast, this study aims to evaluate the advantage of the miniature solid dCPC over common prismatic structures according to their daylight transmittance values under both standard and real sky conditions. A commercial optical analysis software PHOTOPIA is firstly used to compare the daylighting control performance between a dCPC rod and two common prismatic elements.

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to find simple {{criteria}} for automatic recognition of several meteorological phenomena using optical digital sensors (e. g., Wide-Field cameras, automatic DSLR cameras or robotic telescopes). The output of those sensors is commonly represented in RGB channels containing information about both colour and luminosity even when normalised. Transformation into other colour spaces (e. g., CIE 1931 xyz, CIE L*a*b*, YCbCr) can separate colour from luminosity, which is especially useful in the image processing of automatic cloud boundary recognition. Different colour transformations provide different sectorization of cloudy images. Hence, the analysed meteorological phenomena (cloud types, clear sky) project differently into the colour diagrams of each international colour systems. In such diagrams, statistical tools can be applied in search of criteria which could determine clear sky from a covered one and possibly even perform a meteorological classification of cloud types. For {{the purpose of this}} work, a database of sky images (both clear and cloudy), with emphasis on a variety of different observation conditions (e. g., time, <b>altitude,</b> <b>solar</b> <b>angle,</b> etc.) was acquired. The effectiveness of several colour transformations for meteorological application is discussed and the representation of different clouds (or clear sky) in those colour systems is analysed.

40|$|Spectral {{index method}} was widely {{applied to the}} {{inversion}} of crop chlorophyll content. In the present study, PSR 3500 spectrometer and SPAD- 502 chlorophyll fluorometer were used to acquire the spectrum and relative chlorophyll content (SPAD value) of winter wheat leaves on May 2 nd 2013 when {{it was at the}} jointing stage of winter wheat. Then the measured spectra were resampled to simulate TM multispectral data and Hyperion hyperspectral data respectively, using the Gaussian spectral response function. We chose four typical spectral indices including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), triangle vegetation index (TM), the ratio of modified transformed chlorophyll absorption ratio index(MCARI) to optimized soil adjusted vegetation index(OSAVI) (MCARI/OSAVD and vegetation index based on universal pattern decomposition (VIUPD), which were constructed with the feature bands sensitive to the vegetation chlorophyll. After calculating these spectral indices based on the resampling TM and Hyperion data, the regression equation between spectral indices and chlorophyll content was established. For TM, the result indicates that VIUPD has the best correlation with chlorophyll (R- 2 = 0. 819 7) followed by NDVI (R- 2 = 0. 791 8), while MCARI/OSAVI and TVI also show a good correlation with R- 2 higher than 0. 5. For the simulated Hyperion data, VIUPD again ranks first with R- 2 = 0. 817 1, followed by MCARI/OSAVI (R- 2 = 0. 658 6), while NDVI and TVI show very low values with R- 2 less than 0. 2. It was demonstrated that VIUPD has the best accuracy and stability to estimate chlorophyll of winter wheat whether using simulated TM data or Hyperion data, which reaffirms that VIUPD is comparatively sensor independent. The chlorophyll estimation accuracy and stability of MCARI/OSAVI also works well, partly because OSAVI could reduce the influence of backgrounds. Two broadband spectral indices NDVI and TVI are weak for the chlorophyll estimation of simulated Hyperion data mainly because of their dependence on few bands and the strong influence of atmosphere, <b>solar</b> <b>altitude,</b> viewing <b>angle</b> of sensor, background and so on. In conclusion, the stability and consistency of chlorophyll estimation is equally important to the estimation accuracy by spectral index method. VIUPD introduced in the study has the best performance to esti mate winter wheat chlorophyll, which illustrates its potential ability in the area of estimating vegetation biochemical parameters...|$|R
40|$|The solar UV {{radiation}} has prominent {{impacts on}} human life, {{animals and plants}} with positive and negative effects. Atmospheric ozone, which is formed from the photodissociation of molecular oxygen mainly in the stratosphere, absorbs a significant factor of solar UV radiation. The ozone in the stratosphere acts as a protective layer to prevent UV radiation reaching {{on the surface of}} the earth. Hence the intensity of solar UV radiation on the surface has a strong dependence on the Total Ozone Column (TOC). The UV irradiance on earth surface depends on geometrical factors such as <b>solar</b> zenith <b>angle,</b> <b>altitude,</b> latitude and other atmospheric parameters as well. This is an attempt to study the variation of solar UV flux at its four discrete wavelengths ranging from 305 - 380 nm at Kannur, which is located in the north of Kerala in India.

40|$|Abstract. Modeling {{photochemistry}} in {{the stratosphere}} requires solution of the equation of radia-tive transfer over an extreme range of wavelengths and atmospheric conditions, from transmission through the Schumann–Runge bands of O 2 in the mesosphere, to multiple scattering from tro-pospheric clouds and aerosols. The complexity and range of conditions makes photolysis calculations in 3 -D chemical transport models computationally expensive. This study pesents a fast and accurate numerical method, Fast-J 2, for calculating photolysis rates (J-values) and the deposition of solar flux in stratosphere. Fast-J 2 develops an optimized, super-wide 11 -bin quadrature for wavelengths from 177 to 291 nm that concatenates with the 7 -bin quadrature (291 – 850 nm) already developed for the troposphere as Fast-J. Below 291 nm the effects of Rayleigh scattering are implemented as a pseudo-absorption, and above 291 nm the full multiple-scattering code of Fast-J is used. Fast-J 2 calculates the mean ultraviolet-visible radiation field for these 18 wavelength bins throughout the stratosphere, and thus new species and new cross sections can be readily implemented. In comparison with a standard, high-resolution, multiple-scattering photolysis model, worst-case errors in Fast-J 2 do not exceed 5 % {{over a wide range}} of <b>solar</b> zenith <b>angles,</b> <b>altitudes</b> (0 – 60 km), latitudes, and seasons where the rates are important in photochemistry.

Rotation about the vertical axis varies the azimuth (compass bearing) of the pointing direction of the instrument. Rotation about the horizontal axis varies the <b>altitude</b> (<b>angle</b> of elevation) of the pointing direction.|$|R

Polaris itself remains almost stationary, always at the north (i.e. azimuth of 0°), and always at the same <b>altitude</b> (<b>angle</b> from the horizon), equal to the observer's latitude. These are then classified into quadrants.|$|R

Non tracking daylight systems, which redirect the light from <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> between 15 ° and 65 ° deep into rooms without causing glare effects, have been applied successfully in several office buildings recently. These systems are based on specially shaped polymer profiles which are inserted in double glass windows and which are commercialized under the label LUMITOP. Based on these macro structured systems, fixed in the upper area of windows above eyelevel, advanced solutions using micro structured components will be reported. Main objective of this new development is the reduction of material input (e. g. PMMA) and production costs. Additionally, the optical properties and redirection performance of the existing system should be improved. First, ray tracing calculations {{have been carried out}} to identify optimum solutions for micro structured components capable of redirecting daylight with high and almost homogeneous efficiency over the relevant angular range of <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> and not showing colour effects. The simulation results show, that by using a combination of micro lenses and micro prisms an almost homogeneous sunlight redirection of about 70 % is achieved in the angular range of <b>solar</b> <b>altitudes</b> between 25 ° and 65 °. These results could be confirmed by prototypes fabricated in the highly transparent silicone polymer PDMS. Suitable industrial production processes for large area panels (1400 mm x 400 mm x 4 mm) are hot embossing in thermoplastic materials like PMMA and UV-embossing in special UV-curing resins. Both processes are under development and the status of the development will be reported. cf 201...|$|R
40|$|Photocatalytic water {{splitting}} {{is a potential}} route for future carbon-free production of hydrogen. However catalysts {{still need to be}} enhanced in order to reach acceptable solar efficiencies. In the context of the project HyCats funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany a high performance test facility for the evaluation of the activity of photocatalysts under practical conditions was established. It mainly consists of a solar concentrator and a planar receiver reactor. A modified linear Fresnel concentrator configuration was chosen based on ray tracing simulation results and improved concerning the number of different facets and the tolerance of tracking errors. It meets the major demand of a homogeneous intensity distribution {{on the surface of the}} reactor. The SoCRatus (Solar Concentrator with a Rectangular Flat Focus) is a 2 -axes solar concentrator with a geometrical concentration factor of 20. 2 and an aperture area of 8. 8 m 2. The tracking accuracy is better than 0. 1 ° respecting both the <b>solar</b> azimuth and <b>altitude</b> <b>angle.</b> Its 22 highly UV/Vis-reflective flat aluminum mirror facets reflect the sunlight resulting in a rectangular focus with a nominal width of 100 mm and a nominal length of 2500 mm. The reactor is placed in the focal plane at a distance of 2500 mm from the mounting plane of the facets and allows concentrated solar radiation to penetrate suspensions of water, electrolytes and photocatalyst particles flowing through it. Corresponding to a maximum angel of incidence of 36. 6 ° the Quartz window reflects not more than 5 % of the incoming radiation and assures only marginal absorption, in particular of the UV-part of the sun’s spectrum. The material of the receiver body is PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) providing reflection coefficients above 90 % concerning wavelengths of UV-A and UV-B. The special design of the reactor featuring two parallel reaction chambers offers the possibility to test two separate suspensions at the same irradiation conditions. A pump transports the temperate suspension to the reactor. The geometry of the reactor inlet and outlet minimizes critical volumes with inadequate flow. Any evolved gases are separated from the suspension in a tank together with nitrogen introduced in the piping upstream and are analyzed by micro chromatographs. Numerous devices are installed in order to control and monitor the reaction conditions. First experiments have been carried out using methanol as a sacrificial reagent...|$|R
40|$|Cultural {{feature is}} {{important}} element in geospatial information library and the height information is important information of cultural features. The existences of the height information and its precision have direct influence over topographic map, especially the quality of large-scale and medium-scale topographic map, {{and the level of}} surveying and mapping support. There are a lot of methods about height information extraction, in which the main methods are ground survey (field direct measurement) spatial sensor and photogrammetric ways. However, automatic extraction is very tough. This paper has had an emphasis on segmentation algorithm on shadow areas under multiple constraints and realized automatic extraction of height information by using shadow. Binarization image can be obtained using gray threshold estimated under the multiple constraints. On the interesting area, spot elimination and region splitting are made. After region labeling and non-shadowed regions elimination, shadow area of cultural features can be found. Then height of the cultural features can be calculated using shadow length, sun <b>altitude</b> <b>angle,</b> azimuth <b>angle,</b> and sensor <b>altitude</b> <b>angle,</b> azimuth angle. A great many of experiments have shown that mean square error of the height information of cultural features extraction is close to 2 meter and automatic extraction rate is close to 70 %...|$|R
