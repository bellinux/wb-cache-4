40|$|Background: Transcatheter {{closure of}} secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is {{nowadays}} the main treatment option in many centers worldwide. In symptomatic infants or {{in those with}} certain comorbidities, {{there is a need}} for early intervention. Limited data are available about the procedural safety in infants below 15 kg of weight. Methods: Retrospective review of all patients referred to our center for ASD closure by device between January 1998 and November 2014. Major complications included death, cardiac or respiratory arrest, <b>stroke,</b> <b>device</b> embolization and erosion, need for emergency surgery or recatheterisation due to other procedure-related complications, significant pleural/pericardial effusion requiring intervention, persistent arrhythmia or intraprocedural arrhythmia requiring cardioversion/ resuscitation, postprocedural significant valvular insufficiency or pulmonary vein obstruction, need for transfusion due to significant bleeding, and permanent vein thrombosis. Minor complications included transient arrhythmia, significant access site hematoma, transient vein thrombosis, transient limb paresthesis, and development of postprocedural infection occurring within 48 hours. Data were retrieved from the hospital's database and from the Swedish Registry for Congenital Heart Disease (Swedcon). Results: In total, 244 cases with age 15 kg, there were 6 major (one death related to device erosion in a 17 -year female with 26 mm ASD and absent retroaortic rim, surgical removal of device, arrhythmia requiring conversion in 2 patients, and need of transfusion) and 4 minor complications (transient arrhythmia). Conclusion: Transcatheter ASD closure appears to be safe and highly successful even in small infants. (Table Presented) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{investigated}} whether patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) {{have an increased}} risk of stroke due to permanent pacemaker (PPM) /implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. BackgroundData are lacking on the risk of stroke in patients with PFO and implantable intracardiac devices, either a PPM or an ICD. We investigated whether patients with PFO have increased risk of stroke due to PPM/ICD implantation. MethodsBetween 2001 and 2008, 2, 921 consecutive patients with PFO (67. 5 ± 16. 4 years of age, 52. 2 % male) were identified from our echocardiography database. These patients were divided into a device group (patients had PPM/ICD implantation for any reason after receiving a diagnosis of PFO) and a no device group (patients did not have PPM or ICD implantation). Patients who had PFO closure during follow-up were excluded. Both groups were matched for baseline characteristics and medications. The incidence of ischemic stroke was assessed in each group after propensity score matching (case:control ratio of 1 : 1 yielding 231 pairs). All patients completed at least 4 years of follow-up until May  2012. ResultsThere were 2, 690 patients in the n device group (67. 3 ± 16. 4 years of age, 51. 6 % male) and 231 patients in the device group (75. 4 ± 14. 6 years of age, 59. 3 % male). Six patients (2. 6 %) in the no device group and 6 (2. 6 %) in the device group had a stroke during the follow-up period. No difference in the rate of stroke, transient ischemic stroke, or stroke/transient ischemic stroke was observed between the 2 groups. ConclusionsThe risk of stroke in patients with PFO and an implantable intracardiac device is similar to those without an intracardiac device. In patients with PFO, without a history of <b>stroke,</b> <b>device</b> implantation might not be considered a risk factor for future stroke occurrence...|$|E

40|$|Humans {{experience}} {{the self as}} localized within their body. This aspect of bodily self-consciousness can be experimentally manipulated by exposing individuals to conflicting multisensory input, or can be abnormal following focal brain injury. Recent technological developments helped to unravel some of the mechanisms underlying multisensory integration and self-location, but the neural underpinnings are still under investigation, and the manual application of stimuli resulted in large variability difficult to control. This paper presents the development and evaluation of an MR-compatible <b>stroking</b> <b>device</b> capable of presenting moving tactile stimuli to both legs {{and the back of}} participants lying on a scanner bed while acquiring functional neuroimaging data. The platform consists of four independent <b>stroking</b> <b>devices</b> with a travel of 16 - 20 cm and a maximum stroking velocity of 15 cm/s, actuated over non-magnetic ultrasonic motors. Complemented with virtual reality, this setup provides a unique research platform allowing to investigate multisensory integration and its effects on self-location under well-controlled experimental conditions. The MR-compatibility of the system was evaluated in both a 3 and a 7 Tesla scanner and showed negligible interference with brain imaging. In a preliminary study using a prototype device with only one tactile stimulator, fMRI data acquired on 12 healthy participants showed visuo-tactile synchrony-related and body-specific modulations of the brain activity in bilateral temporoparietal cortex...|$|R
40|$|Acute ischemic strokes {{arising from}} {{blockages}} {{of the major}} brain-supplying arteries put patients at risk for extensive brain injury. Left untreated, these major strokes produce significant disability and death. Fortunately, recent advances in <b>stroke</b> <b>devices</b> have improved clinical outcomes in such patients, provided that they are treated early enough after their stroke onset. Using minimally invasive techniques, these devices are delivered through the arteries using catheters in order to remove the thrombus, or blood clot, that is blocking {{blood flow to the}} brain. However, further progress is needed, as approximately half of the major stroke patients who are treated in this way remain dependent or dead at 3 months after their stroke. In particular, a better understanding of which patients are likely to benefit from intervention is crucial. This thesis investigates the role of brain imaging to improve patient selection. Part I examines the use of various imaging approaches to identify those stroke patients who have already suffered large areas of brain injury, and as a result are unlikely to do well after treatment. Excluding such patients will improve the risk-benefit profile of stroke intervention and make treatment more cost effective. Part II explores the emerging field of thrombus imaging and the impact of thrombus characteristics on outcomes after intervention. Through this work, advances in <b>stroke</b> <b>devices</b> and procedural techniques can be targeted to the most difficult to treat thrombi. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the key research questions on the horizon...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} design methodologies {{for construction}} of an actuator that uses smart materials to provide hydraulic fluid power. In the class of actuators described, hydraulic fluid decouples the operating frequency of the output cylinder from the drive frequency of the piezoelectric or other smart material. This decoupling allows the piezoelectric to be driven at high frequency, to extract {{the maximum amount of}} energy from the material, and the hydraulic cylinder to be driven at low frequencies to provide long stroke. However, due to fluid compressibility and structural compliance, the fundamental impedance match between the fluid and the piezoelectric make it difficult to convert energy from the piezoelectric into pressurized hydraulic fluid flow. The basic design tradeoffs and major technical issues are discussed in the areas of materials, mechanical design, and fluid-mechanical interface. Prototype devices and component measurements are presented. Test methods are described, and test results quantifying pump pressure and flow, and actuator force and velocity are summarized. The series of tests show the potential of these devices for high force long <b>stroke</b> <b>devices</b> powered by smart materials...|$|R

Initial sensor-modulated pacemakers were designed for use in the ventricle. This review was undertaken to compare ventricular rate-adaptive pacing with dual chamber and nonrate-adaptive atrial modes. Rate-adaptive ventricular pacing is primarily indicated in patients with complete heart block and nonfunctional atria in whom increased rates are not associated with the development of myocardial ischemia or retrograde conduction. A responsive atrium remains the best measure of metabolic demand, and devices capable of maintaining atrioventricular (AV) sequencing provide superior hemodynamic performance at usual activity levels.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a pneumatic robot for functional movement training of the arm and hand after <b>stroke.</b> The <b>device</b> is based on the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton (WREX), a passive, mobile arm support developed for children with arm weakness caused by a debilitative condition. Previously, we scaled WREX for use by adults, instrumented it with potentiometers, and incorporated a simple grip strength sensor. The resulting passive device (Training WREX or “T-WREX”) allows individuals with severe motor impairment to practice functional movements (reaching, eating, and washing) in a simple virtual reality environment called Java Therapy 2. 0. However, the device is limited since it can only apply a fixed pattern of assistive forces to the arm. In addition, its gravity balance function does not restore full range of motion. Therefore, we are also developing a robotic version of WREX named Pneu-WREX, which can apply a wide range of forces to the arm during naturalistic movements. Pneu-WREX uses pneumatic actuators, non-linear force control, and passive counter-balancing to allow application {{of a wide range of}} forces during naturalistic upper extremity movements. Besides a detailed description of the mechanical design and kinematics of Pneu-WREX, we present results from a survey of 29 therapists on the use of such a robotic device. I...|$|R
