Its size {{was that of a}} large room; it was constructed of a kind of marble with a <b>sloping</b> <b>bottom</b> that varied from three to seven feet in depth, and water still ran in and out of it through large glazed pipes. Moreover round it was a footway about five feet across, from which opened chambers, unroofed now, that the bathers used as dressing-rooms, while between these chambers stood the remains of statues. One at the end indeed, where an alcove had protected it from sun and weather, was still quite perfect, except for the outstretched arms which were gone (the right hand I noticed lying {{at the bottom of the}} bath). It was that of a nude young woman in the attitude of diving, a very beautiful bit of work, I thought, though of course I am no judge of sculpture.

40|$|Abstract: Nonlinear wave-body {{interactions}} for {{a stationary}} surface-piercing body in water of finite depth with flat and <b>sloping</b> <b>bottoms</b> are simulated in a two-dimensional numerical wave tank, which is constructed mainly {{based on the}} spatially averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k H model for simulating the turbulence. The equations are discretized based on the finite volume method and the scheme of the pressure implicit splitting of operators is employed to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. By using the force time histories, the mean and higher-harmonic force components are calculated. The computational results are shown {{to be in good}} agreement with experimental and numerical results of other researchers. Then, the horizontal force, the vertical force and the moment on the surface-piercing body under nonlinear regular waves with flat and <b>sloping</b> <b>bottoms</b> are obtained. The results indicate that the bottom topographies have a significant influence on the wave loads on the surface-piercing body.

50|$|Shortly after {{completing}} his PhD in 1952, Ross was requested by Bell Telephone Labs (BTL) {{to join them}} as the hydrodynamicist on a Navy program to design and construction a system of underwater sensors (SOSUS sound surveillance system) intended to provide an early warning of the approach {{from a distance of}} any Russian missile-carrying submarine. The system used a signal processor called LOFAR, which detected low-frequency tonal components radiated by ships and submarines. Ross was assigned part-time to the small BTL group helping the Navy evaluate performance and developing target classification guides. Each SOSUS station had LOFAR equipment for forty directional beams and in the beginning records were kept of all the (mostly) merchant ship detections. It soon became apparent that some beams held many more ship contacts than others. It was also confirmed that the ships detected on these “hot beams” were more distant than those detected on other beams. Using a globe and following great circle routes Ross, in partnership with Larry Churchill, found that the hot beams originated {{on the other side of}} the ocean, at such places as Gibraltar and the English Channel, where ships transited between shallow water and deep water. Originally called the “Megaphone Effect” these long-range detections were explained by the phenomenon of down-slope propagation, by which sound from a near-surface source is reflected by a <b>sloping</b> <b>bottom</b> into the deep sound channel, where it can propagate long distances with minimum loss.|$|E

However, {{little is known about the}} ecological impacts of these fires, including vegetation recovery. The objective of this work is to study the impacts of a spring grassland fire on vegetation recuperation on an east-facing (A) and a west-facing slope (B), considering fire severity and slope position, 10, 17, 31 and 46 days after the fire. Because of their effects on fire behaviour, aspect, steepness and heterogeneity of topography favoured higher fire severity on slope B than on slope A. Three different slope positions were identified on slope A - flat top, middle <b>slope</b> and flat <b>bottom</b> - and five on slope B - flat top, middle slope, flat middle <b>slope,</b> <b>slope</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>slope</b> and flat <b>bottom.</b> Fire severity was high in top slope positions. The recovery of vegetation was very fast. By the end of the study, vegetation covered nearly 100 % of the study area, although fire severity, aspect and slope characteristics had implications on vegetation recovery. Plant cover recovered quickly on slope A. Ten and 17 days after the fire, plant cover was high in the bottom positions, where fire severity was relatively low. The major vegetation recuperation was observed between 17 and 31 days after the fire, in response to high rainfall. </p...|$|R
40|$|Velocities {{in a flat}} bottom, two {{electrode}} melter are 0. 03 to 0. 3 cm/s and are lowest on {{the cavity}} bottom where noble metals would tend to accumulate. Velocities in 45 {degrees} <b>sloped</b> <b>bottom,</b> three-electrode design {{are estimated to be}} from 0. 1 to 0. 4 cm/s and are highest {{near the bottom of the}} cavity, The terminal velocity of 100 micron-sized Pd in molten glass is about 1 x 10 {sup - 3 } cm/s, which is far slower than normal convection currents. Accumulation of noble metals is thus attributed to trapping inside boundary layers where fluid is nearly motionless. In a flat bottom melter, the boundary layer near the cavity floor could be large due to low bulk fluid motion. Once a sludge layer forms, it takes on distinct Theological properties having a higher viscosity with pseudo-plastic behavior. The critical velocity for resuspension, calculated from a correlation for flow in a pipe, is 1000 times higher than convection currents in the LFCM. It is thus important to keep noble metals suspended and prevent sludge formation. Gravity could play a role in directing sludge to a bottom drain.

Such jets typically arise when brine is discharged from desalination plants. Two small-scale experimental studies were conducted to investigate the behaviour of a dense jet discharged into lighter ambient water. The first experiment concerned {{the importance of the}} initial angle of inclined dense jets, where the slope of the flow increased for the maximum levels as a function of this angle. An angle of 60 ° produced better results than 30 ° or 45 °. An empirical predictive equation was developed based on five geometric quantities to be considered in the design of plants.

40|$|The {{effects of}} varying bottom depth on wave propagation, which are lucidly {{described}} by Mei [1], can {{be important in}} predicting wave effects on ships at offshore terminals. For large vessels such as LNG carriers the change in depth may be substantial over the vessel’s length. However both model tests and computations are usually performed in water of constant depth, {{and it is difficult}} to represent varying depth effects which extend over large horizontal scales. Buchner [2] has performed experiments and computations using an artificial <b>sloping</b> <b>bottom</b> of restricted length and width; substantial differences and variations of the vessel motions are reported, compared to results in a fluid of constant depth, and the results are sensitive to the width of the <b>sloping</b> <b>bottom.</b> We show here that such effects can be expected, and special care is required to design appropriate surrogates for the <b>sloping</b> <b>bottom.</b> In [2] a seabed of nominal slope 1 : 20 is considered, shoaling from 35 m to 8 m over a length of 550 m as shown in Figure 1.

If the. diffuser angle, the sloping angle of the bottom inflow channel aspect ratio and inflow densimetric Froude number are given, the equations which will be presented {{can be used to}} estimate the dilution of plunging or non-plunging inflows. This information is needed in one-dimensional water quality models of stratified lakes or reservoirs. The integral jet flow analysis used herein includes a similarity hypothesis for velocity profiles, application of the entrainment principle and consideration of bottom friction effects on momentum. A general theoretical model is developed to predict jet centerline velocity, width and dilution of non-buoyant turbulent jet flows over horizontal or <b>sloping</b> <b>bottoms</b> in abruptly expanding channels.

Through both logistic regression and clas-sification tree models, we compared the characteristics of 29 known sand lance locations to 58 randomly selected sites. The best models indicated a strong selection of shallow water by sand lance, with weaker association between sand lance distribution and beach shorelines, sand bot-toms, distance to shore, <b>bottom</b> <b>slope,</b> and distance to the nearest sand bottom. We applied an information-theoretic approach to {{the interpretation of the}} logistic regression analysis and de-termined importance values of 0. 99, 0. 54, 0. 52, 0. 44, 0. 39, and 0. 25 for depth, beach shorelines, sand bottom, distance to shore, gradual <b>bottom</b> <b>slope,</b> and distance to the nearest sand bottom, respectively.
