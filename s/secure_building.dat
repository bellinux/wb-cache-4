Later known as Newburgh State Hospital and still later as the Cleveland State Hospital, it {{burned to the ground}} in 1872, after which a larger, <b>secure</b> <b>building</b> was constructed. The grounds adjacent to Mill Creek were sold to the city to add to Garfield Park in 1896.

For instance Gunnarnes Chapel is a former barracks built at Skattøra. Skattøra was the only naval air station of the Navy Air Service to resume use after the war. All other seaplane bases were jointly located with land airport. The Air Force decided in 1947 to make Skattøra one of its five main air stations—and the only one of these to be a water airport. The Air Force and the civilian aviation authorities determined that Norway would receive two area control centers for its air traffic control. One of these was located at Tromsø and located in the subterranean structure at Marielund. This also acted as a rescue coordination center. The fire station was converted to a joint control tower and weather station.|$|E

2500|$|On October 1, 1964, the NCPC {{approved}} the preliminary {{design of the}} FBI building. During the design phase, the architects discovered that the NCPC supported the FBI's desire for a highly <b>secure</b> <b>building,</b> and this influenced the structure's design significantly. The plans by Murphy and Associates called for an eight-story structure on Pennsylvania Avenue and a 12-story building along E Street. The two buildings were connected by wings along 9th and 10th Streets NW, forming an open-air courtyard in the interior. A portion of these wings would push underground into the hill which rose behind Pennsylvania Avenue. The building was set back [...] from Pennsylvania Avenue. It also had underground parking [...] accessible from 9th and 10th streets. [...] An open deck, designed to allow pedestrians to enter on E Street and stroll along {{the second floor of}} the building, existed on the east and west sides of the FBI building. The architects noted that this deck could be extended on the south (Pennsylvania Avenue) side. The NCPC voiced only one concern. It worried that the [...] "penthouses" [...] atop the building (which were designed to conceal the HVAC and elevator equipment) were illegal. The penthouses raised the building's height to — higher than permitted by law.|$|E
