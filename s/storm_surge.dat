5|$|Along the Odishan coast, the cyclone {{generated}} a 5–6m (16–20ft) <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> that brought {{water up to}} 35km (20mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> height of 6.7m (22ft). One visually estimated <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> of 9m (30ft) was reported; however, this estimate was determined to have been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. <b>Storm</b> <b>surge</b> was responsible {{for a majority of}} the fatalities linked to the 1999Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0km (0.9–1.2mi) inland. A 4km (2.5mi) stretch of road leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1m (3.3ft) in height and 0.5km (0.3mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system, though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300million (US$6.9million). The <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> destroyed nearly every house in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27villages were submerged by the surge. To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48trawlers sank.|$|E

5|$|<b>Storm</b> <b>surges</b> {{caused by}} extratropical {{cyclones}} {{have been recorded}} along the coastal areas. These <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> are formed from strong winds that blow towards the land. They are formed due to {{the interaction between the}} semi-permanent South Pacific High and a low pressure system over the Atlantic, southeast of Argentina, creating strong winds from the south or southwest. The sudestada, which brings the worst <b>storm</b> <b>surges,</b> occurs when there is a high pressure system over southern Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean that interacts with a low pressure over Uruguay and southern Brazil, causing strong winds from the southeast. <b>Storm</b> <b>surges</b> have caused flooding of coastal areas, leading to extensive property loss and other damage. It is also the main natural factor in the erosion of coastlines. The flooding as a result of <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> are particularly destructive in flat coastal areas such as the Rio de La Plata shores, and the Salado Basin.|$|R

5|$|Two {{different}} {{measures are}} used for storm tide and <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> {{is defined as the}} rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.|$|E

In Montegut, the surge breached a levee which was still damaged {{from the effects of}} Hurricane Lili 9months before. The breach flooded many homes in the town, forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood. As a result, 150homes in the town were damaged, with half of them severely. The <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways, including the only road to Grand Isle, stranding residents and visitors. The road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded. The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish. Damage from the <b>storm</b> <b>surge</b> totaled $4.1million (2003USD). Rough waves sank two boats offshore; their occupants were rescued.|$|E

As a result of this, small low-lying coastal communities will be particularly exposed to <b>storm</b> <b>surges.</b> This paper examines how well prepared to handle <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> two Danish local communities, Løgstør and Thyborøn, are and how they can enhance their community resilience toward <b>storm</b> <b>surges.</b> This was done through field observations, interviews and a conceptual model applied to assess strengths and limitations of the two communities. The focus of this study is on four dimensions of resilience, which are social capital, community capacity, information & communication and institutional capacity. Results from the study indicates that Løgstør is better prepared to handle <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> than Thyborøn because their strengths are better equipped at preparing for and coping with an impact where as Thyborøn have strengths that are more suitable for a recovery phase. Findings further indicate that Thyborøn should focus on the information & communication dimension of resilience to enhance the community resilience and to improve the flow of information regarding <b>storm</b> <b>surges</b> and the planning process in the municipality to the local community should be the main focus. Løgstør can enhance their community resilience significantly by prioritizing the security over the amenity value and therefore raise the height of the seawall that is protecting the city...|$|R
