The computational study demonstrates how problem features and hardware platforms influence algorithm behaviour. The minimum width order (smallest-last) is investigated, and MCS is broken into its consituent parts and we discover {{that one of these}} parts degrades performance.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} program {{visualization}} is to illustrate {{some aspects of}} the execution of a program. A number of program visualization tools have been developed to support teaching and learning of programming, but only few have been empirically evaluated. Moreover, the dynamics of gaze behavior during program visualization has not been investigated using eye movements and little is known about how program animation is attended by learners with various levels of experience. We report on an empirical study of the gaze behavior during a dynamic program animation. A novice and an intermediate group, a total of 16 participants, used Jeliot 3, a program visualization tool, to comprehend two <b>short</b> <b>Java</b> programs. Referring to previous literature, we hypothesized that the performance as well as the gaze behavior of these two groups would differ. We found statistically significant differences in performance measures and in fixation durations. Other commonly used eye-tracking measures, the fixation count and the number of attention switches per minute, seem to be insensitive to the level of experience. Based on the results, we propose further directions of the research into gaze behavior during program visualization. ...|$|R

We present {{preliminary}} {{results of an}} experiment in computer program comprehension that was conducted {{to find out whether}} visual strategies can characterize low- and high-comprehenders. In addition, we investigated whether the type and quality of externalized mental models can be associated with the visual strategies. Participants of various levels of experience used a program visualization tool, Jeliot, to comprehend <b>short</b> <b>Java</b> programs, while their eye-movements were recorded. Comprehension summaries were evaluated for correctness as a measure of performance and also analyzed using Good’s information-types scheme. Times spent on viewing certain structures of the program visualization were analyzed and correlated with the information types found in comprehension summaries. Depending on comprehension performance and target program, some information types were found to be correlated with eye-data patterns. Comprehension performance did not significantly correlate with information types. When the visual strategies of low-comprehenders were similar to those of highcomprehenders, the comprehension outcome of the low-comprehenders was poor. When the strategies diverged, the mental models of low-comprehenders tend to match those of high-comprehenders. Based on the results, we propose that eyetracking can help to partially predict the mental model that is built during comprehension. We discuss limitations and future directions of this research. ...|$|R

Larvae from sample points were collected from various water containments, both natural and manmade, around the settlement. The larvae samples were then brought to the laboratory to be identified and counted. Results indicated the dominant breeding sites were bathtub (50 %), gutter (24 %), and dispenser (15 %).

40|$|Context. Software defect {{prediction}} aims {{to reduce the}} large costs involved with faults in a software system. A wide range of traditional software metrics have been evaluated as potential defect indicators. These traditional metrics are derived from the source code or from the software development process. Studies have shown that no metric clearly out performs another and identifying defect-prone code using traditional metrics has reached a performance ceiling. Less traditional metrics have been studied, with these metrics being derived from the natural language of the source code. These newer, less traditional and finer grained metrics have shown promise within {{defect prediction}}. Aims. The aim of this dissertation is to study the relationship between <b>short</b> <b>Java</b> constructs and the faultiness of source code. To study this relationship this dissertation introduces {{the concept of a}} Java sequence and Java code snippet. Sequences are created by using the Java abstract syntax tree. The ordering of the nodes within the abstract syntax tree creates the sequences, while small sub sequences of this sequence are the code snippets. The dissertation tries to find a relationship between the code snippets and faulty and non-faulty code. This dissertation also looks at the evolution of the code snippets as a system matures, to discover whether code snippets significantly associated with faulty code change over time. Methods. To achieve the aims of the dissertation, two main techniques have been developed; finding defective code and extracting Java sequences and code snippets. Finding defective code has been split into two areas - finding the defect fix and defect insertion points. To find the defect fix points an implementation of the bug-linking algorithm has been developed, called S + e. Two algorithms were developed to extract the sequences and the code snippets. The code snippets are analysed using the binomial test to find which ones are significantly associated with faulty and non-faulty code. These techniques have been performed on five different Java datasets; ArgoUML, AspectJ and three releases of Eclipse. JDT. core Results. There are significant associations between some code snippets and faulty code. Frequently occurring fault-prone code snippets include those associated with identifiers, method calls and variables. There are some code snippets significantly associated with faults that are always in faulty code. There are 201 code snippets that are snippets significantly associated with faults across all five of the systems. The technique is unable to find any significant associations between code snippets and non-faulty code. The relationship between code snippets and faults seems to change as the system evolves with more snippets becoming fault-prone as Eclipse. JDT. core evolved over the three releases analysed. Conclusions. This dissertation has introduced the concept of code snippets into software engineering and defect prediction. The use of code snippets offers a promising approach to identifying potentially defective code. Unlike previous approaches, code snippets are based on a comprehensive analysis of low level code features and potentially allow the full set of code defects to be identified. Initial research into the relationship between code snippets and faults has shown that some code constructs or features are significantly related to software faults. The significant associations between code snippets and faults has provided additional empirical evidence to some already researched bad constructs within defect prediction. The code snippets have shown that some constructs significantly associated with faults are located in all five systems, and although this set is small finding any defect indicators that transfer successfully from one system to another is rare...|$|R
