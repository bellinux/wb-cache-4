5|$|Ringed seals {{were once}} the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an {{important}} food {{source for the}} people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal meat is an important source of food for residents of small coastal communities. The seal blubber is used to make <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> was processed and sold in Canadian health stores.|$|E

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>seals</b> are {{commonly}} used in high speed multistage compressors. If the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> ring becomes locked up against the fixed portion of the <b>seal,</b> high <b>oil</b> film crosscoupled stiffnesses can result. A method of analysis for determining if the <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> are locked up or not is discussed. The method is then applied to an <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> in a compressor with subsynchronous vibration problems...|$|R
40|$|A {{non-metallic}} {{brush seal}} {{has been developed}} as an <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> for use in turbomachinary. Traditionally labyrinth-type seals with larger clearances {{have been used in}} such applications. Labyrinth seals have higher leakage rates and can undergo excessive wear in case of rotor instability. Brush seals reduce leakage by up to an order of magnitude and provide compliance against rotor instabilities. Brush seals are compact and are much less prone to degradation associated with <b>oil</b> <b>sealing.</b> This paper describes the benefits and development of the nonmetallic brush <b>seals</b> for <b>oil</b> <b>sealing</b> application. ...|$|R
25|$|In Norway in 2004, only Rieber {{worked with}} {{sealskin}} and <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> In 2001, the biggest producer of raw <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> was Canada (two {{percent of the}} raw oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores). Rieber had the majority of all distribution of raw <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> in the world market, {{but there was no}} demand for <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b> From 1995 to 2005, Rieber annually received between 2 and 3 million Norwegian krone in subsidy. A 2003–2004 parliamentary report says CG Rieber Skinn is the only company in the world that delivers skin from bluebacks. Most of the skins processed by Rieber have been imported from abroad, mainly from Canada. Only a small portion is from the Norwegian hunt. Of the processed skin, five percent is sold in Norway; the rest is exported to the Russian and Asian markets.|$|E

50|$|Oil was {{discovered}} at Kelham Hills in the 1920s. In June 1939, BP (then the D'Arcy Exploration Company) discovered oil at Eakring. News of this discovery was not announced until September 1944, {{by which time}} {{the fate of the}} Second World War was <b>sealed.</b> <b>Oil</b> was also drilled during the war at Caunton and Kelham Hills.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine of}} an underbone {{typically}} drives {{the rear wheel}} by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle. This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear. The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a <b>sealed</b> <b>oil</b> bath and is shorter.|$|R
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a <b>sealed</b> <b>oil</b> bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|R

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a <b>sealed</b> <b>oil</b> bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|R
50|$|During normal {{operation}} of a car engine, some vapors from the cylinder pass by the piston rings and down into the crank case. Without ventilation this can pressurize the crank case and cause issues such as lack of piston ring <b>sealing</b> and damaged <b>oil</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R
25|$|Seal meat is an {{important}} source of food for residents of small coastal communities. Meat is sold to the Asian pet food market; in 2004, only Taiwan and South Korea purchased seal meat from Canada. The seal blubber is used to make <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> was processed and sold in Canadian health stores. There has been virtually no market for seal organs since 1998.|$|E
25|$|Generally caribou or {{reindeer}} fat {{was a poor}} choice, as was the fat {{of other}} land animals, <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> being a more efficient fuel for the lamp. Women used to scrape the carcasses, gathering every bit of fat.|$|E
25|$|Hunting for subsistence, {{primarily}} caribou, moose, and Dall sheep {{is still}} {{common in the}} state, particularly in remote Bush communities. An example of a traditional native food is Akutaq, the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, <b>seal</b> <b>oil,</b> dried fish meat and local berries.|$|E
50|$|The Tourist had a {{tubular steel}} frame to which pressed steel body panels were mounted. The {{engine of the}} Tourist was mounted in the frame and drove the rear wheel by a chain {{enclosed}} in the swingarm. Thus sheltered, the chain ran in a <b>sealed</b> <b>oil</b> bath, extending its life and preventing any oil from contacting either scooter or rider. The engines used in Heinkel Tourists were 4-stroke while most other scooters of the time, including the Heinkel 150 light scooter from the 1960s, had 2-stroke engines.|$|R
5000|$|Newfoundland did {{not have}} a strong dairy {{industry}} {{at the turn of the}} 19th century and subsequently embraced the production of margarine. Then in 1883, under the direction of Robert A. Brehm, Harvey and Company started the first margarine manufacturing plant. [...] This plant used fish and <b>seal</b> <b>oils</b> in its production. Brehm had left Harvey and Company shortly thereafter and started a second manufacturing plant under the name Hearn and Company which he eventually renamed Brehm Manufacturing Company after the death of his partners.|$|R

50|$|The motors are {{designed}} with a <b>sealed</b> <b>oil</b> sump from which oil is pumped continuously to lubricate the bearings. A fan draws air from the engine room through the motor to cool it and returns the exhaust air to the engine room through a water-cooled heat exchanger. This arrangement reduces the possibility of water being drawn into the motor {{should there be a}} leak in the cooler. The engine is also fitted with a heater to keep it warm when not running so as to prevent condensation internally. Temperature and revolution speed are monitored and displayed on the control panel.|$|R

Alexander returned to Britain on 27 June 1806 with 105 tuns of sperm oil, 105 tuns of whale oil. 70 tons of whale bone, 14,000 seal skins, and 22½ tuns of elephant <b>seal</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} pressure inside the casing is maintained {{slightly higher than}} atmospheric pressure to avoid outside air ingress. The hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing. Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. <b>Seal</b> <b>oil</b> is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|A new {{lighting}} {{legislation was}} enacted in 1736, {{setting up a}} new kind of <b>seal</b> <b>oil</b> lamp giving a better light even during winter. It was also decided that lamps on the main streets should be twenty-five yards apart (and not thirty as before). These changes were well received by the public opinion, and even in the Old Bailey Session Papers was not uncommon to read about victims and witnesses claiming to be able to identify the accused because of a better street lightning.|$|E
50|$|Car washes {{often use}} these triplex-style plunger pumps (perhaps without {{pulsation}} dampeners). In 1968, William Bruggeman significantly reduced {{the size of}} the triplex pump and increased the lifespan so that car washes could use equipment with smaller footprints. Durable high pressure seals, low pressure <b>seals</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>seals,</b> hardened crankshafts, hardened connecting rods, thick ceramic plungers and heavier duty ball and roller bearings improve reliability in triplex pumps. Triplex pumps now are in a myriad of markets across the world.|$|R
