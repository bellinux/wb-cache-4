40|$|It is {{too early}} to draw {{definitive}} conclusions about the changes that the financial crisis will bring to the shape of financial systems worldwide. Much will depend on the duration of the crisis, <b>on</b> policy responses <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> and <b>on</b> reforms in financial regulation. Given this uncertainty, relying on plausible and internally consistent long-term scenarios may well {{be a good way to}} proceed. 1 While these scenarios may not be able to tell us the magnitude of changes, the direction of changes is becoming increasingly apparent. A shift in global trends? The financial crisis is adversely affecting four broad trends that have characterized financial systems in recent decades: the significant expan-sion in global financial assets compared with underlying economic activity, growing global financial integration, shrinking role of the state in financial systems, and rising share of cross-border ownership of financial institutions. The crisis will likely reverse these trends, at least over the foreseeable future. And it will spark a debate about whether each of them is desirable and appropriate under most circumstances. Shrinking financial systems The growing importance of financial systems— whether measured by assets, profits, contribution to GDP, stock market capitalization, employment, or the like—compared with the real economy has been one of the main economic characteristics of recent decades (figure 1). Driving this growth has been such factors as higher per capita incomes and Global trends taken for granted in recent decades—the big expansion in global f inancial assets compared with underlying economic activity, growing global f inancial integration, shrinking role of the state in f inancial systems, and ris ing share of cross-border ownership of f inancial inst itutions—may reverse over the foreseeable future. In addit ion, the structure of f inancial systems, particularly in developed countries, wi l l l ikely become oriented less toward capital markets and more toward tradit ional (and simpler) banking activit ies.

60|$|Finding {{the strangers}} <b>still</b> {{declined}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> shore, the natives tried {{in every way}} to gain their confidence, and dispel the distrust which their hostile demonstrations might have caused. A boat approaching the shore cautiously one day, in quest of some safe place to procure water, an ancient Indian, of venerable demeanor, issued from among the trees, bearing a white banner {{on the end of}} a staff, and leading two girls, one about fourteen years of age, the other about eight, having jewels of guanin about their necks. These he brought to the boat and delivered to the Spaniards, making signs that they were to be detained as hostages while the strangers should be on shore. Upon this the Spaniards sallied forth with confidence and filled their water-casks, the Indians remaining at a distance, and observing the strictest care, neither by word nor movement to cause any new distrust. When the boats were about to return to the ships, the old Indian made signs that the young girls should be taken on board, nor would he admit of any denial. On entering the ships the girls showed no signs of grief nor alarm, though surrounded by what to them must have been uncouth and formidable beings. Columbus was careful that the confidence thus placed in him should not be abused. After feasting the young females, and ordering them to be clothed and adorned with various ornaments, he sent them on shore. The night, however, had fallen, and the coast was deserted. They had to return to the ship, where they remained all night under the careful protection of the admiral. The next morning he restored them to their friends. The old Indian received them with joy, and manifested a grateful sense of the kind treatment they had experienced. In the evening, however, when the boats went on shore, the young girls appeared, accompanied by a multitude of their friends, and returned all the presents they had received, nor could they be prevailed upon to retain any of them, although they must have been precious in their eyes; so greatly was the pride of these savages piqued at having their gifts refused.|$|R
5000|$|Tanselle {{absorbed the}} {{principles}} of Walter W. Greg and Fredson Bowers, who developed the theory of textual criticism, a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that {{is concerned with the}} identification and removal of transcription errors in texts, both manuscripts and printed books, {{in order to create a}} text which most closely reflects the author's intent. He has been called the [...] "most prominent, consistent, and authoritative defender of the Greg-Bowers approach to editing," [...] which is now the [...] "dominant theoretical and practical position in Anglo-American editing." [...] Tanselle has sought to accommodate legitimate critiques of its limitations, such as the insistence on the difference between substantive and accidentals, that is, the difference between the words and their spelling and punctuation. [...] Tanselle, says one scholar, like Greg and Bowers, postulates the notion of an [...] "ideal 'correct' text, measured against which extant texts show various degrees of 'corruption' that the editor seeks to remove." [...] Tanselle follows this tradition more flexibly, but <b>still</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> rest <b>on</b> the [...] "principle of the author's final intention,'" [...] which the [...] "editor (or critic) seeks first to understand and then to implement..." [...] This position is opposed to the New Criticism, which rejects the intentional fallacy, since the author's intentions are not relevant to the work of art once it is finished.|$|R

60|$|I observed, {{that the}} two who swam were yet {{more than twice as}} long {{swimming}} over the creek than the fellow was that fled from them. It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was my time to get a servant, and perhaps a companion, or assistant, and that I was called plainly by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I immediately got down the ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both {{at the foot of the}} ladder, as I observed above; and getting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea; and having a very short cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much frighted at me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back; and in the meantime I slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece; I was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest hear, though at that distance it would not have been easily heard; and being out of sigh of the smoke too, they would not have easily known what to make of it. I having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced apace towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen, and killed, (as he thought) yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither came forward, nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined <b>to</b> fly <b>still,</b> than <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on.</b> I hallooed again to him, and made signs <b>to</b> <b>come</b> forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, then stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned him again <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>still</b> nearer. At length he <b>came</b> close <b>to</b> me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was more work to do yet; for I perceived the savage, whom I knocked down, was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke some words to me; and though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above five-and-twenty years. But there was no time for such reflections now: the savage, who was knocked down, recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground; and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side: so I did: he no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one, who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden swords: however, it seems, as I learnt afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will cut off heads even with them, nay, and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had done this, he <b>comes</b> laughing <b>to</b> me in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and, with abundance of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before me.|$|R
