50|$|Modern {{boring tools}} have three primary {{components}} although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of <b>solid</b> <b>stock,</b> has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower part (bar holder) is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore diameter via the dial screw. As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight distortion if {{the cutting tool}} is moved further than the boring head is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called unbalanced gyroscope precession. Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the boring tool. Boring tools can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many boring head designs.|$|E
40|$|The 1 - 3 {{connectivity}} composite transducers comprise active piezoceramic pillars {{within a}} passive polymer matrix. The first stage in manufacturing the 1 - 3 material {{is to produce}} a bristle block (comprising a <b>solid</b> <b>stock</b> of active material with protruding pillars) by injection moulding or by dicing a piece of ceramic using precision sawing equipment. The bristle block is filled with a reactive polymer liquid that produces the passive polymer phase, and the filled block is machined to the desired dimensions. For optimum performance, the polymer phase should have complementary interaction with the ceramic phase as well as imparting dimensional stability. Epoxy-based polymers are the most usual passive materials because of their low viscosity in the uncured state and solvent resistance, coupled with their excellent adhesive, mechanical, and electrical properties. However, the curing of epoxy resins results in shrinkage of the polymer matrix and internal stress within the passive phase. This can lead to prestressing of the active ceramic material, distortion of pillars, reduction in the parallelism between the sides of pillars, acid, in certain circumstances, warpage of transducers. This is particularly evident when the <b>solid</b> <b>stock</b> in the bristle block is relatively thin. This paper reports the in situ modification of epoxy in the bristle block by UV-based low temperature polymerization of acrylate monomers within the epoxy matrix prior to polymerization of the epoxy resin. Internal stress measurements are presented to quantify the influence of this modification via a reduction of internal stress within the polymer matrix. Results from finite element analysis emphasise the conclusions of the experimental work, and examples of manufactured devices are presented. Composite transducer performance is assessed by laser measurement of surface displacement profiles, and a 50 % improvement in surface displacement magnitude was observed for the modified devices...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study that visualizes {{the effects of}} a planar shock front passing through air (or SF 6) randomly seeded with glycol droplets or smoke particles. It was observed, using a high-speed multiple-CCD (charge coupled device) camera, that an instability occurs as the shock wave bypasses the slow-moving column of gas. This produced evident perturbation at the interface. The flow morphology of the gas column consists of a pair of counter-rotating vortices that develops downstream from the initial conditions as well as some secondary instabilities (in certain cases). Some images also show a trailing tail due to larger particles lagging behind the flow. The data and images obtained in the experiments were gathered using a tilt-able shock tube made of <b>solid</b> <b>stock</b> aluminum, two green-light lasers, and other high-speed diagnostics.

40|$|International audienceA {{mesocosm}} {{study was}} conducted {{to assess the impact of}} water saturation episodes and of the input of bioavailable organic matter on the biogeochemical cycles of C and N, and on the behavior of metal(loid) s in a soil highly contaminated by the destruction of arsenical shells. An instrumented mesocosm was filled with contaminated soil taken from the “Place-à-Gaz” site. Four cycles of dry and wet periods of about one month were simulated for 276 days. After two dry/wet cycles, organic litter sampled on the site was added above the topsoil. The nitrogen cycle was the most impacted by the wet/dry cycles, as evidenced by a denitrification microbial process in the saturated level. The concentrations of the two most mobile pollutants, Zn and As, in the soil water and in the mesocosm leachate were, respectively, in the 0. 3 – 1. 6 mM and 20 – 110 μM ranges. After 8 months of experiment, about 83 g·m− 3 of Zn and 3. 5 g·m− 3 of As were leached from the soil. These important quantities represent < 1 % of the <b>solid</b> <b>stock</b> of this contaminant. Dry/wet cycles had no major effect on Zn mobility. However, soil saturation induced the immobilization of As by trapping As V but enhanced As III mobility. These phenomena were amplified by the presence of bioavailable organic matter. The study showed that the natural deposition of forest organic litter allowed a part of the soil's biological function to be restored but did not immobilize all the Zn and As, and even contributed to transport of As III to the surrounding environment. The main hazard of this type of site, contaminated by organo-arsenic chemical weapons, is the constitution of a stock of As that may leach into the surrounding environment for several hundred years...|$|E

25|$|Iron is also {{corroded}} {{much more}} easily in seawater than lead, and would need some form of protection to prevent rusting. Alloys of stainless steel are more resistant to corrosion, but, for the cheaper grades, need to be rinsed with freshwater after use to prevent corrosion in storage.
