This rare form of early childhood epilepsy is associated with subsequent cognitive impairment, significant risk of death, and high pharmacoresistance. Based on an efficacy signal of <b>stiripentol</b> added to clobazam and valproate in an observational, prospectively conducted, exploratory study including 10 % of children with Dravet syndrome, a randomized placebo-controlled trial was specifically dedicated to patients with Dravet syndrome inadequately controlled by clobazam and valproate. Results showed significantly higher responder rates (71 % versus 5 %; P< 0. 0001) and decrease in seizure frequency (- 69 % versus + 7 %; P< 0. 002) on <b>stiripentol</b> than on placebo. A second, independently performed, randomized controlled trial confirmed these results 2 years later, and both trials were plotted in a meta-analysis. Efficacy was supported by three subsequent observational studies, with, respectively, 46 (France), 23 (Japan), and 82 (USA) children with Dravet syndrome treated with <b>stiripentol</b> for up to 5 years. Based on the experiences of more than 2, 000 patients with Dravet syndrome {{who were exposed to}} <b>stiripentol,</b> drowsiness, loss of appetite, and weight loss are the most frequent adverse events and may be reduced by decreasing the dosage of co-medication. The inhibition of <b>stiripentol</b> by the cytochrome P 450 complex (CYP 2 C 19, and CYP 3 A 4) leads to clinically significant interactions. Experimental data, both in vitro and in vivo, have definitively established that <b>stiripentol</b> is a GABAergic anticonvulsant and acts on different sites than benzodiazepines. The pharmacodynamic interactions also enhance the anticonvulsant effect of the stiripentol–clobazam combination in patients with Dravet syndrome, irrespective of the GABAergic effect. <b>Stiripentol</b> is currently the only drug specifically indicated in Dravet syndrome.

40|$|International audienceDravet {{syndrome}} {{is a highly}} pharmaco-resistant form of epilepsy. Valproate and benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment but are usually insufficient therapeutic options.

In order to avoid side effects (mainly loss of appetite and loss of weight) resulting from the inhibition of cytochromes P 450 by <b>stiripentol,</b> the prescribed doses of valproate and clobazam should be reduced. <b>Stiripentol</b> has a proper antiepileptic effect and enhances GABAergic neurotransmission by acting on the alpha- 3 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. <b>Stiripentol</b> was approved as an orphan drug in Europe in 2007 for adjunctive therapy in Dravet syndrome.

The only precedents of randomized placebo-controlled trials in Dravet syndrome are the two small trials {{that led to the}} approval of <b>stiripentol.</b> With the arrival of new clinical trials for Dravet syndrome, we sought to determine the characteristics of the patient population with Dravet syndrome in Europe today, which has possibly evolved subsequent to the approval of <b>stiripentol</b> and the ability to diagnose milder clinical cases via genetic testing. From May to June 2014, we conducted an online parent-reported survey to collect information about the demographics, disease-specific clinical characteristics, as well as current and past use of antiepileptic medications by European patients with Dravet syndrome. We present data from 274 patients with Dravet syndrome from 15 European countries. Most patients were between 4 and 8 years of age, and 90 % had known mutations in SCN 1 A. Their epilepsy was characterized by multiple seizure types, although only 45 % had more than 4 tonic–clonic seizures per month on average. The most common drug combination was valproate, clobazam, and <b>stiripentol,</b> with 42 % of the total population currently taking <b>stiripentol.</b> Over a third of patients with Dravet syndrome had taken sodium channel blockers in the past, and most had motor and behavioral comorbidities.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that controlled trials {{are necessary to}} approve a new antiepileptic drug in children and in adults. 1 How-ever, the use of placebo raises problems in the pediatric popula-tion, and recruitment for these studies is difficult.

One of these designs is called “enrichment ” and was first adapted for add-on ther-apy using tiagabine in adult patients. 2 It consists of withdrawal ran-domization versus placebo in responders previously recognized in an open phase and allows comparison with placebo without delay-ing the administration of the active drug as a rescue treatment. This design was also applied to children to study the efficacy of viga-batrin. 3 <b>Stiripentol</b> is a new antiepileptic compound that inhibits sev-eral cytochrome P 450 -enzymes.

40|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} pathologies of human brain, affecting approximately 1 % of world population. Despite the development of new methods of seizure control, chronic administration of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) remains the treatment of choice. Nevertheless, pharmacotherapy is not always effective.

Moreover, chronic medication with currently available AEDs may result in severe side-effects and undesired drug interactions. That is why in recent years intensive research has been carried out aiming at the development of new therapeutic strategies in epilepsy. The goal of this review is to assemble current literature data on <b>stiripentol</b> (STP), a novel anticonvulsant unrelated to any other AEDs.

40|$|Here, we {{assembled}} a broad molecular “tool-kit” to interrogate {{the role of}} metabolic heterogeneity in the propagation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). First, we subjected MCF 7 cells to “metabolic fractionation” by flow cytometry, using fluorescent mitochondrial probes to detect PCG 1 α activity, as well ROS and hydrogen-peroxide (H 2 O 2) production; NADH levels were also monitored by auto-fluorescence. Then, the various cell populations were functionally assessed for “stem cell activity”, using the mammosphere assay (3 D-spheroids). Our results indicate that a sub-population of MCF 7 cells, with increased PGC 1 α activity, high mitochondrial ROS/H 2 O 2 production and high NADH levels, all form mammospheres with a higher efficiency. Thus, it appears that mitochondrial oxidative stress and the anti-oxidant response both contribute to the promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in CSCs. Further validation was provided by using specific inhibitors to target metabolic processes (the NAD+ salvage pathway, glycolysis, mitochondrial protein synthesis and OXPHOS), significantly reducing CSC propagation. As a consequence, we have now identified a variety of clinically-approved drugs (<b>stiripentol),</b> natural products (caffeic acid phenyl ester (CAPE), ascorbic acid, silibinin) and experimental pharmaceuticals (actinonin, FK 866, 2 -DG), {{that can be used}} to effectively inhibit CSC activity.

40|$|AbstractThe GABAA {{receptor}} (GABAAR) {{is a major}} {{target of}} antiseizure drugs (ASDs). A variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and <b>stiripentol,</b> GABAAR modulation {{is one of several}} possible antiseizure mechanisms.

Other agents modulate GABAergic “tone” by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional target for “GABAergic” ASDs. GABAAR subunit changes occur both acutely during status epilepticus and in chronic epilepsy, which alter both intrinsic GABAAR function and the response to GABAAR-acting ASDs.

40|$|Here, we {{developed}} a new synthetic lethal strategy for further optimizing the eradication of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Briefly, we show that chronic treatment with the FDA-approved antibiotic Doxycycline effectively reduces cellular respiration, by targeting mitochondrial protein translation. The expression of four mitochondrial DNA encoded proteins (MT-ND 3, MT-CO 2, MT-ATP 6 and MT-ATP 8) is suppressed, by up to 35 -fold. This high selection pressure metabolically synchronizes the surviving cancer cell sub-population towards a predominantly glycolytic phenotype, resulting in metabolic inflexibility. We directly validated this Doxycycline-induced glycolytic phenotype, by using metabolic flux analysis and label-free unbiased proteomics. Next, we identified two natural products (Vitamin C and Berberine) and six clinically-approved drugs, for metabolically targeting the Doxycycline-resistant CSC population (Atovaquone, Irinotecan, Sorafenib, Niclosamide, Chloroquine, and <b>Stiripentol).</b> This new combination strategy allows for the more efficacious eradication of CSCs with Doxycycline, and provides a simple pragmatic solution to the possible development of Doxycycline-resistance in cancer cells. In summary, we propose the combined use of i) Doxycycline (Hit- 1 : targeting mitochondria) and ii) Vitamin C (Hit- 2 : targeting glycolysis), which represents a new synthetic-lethal metabolic strategy for eradicating CSCs.
