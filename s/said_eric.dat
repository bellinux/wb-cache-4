The project provides {{students with}} resources {{for the long term}} study of Arroyo Valle; these resources include information about the chemistry in the creek, images of the creek, a guide to flora and fauna, and student projects on aquatic species. [...] "The goal is to let kids realize {{there are a number of}} different physical and biological components that allow these organisms (in the creek) to coexist," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Eric</b> Thiel, an Amador Valley Biology teacher and a co-founder of the project. [...] "I hope they walk away able to see how complex ecosystems are." [...] In 1999, the project received a Golden Bell Award for excellence in education from the California School Boards Association. Research projects about the creek and other topics have won first place awards at the Tri-Valley Science and Engineering Fair. In 2001, Thiel and the school received a National Semiconductor [...] "Internet Innovator Award" [...] for the Project Creek Watch website.|$|E

But it was a rival of Romney for the Republican nomination, Herman Cain, who voiced the criticism Democrats and demonstrators here fear most. Occupy, and those backing it, according to Cain, are [...] "anti-American"." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Eddie heard Alex's {{performance}} of The Surfaris' drum solo {{in the song}} Wipe Out, he decided to switch instruments and began learning {{how to play the}} electric guitar. According to Eddie Van Halen, as a teen, he would often practice while walking around at home with his guitar strapped on or sitting in his room for hours with the door locked. Van Halen acknowledged the importance of super group Cream's [...] "I'm So Glad" [...] on Goodbye Cream to be mind-blowing. He once claimed that he had learned almost all of Eric Clapton's solos in the band Cream [...] "...note for note." [...] "I've always <b>said</b> <b>Eric</b> Clapton was my main influence," [...] Van Halen said, [...] "but Jimmy Page was actually more the way I am, in a reckless-abandon kind of way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That was Osmond, not I," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Eric.</b> [...] "He knows their mincing tongue {{better than}} I. He {{were the best}} {{to go with the}} poor child, if go he must." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May {{they fly}} after the foe, not before him," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Eric.</b> [...] "Speed thee well, my son--let not our Danish cousins say we learn Frank graces instead of Northern blows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To the stairs, Osmond," [...] <b>said</b> Sir <b>Eric.</b> [...] "On that narrow {{step one}} man may keep them at bay a long time. You can speak their jargon too, and hold parley with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't harm her," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Eric</b> confidently. [...] "When {{a belief}} in her ugliness hasn't spoiled a girl {{a belief in}} her beauty won't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou art here?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Eric,</b> {{turning his}} white face towards her. [...] "Do I still dream, or how comest thou here to Mosfell, Gudruda?" ...|$|E

Other examples were: [...] "There's no answer to that!", which was <b>said</b> by <b>Eric</b> after anything which could be construed as innuendo. He would also say [...] "Pardon?"
