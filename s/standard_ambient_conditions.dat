This report illustrates the development and testing of a hybrid liquid-air cooling system prototype implemented on Cisco’s 7609 s router.

The analysis was made through experiments carried out in a vehicle on the road, under different temperature, pressure and air humidity conditions. The vehicle had a four-cylinder gasoline-fuelled engine, with multi-point fuel injection system, variable intake pipe length and variable intake valve camshaft position. The vehicle was tested at sea level and at 827 m above sea level, corresponding to atmospheric pressures between 1027 and 926 mbar.

40|$|Among {{the major}} {{deterioration}} problems a gas turbine encountered while in operation is compressor blade fouling. This is the accumulation and adhesion {{of dirt and}} sediment on the compressor blade which contributes between 70 to 85 % of gas turbine performance loss. Fouling reduces turbine air mass flow capacity, compressor pressure ratio and overall gas turbine efficiency. In most cases, its effect does not manifest immediately in gas turbine power output and efficiency since they are not measured directly. However, it is apparent on the gradual increase in Turbine Entry temperature (TET) and Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT). More fuel is burnt in the combustion chamber to maintain turbine power output which leads to high combustion flame temperature and thus reduces creep life of hot components. This research seeks to analyse the technical and economic consequences of compressor fouling in overall gas turbine performance. The work begins with simulation of TS 3000 engine and examination of its design and off design performance. Subsequently, medium size gas turbine engine was modelled, simulated and its performance at different condition was examined to validate the outcome of field data analysis.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and quantitative explanation for the relatively low melting temperatures of ionic liquids (ILs). The basic concept {{was to assess the}} Gibbs free energy of fusion (ΔfusG) for the process IL(s) → IL(l), which relates to the melting point of the IL. This was done using a suitable Born−Fajans−Haber cycle that was closed by the lattice (i. e., IL(s) → IL(g)) Gibbs energy and the solvation (i. e., IL(g) → IL(l)) Gibbs energies of the constituent ions in the molten salt. As part of this project we synthesized and determined accurate melting points (by DSC) and dielectric constants (by dielectric spectroscopy) for 14 ionic liquids based on four common anions and nine common cations. Lattice free energies (ΔlattG) were estimated using a combination of Volume Based Thermodynamics (VBT) and quantum chemical calculations. Free energies of solvation (ΔsolvG) of each ion in the bulk molten salt were calculated using the COSMO solvation model and the experimental dielectric constants. Under <b>standard</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> (298. 15 K and 105 Pa) ΔfusG° was found to be negative for all the ILs studied, as expected for liquid samples. Thus, these ILs are liquid under <b>standard</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> because the liquid state is thermodynamically favorable, due to the large size and conformational flexibility of the ions involved, which leads to small lattice enthalpies and large entropy changes that favor melting. This model can be used to predict the melting temperatures and dielectric constants of ILs with good accuracy. A comparison of the predicted vs experimental melting points for nine of the ILs (excluding those where no melting transition was observed and two outliers that were not well described by the model) gave a standard error of the estimate (sest) of 8 °C. A similar comparison for dielectric constant predictions gave sest as 2. 5 units. Thus, from very little experimental and computational data it is possible to predict fundamental properties such as melting points and dielectric constants of ionic liquids. ...|$|E

40|$|The Oil-Free Turbomachinery Program at the NASA Glenn Research {{center is}} {{committed}} to, revolutionary improvements in performance, efficiency {{and reliability of}} turbomachinery propulsion systems. One of the key breakthroughs by which this goal is being achieved is the maturation of air lubricated foil bearing technology. Through experimental testing, foil bearings have demonstrated a variety of exceptional qualities that show them to {{have an important role}} in the future of rotordynamic lubrication. Most of the work done with foil bearings thus far has considered ambient air at atmospheric pressure as the working fluid or lubricating fluid in the bearing. However, special applications of oil-free technology require the use of air at non- <b>standard</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> or completely different working fluids altogether. The NASA Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter program presents power generation needs far beyond that of any previous space exploration effort. The proposed spacecraft will require significant power generation to provide the propulsion necessary to reach the moons of Jupiter and navigate between them. Once there, extensive scientific research will be conducted that will also present significant power requirements. Such extreme needs require exploring a new method for power generation in space. A proposed solution involves a Brayton cycle nuclear fission reactor. The nature of this application requires reliable performance of all reactor components for many years of operation under demanding conditions. This includes the bearings which will be operating with an alternative working fluid that is a combination of Helium and Xenon gases commonly known as HeXe. This fluid has transport and thermal properties that vary significantly from that of air and the effect of these property differences on bearing performance must be considered. One of the most promising applications of oil-free technology is in aircraft turbine engines. Eliminating the oil supply systems from aircraft engines will lead to significant weight and maintenance reduction. In such applications, the lubricating fluid will be high altitude air. This air will be at much lower pressure than that at sea level. Again this property change will result in a change in bearing performance, and analysis is required to quantify this effect. The study of these alternate working fluid properties will be conducted in two ways: analytically and experimentally. Analytical research will include the use of a mathematical code that can predict film thickness profiles for various ambient conditions. Estimations of load capacity can be made based upon the film thickness trends. These values will then be compared to those obtained from classical rigid bearing analysis. Experimental Research will include testing a foil bearing at a variety of ambient air pressures.

The different system hardware and the operational strategies, including a 16 -bit microprocessor and electronics for actuators and sensors, focusing on robust operation {{and protection of}} the DMFC system. Various system components are characterized to find the optimal design for better portability, reliability, and energy efficiency. Suggestions for effective and robust design of control strategies were evaluated and implemented. The demonstration of the hybrid operation of the DMFC stack and Li-ion laptop battery was able to show a constant stack output voltage was maintained regardless of the load current to maximize the performance. Details of the design of subsystems for power supply, measurement, actuation and protection are discussed. The system was able to run {{for a long period}} of time comparable to a generic laptop battery under <b>standard</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> To further optimize the system, system modeling is considered. First, a simplified model for mass transport on the anode side for a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is synthesized. The semi-analytical mass-transport model of DMFC species utilizes experimental data to fit parameters that allows approximation of methanol crossover current density and methanol concentration in the catalyst layer. The model is derived from fundamental principles to describe the methanol crossover phenomenon with convection and electro-osmotic drag (EOD) components. Experiments carried out in a laboratory facility to measure methanol crossover at various operating conditions including cell temperature, cell current and feed methanol concentration. Least-squares analysis of selected experimental data is performed to fit the parameters of the methanol crossover model. The performance of the empirical model is evaluated by comparison to the experimental data over the cell current density range of 0 - 150 mA/cm^ 2, the cell temperature range of 45 - 60 C and the concentration range of 0. 6 - 1. 2 M.  The model captured the experimental data for linear dependence of the methanol crossover current density on the cell current density within a maximum observed error of 12 %. In addition, the effects of fuel flow rate in the anode channel, operating cell temperature and feed methanol concentration on methanol transport are evaluated for various high-performance conditions including at constant cell temperature of 50 C, at constant methanol concentration of 0. 8  M and at constant current density of 120  mA/cm^ 2. The effect of DMFC degradation on methanol transport was found to be insignificant after characterization based on additional experiments carried out.   A classic process modeling approach to dynamic DMFC modeling is evaluated to incorporate into the system model. The experimental work of model development considers a laboratory setup of a DMFC stack of multiple cells for classical process model analysis used in control synthesis. Least-squares analysis on MATLAB® of selected experimental data is performed to fit the parameters of the process models. The model responses compared to the experimental responses show that the outputs such as voltage and stack temperatures of the DMFC can be approximated for step changes in the input variables of air flow rate and current density. The voltage response has faster dynamics with time constant parameter under 10 s than temperatures from the stack with time constant  greater than a minute for increase in current density by at least one magnitude, but the dynamics of the voltage with time constant above 400 s becomes comparably slower to the dynamics of the temperatures that has time constant near 100 s for decrease in current density to 0 mA/cm^ 2.  The parameters obtained can be used to develop a robust classical controller to maintain optimal voltage operation. The temperature dynamics of time constant between 50 and 120 s are slightly slower for step increase in air flow rate. The combination of model parameters as a result step functions of current density and air flow rate can be utilized to develop optimal temperature controllers to respond quicker to thermal changes to maintain consistent DMFC performance...|$|E
40|$|Optimal engine {{performance}} during an engines operation lifetime {{is important to}} gain minimal costs related to fuel and maintenance cost. Downtime related to propulsion engine will also benefit from this. In this report operating <b>conditions</b> including <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions,</b> added loads and fault conditions for a ships propulsion engine has been identified and discussed. The main focus is on <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> and fault conditions. The fault condition analysis is limited to four different conditions. Different performance models with different complexity are discussed regarding complexity, required inputs and accuracy. Dynamic process analyses are the most complex methods to use but will provide the most accurate results. Exhaust emission theory with focus on NO x emissions has been elaborated. It is obvious that NO x production formed under high temperature and pressure, commonly known as thermal NO x, is the domination contributor to the total NO x emission from a diesel engine. Performance analysis can involve all from single components to the entire engine. An engine model should be kept as "small" as possible but {{still be able to}} provide the desired results, this because a detailed model incorporating all engine components will require much time and processor power to calculate. Simulations for <b>ambient</b> and fault <b>conditions</b> has been performed by utilising the computer program GT-POWER. This program is based on dynamic process analysis. A Bergen Diesel KRG- 6 engine has been modelled in GT-power by the manufacturer and further calibrated during this thesis. The accuracy is within 2 %. After calibration and initial simulation for <b>standard</b> <b>condition,</b> different <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> has been introduced and simulated. <b>Ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> effect on the {{engine performance}} can be estimated by utilising calculation routines based on ISO 3046. A comparison has been made between simulations in GT-POWER and ISO corrected performance. The result deviates but shows the same trends in performance. Four fault conditions has been introduced to the GT-POWER model and simulated with different degree of fault condition. The results show the impact of the fault condition including altered NO x emission. The fault conditions simulated will result in considerable increase of fuel consumption. This shows that proper monitoring and maintenance is beneficial. Engines operating with significant faults {{may not be able to}} produce the stated power because of parameters such as temperature and pressures are exceeding allowed limits. A specific case regarding MS Siskin Arrow, managed by KGJS has been analysed. The propulsion engine is currently running with reduced turbocharger efficiency. The impact of this fault condition has been analysed by utilizing a Fuel-Air process model. The results from this simulation correlate with figures stated by MAN B&W regarding increase of fuel consumption for such a fault condition, which indicates an increase of 1 g/kWh per 0, 1 bar decrease in charge air. When the ship operated with a 0, 2 bar reduction in charge air pressure the extra cost related to fuel will be approximately 27600 US dollar per year when assumption of 200 days of continuous sailing is made. </p...|$|R

Four main theories are included in the Theoretical Framework to provide a deep understanding for the reader about the complexity of problems that comes with working in an open-plan office. The Bitner theory and the research compiled by Sundstrom discuss <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> and their impacts on employees' behaviour/satisfaction. Evans and Johnson’s theory discusses how stress is related to low-intensity noise. The final main theory, Person-Environment Fit, upholds the importance of a servicescape that fits employees’ needs and desires. The <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> influence employee behaviours in numerous ways (Davis, 1984, pp. 271) and at Sogeti’s open-plan office several <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> are studied through an observation conducted during April 17 th 2007 and a questionnaire with 15 closed questions. The outcomes of the observation and the questionnaire are analysed and concrete proposals are created for the Sogeti management to act upon in order to improve the characteristics of their open-plan office’s <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> and thereby improve employee satisfaction. One of the concrete proposals to how Sogeti may improve the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> in their open-plan office is to introduce a survey that should be handed out to the employees three or four times a year. The purpose of the survey is to define employees’ perceptions of the different <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on the outcomes from the survey, employees’ needs and desires of the servicescape, the ambient conditions’ characteristics, can be improved. Also, some examples of actions geared towards reducing the level of noise in the Sogeti open-plan office are to use ear phones when listening to music and to leave the open-plan office when conducting phone calls. The concrete proposals developed based on the Sogeti employees’ perceptions of the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> in the open-plan office are outcomes of this thesis that may serve as a tool for the Sogeti management to improve the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> of their servicescape and thereby increase employee satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growing}} {{interest}} in life cycle costs for heavy-duty gas turbines, equipment operators are investigating the trade off between performance improvements and associated maintenance costs. One of the key factors leading to performance degradation during plant operation is compressor fouling especially in harsh environments. These results from the adherence of dust or sand particles mixed with small oil droplets to compressor blade surfaces. The result is a reduction in compressor pressure ratio and an overall loss in mass flow, compressor efficiency and, therefore, overall power output. To restore this power loss, an increased fuel flow rate with the consequent higher firing temperature (TET) is necessary. This will seriously reduce the creep life of the HP turbine blades. The research described here {{is divided into three}} sections: The first section focuses on the simulation and diagnostic analyses of a typical clean and fouled industrial gas turbine. The analysis tool is a performance code (Turbomatch) developed at Cranfield University. The performance degradation was based on the following engine which is currently operating in the Libyan Desert, using field data available from the company. A single shaft industrial gas turbine (11 MW) engine The study comprised a simulation of the "clean" engine performance of a typical small gas turbine used for power generation. The study also examined the economic impact of compressor fouling on operating costs due to increased fuel flow rate and the reduced creep life of the HP turbine. Additionally, the study included an economical analysis of various types of compressor online washing techniques. The real engine data of a Sulzer Type 7 gas turbine (11 MW) have been collected from a Libyan oil field over a period of four months without compressor washing. Corrected to <b>standard</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> the results are then compared with the clean engine performance. A case study shows {{that as a result of}} compressor fouling, the compressor efficiency decreases about 2. 5 %, and Heat Rate increases by 7 % and power output falls by 10 %. Consequently, the cost of power losses in a one year period is around $ 600, 000. The second section involves high fidelity CFD (two dimensional and three dimensional) simulations of the fouling mechanism of the ninth stage of an axial compressor. This HP 9 stage was tested in No. 3 Compressor Test Facility at Rolls-Royce. The comparison between the experimental data and the ANSYS CFX is shown in chapter 4. This research contains a description of the numerical analyses carried out on the HP 9 test case to include the effects of variable amounts of roughness both in terms of spatial distribution and equivalent grain size. The examination of the effects of adding roughness to selected regions of the rotor blade suction side has shown the relative importance of the leading edge end on the blade suction side over other regions of the blade. The relative impact was quantified in terms of the wake velocity defect, magnitude and wake width. However when the radial distribution is considered the differences between clan and roughened blades is less apparent excepting for the case where the entire suction side of the blade is roughened. The pressure distribution around the blades was also examined. This part of the work has shown the benefits of flow analysis using CFD in a very small region of the flow field. In this case close the analysis is confined to the leading edge and trailing edge of a compressor blade. It also demonstrates clearly the disadvantages of fouling in reducing pressure rise through increases of total pressure loss and therefore reduced efficiency. It has been established that the leading edge and the concave surfaces of the rotor blade are the most sensitive regions to the fouling. It is emphasised that experimental verification of this trend would be very difficult to achieve with a cascade rig because both rotor and stator would need static pressure tapings very close to one another at the leading edge of the blade. This would be extremely difficult to achieve in practice. In the third section experimental work has been undertaken on a cascade facility in the Gas Turbine Laboratory. This details measurements of the cascade the pressure losses as a result of increasing levels of fouling on the blades. In addition, further experiments are undertaken to recover performance loss due to fouling through a washing technique. This has facilitated a rigorous estimation of the magnitude of compressor stage inefficiency caused by fouling. By observing the actual distribution of fouling in a typical compressor, it is now possible to estimate more accurately the overall impact of the fouled performance on overall compressor efficiency. Furthermore an experimental study has been carried out based on a need in practice for online compressor washing; an investigation was undertaken by using a different spray nozzle pressure. The detergent used for the washing experiments was a water based cleaner diluted with demineralised water in a ratio of 1 : 4. The fouled compressor efficiency after cleaning with the current project washing scheme has been improved by 2. 2 %. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
