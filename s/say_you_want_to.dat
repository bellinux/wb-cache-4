6000|$|... "Yes, {{you ask me}} for protection--which {{makes you}} very interesting; and then you won't take it. You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be squashed--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, God bless my soul," [...] shrieked out the Doctor, hardly {{knowing whether}} to burst with rage or laughter, [...] "you don't mean to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said, 'You're arresting me, huh? <b>Say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{look where}} you're goin'; I cut some ice in this town. I made half the big {{politicians}} in New York!' That {{was what he}} said." ...|$|E
60|$|JACKSON. Excuse me, my lady. There's a {{young woman}} from the village, <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, as for that, I {{should have}} thought the new horse {{might have been able}} to carry you as far as that. I heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see Mr. Crawley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good little girl! So it would. I {{should like}} nothing better; but I {{am afraid that}} if you took her without a maid, Emma would {{misunderstand}} it, and <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> save the expense.' ...|$|R
6000|$|LORD LOAM (genially). Take them, my boy. (With a rapidity we had {{not thought}} him capable of, ERNEST becomes the wearer of the boots.) And now I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know why I give them to you, Ernest? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{an immense}} number of words," [...] said Cecilia after a pause, [...] "to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fall in love! I 've {{no doubt you}} have as good a genius for that as any one, if you would only trust it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better go into Bideford an' pay up our debts," [...] said Stalky. [...] "I've {{got three}} quid {{out of my}} father--ad hoc. Don't owe more than thirty bob, either. Cut along, Beetle, and ask the Head for leave. <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> correct the 'Swillingford Patriot.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, to {{all those}} questions. Now tell me what you've been at, little sinner? Aunty Plen <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> consult me about some new and {{remarkable}} project which you have dared to start in my absence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. I don't ride behind {{anything}} but Vermont; never did. Touch of Morgan, of course; but you can't have much Morgan in a horse if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> speed. Hambletonian mostly. Where'd <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm sure he's got the parcel. I'll {{tell you}} what you might do. <b>You</b> might <b>say</b> that Mr. Berkeley wired that he had left {{something}} here. He had Bertie's room, you know. <b>You</b> might <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> look for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{you should}} be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go a long distance. Otherwise they would be very inconvenient--when you only want to cross the room, for example. Perhaps {{this has not been}} {{explained}} to you by your governess? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know why}} you were cabled for. I'll tell you. There's no use talking for half a day {{before you get to}} the point. I guess you've heard that there's a prince here instead of a {{republic}} now? Well, that's where you come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{conclusion}} was, perhaps, {{not entirely}} logical, but Jack overlooked it, {{and handed the}} sum to his visitor. [...] "The old-woman business is about played out, Brown," [...] he added, by way of commentary; [...] "why don't you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> buck agin' faro? You know you ain't married!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] he said. [...] "Your boy told me {{you would}} be likely enough coming. So <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see the Captain; he has just {{finished}} his breakfast and gone into the study. Now, what shall I <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see him for? I can't show you in, you know, without asking him first." ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE. Stuff! Come: <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{and let me}} go.|$|R
6000|$|Jo <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to Canada {{within a}} month or six weeks--I forget just exactly what he did say; but he intimated the trip could be delayed a while, if necessary. If this is so, suppose you meet Osgood and me in New Orleans early in May--say somewhere between the 1st and 6th? ...|$|R
6000|$|The humour of this {{appeared}} {{to touch his}} father, who lay a little while taking it in. [...] "I'll do anything you like," [...] Mr. Touchett said at last; [...] "but I'm not sure it's right. You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> put wind in her sails; but aren't you afraid of putting too much?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there it}} is, sir. I {{am afraid that}} when I let my {{thoughts}} meddle with such matters I am no longer a servant. But I am so devoted to the countess; if she were my own child I couldn't love her more. That is how I come to be so bold, sir. They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said coldly. [...] "You <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{work for}} the Revolution. Take off your coat. Hang it over there. I will show you, come--where are the buckets and cloths. The floor is dirty. You will begin by {{scrubbing}} it, and by scrubbing the floors of the other rooms. The spittoons need to be cleaned. Then there are the windows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Law, did I? Well, it popped out: it's a mercy I said no more, for I'm a bad un to {{live with}} folks when they don't like the truth. But as for being ugly, look at me, child, in this silver-coloured silk--I told you how it 'ud be--I look as yallow as a daffadil. Anybody 'ud <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a mawkin of me." ...|$|R
60|$|Its {{effect upon}} young Barnacle {{was to make}} him repeat in a defenceless way, 'Look here! Upon my SOUL you mustn't come into the place <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know, <b>you</b> know!' The effect of that upon Arthur Clennam was to make him repeat his inquiry {{in exactly the same}} words and tone as before. The effect of that upon young Barnacle was to make him a {{wonderful}} spectacle of failure and helplessness.|$|R
6000|$|MAGISTRATE. [Hissing, with {{protruded}} neck.] Now--you {{will have}} your chance of <b>saying</b> what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> presently. Have <b>you</b> anything {{to ask the}} officer? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{remember}} your name, Mr. Hartington, {{with reference to}} the Abchester Bank failure. It seemed a particularly hard case, and I know our Mr. Wanklyn, who had charge of the winding up, took particular interest in it, and personally consulted me more than once about it, though I cannot exactly recall the circumstances now. What is it that you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> examine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{first man}} he {{met on the}} street stopped him with a jovial word: [...] "Hello, Hans! <b>Say,</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch out for Abe Kitsong. He came b'ilin' {{in half an hour}} ago, and is looking for you. Says you helped that Dutchman and his girl (or wife, or {{whatever}} she is) to get away, and that you've been arresting Henry, his nephew, without a warrant, and he swears he'll swat you good and plenty, on sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Let us two {{meet him}} accidentally {{at the street}} corner to-morrow,” said Eleanor; “we can walk a little way with him, and with luck {{we ought to be}} able to side-track him into the shop. You can <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get a hair-net or something. When we’re safely there I can say: ‘I wish you’d tell me what you want for your birthday.’ Then you’ll have {{everything}} ready to hand—the rich cousin, the fur department, and the topic of birthday presents.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "People {{like that}} do not stand on {{ceremony}} at all. I don't see why they shouldn't come. I could <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make their acquaintance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you hear}} what I <b>say?</b> If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> breathe freer, break the pipe of the wires, and you'll get fresh air from outside right through it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no; nor Sam. It was Nurse herself! But {{they all}} <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take away her character; and they won't have strangers put over them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never bore them--and {{they are}} so easily bored! It bores them if you <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be married. I {{think it would be}} sweet to be married, but you should never ask for a wedding. They give you {{everything}} else, but if you say you want a wedding, they stamp their feet and go away. Why are you crying, girl? You should not cry; they don't like it. Put on your prettiest gown and laugh and pretend you are happy, and then they will tell you naughty stories and give you these." [...] She felt her ears and looked at her fingers, on which there may once have been jewels, but there were none now.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am sure, my dear Nick,' {{said the}} brave and {{beautiful}} girl--my name was then Nick Chopper, {{you should be}} told--'that you will make the best husband any girl could have. I shall not be obliged to cook for you, for now you do not eat; I shall not have to make your bed, for tin does not tire or require sleep; {{when we go to}} a dance, you will not get weary before the music stops and <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go home. All day long, while you are chopping wood in the forest, I shall be able to amuse myself in my own way--a privilege few wives enjoy. There is no temper in your new head, so you will not get angry with me. Finally, I shall take pride in being the wife of the only live Tin Woodman in all the world!' Which shows that Nimmie Amee was as wise as she was brave and beautiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do, then. Go down {{at once to}} the riverside. There are {{hundreds}} of boats lying idle there, for there are no passengers and no trade, and half of their owners are dead. You are sure to see some men there; having nothing else to do, some will be hanging about. <b>Say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hire a boat {{for a couple of}} months or to buy one. You will probably get one for a few shillings. Get one with a sail as well as oars. Go out the first thing after breakfast, and go up or down the river as the tide or wind may suit. Take some bread and meat with you, and don't return till supper-time. Then you can spend your evenings with Shakespeare. Maybe I myself will come down and take a sail with you sometimes. That will bring the colour back into your cheeks, and make a new man of you. Would that I had thought of it before!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But aren't you fond of them? They're such awfully nice kids. Do <b>you</b> mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have {{anything}} {{more to do}} with them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't ye <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> one <b>to</b> match? Ho, ho! I reckon I cotched {{you that}} trip, didn't I?" [...] And the man {{continued}} to laugh, and Dave and Phil joined in.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{said to them}} there's {{another one}} that the Nitty Ditty Nitty Gritty Great Bird and it <b>says</b> if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see a rainbow you've got to stand a little rain." ...|$|R
