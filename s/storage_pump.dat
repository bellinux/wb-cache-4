40|$|Water {{heating energy}} use is an {{important}} end use in low-rise residential buildings. Roughly 90 percent of California households use natural gas fueled water heaters, typically storage gas units with tank volumes of 40 to 50 gallons. Standby loss associated with the center flue gas storage water heater design contributes 25 - 35 percent of a typical gas storage water heater system's annual energy use. Whereas natural gas, (liquefied petroleum gas), LPG or oil can be burned directly to heat water, electricity is typically generated in a fossil fueled power plant where approximately two-thirds of the energy used to produce the electricity is lost in the generation, transmission, and distribution processes. The Standards require space conditioning and water heating systems to account for hourly usage impacts of the overall efficiency of each fuel type {{in the form of}} Time Dependent Valuation (TDV). Due to inefficiencies associated with generation and transmission, electric TDV essentially precludes the use of standard electric water heaters. Only electric heat pump water heaters, with significantly higher efficiencies than electric storage units, are closer to the efficiency of typical gas systems, even after accounting for TDV impacts. The figure below shows the energy flows that determine water heating energy usage. On the right hand side, hot water draws at the end use points define a load pattern that is imposed on the hot water distribution system that delivers water from the heating device to the use points. The heating device must meet this recovery load minus any contribution from auxiliary heat inputs, such as a solar thermal system. Energy use for water heating encompasses all energy uses; therefore, considerations of issues such as standby losses from the water heater or supplemental <b>storage</b> <b>pump</b> energy for recirculation systems, or impacts from supplemental heating must be considered in selecting a water heater that will comply...|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} mature energy storage technologies, {{including}} chemical battery energy <b>storage,</b> <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> and {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) [4, 5].

In [12], the life cycle cost of a microgrid with different energy storage schemes (including battery <b>storage,</b> seawater <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> and hybrid energy storage systems) is analyzed under the condition of a given island microgrid with the necessary energy storage requirements.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the debate on}} the {{necessity}} of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems in the Greek power supply system has started. In the current decade, the Greek power system will gradually try higher RES penetration, mainly due to wind energy and photovoltaics integration. Variability of wind and PV generation and the current structure of the Greek power system introduce technical constraints, which should be taken into consideration in the forthcoming large scale RES integration. This paper examines the ability of the Greek power system to absorb renewable power and the necessity of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems. The feasibility of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems is discussed in three different scenarios of wind-photovoltaics integration. Results show that for the gradual increase of variable output RES, <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems are required, but the feasibility of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> systems is not proved in the intermediate scenarios of RES integration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
