25|$|Perhaps {{the first}} major change was the advent of music {{sequencer}} technology. Prior to its introduction all synchronisation was achieved by adding <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> to analogue tape. This acted as a reference point so that individual tracks could be easily synchronised. With the advent of MIDI hardware, devices {{could be used to}} synchronise any MIDI device and eventually MIDI Time Code or MTC became an alternative method of synchronising studio activity. Continuing development in this area has led to computer-controlled sequencing.|$|E
50|$|Video {{frames are}} {{typically}} identified using <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E

5000|$|SMPTE timecodes ( [...] or [...] ) contain {{binary coded decimal}} hour:minute:second:frame {{identification}} and 32 bits for use by users. There are also drop-frame and color framing flags and three extra 'binary group flag' bits used for defining {{the use of the}} user bits. The formats of other varieties of <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> are derived from that of the longitudinal timecode.|$|R
50|$|MusicPrinter Plus {{contained}} some advanced {{mechanisms for}} its day, including playback of articulations and synchronization to <b>SMPTE</b> and other <b>time</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the time}} is running continuously, the 32-bit <b>time</b> <b>code</b> is broken into 8 4-bit pieces, and one piece is {{transmitted}} each quarter frame. I.e. 96—120 times per second, depending on the frame rate. Since it takes eight quarter frames for a complete <b>time</b> <b>code</b> message, the complete <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> is updated every two frames. A quarter-frame messages consists of a status byte of 0xF1, followed by a single 7-bit data value: 3 bits to identify the piece, and 4 bits of partial <b>time</b> <b>code.</b> When <b>time</b> is running forward, the piece numbers increment from 0-7; with the time that piece 0 is transmitted is the coded instant, and the remaining pieces are transmitted later.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally {{the use of}} <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> on source {{recordings}} simplifies finding match {{points in}} post production between picture and audio in both the film and television worlds.|$|E
50|$|Keykode, {{while not}} a timecode, {{is used to}} {{identify}} specific film frames in film post-production that uses physical film stock. Keykode data is normally {{used in conjunction with}} <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the six digital audio channels, three data/control channels were provided. One <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> channel and another channel for MIDI control signals offered flexibility for performing theater automation or external synchronization of equipment. The third data channel, an identification track, could used to record a variety of user-defined parameters specific to the film (such as curtain opening/closing, seat movement or lighting effects.) In {{view of the fact}} that the CDS system was available for only two years before its complete withdrawal from the market, no use of the <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> or MIDI channels was ever implemented.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – IRIG <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> {{are used}} for time {{synchronization}} for industrial equipments as all types of IRIG <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> are accepted as international standard. IRIG-B {{is one of the}} available IRIG <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> which is widely accepted as time synchronization protocol. This paper highlights the brief description of various <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> of IRIG standard and mentions the methods used for generation of IRIG-B <b>time</b> <b>code</b> format...|$|R
40|$|A {{high quality}} <b>time</b> <b>code</b> and word clock {{synchronization}} {{is essential to}} prevent audio drop outs and flutters in sound studios. A bad adjustment of <b>time</b> <b>code</b> generators respectively word clock synchronizers requires extensive error checks in synchronization networks. For this reason, a new measurement method is presented which enables sound engineers to measure longitudinal <b>time</b> <b>code</b> jitter and to check <b>time</b> <b>code</b> / word clock synchronization. Annoying audible artifacts in sound studios {{can be traced back}} on measured <b>time</b> <b>code</b> jitter and on loss of synchronization of the used <b>time</b> <b>code</b> / word clock synchronizer. With this method a <b>time</b> <b>code</b> jitter measurement accuracy of +/- 20 microsecond can be achieved. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
50|$|A {{sequencer}} {{can drive}} a MIDI system with its internal clock, {{but when a}} system contains multiple sequencers, they must synchronize to a common clock. MIDI Time Code (MTC), developed by Digidesign, implements SysEx messages {{that have been developed}} specifically for timing purposes, and is able to translate to and from the <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> standard. MIDI Clock is based on tempo, but <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> is based on frames per second, and is independent of tempo. MTC, like SMPTE code, includes position information, and can adjust itself if a timing pulse is lost. MIDI interfaces such as Mark of the Unicorn's MIDI Timepiece can convert SMPTE code to MTC.|$|E
50|$|Like most {{audiovisual}} timecodes such as <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code,</b> it encodes {{only time}} of day, repeating each 24 hours. Time {{is given in}} units of hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. There may be 24, 25, or 30 frames per second.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, CMX, a {{collaborative}} between CBS and Memorex, introduced the first computer-based edit controller using <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> for editing. The CMX 200 could control both the source (A-roll) and record (B-Roll) quad VTRs. CMX {{continued to make}} more powerful edit controllers capable of controlling more VTRs and peripheral devices, such as switchers, DVEs and character generators.|$|E
40|$|WO 2004105034 A UPAB: 20050124 NOVELTY - To {{synchronize}} {{sound and}} film, a detection unit (10) registers the <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> for each separate {{image in the}} film sequence. A <b>time</b> <b>code</b> generator (12) gives a sequence of synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> from a starting value, provided by a decoder (14) which processes the detected <b>time</b> <b>codes.</b> The detected and synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> are compared (16) to establish any phase deviations which require a manipulation (20) of the synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes.</b> The synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> are fed to an audio processing unit (24), to allocate the sampled audio signal values to each image from detected synthesis <b>time</b> <b>codes,</b> under <b>time</b> control. USE - The technique is for the synchronization of sound with separate images in cinema and video films, using wave field synthesis. ADVANTAGE - The synchronized sound {{can be used with}} loudspeaker arrays comprising numbers of loudspeakers to give a variety of structured and synchronized sounds with the film...|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, <b>time</b> <b>code</b> {{ambiguity}} is {{the shortest}} interval between successive repetitions of the same <b>time</b> <b>code</b> value.|$|R
5000|$|Visible <b>time</b> <b>code,</b> a.k.a. {{burnt-in}} timecode and BITC (pronounced [...] "bit-see") - {{the numbers}} are burnt into the video image so that humans can easily read the <b>time</b> <b>code.</b> Videotapes that are duplicated with these <b>time</b> <b>code</b> numbers [...] "burnt-in" [...] to the video are known as window dubs.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} of the instrument included an 80-gigabyte hard drive, an unobtrusive console, located under {{the left side of}} the keyboard, an expanded array of audio ports, support for USB storage devices, and support for USB MIDI communications. Another enhancement of the Disklavier system was the support for <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> generation and reception, enabling the recording and playback of video-synchronized performance without additional hardware.|$|E
50|$|With an ADAT Lightpipe and an ADAT {{controller}} linking {{up to four}} ADAT's using CAT5 cables with RJ-connectors and <b>SMPTE</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Code,</b> {{you could}} synchronize four 8-track ADAT’s together {{for a total of}} 32 simultaneous synchronized channel tracks of 16 or 20 bit audio data. 24 bit came later with the HD24 Hard Disk recorder in early 2001, which also made use of Lightpipe capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} take videos in Full HD {{resolution}} with up to 60 complete frames per second with a bit rate of up to 72 Megabits per second with powerful lenses {{and the capacity to}} use external microphones make the GH3 interesting also for high-end movie production. The videos can be also taken in time lapse photography or in slow motion and can be flagged by <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because {{a single}} <b>time</b> <b>code</b> {{is made up}} of 40 {{consecutive}} bits, read errors can cause a timecode to be unreadable even if a single bit is misread. A bit that has become unreadable due to a scratch can make an entire 40 bit long <b>time</b> <b>code</b> permanently unreadable. Dust can have a similar effect on the <b>time</b> <b>code.</b> The <b>time</b> <b>code</b> implements very little error checking, an attribute strong {{in a number of other}} vinyl control systems.|$|R
50|$|However, {{sometimes}} editors will (confusingly) use {{the letter}} B to designate <b>time</b> <b>code</b> breaks {{on a video}} tape. If there is broken <b>time</b> <b>code</b> on a video tape, {{there will be two}} (or more) instances of a particular <b>time</b> <b>code</b> on the video tape. When re-capturing, it can be ambiguous as to which timecode is the right one. The letter B may indicate that the right <b>time</b> <b>code</b> is from the second set of timecode on the video tape.|$|R
50|$|When {{the phase}} {{modulation}} <b>time</b> <b>code</b> was added in late 2012, this station identification was eliminated; the <b>time</b> <b>code</b> itself serves as station identification.|$|R
50|$|Many master clocks {{include the}} {{capability}} to synchronize devices like computers to the master clock signal. Common features include the transmission of the time via RS-232, a Network Time Protocol, or a Pulse Per Second (PPS) contact. Others provide <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> outputs, which are often used in television settings to synchronize the video from multiple sources. Master Clocks often come equipped with programmable relay outputs to synchronize other devices such as lights, doors, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Logic Control (and now MCU) allows {{control of}} almost all Logic {{parameters}} with hardware faders, buttons and [...] "V-Pots" [...] (rotary knobs). Its touch-sensitive, motorized faders react to track automation. All transport functions and wheel scrubbing are also available. The unit also controls plug-in parameters. Visual feedback including current parameters being edited, parameter values, project location (<b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> or bars/beats/divisions/ticks) are conveyed by a two-line LCD and red 7-segment LED displays.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 EECO {{created and}} {{introduced}} the EECO-900 edit controller, which used their proprietary On-Time time code (the later and more standard <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code</b> {{had not yet}} been developed), which was used in conjunction with the quad machines of the time, and was the successor to Ampex's Editec. The EECO-900 and On-Time timecode were developed from EECO's previous work and products developed for NASA for logging and timecoding of their telemetry tapes during space missions.|$|E
50|$|The phase-modulated <b>time</b> <b>code</b> {{has been}} {{completely}} updated and {{is not related to}} the amplitude-modulated <b>time</b> <b>code.</b> The only connection is that it is also transmitted in 60-second frames, and the amplitude-modulated markers (when only 20% of the second is transmitted at full strength) are not used for essential <b>time</b> <b>code</b> information.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — {{the paper}} deals with {{development}} of <b>time</b> <b>code</b> generator and translator using microcontroller based user interface. TCG/T {{is used in}} order to provide time stamping and event synchronization in satellite stations. TCG (<b>Time</b> <b>Code</b> Generator) is a precision timing system that generates a GPS (Global positioning system) Synchronized serial <b>time</b> <b>code</b> with DS 1307 -RTC (Real time Clock) where the process takes place and gives a serial time output using the IRIG-A (Inter Range Instrumentation Group) <b>time</b> <b>code.</b> TCT (<b>Time</b> <b>Code</b> Translator) is capable of accepting the control signals from TCG and translate the serial time to parallel time using a CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device). TCG/T can be programmed to even translate and provide parallel <b>time</b> <b>code</b> to front end hardware for time stamping the satellite raw data ingested by real time data acquisition systems up to microsecond level...|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} longwave <b>time</b> <b>code</b> stations, the JJY signal is amplitude-modulated to send one bit per second, {{transmitting}} a complete <b>time</b> <b>code</b> every minute.|$|R

50|$|The {{show is a}} {{recorded}} show that repeats every fifteen minutes, similar to many amusement park rides. Instead of live actors, the show uses high-definition projections of the characters {{to tell the story}} using several magician's illusions such as Pepper's ghost along with other high-tech projection and lighting methods. The show is controlled by an Alcorn McBride show control system that is synced to <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code.</b> The show control systems coordinates the motion control systems, animatronics, lighting, and special effects.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{a couple}} of industry-specific {{metadata}} areas are present: Motion-Picture and Television ones. They are either used only if the picture has enough embedded information relevant to that specific industry, otherwise are left [...] "empty". For example, Motion-Picture-specific metadata include perforation-exact film KeyKode (if the image comes from a film scan), camera shutter angle, slate information and frame positioning within a frame sequence. On the other side, Television metadata include full <b>SMPTE</b> <b>time</b> <b>code,</b> video overscan and field information, and signal/colour level information.|$|E
50|$|WWVB transmits data at one bit per second, taking 60 {{seconds to}} send the current time of day and date within a century. There are two {{independent}} <b>time</b> <b>codes</b> used for this purpose: an amplitude-modulated <b>time</b> <b>code,</b> {{which has been in}} use with minor changes since 1962, and a phase-modulated <b>time</b> <b>code</b> added in late 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Between 31 and 39 seconds {{past the}} minute inclusive, the once-per-second tones {{are reduced to}} 10-millisecond [...] "ticks" [...] while a digital <b>time</b> <b>code</b> is transmitted.
