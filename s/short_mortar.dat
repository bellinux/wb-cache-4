50|$|The {{base plate}} is very heavy and is fitted with four {{carrying}} handles. The sight bracket fits the standard mortar sight. The barrel is heavily reinforced at the muzzle {{and has two}} raised ribs midway of the barrel, between which the barrel clamping collar is held. The firing mechanism {{is similar to that}} used on the Type 99, 81 mm <b>short</b> <b>mortar.</b> After the weapon has been loaded, a plunger, which projects upward from the mortar breech, is struck with a mallet or similar instrument, thus camming out the firing pin and firing the mortar. A safety lock is fitted on this firing plunger.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of the 19 April 1948 the village was {{attacked}} by the Palmach. The attacking force was commanded by Yosef Tabenkin, based in Jerusalem. They were later to become the Harel Brigade of the Israeli army. The village was surrounded by five companies with ambushes being set on the roads to Ramallah, Nabi Samuel and Biddu. A group consisting of armoured cars, a Davidka, reserves and the operation's HQ approached from Jerusalem. The company approaching from Castel encountered a group of around 30 armed men leaving Beit Surik heading east but did not engage them. A <b>short</b> <b>mortar</b> barrage was launched on the village from the east. When one of the ambush groups was fired on they attacked and took the school building. The village was taken soon afterwards with the attackers only encountering sparse rifle fire. Three platoons went through the village clearing enemy positions while a detachment of sappers began demolishing buildings. Some of the brigade then went on to capture Biddu before daybreak.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor {{more than}} sixty years, {{cylindrical}} steel cannons (long mortar and <b>short</b> <b>mortar)</b> {{have been used in}} France to assess the safety of explosives with regard to firedamp. These testing methods are considered expensive mainly because a large number of shots are needed äs a result of the low level of reproducibility. Also, using them with certain explosives, such äs slurries and emulsions, is somewhat problematical. Taking into aecount the Polish expertise, CERCHAR (now INERIS) developed m the sixties a testing method in which the Charge, placed in a steel groove mortar, is isolated from the methane-air mixture by an asbestos-cement plate. This method seems more attractive than those traditionally used, {{especially when it comes to}} distinguishing rock explosives from the more powerfui pennitted explosives...|$|E
50|$|Minenwerfer ("mine launcher") is the German {{name for}} a class of <b>short</b> range <b>mortars</b> used {{extensively}} during the First World War by the German Army. The weapons were intended {{to be used by}} engineers to clear obstacles including bunkers and barbed wire, that longer range artillery {{would not be able to}} accurately target.|$|R

50|$|A mortar is {{a device}} that fires {{projectiles}} at low velocities and <b>short</b> ranges. The <b>mortar</b> has traditionally {{been used as a}} weapon to propel explosive mortar bombs in high-arcing ballistic trajectories. The weapon is typically muzzle-loading with a short, often smooth-bore barrel, generally less than 15 times its caliber. Modern mortars are light and easily portable. They can be used for close fire support with a variety of ammunition.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the school’s {{research}} program was greatly {{aided by the}} Office of Scientific Research and Development, the organization that was created to provide the military with research support. In 1943, the school won the contract to manage rocket and ordnance research at the Cumberland Arsenal in Maryland. In this work, university faculty developed the recoilless anti-tank rifle (popularly known as the Bazooka), a variety of <b>short</b> range <b>mortars,</b> {{and a number of}} elements of small rockets. By the end of the war, the Engineering school was the 8th largest university contractor with the Office of Scientific Research and Development, following only MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Columbia, the University or California Berkeley, Johns Hopkins and the University of Chicago.|$|R
25|$|In 1968 the NZ {{government}} contemplated introducing US weapons systems. In {{line with}} this Mk 32 a/s torpedo tubes were fitted and {{a limited number}} of Mark 46 torpedoes were provided to supplement the older shallower diving Mk 44 torpedoes, to replace the <b>short</b> range Limbo <b>mortar</b> and to arm the Wasp helicopter. However plans for a US Edo sonar and chaff decoys and to arm the Wasp with the Anglo-French AS-12, anti small ship missiles were not introduced due to cost and for political reasons.|$|R
2500|$|The 157th Brigade went on {{to attack}} the {{southern}} end of Sausage Ridge, and succeeded in gaining ground as darkness fell. By 18:00 the leading troops of the Argyll and Southern Highlanders and 5th Highland Light Infantry reached the foot of the hill and charged straight up to gain the crest. Under very heavy Ottoman machine gun fire, strengthened by minenwerfer <b>short</b> range <b>mortars,</b> small groups of British soldiers [...] "came to close quarters" [...] with the Ottoman troops, fighting each other with bombs and bayonets. An Ottoman battalion counterattacked a few minutes later driving the British off the ridge. After rallying, they were driven off four times when many British were killed with the bayonet. After losing all their officers and NCOs the survivors reformed and returned to the attack. However, the Ottoman defenders were also armed with hand grenades and trench mortars.|$|R
5|$|As {{it moved}} into {{position}} around Bardia in December 1940, the 6th Division was still experiencing shortages. It {{had only two}} of its three artillery regiments, and only the 2/1st Field Regiment was equipped with the new 25-pounders, which it had received only that month. The 2/2nd Field Regiment was still equipped with twelve 18-pounders and twelve 4.5-inchhowitzers. Only A Squadron of the 2/6th Cavalry Regiment was on hand, {{as the rest of}} the regiment was deployed in the defence of the frontier posts at Al-Jaghbub and Siwa Oasis. The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion had been diverted to Britain. Its place was taken by a British Army machine-gun battalion, the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers. The 2/1st Antitank Regiment had likewise been diverted, so each infantry brigade had formed an antitank company but 2-pounders were in short supply, and only eleven guns were available instead of the 27 required. The infantry battalions were particularly <b>short</b> of <b>mortars,</b> and ammunition for the Boys anti-tank rifle was in short supply.|$|R
50|$|Concrete blocks may be {{produced}} with hollow centers (cores) to reduce weight or improve insulation. The use of blockwork allows structures {{to be built}} in the traditional masonry style with layers (or courses) of staggered blocks. Blocks come in many sizes. In the US, the most common nominal size is 16 x 8 x 8 in; the block measures a 3/8 in <b>shorter,</b> allowing for <b>mortar</b> joints. In Ireland and the UK, blocks are usually 440 x 215 x 100 mm excluding mortar joints. In New Zealand and Canada, blocks are usually 390 x 190 x 190 mm excluding mortar joints.|$|R
5000|$|Everything {{was finally}} ready by mid-afternoon of 16 April when Porter {{embarked}} in Arletta {{and took her}} — accompanied by two of her sister schooners — upriver to anchor at predetermined sites to test the mortars and their mounts and to determine the ranges of their targets. Confederate cannon fired intermittently upon the small Northern sailing ships, but the Southern rounds all fell <b>short.</b> Meanwhile, Arlettas <b>mortar</b> answered with five shells, three of which exploded inside Fort Jackson. After an hours action, Porter — highly satisfied {{with the performance of}} his mortars, gunners, and ships — ordered his captains to retire downstream.|$|R
5000|$|Provision {{was made}} in mid-1916 for {{attachment}} of the [...] "Temple Silencer" [...] at the muzzle, intended to reduce the flash and noise generated on firing, which at the <b>short</b> ranges the <b>mortar</b> operated at was quickly noticed by the enemy and invited artillery response. This required the use of bombs with a special piston attached to the tail which was retained in the barrel by the silencer on firing, and hence sealed the muzzle after the bomb tail left the barrel. This had the major disadvantage of causing the barrel to overheat during prolonged daylight firing, and the silencer was only used at night.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} {{started on}} 20 May 2013, and 8,000 {{members of the}} Iraqi security forces were involved. During the first 24 hours, 43 militants, including 11 wanted al-Qaeda operatives, were captured in the no-mans land with Syria. <b>Short</b> range rockets, <b>mortar</b> rounds, rocket launch pads, explosive charges and communication devices were found. By 24 May 2013, 32 militants were killed during the operation and 51 were captured, including seven women. At {{the time of the}} start of the campaign, Iraqi border troops were increasingly coming under sniper fire from Syrian militants across the border. According to the Iraqi military, a large number of Turkish-made military equipment was seized during the operation. Two senior commanders of the Islamic State of Iraq were among those reported killed.|$|R
50|$|Gaeta {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} {{military}} fortresses in Europe. It consisted of a triangle-shaped promontory (Mount Orlando) which stretched for more than one and a half kilometers and rose to 169 m and with almost vertical cliffs on the seaward sides. The cliff was connected to the mainland by a 600 m wide isthmus. Called Montesecco ("Dry Mountain"), the isthmus was the only way for a besieger to conquer the stronghold. The ships of the time were indeed considered too fragile to face the massive fortifications that encircled the promontory. Built in the time of emperor Charles V, the promontory was provided with 220 guns divided between 19 batteries. An additional 230 guns defended the fortress on the mainland side, making a total of 450 cannons, 26 of which were <b>short</b> range <b>mortars.</b> Most of the guns were smoothbore arms, some dating back to the 18th century, and therefore rather imprecise. The massive castle, which commanded the east side on the sea, dated from the time of Emperor Frederick II but was continuously updated. The forces amounted to 19,700 sub-officers and soldiers and 1,770 officers; there were also 3,000 citizens of Gaeta. 17 ships of various nations (including Spain and France) kept open communications with the sea.|$|R
50|$|Roche-la-Croix {{fired on}} an Italian patrol that crossed into French {{territory}} on 17 June 1940. As Italian {{troops of the}} Forli Division advanced into France on 20 June, they were bombarded by Roche-la-Croix's 75mm gun turret, supported by fire from Saint Ours Haut, stopping the advance. The turret fired four salvos the following day. On the 22nd, Roche-la-Croix's turret was used for counter-battery fire against Italian artillery, followed by fire on Italian forces advancing along the Col des Monges, supported by fire from Block 6 of the main ouvrage and Roche-la-Croix Supérieure. Additional fire was directed to support the defense of Ouvrage Plate Lombard. On the 24th the turret and casemate fired at the Col Rémi and the Tête-Dure, {{as well as the}} Col de Larche. The armistice of 25 June brought action to an end. During this period Roche-la-Crox fired 1909 shots from the turret, 401 from the casemate and 128 <b>shorts</b> from the <b>mortar</b> battery.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: To {{investigate}} the fundamental characteristics of blast-furnace slag mortar that was hardened with activating chemicals {{to capture and}} sequester carbon dioxide. METHODS: Various mix proportions were considered to find an appropriate stregnth development in regards with various dosages of activating chemicals, calcium hydroxides and sodium silicates, and curing conditions, air-dried, wet and underwater conditions. Flow characteristics was investigated and setting time of the mortar was measured. At different ages of 3, 7 and 28 days, strength development was investigated for all the mix variables. At each age, samples were analyzed with XRD. RESULTS: The measured flow values showed the mortar lost its flowability as the activating chemicals amount increased in the scale of mole concentration. The setting time of the <b>mortar</b> was relatively <b>shorter</b> than OPC <b>mortar</b> but the initial curing condition was important, such as temperature. The amount of activating chemicals was found not to be critical {{in the sense of}} setting time. The strength increased with the increased amount of chemicals. The XRD analysis results showed that portlandite peaks reduced and clacite increased as the age increased. This may mean the Ca(OH) 2 keeps absorbing CO 2 in the air during curing period. CONCLUSIONS: The carbon capturing and sequestering activated blast-furnace slag mortar showed successful strength gain to be used fo...|$|R
500|$|At 01:00 on 22 May FSB Coral {{was again}} attacked, though {{not on the}} same scale as before, coming under a <b>short</b> but {{accurate}} <b>mortar</b> bombardment that was subsequently broken up artillery and mortar fire. In order to bolster his defences and provide an increased offensive capability, on 21 May Dunstan ordered the Centurion tanks from C Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment to redeploy the [...] from Nui Dat. Under the command of Major Peter Badman, the slow-moving armoured column departed on 22 May, traversing the difficult terrain that included a number of old, rusting Bailey bridges, which threatened to collapse under the 50-tonne weight of the Centurions. Moving via the inland route under cover provided by an observation aircraft from 161st Reconnaissance Flight, they drove north on Route 2, then west on Highway 1 to Long Binh where they staged overnight. Just north of Blackhorse the lead vehicle of the convoy hit a road mine, damaging a dozer tank but resulting in no casualties. They finally arrived at FSB Coral at 02:30 on 23 May. Four tanks from 1 Troop were subsequently allocated to 1 RAR, while 2 Troop was allocated to 3 RAR. Two American M42 40mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns had also accompanied the tanks and further strengthened the Australian FSBs in a ground support role.|$|R
50|$|The first {{tanks were}} used to break through trench defences in support of {{infantry}} actions particularly machine gun positions during the First World War and they were fitted with machine guns or high explosive firing guns of modest calibre. These were naval or field artillery pieces stripped from their carriages and mounted in sponsons or casemates on armored vehicles. The early British Mark I tanks of 1916 used naval 57 mm QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss mounted at the sides in sponsons. These guns proved too long {{for use in the}} British tank designs as they would come into contact with obstacles and the ground on uneven terrain, and the succeeding Mark IV tank of 1917 was equipped with the shortened 6 pounder 6 cwt version which can be considered the first specialised tank gun. The first German tank, the A7V, utilized 57 mm Maxim-Nordenfelt fortification guns captured from Belgium and Russia, but mounted at the front. The early French Schneider CA1 mounted a <b>short</b> 75 mm <b>mortar</b> on one side, while the Saint-Chamond mounted a standard 75 mm field gun in the nose. The thin armour of the tanks meant that such weapons were effective against other vehicles, though the Germans fielded few tanks anyway and the Allied tanks concentrated on anti-infantry and infantry support activities.|$|R
500|$|... 1 ATF was redeployed on 12 May {{to obstruct}} the {{withdrawal}} of forces from the capital, with two battalions establishing a fire support base named FSB Coral, just east of Lai Khe in Binh Duong Province, {{in an area of}} operations known as AO Surfers. However, poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning led to delays and confusion during the fly-in, and the Australians had only partially completed FSB Coral by the evening. The North Vietnamese mounted a number of battalion-sized assaults on the night of 12/13 May, with a heavy bombardment from 03:30 signalling the start. Exploiting the disorganised defence to penetrate the Australian perimeter, the North Vietnamese 141st Regiment temporarily captured a forward gun position during close-quarters fighting, before being repulsed by superior firepower the following morning. Casualties were heavy on both sides but the Australians had won a convincing victory. The following day 1 RAR was deployed to defend FSB Coral, while 3 RAR established FSB Coogee to the west to ambush staging areas and infiltration routes. Coral was again assaulted {{in the early hours of}} 16 May, coming under a heavy barrage followed by another regimental-sized attack. Again the base was penetrated but after a six-hour battle the North Vietnamese were forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses. Expecting further fighting, the Australians were subsequently reinforced with Centurion tanks and additional artillery. On 22 May, FSB Coral was again attacked overnight, coming under a <b>short</b> but accurate <b>mortar</b> bombardment which was broken up by Australian artillery and mortars.|$|R
40|$|In early February of 1968, at the {{beginning}} of the Tet Offensive, Private First Class Gregory V. Short arrived in Vietnam as an eighteen-year-old U. S. Marine. Amid all of the confusion and destruction, he began his tour of duty as an 81 mm mortarman with the 2 nd Battalion, 1 st Marine Regiment, which was stationed at Con Thien near the DMZ. While living in horrendous conditions reminiscent of the trenches in World War I, his unit was cut off and constantly being bombarded by the North Vietnamese heavy artillery, rockets, and <b>mortars.</b> Soon thereafter <b>Short</b> left his <b>mortar</b> crew and became an 81 mm’s Forward Observer for Hotel Company. Working with the U. S. Army’s 1 st Air Cavalry Division and other units, he helped relieve the siege at Khe Sanh by reopening Route 9. Short participated in several different operations close to the Laotian border, where contact with the enemy was often heavy and always chaotic. On May 19, Ho Chi Minh’s birthday, the NVA attempted to overrun the combat base in the early morning hours. Tragically, during a two-month period, one of the companies (Foxtrot Company) within his battalion would sustain more than 70 percent casualties. By September Short was transferred to the 1 st Battalion 9 th Marines (the Walking Dead). Assigned as an infantryman (grunt) with Bravo Company and operating along the DMZ and near the A Shau Valley, he would spend the next five months patrolling the mountainous terrain and enduring the harsh elements. At the end of his first tour, he re-upped for a second and was assigned to the 1 st Marine Air Wing in Da Nang, where he had an opportunity to become familiar with the Vietnamese culture. Direct, honest, and brutal in his observations, Short holds nothing back in describing the hardships of modern warfare and our leaders’ illusions of success...|$|R
