50|$|The Family Law Act {{talks about}} these issues in terms of <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> {{parenting}} time and contact.

50|$|Children's {{matters are}} {{determined}} {{on the basis}} of who the child will 'live with' and 'spend time with' (terms which were formerly labeled 'residence' and 'contact' respectively). Although the term custody often refers to where children live, the concept was abolished in 1995 with the Family Law Reform Act. The concept of custody gave much wider decision making powers to the parent with whom children lived, than either the concept of 'residence' or 'live with'. Since 1995 both parents legally have the same (but not <b>shared)</b> <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> for children, regardless of where and with whom the children live, until and unless a court makes a different order (s61C).|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a dispute about {{parenting}} matters and the case is placed before a court, then the Court must apply a presumption {{that it is in}} the best interests of children that their parents have equal <b>shared</b> <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the children (section 61DA). In practical terms this means that parents must consult one another about major decisions affecting the care of children (but not day-to-day decisions), whereas without that order parents can make decisions together or without consulting each other. The presumption does not apply in circumstances of family violence or there has been any abuse (including sexual abuse) of a child, a parent or any family member living with the child.|$|E

40|$|Author version made {{available}} {{in accordance with}} the publisher's policy.

A qualitative approach was taken to investigate breastfeeding women’s experiences of the implementation of the act and its impact on their ability to maintain breastfeeding. Fifteen women responded to questions related to their breastfeeding and their engagement with the family law system. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, and data were then analyzed thematically. These women experienced inconsistent advice from all facets of legal services, including opinions about the inappropriateness of breastfeeding for infants over 6 months of age. Breastfeeding was considered only as nutrition, without recognition of its immunological and cognitive benefits and the security and comfort it provides. Many participant women felt that they had been persuaded against discussing breastfeeding in the legal system, resulting in a sense of disempowerment...|$|E

50|$|A {{long-lived}} {{example was}} the Oneida Community founded by John Humphrey Noyes in 1848. Noyes taught {{that he and}} his followers, having reached 200 in number, had thus undergone sanctification; that is, it was impossible for them to sin, and that for the sanctified, marriage (along with private property) was abolished as an expression of jealousy and exclusiveness. The Oneida commune lived together as a single large group and <b>shared</b> <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Any given male-female combination in the group was free to have sex, usually upon the man's asking the woman, and this was the common practice for many years. The group began to falter about 1879-1881. Noyes heard a New York warrant was out for his arrest, perhaps for adultery, though apparently not for anyone else in the group, and he fled to Canada, not many miles away. He lived there the rest of his life. After some period without his leadership, and acting at Noyes' suggestion, the group disbanded. Several dozen pairs of them quickly married in traditional fashion after disbanding. They and others nearby then created the Oneida Silver company that for many decades was a famous US company name in flatware and related items.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers incentives {{arising from}} equilibrium influences {{that affect the}} sequence of decisions that lead to family formation. The first chapter examines how state regulations directly aimed at abortion providers affect the market for abortion in the United States. Estimates from a dynamic model of competition among abortion providers show that regulations' main impact is on the fixed costs of entry for providers. Simulations indicate that the removal of regulations would promote entry and competition among abortion providers, and because abortions {{are found to be}} price sensitive, this would lead to increases in the number of abortions observed. The second chapter tests if an important negative externality of abortion access exists, namely whether abortion access makes prospective fathers more likely to leave pregnant women. Designing a number of empirical tests, I confirm that in some areas where abortion is more accessible women who give birth {{are more likely to be}} single mothers, rather than <b>sharing</b> <b>parental</b> <b>responsibility</b> with the biological father. The final chapter, which is joint work with Peter Arcidiacono and Marjorie McElroy, examines how gender ratios influence bargaining power in romantic relationships between men and women. Gender ratios, by influencing the prospects of matching, allow us to estimate preferences for various match characteristics and activities. We find men prefer sexual relationships more than women at high school ages, and that men and women trade off their preferred partner for an increased chance of matching. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Extract:In many cultures, {{grandparents}} {{have traditionally}} {{played an important}} role in the family. With family breakdown continuing to increase, and the ageing of Australia’s population, more grandparents are wanting to know what right they have to regular contact with their grandchildren and what they can do to help care for their grandchildren. In many families, grandparents play an important role as caretaker of the children, particularly in families where both parents work. Sometimes grandparents live in the same home as the parents and children and <b>share</b> many <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities</b> with the working parents. In these situations, breakdown of the marriage impacts dramatically upon the whole family — the separating couple, the children, the grandparents and other members of the extended family with whom the children have had regular contact. Sometimes the family break is a compound fracture. The family divides and loyally supports the spouse from its side of the family and is alienated from the other side. On occasions, this means retributional punishment for the parent who does not foster contact with her or his spouse’s extended family...|$|R

Artikelförfattarna har träffat fyra grupper av män med skilda erfarenheter och bakgrunder för att utforska hur de konstruerar sitt faderskap i spänningsfältet mellan visioner och levd erfarenhet. This article {{explores the}} way {{different}} groups of Swedish men experience and relate to issues concerning fatherhood, paternity leave and gender equality – how they together construct fatherhood {{in the field of}} tension between normative societal visions and their own lived reality. The study included four groups of men: men working in a centre for men in crisis, men involved in a network organization for masculinity issues, men in an association promoting security and social justice in a multiethnic suburb (a majority of the men had immigrant background) and men involved in a Christian church. Conceptions of fatherhood and gender equality were explored through focus group interviews. As starting point for the interviews the groups were confronted with materials from the last 30 years of state initiated paternity leave campaigns. The result confirms conclusions made in previous research, namely that Swedish men in general have a positive attitude to active parenthood. With few exceptions the groups expressed a child orientation and a positive approach to gender equality and <b>shared</b> <b>parental</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Despite common ground on the importance of fathers taking active part in child care, the four groups displayed differences in the way they conceptualized the question. They related to different experiences and often used different ways of expressing thought, emotions and observations. The result points toward the influence of factors such as age, social and professional position, ethnic background and religion. The group of men working at the crisis centre primarily used individual rather than societal perspectives. Their main concern was the impact of the campaigns on men’s psychological well-being. The group of men from the Christian church placed the question of fatherhood in the context of preserving and promoting the family. In the group dominated by men with immigrant background, the fatherhood question was mainly framed through references to the economic hard-ship and social exclusion distinguishing many multi-ethnical Swedish suburbs...|$|R
