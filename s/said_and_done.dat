5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> there.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

25|$|With the NHL {{preparing}} for looming labor unrest, the Flyers let their leading scorer, Mark Recchi, leave for Pittsburgh during the off-season.

In September and October combined, the Rays split 30 games, going 15–15.

500|$|The Posthumous Works, {{of which}} The Wrongs of Woman {{was the largest}} part, had a [...] "reasonably wide audience" [...] when it was {{published}} in 1798, but it [...] "was received by critics with almost universal disfavor". This was in large part because the simultaneous release of Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman revealed Wollstonecraft's illegitimate child and her love affairs. Most reviewers and readers transferred the unconventional and unorthodox life Wollstonecraft herself had lived onto Maria and much that Maria had <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> onto Wollstonecraft, thereby realizing Wollstonecraft's fears that her books would be read only as a mirror of her life. The eighteenth-century moralist Hannah More, for example, called The Wrongs of Woman a [...] "vindication of adultery".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Project 86 {{teamed with}} Slayer {{producer}} Matt Hyde {{to record their}} next album. The record was envisioned as a critique of post-9/11 America and the music industry. Formatted as a concept album, it {{told the story of}} a character attempting to find fulfillment in modern culture. [...] "Songs were written and assembled with a certain ebb and flow in mind," [...] said Schwab, [...] "I approached the album like writing chapters in a book." [...] The group spent over 14 months recording demos for Atlantic, which invested nearly $1,000,000 in the project when it was all <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done.</b> [...] Because of the pressure to produce radio singles, the sound of the album was quite different from its previous releases, as was Schwab's cryptic lyrics, which represented the frustrations of being stifled creatively and feeling powerless in the process.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of writing}} a piece for {{production}} by a theatre proprietor, as was usual in Victorian theatres, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support. They were therefore able {{to choose their own}} cast of performers, rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre. They chose talented actors, most of whom were not well-known stars and did not command high fees, and to whom they could teach a more naturalistic style of performance than was commonly used at the time. They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers. The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience; as critic Herman Klein wrote: [...] "we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [...] were <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done.</b> For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings.... conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight." ...|$|E

500|$|Crawford {{returned}} {{his attention to}} Sudanese archaeology, describing Sudan as [...] "an escape-land of the mind {{at a time when}} the island of Britain was an austere prison". At the invitation of the Sudanese government, he visited the country on an archaeological reconnaissance trip in January 1950, before visiting the Middle Nile in 1951. At Nursling, he wrote a book on the northern Sudanese Funj Sultanate of Sennar, which appeared in the same year as his long-delayed report on the Abu Geili excavation, co-written with Frank Addison. He followed this with the 1953 book Castles and Churches in the Middle Nile Region. Another of Crawford's book projects in this period was a short history of Nursling, as well as an introductory guide to landscape studies, Archaeology in the Field, published in 1953. In 1955 he then published his autobiography, <b>Said</b> <b>and</b> <b>Done,</b> which the archaeologist Glyn Daniel and the historian Mark Pottle—the authors of Crawford's entry in the Dictionary of National Biography—described as [...] "a vivacious and amusing autobiography in which his character comes clearly through".|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is <b>Said</b> <b>and</b> <b>Done</b> More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|Knowing that Gilbert and Sullivan {{shared his}} vision of {{broadening}} the audience for British light opera by increasing its quality and respectability, Carte gave Gilbert wider authority as a director than was customary among Victorian producers, and Gilbert tightly controlled all aspects of production, including staging, design and movement. [...] Gilbert hired the Gaiety Theatre's ballet-master John D'Auban to choreograph most of the Savoy operas. [...] The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers {{had an effect on}} the audience; as the critic Herman Klein wrote: [...] "we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [...] were <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done.</b> [...] For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings.... conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight." [...] The Sorcerer ran for 178 performances, a healthy run at the time, making a profit, [...] and Carte sent out a touring company in March 1878. [...] Sheet music from the show sold well, and street musicians played the melodies. [...] The success of The Sorcerer showed Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan that there was a future in family-friendly English comic opera.|$|E
