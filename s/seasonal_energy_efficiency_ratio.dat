25|$|In cooling mode, a heat pump's {{operating}} performance {{is described in}} the US as its energy efficiency ratio (EER) or <b>seasonal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> (SEER), and both measures have units of BTU/(h·W) (1 BTU/(h·W)= 0.293 W/W). A larger EER number indicates better performance. The manufacturer's literature should provide both a COP to describe performance in heating mode, and an EER or SEER to describe performance in cooling mode. Actual performance varies, however, and depends on many factors such as installation details, temperature differences, site elevation, and maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{passive solar}} {{building}} design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high <b>seasonal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation. Passive cooling, and superior system engineering techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%. Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{prescriptive}} {{approach is}} primarily {{used to establish}} energy benchmarks for energy systems in buildings. This paper reviews national standards and guidelines for the energy performance of chiller systems which provide cooling energy in commercial buildings but their operation causes the major proportion of electricity consumption in the building sector. The standards reviewed are currently adopted in nine places (in alphabetical order) : Australia, California, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, the EU, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the USA. Under standard rating conditions at full load operation, the minimum required coefficient of performance (COP) ranges from 2. 40 to 3. 06 for air-cooled chillers and from 3. 80 to 6. 39 for water-cooled chillers. Some standards state also the COP requirements at part load operation with integrated part load values or <b>seasonal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratios.</b> A classification scheme is provided in the EU and Chinese standards which helps labeling and certifying high efficient chiller products.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the office}} buildings, large energy is {{consumed}} due to poor thermal performance and low efficiencies of HVAC systems. A cooling load calculation is {{a basis for}} the design of building cooling systems. The current design methods are usually based on deterministic cooling loads, which are obtained by using design parameters. However, these parameters contain uncertainties, and they will be different from that used in the design calculation when the cooling system is put in use. The actual cooling load profile will deviate from that predicted in design. A modified bin method was used in this paper to optimize the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> (EER). A design optimization method is proposed by considering uncertainties related to the cooling load calculation. Impacts caused by the uncertainties of seven factors are considered, including the outdoor weather conditions and internal heat sources. The cooling load distribution is analyzed. Comparison between the modified bin method and CLTD/SCL/CLF method is also conducted. With the distributions of their energy consumption, decision makers can select the optimal configuration based on quantified confidence.

40|$|International audienceAir source {{heat pumps}} {{driven by a}} gas engine is a known technology. In this paper, we {{describe}} a Heat Pump driven by a gas engine that uses grey waters as the cold source producing domestic hot water and heat for the hydronic system. Grey waters are coming exclusively from kitchen’s and bathrooms’ wastewater and their average temperature is about 30 °C. This temperature is constant all along the year. The recovered lukewarm water is stored at atmospheric pressure in a tank. The domestic hot water and the heating water are produced instantaneously by the heat pump and stored in a tank, and hot water is delivered at 58 °C. The paper presents the architecture resulting from a heat integration and exergy analysis study. It allows the heat recovery from the grey waters for the generation of domestic hot water while heat recovery from the engine is used for heating the building. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the ratio between the heat recovered from the grey waters and the heat recovered from the engine when the thermal efficiency of the engine varies.
