500|$|One evening, Starr took Carey to {{a record}} {{industry}} gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records, was interested in Carey; as <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> the tape, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola grabbed it from him, {{and said that he}} would tend to [...] "the project". Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and invited her to go to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, [...] "When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom." [...] After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.|$|E
500|$|She took John back to {{her house}} and {{enrolled}} him in a local school, but after few weeks <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> back to Mimi. Various reasons have been suggested for her decision, such as Dykins' unwillingness to raise the young boy, Julia's inability {{to cope with the}} responsibility, or a punishment forced on her by Mimi and her father for [...] "living in sin". Lennon blamed himself, saying later, [...] "My mother... couldn't cope with me." [...] He then lived continuously at 'Mendips', in the smallest bedroom above the front door, with Mimi determined to give him a [...] "proper upbringing". Julia later bought Lennon his first guitar for £5/10- (five pounds, ten shillings) after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks, but insisted it had to be delivered to her house, not her sister's. As Lennon had difficulty learning chords, she taught him banjo and ukulele chords, which were simpler, and later taught Lennon how to play the piano accordion. Julia's banjo was the first instrument that John learned to play 'sitting there with endless patience until I managed to work out all the chords.' After Julia's untimely death the instrument was never seen again and its whereabouts remains a mystery.|$|E
500|$|After Julia {{separated}} from her husband, she and the infant Lennon {{moved in with her}} new partner, John Albert [...] "Bobby" [...] Dykins, but Mimi twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services and complained about Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins. Julia was eventually persuaded to hand the care of Lennon over to the Smiths, who had no children of their own. Mimi later confided to a relative that although she had never wanted children, she had [...] "always wanted John". In July 1946, Alf Lennon visited the Smiths and took Lennon to Blackpool, ostensibly for a long holiday, but with the secret intention of emigrating to New Zealand with him. Julia went to Blackpool and took Lennon back to her house, but a few weeks later <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> back over to Mimi. Lennon then lived continuously at Mendips, in the smallest bedroom above the front door. Although she was a caring guardian, she was also known for being very strict, compared to the more relaxed influence of her husband and Lennon's mother. Family friends described Mimi as stubborn, impatient, and unforgiving, but also said that she had a strong sense of humour. On many occasions when she criticised Lennon, he would respond with a joke, {{and the two of them}} would be [...] "rolling around, laughing together".|$|E

500|$|Angelo {{was forced}} to help Nicole {{give birth to a}} baby boy, George, and <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> over to Marilyn {{immediately}} as agreed. She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby. Of the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby. James defended Nicole stating: [...] "I think it's hard to not bond, but this is Marilyn's baby, and Nicole is so young and wants very much to give Marilyn and Sid this gift." ...|$|E
2500|$|Already drunk {{before he}} got to the Emerson Hotel that night, the 6'2" [...] Zantzinger had {{assaulted}} employees at Eager House, a prestigious Baltimore restaurant, with the same cane. The cane was a 25-cent toy. At the Spinsters' Ball, he called a 30-year-old waitress a [...] "nigger" [...] and hit her with the cane; she fled the room in tears. Moments later, after ordering a bourbon that Carroll did not bring immediately, Zantzinger cursed her, called her a [...] "nigger", then [...] "you black son of a bitch", and struck her on the shoulder and across the head with the cane. In the words of the court notes: [...] "He asked for a drink and called her 'a black bitch', and 'black s.o.b'. She replied, 'Just a moment' and started to prepare his drink. After a delay of perhaps a minute, he complained about her being slow and struck her a hard blow on her shoulder about half-way between the point of her shoulder and her neck." [...] <b>She</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> his drink. After striking Carroll, he attacked his own wife, knocking her to the ground and hitting her with his shoe.|$|E
