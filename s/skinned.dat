5|$|In Novi, Virginia, a {{group of}} ex-convicts, led by Dr. Lisa Holland (Katy Boyer), meet and discuss atoning for their sins. Terry Pruit (Don Swayze) tells the others that, since he has {{discovered}} the group, he has made amends for his past. However, another member, Ed (Cyril O'Reilly), tells him that humans are unable to change {{and that they are}} both destined for hell. Ed's friend, Victor Potts (David Figlioli), tells Holland that he's been having nightmares involving people being <b>skinned</b> alive. That night, he has a vision of Ed <b>skinned.</b> Several hours later, Victor is murdered. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) asks John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to examine Potts' body. Reyes explains that, because Potts had a premonition of his death, the case is an X-File. Meanwhile, at a butchery, Terry and Ed get into an argument. Terry later has a vision—similar to Victor's—in which Ed is <b>skinned</b> alive. That night, he is attacked and brutally flayed.|$|E
5|$|Reyes finds {{newspaper}} clippings explaining the story: In 1868, {{a group of}} four miners murdered a man. The murderers' souls have been reincarnated several times since, only to be brutally <b>skinned</b> by {{the soul of the}} victim. In each case, the avenger is a prominent figure of the law.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have <b>skinned</b> him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
40|$|Reproducing <b>skin</b> colors pleasingly is {{essential}} for photographic color reproduction. Moving <b>skin</b> colors toward their preferred <b>skin</b> color center improves the <b>skin</b> color preference. Two main factors to successfully enhance <b>skin</b> colors are: a method to detect <b>skin</b> colors effectively and a method to morph <b>skin</b> colors toward a preferred <b>skin</b> color region properly. This paper starts with introducing a method to enhance <b>skin</b> colors using a static <b>skin</b> color detection model. It significantly improves the color preference for <b>skin</b> colors that are not far off from regular <b>skin</b> tones. To enhance a greater range of <b>skin</b> tones effectively, another method that automatically adapts the <b>skin</b> color detection model to the <b>skin</b> tone of each individual image is proposed. It not only enhances <b>skin</b> colors effectively, but also adjusts the overall image colors to produce more accurate white balance on the image...|$|R

5|$|Doggett, {{acting on}} Reyes' insistence that Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is <b>skinned</b> {{regardless}} of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that the victims are experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E
5|$|During the Postclassic period, {{the most}} common form of human {{sacrifice}} was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid. Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the corpse would be <b>skinned</b> by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The officiating priest would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that symbolized the rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Reyes and Doggett {{arrive in}} Novi {{and talk to}} Detective Van Allen (James McDonnell), who seems apathetic about the case. At the same time, Scully {{contacts}} Dr. Bertram Mueller (George D. Wallace), a former medical examiner who autopsied several bodies in the 1960s that were <b>skinned</b> {{in a manner similar}} to Potts. Mueller tells Scully that the sheriff at the time did not pay much attention to the cases, emphasizing that there was more than one victim, and that he later killed himself. Reyes and Doggett receive news of Terry's attack and arrive at the local butchery to find him strung up among the pigs. While looking around the crime scene, Doggett discovers that Terry is still alive; Terry weakly says Ed's name. Doggett and the local police arrest Ed, who claims that he is innocent. Reyes believes him and admits that she too is having similar visions. Ed is freed, but not before having a vision in which Dr. Holland is <b>skinned.</b> In the meantime, Scully discovers that Potts and Terry were both born on the same day that two of the 1960s murder victims died.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be <b>skinned</b> and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E

5|$|Gallimimus are {{featured}} in a stampede scene where {{one of them is}} devoured by the Tyrannosaurus. The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully <b>skinned</b> while pursued by the T. rex. Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus jump over. The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E
40|$|<b>Skin</b> can {{be damaged}} by the {{environment}} easily. <b>Skin</b> cream is an effective and rapid way to moisten the <b>skin</b> by changing the <b>skin</b> surface properties. Rat <b>skin</b> and pig <b>skin</b> are common animal models for studies and were used as <b>skin</b> samples in this study. The nano- and macroscale friction and durability of damaged <b>skin</b> were measured and {{compared with those of}} virgin (intact/undamaged) <b>skin.</b> The effect of <b>skin</b> cream on friction and durability of damaged and virgin <b>skin</b> samples is discussed. The effects of velocity, normal load, relative humidity and number of cycles were studied. The nanoscale studies were performed by using atomic force microscope (AFM), and macroscale studies were performed by using a pin-on-disk (POD) reciprocating tribometer. It was found that damaged <b>skin</b> has different mechanical properties, surface roughness, contact angle, friction and durability compared to that of virgin <b>skin.</b> But similar changes occur after <b>skin</b> cream treatment. Rat and pig <b>skin</b> show similar trends in friction and durability...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: (Pre) {{cancerous}} <b>skin</b> lesions accumulate more protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) upon {{topical application}} of 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) than the surrounding normal <b>skin.</b> This {{might be the}} result of a higher percutaneous penetration of ALA into (pre) cancerous <b>skin.</b> Study Design/Materials and Methods: ALA penetration through (1) healthy <b>skin</b> with intact stratum corneum, (2) healthy <b>skin</b> with reduced stratum corneum (i. e. tape stripped <b>skin)</b> and (3) diseased <b>skin</b> with dysplastic and thickened epidermis (chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin)</b> was determined in an in vitro model with hairless mouse <b>skin.</b> Results: More ALA had penetrated through chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> than through normal non-exposed <b>skin</b> after 8 hours ALA application. The amount of ALA penetrated through chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> was smaller than through tape stripped <b>skin.</b> Conclusions: The stratum corneum barrier function is less effective in chronically UVB-exposed <b>skin</b> than in normal non-exposed <b>skin,</b> but more effective than in tape stripped <b>skin.</b> A higher penetration rate of ALA into (pre) cancerous lesions may be (partly) responsible for the greater accumulation of PpIX in such lesions.

5|$|In 1838 William Macarthur planted Riesling vines near Penrith in New South Wales. Riesling was {{the most}} planted white grape in Australia until the early 1990s when Chardonnay greatly {{increased}} in popularity. Riesling still flourishes in The Great Southern (in particular Mt Barker, Frankland River and Porongorup), Clare Valley, in particular the areas of Watervale and around the Polish Hill River, and the cooler Eden Valley and High Eden regions. The warmer Australian climate produces thicker <b>skinned</b> grapes, sometimes seven times the thickness of German grown grape. The grapes ripening in free drain soil composed of red soil over limestone and shale, producing a lean wine that as it matures produces toasty, honeycomb and lime aromas and flavors. It is common for Australian Rieslings to be fermented at low temperatures in stainless steel tanks with no oxidation of the wine and followed by earlier bottling.|$|E
5|$|On a field near Ustikolina and Jahorina {{in eastern}} Bosnia, the Chetniks of Baćović and Ostojić massacred about 2,500 Muslims and burned {{a number of}} villages. Baćović also killed a number of Partisan sympathizers elsewhere. In September 1942, Baćović {{completed}} a tour of Chetnik units in Herzegovina, and reported that {{the morale of the}} population was excellent and that the actions of the Ustaše and Partisans were drawing the populace to the Chetniks. That same month, his Chetniks killed 900 Croats in the coastal town of Makarska. Baćović's reports made it plain that his forces were conducting planned operations to kill or drive out the Muslim and Catholic population of Herzegovina. One of these reports stated that during reprisal attacks against the towns of Ljubuški in western Herzegovina and Imotski in the Dalmatian hinterland, his Chetniks had <b>skinned</b> alive three Catholic priests, killed all men over fifteen, and razed 17 villages.|$|E

40|$|The memory colour {{reproduction}} {{is an important}} factor in judging image quality of photographic images of real life scenes. As the most important memory colour category, <b>skin</b> tone was extensively studied for preferred {{colour reproduction}} in this research. The methodology to study <b>skin</b> colour preference was then applied to study the colour preference of two other important colour categories: green foliage and blue sky. There are three essential parts for preferred <b>skin</b> colour enhancement: 1) building a <b>skin</b> colour model to detect <b>skin</b> colours or <b>skin</b> pixels; 2) finding a preferred <b>skin</b> colour region or a preferred <b>skin</b> colour centre; and 3) developing an algorithm to morph <b>skin</b> colours toward the preferred <b>skin</b> colour region. This study for <b>skin</b> colour enhancement started with the mathematical modelling of the <b>skin</b> colour region for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The modelling of <b>skin</b> colours was then applied to adjust <b>skin</b> colours of test images for psychophysical experiments that were to determine a preferred <b>skin</b> colour region. Finally, the <b>skin</b> colour modelling and the preferred <b>skin</b> colour centres were applied to adjust <b>skin</b> colours of digital photographic images for preferred colour reproduction. Two approaches were developed to model the <b>skin</b> colour distribution for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The first approach was to model a local colour region for general applications. A convex hull is constructed to fit the geometrical shape of a local region, and then the convex hull is approximated with mathematical formulae. The formulations and data fitting are adjusted with interactive 3 -D visualization. The approach is flexible for fitting data gamut with various mathematical forms for different purposes. The other approach was to model <b>skin</b> colours with elliptical shapes. Three elliptical <b>skin</b> colour models were developed for <b>skin</b> colour detection. The first one is to model the <b>skin</b> colour cluster using a single ellipse ignoring the lightness (or luminance) dependency. It is simple and efficient, and the <b>skin</b> colour detection accuracy may be adequate for many applications. In the second model, the <b>skin</b> colour ellipse is adapted to different lightness so that the shape of the ellipse fits the <b>skin</b> colour cluster more accurately. The model is more complex to train and is less efficient in computation, but it is more accurate in <b>skin</b> colour detection. In the third method, an ellipsoid is trained to fit the <b>skin</b> colour cluster. It is almost as simple to train as the first model, but the <b>skin</b> colour detection accuracy is improved. Finally, these models were applied to train mixed <b>skin</b> colours, African <b>skin</b> colours, Caucasian <b>skin</b> colours, and Asian <b>skin</b> colours.

25|$|The surgeon replaces missing {{parts with}} tissue of like quality and quantity; nasal lining with mucosa, {{cartilage}} with cartilage, bone with bone, and <b>skin</b> with <b>skin</b> that best match the native <b>skin</b> color and <b>skin</b> {{texture of the}} damaged nasal subunit. For such surgical repairs, <b>skin</b> flaps are preferable to <b>skin</b> grafts, because <b>skin</b> flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture of nasal <b>skin,</b> better resist tissue contracture, and provide better vascularisation of the nasal skeleton; thus, when there is sufficient <b>skin</b> to allow tissue harvesting, nasal <b>skin</b> is the best source of nasal <b>skin.</b> Furthermore, despite its notable scarring propensity, the nasal <b>skin</b> flap is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction, because of its greater verisimilitude.|$|R
40|$|<b>Skin</b> {{has been}} paid {{attention}} as a site of application of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs (non-prescription drugs) and cosmetics. <b>Skin</b> permeation and <b>skin</b> concentration of the compounds should be considered after topical administration, {{as well as their}} blood concentration to evaluate efficacy and safety. Since the evaluation of the amount of drugs permeated through <b>skin</b> is important for topically applied drugs, studies on the <b>skin</b> permeation has been greatly advanced. In addition, many reports proved that <b>skin</b> permeabilities of drugs could be predicted from physicochemical parameters of drugs. On the other hand, few reports have been found on the prediction of <b>skin</b> concentration of drugs. Furthermore, many experimented problems are left to determine the <b>skin</b> concentration of drugs: severe consume of human or animal <b>skins,</b> difficult removal of applied drugs from the <b>skin</b> surface, low drug extraction ratio from <b>skin</b> and low sensitivity to determine <b>skin</b> concentration of drugs, and requirement of long time measurement. Thus, fast and accurate measurement of <b>skin</b> concentration of applied drugs are urgently required.

5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and <b>skinned</b> their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes <b>skinned</b> alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Adaptive Coloration in Animals, Cott wrote two essays on camouflage: “Camouflage {{in nature and}} in war” in the Royal Engineers Journal (December 1938), pp501–517; and ”Animal form in relation to appearance” in Lancelot Law Whyte, ed. Aspects of form: a symposium on form in nature and art (London: Percy Lund Humphries, 1951). As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: Zoological photography in practice (1956); Uganda {{in black and white}} (1959); and Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with their role as warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being <b>skinned</b> while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of ferrets, rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg tasters. In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the kittiwake eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Autologous <b>skin</b> {{substitutes}} {{to cover}} large <b>skin</b> defects are used since several years. Melanocytes, although essential for solar protection and pigmentation of <b>skin,</b> {{are not yet}} systematically added to such substitutes. In this experimental study, we reconstructed melanocyte-containing dermo-epidermal <b>skin</b> substitutes from donor <b>skins</b> of different <b>skin</b> pigmentation types and studied them in an animal model. Features pertinent to <b>skin</b> color were analyzed and compared in both <b>skin</b> substitutes and original donor <b>skin.</b> METHODS: Keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblast were isolated, cultured, and expanded from <b>skin</b> biopsies of light- and dark-pigmented patients. For each donor, melanocytes and keratinocytes were seeded in different ratios (1 : 1, 1 : 5, 1 : 10) onto collagen gels previously populated with autologous fibroblasts. <b>Skin</b> substitutes were then transplanted onto full-thickness wounds of immuno-incompetent rats. After 8  weeks, macroscopic and microscopic analyses were conducted with regard to <b>skin</b> color and architecture. RESULTS: Chromameter evaluation revealed that <b>skin</b> color of reconstructed light- and dark-pigmented <b>skin</b> was very similar to donor <b>skin,</b> independent of which melanocyte/keratinocyte ratio was added. Histological analyses of the <b>skin</b> analogs confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that adding autologous melanocytes to bioengineered dermo-epidermal <b>skin</b> analogs can sustainably restore the patients' native <b>skin</b> color...|$|R

5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark <b>skinned</b> Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
