40|$|Since {{the title}} passage rule evolved {{out of the}} law <b>of</b> {{commercial}} <b>sales,</b> {{it is appropriate to}} question contemporary judicial and administrative reliance on the concept of title, which, in the modern law <b>of</b> <b>sales,</b> exists largely as an historical footnote. It would be logical at this time to incorporate into source analysis changes in the law <b>of</b> commercial <b>sales</b> and to recognize explicitly that the passage of risk of loss from the seller to the buyer ought to determine the source of gains in international <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>property.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this Article is (1) to examine the role of the title passage rule in U. S. taxation of multinational enterprises in light of international law and jurisdictional legal principles; (2) to urge that any Congressional reexamination of the rule take into full account both the historical context in which the rule was created and the policy forces that contributed to its maturation; and (3) to reconcile judicial opinions and administrative pronouncements in the tax area with the abandonment of the title concept in commercial law. It is time for the courts to explicitly recognize both the centrality of risk of loss passage and the irrelevance of passage of title and to apply a risk of loss passage rule when determining the source of gains in international <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>property.</b> If Congress reexamines the statutory rules for sourcing gains from <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> inventory property, it must recognize that the title passage rule encompasses a risk of loss passage rule under which determinations of source of income reflect the economic substance <b>of</b> the underlying <b>sales</b> transactions, and, therefore, a total repeal of the title passage rule is not warranted...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{systems have}} {{different}} traditions {{about how to}} “prove” a contract for the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>property.</b> Most legal systems today permit the contract to be proved by any means but some States require that the agreement be concluded in or evidenced by writing. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods adopts a freedom-of-form rule but authorizes a State to declare that the rule does not apply when the seller or buyer has its place of business in that State. This essay studies the consequences of such a declaration. The Convention text does not expressly state the consequences. The Convention’s travaux préparatoires suggest that this silence was deliberate. Doctrine and court opinions are divided on whether the writing formalities of the declaring State always apply or the formalities, if any, of the law applicable {{by virtue of the}} rules of private international law govern. In the absence of a consensus, this essay argues that the writing formalities of the declaring State apply. The argument is based on the policies implicit in the decision of non-declaring Contracting States to adhere to a Convention that allows certain Contracting States to opt out of the freedom-of-form rule. The result is consistent with recent private international law treaties that, while providing liberal rules that favor freedom of form, direct application of the fundamental policies not only of the forum but also of other jurisdictions...|$|E

40|$|Investors in {{depreciable}} assets {{used in a}} trade or business claim depreciation deductions following investment, and upon sale or other disposition of their assets are taxed on gain or loss equal to differences between amounts realized and adjusted basis. The taxation of these realized gains and losses is asymmetric: losses are deductible against ordinary income, whereas {{a portion of the}} gain on <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> <b>property,</b> and virtually all gains on <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> real property, are taxed at more favorable capital gain tax rates. Evidence from U. S. tax returns in 2012 indicates that the aggregate annual magnitude of the tax saving due to the asymmetric taxation of these gains and losses is relatively modest, roughly between $ 800 million and $ 1. 71 billion. This paper considers the policy basis of this asymmetric tax treatment, noting that depreciation rules together with the elective nature <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> and realization implies that the tax system inefficiently discourages <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> depreciable business assets on which taxpayers have unrealized gains. In order to maintain efficient reallocation of used assets it is necessary to tax realized gains rather lightly. Taxpayers with unrealized losses on depreciable property have the option of retaining or discarding the property, in the first case claiming subsequent depreciation deductions against ordinary income and in the second claiming an immediate ordinary loss. The availability of these options implies that limiting the tax rate applicable to deductions for losses on <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> {{depreciable assets}} again would also inefficiently discourage asset sales. Consequently, the elective nature <b>of</b> asset <b>sales</b> implies that an efficient system imposes asymmetric taxes on gains and losses from <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> depreciable assets...|$|R
