5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to <b>sulfonated</b> hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E

25|$|Before the {{invention}} of PEM fuel cells, existing fuel cell types such as solid-oxide fuel cells were only applied in extreme conditions. Such fuel cells also required very expensive materials and could only be used for stationary applications due to their size. These issues were addressed by the PEM fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell was invented in the early 1960s by Willard Thomas Grubb and Leonard Niedrach of General Electric. Initially, <b>sulfonated</b> polystyrene membranes were used for electrolytes, but they were replaced in 1966 by Nafion ionomer, which proved to be superior in performance and durability to <b>sulfonated</b> polystyrene.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} the ion-exchange {{chromatography}} is given by the NTRC using <b>sulfonated</b> polystyrene as a matrix, adding the amino acids in acid solution and passing a buffer of steadily increasing pH through the column. Amino acids are eluted when the pH reaches their respective isoelectric points. Once the amino acids have been separated, their respective quantities are determined by adding a reagent that will form a coloured derivative. If the amounts of amino acids are in excess of 10 nmol, ninhydrin {{can be used for}} this; it gives a yellow colour when reacted with proline, and a vivid purple with other amino acids. The concentration of amino acid is proportional to the absorbance of the resulting solution. With very small quantities, down to 10 pmol, fluorescent derivatives can be formed using reagents such as ortho-phthaldehyde (OPA) or fluorescamine.|$|E
40|$|In {{solutions}} of hydrated SO 2 it {{is well-known}} {{that both the}} bisulfite ion HOSO 2 - and the <b>sulfonate</b> ion HSO 3 -are present whereas the <b>sulfonate</b> form prevails in some salts. Here we show by ab initio and transition state theory considerations how the mechanism of <b>sulfonate</b> formation works. In aqueous solution, dissolved SO 2 first forms a bisulfite ion which is in a next step converted into the <b>sulfonate</b> ion. Direct formation of the <b>sulfonate</b> ion is kinetically hindered due to a very high reaction barrier for this process. Tautomerization of the bisulfite ion into the <b>sulfonate</b> ion is catalyzed by water molecules.

While the ssu genes encode proteins resembling Ssu proteins from Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis, the seu gene products exhibited similarity to the dibenzothiophene-degrading Dsz monooxygenases of Rhodococcus strain IGTS 8. Growth tests with the C. glutamicum wild-type and appropriate mutant strains showed that the clustered genes ssuC, ssuB, and ssuA, putatively encoding the components of an ABC-type transporter system, are required for the utilization of aliphatic <b>sulfonates.</b> In C. glutamicum <b>sulfonates</b> are apparently degraded by sulfonatases encoded by ssuD 1 and ssuD 2. It was also found that the seu genes seuA, seuB, and seuC can effectively replace ssuD 1 and ssuD 2 for the degradation of <b>sulfonate</b> esters. The utilization of all <b>sulfonates</b> and <b>sulfonate</b> esters tested is dependent on a novel putative reductase encoded by ssuI. Obviously, all monooxygenases encoded by the ssu and seu genes, including SsuD 1, SsuD 2, SeuA, SeuB, and SeuC, which are reduced flavin mononucleotide dependent according to sequence similarity, have SsuI as an essential component.

In the present study, we examined the effect of andrographolide <b>sulfonate,</b> a water-soluble form of andrographolide (trade name: Xi-Yan-Ping Injection), on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced ALI and inflammation. Andrographolide <b>sulfonate</b> was administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice with LPS-induced ALI. LPS-induced airway inflammatory cell recruitment and lung histological alterations were significantly ameliorated by andrographolide <b>sulfonate.</b> Protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were reduced by andrographolide <b>sulfonate</b> administration. mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue were also suppressed.

Two different bacteria {{able to grow}} fermentatively using sulfonate-sulfur as sole sulfur source were isolated by enrichment culture; neither were able to utilize <b>sulfonate</b> as sole source of carbon and energy for growth.

Thus, bacterial {{assimilation of}} sulfonate-sulfur during anaerobic growth has direct parallels with features until now recognized only for the aerobic assimilatory process. ^ A novel taurine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity was detected in cell extracts of Clostridium pasteurianum when grown with taurine as sole sulfur source but was absent when cells had been grown with sulfate or sulfite as sole sulfur source. This aminotransferase activity was not detected in cell extracts of other bacteria examined. The characterization of taurine-pyruvate aminotransferase shows that the enzyme activity is inducible and has temperature optimum of 37 ∘C and pH optimum between 8. 5 to 9. 5. ^ The diverse pattern of <b>sulfonate</b> utilization in the aerobic bacterial world has also been studied.
