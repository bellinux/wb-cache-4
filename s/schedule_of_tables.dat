40|$|The {{comparison}} of two biggest jewish {{communities in the}} Czech country, Kolín and Libeň, show us in virtue of performed research the different making of them. On the one hand its population grew {{in the same way}} up. Many of the inhabitants come from other cities, mainly from Nový Bydžov and Praha, also some from Poland or Germany. On the other hand show the differents in crafts, taxes collection and administration. In Kolín were more tradesmen and merchants, in Libeň dominated the manufacturing of clothes. The real jewish ribbon manufacture in Libeň was established at the end of eighties of 18 th century. Surprising is result of research the taxes. The Jews from Kolin, although they had less incomes, had to collect twice more contribution tax than the Jews from Libeň. The contribution tax rises about one third during the 18 th century. The administration of Jews in Kolín was privileged due to direct management of Czech chamber. But the the economic situation was different, the Jews from Libeň were for Praha more important.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in mixed-criticality applica-tions implemented using distributed heterogenous architec-tures, composed of processing elements (PEs) interconnected using the TTEthernet protocol. At the PE-level, we use partitioning, such that each application is allowed to run only within predefined time slots, allocated on each processor. At the communication-level, TTEthernet uses the concepts of virtual links for the separation of mixed-criticality messages. TTEthernet integrates three types of traffic: Time-Triggered (TT) messages, transmitted based on schedule tables, Rate Constrained (RC) messages, transmitted if there are no TT messages, and Best Effort (BE) messages. We assume that applications are scheduled using Static Cyclic Scheduling (SCS) or Fixed-Priority Preemptive Scheduling (FPS). We are interested in analysis and optimization methods and tools, which decide the mapping of tasks to PEs, the sequence and length of the time partitions on each PE and the <b>schedule</b> <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> the SCS tasks and TT messages, such that the applications are schedulable and the response times of FPS tasks and RC messages is minimized. We have proposed a Tabu Search-based meta-heuristic to solve this optimization problem, which has been evaluated using several benchmarks. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe recent {{migration}} from single-core to multi-core platforms in the automotive domain reveals great {{challenges for the}} legacy embedded software design flow. First of all, software designers need new methods {{to fill the gap}} between application description and tasks deployment. Secondly, the use of multiple cores has also to remain compatible with real-time and safety design constraints. Finally, developers need tools to assist them in the new steps of the design process. We propose in this paper a method integrated in the AUTOSAR design flow for the generation <b>of</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>tables</b> imposing the execution constraints onto a multi-core architecture. We consider an engine control application described in AUTOSAR as a set of periodic and dependent runnables. For that, we propose a formalization of periodic dependencies adapted to this automotive framework and present a scheduling algorithm taking into account this specificity. We leaded experiments with a complex and real world control application onto automotive multi-core systems. We present our working process enabling the generation of several execution schemes for this industrial application. The results show that our scheduling method benefits the multi-core migration to generate solutions best suited to safety standards by reducing the total jitter...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the storage {{management}} of the WHOWEDA web warehousing system, which warehouses historical web information. To facilitate inter-table and intra-table sharing of web pages, we propose a three-layer storage architecture, that consists <b>of</b> tuple, <b>table,</b> and pool layers of storage modules storing different part of warehoused web information. To improve retrieval efficiency, we have chosen to replicate some mode attributes across web tables in the table layer while keeping only unique copies of web pages at the pool layer. The separation <b>of</b> <b>table</b> and pool layer storage also allows different valid times to be maintained by multiple web tables for the same web pages due to different <b>schedules</b> <b>of</b> global coupling across web tables. As the sharing of web pages may lead to valid time inconsistency between different web tables, we propose an update synchronization scheme to resolve the valid time differences on user request...|$|R

40|$|Parnas {{together}} {{with a number of}} colleagues established the systematic use of certain kinds <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> as a useful tool in software documentation and inspection with an accessible, multidimensional syntax and intuitive semantics. Previous approaches to formalisation <b>of</b> <b>table</b> semantics based their definitions on the multi-dimensional array structure <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> and thus achieved close correspondence with the intuitive understanding <b>of</b> <b>tables.</b> In this paper, we argue that a different view, supporting a compositional semantics, is more advantageous for tool support and for reasoning about tables.

This simple, inductive view of the structure <b>of</b> <b>tables</b> allows us to provide highly flexible tools for defining the semantics of tabular expressions.

40|$|In {{embedded}} systems, {{there is}} a trend of integrating several different functionalities on a common platform. This has been enabled by increasing processing power and the arise of integrated system-on-chips. The composition of safety-critical and non-safety-critical applications results in mixed-criticality systems. Certification Authorities (CAs) demand the certification of safety-critical applications with strong confidence in the execution time bounds. As a consequence, CAs use conservative assumptions in the worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis which result in more pessimistic WCETs than the ones used by designers. The existence of certified safety-critical and non-safety-critical applications can be represented by dual-criticality systems, i. e., systems with two criticality levels. In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> mixed-criticality systems which are subject to certification. <b>Scheduling</b> policies cognizant <b>of</b> the mixed-criticality nature of the systems and the certification requirements are needed for efficient and effective scheduling. Furthermore, we aim at reducing the certification costs to allow faster modification and upgrading, and less error-prone certification. Besides certification aspects, requirements of different operational modes result in challenging problems for the scheduling process. Despite the mentioned problems, schedulers require a low runtime overhead for an efficient execution at runtime. The presented solutions are centered around time-triggered systems which feature a low runtime overhead. We present a transformation to include event-triggered activities, represented by sporadic tasks, already into the offline scheduling process. Further, this transformation can also be applied on periodic tasks to shorten the length <b>of</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>tables</b> which reduces certification costs. These results can be used in our method to construct schedule tables which creates two schedule tables to fulfill the requirements of dual-criticality systems using mode changes at runtime. Finally, we present a scheduler based on the slot-shifting algorithm for mixed-criticality systems. In a first version, the method schedules dual-criticality jobs without the need for mode changes. An already certified schedule table can be used and at runtime, the scheduler reacts to the actual behavior of the jobs and thus, makes effective use of the available resources. Next, we extend this method to schedule mixed-criticality job sets with different operational modes. As a result, we can schedule jobs with varying parameters in different modes...|$|R
