5|$|The {{school was}} still {{operating}} in 1937, though a public request {{had been made}} for regular transport to take children to the Hagley District School, in consequence of the Hadspen school's impending closure. Children from the town began attending the Hagley school in March 1938. By {{the middle of the}} same year a tender was approved by the Minister of Education for regular <b>school</b> <b>transport.</b> The transport was also for students from nearby Carrick., whose school closed in the 1930s. The school building was finally removed; a tender in 1944 called for it to be removed and re-erected at Falmouth. Schools have also been run in other town buildings, including a hall near the Anglican church, that was used for worship before the church's completion, in what is now the Uniting Church and also in another building that later became a private home. In the 21st century there are no schools remaining in Hadspen.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Monds was {{instrumental}} in formation of the first school. This private school was built in 1843, though Thomas Reibey converted it into St Andrews church in 1845, and the school moved elsewhere in the town. A Government school was built in 1873, next to the current recreation ground, and both schools were open as of 1883. The private school closed late in the 19th Century, but the Government school still had 65 students on the 1901 roll. The latter was a weatherboard building. It was extensively renovated in 1920 and was in use until the mid-1930s when the last school in Carrick closed. The building was relocated to nearby Hagley in 1938, though it was later demolished. In the same year the government began funding regular <b>school</b> <b>transport</b> from Carrick to the school at nearby Hagley, accompanying children from Hadspen whose school had also been closed. Since that time {{there has been no}} school in Carrick and a 1976 planning report stated the population was likely to remain insufficient to require one.|$|E

25|$|In July 2012, a new £28m <b>school</b> <b>transport</b> {{contract}} {{was made by}} the Isle of Wight council with Southern Vectis. New vehicles, Optare Solo SR M920s were ordered and arrived in September 2012. Some buses were transferred from the Go-Southcoast subsidiary, Damory Coaches. New double deckers ordered from Alexender Dennis were delivered in January 2013. Southern Vectis' involvement in coaching had varied through the years; early in the company's history the firm took no interest in coaching, preferring to leave the field to other operators. However, the company became involved in coaching through acquisition and conglomeration.|$|E
25|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} limited, {{and there were}} never more than two to three daily round trips. The first railcar was bought in 1928, {{allowing}} both the remaining steam locomotives to be chopped in 1930. Freight trains to the power station were thereafter operated using a shunter from SB. A second railcar was bought in 1938. From the 1950s there was increasing car traffic, taking patronage away from the railway. From the late 1950s to 1965 most of the traffic was as a <b>school</b> <b>transport.</b> The last major transport to the power station took place in 1948.|$|E

500|$|Roza Shanina {{was born}} on 3 April 1924 in the Russian village of Yedma (Arkhangelsk Oblast) to Anna Alexeyevna Shanina, a kolkhoz milkmaid, and Georgiy (Yegor) Mikhailovich Shanin, a logger who had been {{disabled}} by a wound received during World WarI. Roza was reportedly named after the Marxist revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg and had six siblings: one sister Yuliya and five brothers: Mikhail, Fyodor, Sergei, Pavel and Marat. The Shanins also raised three orphans. Roza was above average height, with light brown hair and blue eyes, and spoke in a Northern Russian dialect. After finishing four classes of elementary school in Yedma, Shanina continued her education {{in the village of}} Bereznik. As there was no <b>school</b> <b>transport</b> at the time, when she was in grades five through seven Roza had to walk [...] to Bereznik to attend middle school. On Saturdays, Shanina again went to Bereznik {{to take care of her}} ill aunt Agnia Borisova.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on the organization surrounding the <b>school</b> <b>transports</b> in Norrköping and its surrounding areas. It is a qualitative research {{based on interviews with}} four different groups that is included by this organization, local municipal officials, entrepreneurs, school personnel and youths depending on this service. I have used organization theory as a theoretical base. In my study it became clear to me that this is a complex and multifarious organization. The many different actors sometimes make it hard to survey all the different parts of the organization. The local municipal officials are responsible for the planning of <b>school</b> <b>transports</b> but are dependent on the cooperation of the other actors. The <b>school</b> <b>transports</b> are vital for the countryside and makes it possible for people to live far out on the country without having to pay for the <b>transports</b> to <b>school.</b> Furthermore it creates jobs for the local entrepreneur. My analysis shows that the main problem in the organization is the lack of communication and the different opinions in some areas of the organization. A lack of understanding and communication creates problems for an organization of this magnitude {{and it needs to be}} recognized. One solution is to organize meetings with the people involved at regular intervals. It is easier to discuss a matter if you meet each other face to face...|$|R
