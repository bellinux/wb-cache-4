Three years after <b>shelterwood</b> <b>felling</b> in subalpine Alberta, {{dominant}} regeneration averaged 5.5 cm in height in scarified blocks, and 7.3 cm in non-scarified blocks (Day 1970), possibly reflecting diminished fertility with {{the removal of}} the A horizon.|$|E
40|$|Our work {{aimed at}} {{studying}} {{the strategy of}} woody plants regeneration during the regeneration of a spruce stand with the admixture of beech and Douglas-fir by border cutting (NW-SE aspect) on acidic sites of higher elevations in the Bohemian-Moravian Upland. Spruce is better adapted to bear shade than Douglas-fir. Nevertheless, in optimal light conditions up to a distance of ca. 35 m (about 16 % DIFFSF) from the stand edge, the Douglas-fir can put the spruce into danger as to height growth. By contrast to beech, the density of spruce is significantly higher within the distance of 45 m (about 15 % DIFFSF) from the stand edge but further on the situation would change {{to the benefit of}} beech. The density of Douglas-fir significantly dominates over beech within a distance of 35 m from the stand edge; from 55 m (less than 15 % DIFFSF), the situation changes in favour of beech. Beech can survive in full shade deep in the stand core waiting for its opportunity to come. As compared to spruce and Douglas-fir, the height growth of beech was at all times significantly greater at a distance of 25 m from the stand edge. Converted to practical conditions, spruce and Douglas-fir with individually admixed beech seedlings showed good prosperity approximately up to a distance of one stand height from the edge. A mixture of spruce and beech did well at a greater distance but good prosperity at a distance of 2 – 3 stand heights was shown only by beech. Thus, border regeneration eliminates disadvantages of the climatic extremes of clear-cutting and specifics of <b>shelterwood</b> <b>felling</b> during which one – usually shade-tolerant tree species dominates in the natural regeneration (e. g. beech) ...|$|E
40|$|Meteorological {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out in forests in the southwestern part of the Swabian Alb (SW Germany) to analyze the influences of exposition and silvicultural treatment on the microclimate within various stands of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The measurements were taken {{as part of an}} interdisciplinary project on the effects of climate and forest management on structures and processes within beech dominated deciduous forests. Near-surface stations for continuous recording of meteorological variables in forests provide the basis of the investigations. Two each were installed on two opposite slopes (NE and SW) of a narrow valley: one within a control plot (no silvicultural thinning) and one within a silviculturally treated plot (strong <b>shelterwood</b> <b>felling).</b> Meteorological towers on each control plot provided data for the analysis of climatic conditions above the beech stands and within their canopies. The experimental design is well-suited for investigation of not only the influence of exposition, but also the effects of forest management and phenophases on the microclimate within differently handled beech stands. The plant area index PAI is used to characterize the canopy. The present article deals with the photosynthetically active radiation PAR at the near-surface stations and above the stands as a reference. PAR is measured horizontally. Above the stands, differences to PAR received parallel to the slopes can be estimated by use of model calculations for the incoming solar radiation G {{due to the fact that}} PAR/G is almost constant (1. 937 µmol/J) above the stands. For PAR and the PAR-interception within the canopy in the year 2001, the following results are discussed: mean diurnal courses in one month within the leafless period (February) and the vegetation period (August), daily mean values over the whole year and monthly mean values. For the leafless period the results show the influence of the exposition of both slopes on PAR at the near-surface stations and the PAR-interception. In the vegetation period, however, the influence of the fully developed canopy was more significant than exposition. With increasing PAI, results from regression analysis for the entire investigation period indicate a linear decrease of PAR/G below the canopy as well as an exponential increase of PAR-interception within the canopy and a logarithmic decrease of the PARtransmission through the canopy. The extinction coefficient k for PAR shows a tendency towards logarithmic decrease with increasing PAI...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{successional}} process of beech in a allochthonous spruce monocultures. In the natural regeneration of the predominatly spruce stand (area: 14. 28 ha, age: 110 years) with single mother beech trees admixture the spruce regeneration occupies {{the most part}} of the study area. However, about one quarter of area is occupied relatively regular by beech regeneration. The spruce density was at all times higher than that of beech while the spruce height grow was by contrast at all times lower than that of beech. Mean distance of beech seedlings dispersion is 12. 7; at a distance greater than 40 [*]m, the density already neared zero. Density of spruce increases with increasing light intensity, the density of beech decreases – the competition point was found about 19 % of diffuse radiation or about 14 % of canopy openness. The both species respond to increase of light intensity with increase of height grow (by beech only weekly) – the spruce starts to dominate the beech at about 32 % of diffuse radiation or about 22 % of canopy openness. The silvicultural goal in the next stand generation – converting of spruce forest into mixed forest, i. e. achievement of the legal proportion of beech as a soil-improving and reinforcing tree species (proportion about 30 % and more) in the spruce stand can be reliably realized by natural way only using a combination of more intensive <b>shelterwood</b> or border <b>felling</b> with group selection system...|$|R
