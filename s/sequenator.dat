40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} where the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase system {{is used to}} create very small devices for quantitative analysis of the amino acids that occur in proteins. The basis of the method is {{that each of the}} 20 synthetases and/or a tRNA specific for a different amino acid is separated spatially (e. g. in tiny chambers or on a surface). The reactions catalyzed by all 20 synthetases are monitored in a spatially resolved manner. Each separately positioned synthetase or tRNA will signal its cognate amino acid. The synthetase reactions can be monitored using continuous spectroscopic assays. Alternatively, since elongation factor Tu;GTP (EF-Tu;GTP) specifically binds all AA-tRNAs, the aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by the synthetases can be monitored using ligand assays. Microarrays for amino acid analysis are suggested. Additionally, it is possible that amino acid analysis arrays can be integrated with aminopeptidase or carboxypeptidase digestions to produce miniaturized enzymatic <b>sequenators</b> capable of generating either N- or C-terminal sequence data at femtomole-attomole levels.

Thermolysin was cleaved under conditions of limited fragmentation in order to produce, besides fragments 1 - 120, 121 - 205 and 206 - 316, the overlapping fragments 1 - 205 and 121 - 316.

The complete sequence of the first 37 residues was determined by Edman Begg degradation (<b>Sequenator)</b> of the protein. The {{amino acid sequence}} of the last 8 residues was determined by manual Edman degradation of an octapeptide obtained on cleavage of the reduced and S-methylated protein with N-bromosuccinimide. The basic nuclear protein of bull spermatozoa contains 47 amino acid residues with alanine at the amino terminus and glutamine at the carboxyl terminus. The protein contains 24 arginine residues and 6 half-cystine residues. 19 of the arginine residues {{are in the middle}} of the molecule, arranged in three clusters of, respectively, 7, 6 and 6 residues.

Sequencing of total circulating DNA could either provide valuable information regarding such factors or determine novel targets (DNA markers) for cancer diagnostics. Materials and Methods: We used a Sanger’s technology (ABI PRIZM 3110 <b>sequenator)</b> and BLAST analysis of circulating DNA from plasma and cell-surface-bound fraction of healthy individuals and patients with breast cancer. DNA was isolated by guanidine thiocyanate/glass milk method (Tamkovich, 2004) followed by Sau 3 A and EcoRI hydrolysis. Fragmented DNA was ligated into the pBlueScript II KS(-) vector. Competent XL-Blue (E. coli) cells were transformed with the vector by electroporation and after recovery the cells were plated on LB+Amp agar plates. The inserts length estimate by PCR-analysis. Results: The majority of investigated circulating DNA fragments were about 100 – 800  bp. Sequence analysis revealed that number of circulating DNA fragments does not depend from the size of paternal chromosome both in normal and pathological state, but fragments from chromosome six were found in the female bloodstream more frequently. It was found, that in cancer patients blood were observed frequency of occurrence of pseudo genes and CpG islands below then in healthy female blood. BLAST analysis demonstrates that 10 % of coding DNA fragments circulating in blood of the breast cancer patients is associated with development of this pathology. Conclusion: Sequencing of circulating DNA demonstrates a variable concentration of different DNA sequences in comparison with genomic DNA. Further characterization of circulating DNA may be beneficial in diagnosis and prognosis and may also contribute to determining the source and function of circulating DNA...|$|E
30|$|The {{mitochondrial}} cytochrome c oxidase (COI) gene barcodes {{were successfully}} obtained for 69 specimens. Three genera of Ulidiinae (Physiphora (two species), Timia (four species), Ulidia (two species)), eight genera of Otitinae (Ceroxys (six species), Herina (two species), Melieria (four species), Myennis (one species), Otites (three species), Pseudotephritis (one species), Seioptera (one species), Tetanops (one species)), the genus Homalocephala (four species), and Psila fimetaria (L., 1761) (Psilidae) as an outgroup {{were included in}} a barcode analysis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing were performed at the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding following standard throughput methods. The specimen information, vouchers, sample distribution, photographs. and GenBank accession numbers can be assessed through the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD; [URL] (Ratnasingham and Hebert [2007]) in the publically available project ‘TGSPA-Schizophora of the Palaearctic.’ In order to broaden the sample space of the group Ulidiidae, we additionally obtained five COI barcodes of Physiphora clausa Macquart, 1843, Timia monticola Becker, 1906, Timia (Empyelocera) libani Gregor, 1970, Ulidia megacephala Loew, 1845, and Ulidia ruficeps Becker 1913 [GenBank:KC 663633 -KC 663637]. DNA was extracted from whole specimens following the manufacturer’s protocol of the DIAtomTM DNA Prep 100 kit (Isogene, Russia). PCR amplification was performed using LCO 1490 (forward, 5 ′-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG- 3 ′) and HCO 2198 (reverse, 5 ′-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA- 3 ′) primers (Folmer et al. [1994]). The following are the conditions: PCR conditions - hot start 94 °C for 5 min; pre-PCR 5 cycles - denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 45 °C for 1 min 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s; and 35 cycles - denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplification products were run on 1 % TBE agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). PCR products were extracted from an agarose gel via the manufacturer’s protocol of the JETQUICK Gel Extraction Spin Kit 250 (GENOMED GmbH, Löhne, Germany). Sequencing was performed using a <b>sequenator</b> ABI PRISM 310 with reagents from an Applera kit (Norwalk, CT, USA). Contigs were made using CodonCode Aligner Ver 3.7. 1.1 (CodonCode Co.).|$|E
40|$|Component 8 c- 1, {{one of four}} highly {{homologous}} component- 8 subunit proteins {{present in}} the microfibrils of wool, was isolated as its S-carboxymethyl derivative and its amino acid sequence was determined. Large peptides were isolated after cleaving the protein chemically or enzymically and the sequence of each was determined with an automatic <b>Sequenator.</b> The peptides were ordered by sequence overlaps and, in some instances, by homology with known sequences from other component- 8 subunits. The C-terminal residues were identified by three procedures. Full details of the various procedures used have been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50133 (4 pp.) at the British Library Lending Division, Boston Spa, Wetherby, West Yorkshire LS 23 7 BQ, U. K., from whom copies can be obtained on the terms indicated in Biochem. J. (1986) 233, 5. The result showed that the protein comprises 412 residues and has an Mr, including the N-terminal acetyl group, of 48, 300. The sequence of residues 98 - 200 of component 8 c- 1 was found to correspond to the partial or complete sequences of four homologous type I helical segments previously isolated from helical fragments recovered from chymotryptic digests of microfibrillar proteins of wool [Crewther & Dowling (1971) Appl. Polym. Symp. 18, 1 - 20; Crewther, Gough, Inglis & McKern (1978) Text. Res. J. 48, 160 - 162; Gough, Inglis & Crewther (1978) Biochem. J. 173, 385]. Considered in relation to amino acid sequences of other intermediate-filament proteins, the sequence is {{in accord with the}} view that keratin filament proteins are of two types [Hanukoglu & Fuchs (1983) Cell (Cambridge, Mass.) 33, 915 - 924]. Filament proteins from non-keratinous tissues, such as desmin, vimentin, neurofilament proteins and the glial fibrillary acidic protein, which form monocomponent filaments, constitute a third type. It is suggested that as a whole the proteins from intermediate filaments be classed as filamentins, the three types at present identified forming subgroups of this class. The significant homologies between types I, II and III occur almost exclusively in segments of the chain that have been identified as having a coiled-coil structure together with the relatively short sections connecting these segments. The non-coiled-coil segments at the C- and N-termini show no significant homology between types, nor is homology in these segments apparent in all members of one type. Component 8 c- 1 does not show homology in its terminal segments with the known sequence of any other filamentin. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Antifreeze polypeptides (AFP) were {{separated}} successfully from the serum of ocean pout Macroxoarces americanus using Sephadex G- 75 gel-filtration. QAE-Sephadex and SP-Sephadex ion-exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC. [...] It {{was found that}} the ocean pout AFP consists of a multiple family of at least twelve active components of nearly identical size (about 6, 000 daltons), which can be classified into two separate groups, named QAE and SP {{on the basis of their}} amino acid compositions and their behaviour on ion-exchange chromatography. [...] A partial amino acid sequence of SP- 1 -A, one of the major ocean pout AFP, was established up to 41 residues from its chymotryptic peptides using a protein <b>sequenator.</b> SP- 1 -A was compared with two other major components, namely SP- 1 -B and SP- 1 -C, by tryptic and chymotryptic peptide mapping and amino acid analyses. They showed overall structural similarities with minor differences. [...] A cDNA coding for the biosynthetic precursor of one of the ocean pout AFP was isolated and purified from the plasmid pBR 322 in E. Coli HB 101. It was then cloned into phage M 13 mp 8. The sequence of the cDNA was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. It had untranslated regions at both 3 ' and 5 ', and a coding region for a signal peptide containing 22 amino acid residues and a mature polypeptide containing 65 residues. The sequence of the mature polypeptide matched the protein data from both SP- 1 -B and SP- 1 -C. The results from both protein chemistry and molecular biology showed that SP- 1 -A, SP- 1 -B and SP- 1 -C have very similar amino acid compositions and sequences with only minor differences. For example, SP- 1 -A contains Ile and Ala at positions 53 and 62, while both SP- 1 -B and SP- 1 -C contain respectively Leu and Val at the same positions. SP- 1 -C has an additional Gly at its C-terminal compared to both SP- 1 -A and SP- 1 -B. [...] The amino acid analyses showed that SP- 1 -A, SP- 1 -B and SP- 1 -C contain fourteen types of amino acids with modest contents of Ala and no half-cystine. There is no obvious repeating structure in ocean pout AFP. These results confirm that ocean pout AFP represent a new type of fish antifreeze proteins. [...] Ocean pout AFP from individual fish caught in both winter and summer from Newfoundland, and in winter months from New-Brunswick were analyzed on reverse phase HPLC. The results did not show any significant populational or seasonal polymorphisms...|$|E
