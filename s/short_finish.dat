40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness, inert flexural strength, {{and slow}} crack growth {{parameters of the}} r- and a-planes of sapphire grown by the Heat Exchange Method were measured to qualify sapphire for structural use in the International Space Station. The fracture toughness in dry nitrogen, K(sub Ipb), was 2. 31 +/- 0. 12 MPa(square root of) m and 2. 47 +/- 0. 15 MPa(squre root of) m for the a- and r-planes, respectively. Fracture toughness measured in water via the operational procedure in ASTM C 1421 was significantly lower, K(sub Ivb) = 1. 95 +/- 0. 03 MPa(square root of) m, 1. 94 +/- 0. 07 and 1. 77 +/- 0. 13 MPa(square root of) m for the a-, m- and r-planes, respectively. The mean inert flexural strength in dry nitrogen was 1085 +/- 127 MPa for the r-plane and 1255 +/- 547 MPa for the a-plane. The power law slow crack growth exponent for testing in water was n = 21 +/- 4 for the r-plane and n (greater than or equal to) 31 for the a-plane. The power law slow crack growth coefficient was A = 2. 81 x 10 (exp - 14) m/s x (MPa(squre root of) m) /n for the r-plane and A (approx. equals) 2. 06 x 10 (exp - 15) m/s x (MPa(square root of) m) /n for the a-plane. The r- and a-planes of sapphire are relatively susceptible to stress corrosion induced slow crack growth in water. However, failure occurs by competing modes of slow crack growth at long failure times and twinning for short failure time and inert environments. Slow crack growth testing needs to be performed at low failure stress levels and long failure times so that twinning {{does not affect the}} results. Some difficulty was encountered in measuring the slow crack growth parameters for the a-plane due to a <b>short</b> <b>finish</b> (i. e., insufficient material removal for elimination of the damage generated in the early grinding stages). A consistent preparation method that increases the Weibull modulus of sapphire test specimens and components is needed. This would impart higher component reliability, even if higher Weibull modulus is gained at the sacrifice of absolute strength of the component. The current specification frequently used for the preparation of sapphire test specimens and components (e. g., a " 60 / 40 " scratch-dig finish) is inadequate to avoid a <b>short</b> <b>finish...</b>|$|E

50|$|After the 1941/42 relegation, Landskrona BoIS {{first became}} a top team in their Division 2 group, and on two {{occasions}} they won their group, thereby winning promotion back to Allsvenskan. On both occasions their stays were <b>short,</b> <b>finishing</b> last in both the 1944-45 and 1948-49 Allsvenskan seasons. The situation worsened in the 1951-52 season, with BoIS finishing ninth of ten teams in the second tier, and being relegated to the third tier. With Landskrona's other notable club, BK Landora, also relegated from Division 2, Landskrona now lacked any representation in the two top tiers of Swedish football. That situation would last only one year, however, as BoIS were promoted back to the second tier in 1953.|$|R
50|$|The sprint hurdles {{are a very}} rhythmic race {{because both}} men and women take 3 steps (meaning 4 foot strikes) between each hurdle, no matter whether running 110/100 meters outdoors, or the shorter {{distances}} indoors (55 or 60 meters). In addition, the distance from the starting line to the first hurdle - while shorter for women - is constant for both sexes whether indoors or outdoors, so sprint hurdlers do not need to change their stride pattern between indoor and outdoor seasons. One difference between indoor and outdoors is the <b>shorter</b> <b>finishing</b> distance from the last (5th) hurdle indoors, compared to longer distance from the last (10th) hurdle outdoors to the finish line.|$|R
