5|$|By 1911 Germany {{had built}} battlecruisers of her own, and {{the superiority of}} the British ships could no longer be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher's view of the battlecruiser. In {{contrast}} to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann, begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283mm) armour <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> better protected than the Invincibles. The two s were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design. , designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified Moltke; speed increased by one knot to , while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches, equivalent to the s of a few years earlier. Seydlitz was Germany's last battlecruiser completed before World War I.|$|E

Unfortunately he died of smallpox in 1689, at the early age of 22. His young widow Muttammal – the only woman, strange to say, whom he had married – was inconsolable at his loss and, though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> advanced in pregnancy, insisted upon committing sati on his funeral pyre. His mother, Rani Mangammal, with great difficulty persuaded her to wait until her child was born, solemnly swearing that she could then have her way. When the child (a son) arrived, she was put off with various excuses until, despairing of being allowed her wish, she put an end to her own life.|$|E

25|$|The {{final day}} of the meeting was {{highlighted}} by Martina Ratej's first round Slovenian record throw to win the women's javelin contest, upsetting the defending champion and favourite Mariya Abakumova. Markus Münch provided his second personal best in as many years at the Winter Throwing event, but on this occasion his best was enough to take the gold in the men's discus. Following gold at the 2010 World Indoors, Nadzeya Astapchuk dominated the women's shot put: six of her throws that day were enough to win, although an injury hampered her performance and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> from her best form. The men's hammer was a close contest with the experienced Nicola Vizzoni just keeping the young Belarusian Yury Shayunou at bay. Sandra Perković was one of the stand-out performers in the under-23s competition: having set a Croatian national record in the discus in the weeks prior to the competition, she won the women's gold with a throw of 61.93m – which would have been enough for a silver medal in the senior ranks.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel was}} picked {{to be part}} of the young adult fantasy genre due to its {{increasing}} popularity. Cherith Baldry feel that the growth of genre is due to the fact that [...] "fantasy is something very deeply rooted in the human mind, not just for children". Fantasy stories are able to deal with human emotions helping readers to deal with them in the real world. Another Erin Hunter, Kate Cary felt that fantasy books such as Harry Potter [...] "is a sign of a deepening need for fantasy to brighten our lives".

500|$|The {{reviewer}} from NME {{considered that}} the song sashays along with sass, while still remaining charming, {{and said that}} though it doesn't mark Allen out as excellent dating material, as a soundtrack to the summer, [...] "it’s a dead fackin’ cert". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters called [...] "Smile" [...] {{just as good as}} [...] "LDN", [...] "its loose reggae arrangement augmented by the clever sample of Jackie Mittoo’s piano from the Soul Brothers’ 60s rocksteady tune [...] "Free Soul", as Allen sings bitterly about her ex, with just a hint of vulnerability at first, before going to her friends for reassurance, and confronting the guy during the chorus with a mean-spirited confidence that has us cheering inside". While John Murphy of MusicOMH praised the song and its [...] "gently lilting reggae rhythm", Priya Elan from NME considered that the Althea & Donna groove of [...] "Smile" [...] is what made fans [...] "fall for her in the first place". The former argued that [...] "even people who profess to hate pop music will secretly be tapping a foot to it and claiming it is just downright perfect pop for lolling around during the lazy warm, guaranteed to cheer the listeners up, no matter how down they're feeling". Other reviews came from The Guardian reporter Sophie Heawood, who didn't consider the song as Allen's greatest effort, but still thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>far</b> better than being called [...] "the female Mike Skinner".|$|E

In 1930, a ballet teacher from Tulsa, Mrs. Sabin, visited Fairfax looking for students and took on Betty Marie and Marjorie as students.

2500|$|Haddad {{comes from}} the {{southern}} Lebanese town of Maghdouche, although born in the Mountain town of Bsalim.
