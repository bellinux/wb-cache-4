40|$|The {{need for}} {{diversity}} {{has been cited}} as a rationale for important recent investment decisions <b>in</b> the UK <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> sector. It is invoked as the principal argument for continuing major government intervention. Yet there exists no formal analytical basis for the concept. Why is diversity good?

The resulting ambiguity causes confusion and is vulnerable to special pleading. Despite this, this paper argues that diversification offers a superior alternative to probabilistic approaches towards uncertainty and ignorance <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> investments and proposes a formal analytical approach. A quantitative index of diversity is borrowed from information theory and used to derive a value for the government's implicit willingness to pay for diversity <b>in</b> the UK <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> mix.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide methods to find the {{emission}} source and estimate the amount of waste gas emissions <b>in</b> the <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain, establish the model of the environmental impact (burden) <b>in</b> the <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain, detect the critical factor which causes significant environmental impact, and then identify the key control direction and reduce amount of environmental pollution <b>in</b> the <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain. Design/methodology/approach: In this context, life cycle inventory and life cycle assessment of China’s electricity coal were established in three difference stages: coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning. Then the outcomes were analyzed with the aim to reduce waste gases emissions’ environmental impact <b>in</b> the <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain from the perspective of sensitivity analysis. Findings: The results and conclusion are as follow: (1) In terms of total waste gas emissions <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain, CO 2 is emitted in the greatest quantity, accounting for 98 - 99 wt% of the total waste gas emissions. The vast majority of the CO 2, greater than 93 %, is emitted from the power plant when the coal is combusted. (2) Other than CO 2, the main waste gas is CH 4, SO 2 and so on. CH 4 is mainly emitted from Coal Bed Methane (CBM), so the option is to consider capturing some of the CH 4 from underground mines for an alternative use. SO 2 is mainly emitted from power plant when the coal is combusted. (3) The environmental burden of coal burning subsystem is greatest, followed by the coal mining subsystem, and finally the coal transportation subsystem. Improving the coal-burning efficiency of coal-fired power plant <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain is the most effective way to reduce the environmental impact of waste gas emissions. (4) Of the three subsystems examined (coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning), transportation requires the fewest resources and has the lowest waste gas emissions. However, the energy consumption for this subsystem is significant (excluding the mine mouth case), and transportation distance is found to have a substantial effect on the oil consumption and non-coal energy consumption. (5) <b>In</b> <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain, the biggest environmental impact of waste gas emissions is GWP, followed by EP, AP, POCP and ODP, and regional impact is greater than the global impact. Practical implications: The model and methodology established in this paper could be used for environmental impact assessment of waste gas emissions <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain and sensitivity analysis in China, and it could supply reference and example for similar researches. The data information on life cycle inventory, impact assessment and sensitivity analysis could supply theory and data reference for waste gas emissions control <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> coal <b>supply</b> chain.
