50|$|The EF 100 mm 2.8L Macro IS USM lens is {{the second}} macro lens in the Canon L series. It {{incorporates}} IS, improved build quality, weather sealing, and a new lens configuration resulting in improved MTF plots. This is the first lens on the market to incorporate Canon's new Hybrid Image Stabilization Technology. Hybrid IS effectively compensates for both angular and shift camera <b>shake</b> during close-up <b>shooting.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Creating high {{dynamic range}} images of non-static scenes is {{currently}} a challenging task. Carefully preventing strong camera <b>shakes</b> during <b>shooting</b> and performing image-registration before combining the exposures cannot ensure that the resulting hdr image is consistent. This is eventually due {{to the presence of}} moving objects in the scene that causes the so called ghosting artifacts. Different approaches have been developed so far {{in order to reduce the}} visible effects of ghosts in hdr images. Our iterative method propagates the influences of pixels that have low chances to belong to the static part of the scene through an image-guided energy minimization approach. Results produced with our technique show a significant reduction or total removal of ghosting artifacts. ...|$|R
50|$|The S95 is {{the first}} compact camera to feature Hybrid IS, which {{minimizes}} the impact of camera shake on image quality. There {{are two types of}} camera shake: angular shake and lateral shake. The PowerShot S95’s Hybrid IS stabilizes both types of camera shake by using a dedicated acceleration sensor to detect lateral shake. Because Hybrid IS is effective in reducing noticeable lateral <b>shake</b> at short <b>shooting</b> distances (where shooting magnification is high), the camera is able to greatly stabilize images at all shooting distances.|$|R
50|$|The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is {{a digital}} interchangeable-lens camera {{announced}} in February 2015. It features a new 40-megapixel high-resolution mode that uses sensor shift to generate overlapping 16-megapixel images to then compute a 40-megapixel composite. It is the successor of the Olympus OM-D E-M5. Compared to that earlier model from 2012 and flagship OM-D E-M1 released in 2013, {{both of which}} are claimed to have 4 f-stops of <b>shake</b> compensation when <b>shooting</b> handheld, Olympus claims the OM-D E-M5 II can compensate 5 f-stops.|$|R

5000|$|On July 6, 2012, {{the city}} was <b>shaken</b> by a <b>shooting</b> rampage in the East River Gardens {{apartment}} complex. Robert Brazzon murdered four people, including a fifteen year-old boy, before taking his own life in a city cemetery. He believed his girlfriend was stealing his illegal drugs; he was addicted to opiate pain medication and heroin for years due to his failing health. He had a decades-long criminal history, an obsession with firearms, and was a loner with few friends. Despite being caught earlier with homemade bombs and thousands of illegally-obtained pills in his house, he was never jailed for these offenses, instead taking a plea deal that have him probation.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} design, digital {{implementation and}} performance validation of a lead-lag controller for a 2 -degree-of-freedom (DOF) translational optical image stabilizer (OIS) installed {{with a digital}} image sensor in mobile camera phones. Nowadays, OIS is an important feature of modern commercial mobile camera phones, which aims to mechanically reduce the image blur caused by hand <b>shaking</b> while <b>shooting</b> photos. The OIS developed {{in this study is}} able to move the imaging lens by actuating its voice coil motors (VCMs) at the required speed to the position that significantly compensates for imaging blurs by hand shaking. The compensation proposed is made possible by first establishing the exact, nonlinear equations of motion (EOMs) for the OIS, which is followed by designing a simple lead-lag controller based on established nonlinear EOMs for simple digital computation via a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board in order to achieve fast response. Finally, experimental validation is conducted to show the favorable performance of the designed OIS; i. e., it is able to stabilize the lens holder to the desired position within 0. 02 s, which is much less than previously reported times of around 0. 1 s. Also, the resulting residual vibration is less than 2. 2 – 2. 5 μm, which is commensurate to the very small pixel size found in most of commercial image sensors; thus, significantly minimizing image blur caused by hand shaking...|$|R

40|$|Dimorphorchis lowii {{with its}} {{spectacular}} dimorphic flowers {{is well known}} to orchid enthusiast. This species belongs to Vandaeae tribe and Aeridinae subtribe. Like {{most of the other}} endemic orchids in Borneo island, this species is facing combined threats from habitat loss, habitat degradation, and problems in viable seed production and inefficient conventional vegetative propagation. Therefore in vitro propagation offers an important measure for multiplication and conservation of this species. In this study, protocols for in vitro propagation of D. lowii through semisolid and liquid systems were developed. The effects of basal media (1 / 2 MS, MS, 1 / 2 KC, KC, VW, and Mitra), plant growth regulators (KIN, BAP, TDZ, 2, 4 -D, NAA, IBA, and IAA), complex additives (banana homogenate, coconut water, tomato juice, peptone, and yeast extract), carbon sources (fructose, glucose, and sucrose), light and dark photoperiods (16 -hr light, 24 -hr dark, and 24 -hr light), and type of leaf segments (leaf tip, middle, and leaf base) on callus induction from leaf explant; protocorm-like-bodies (PLBs) proliferation from callus and shoot development; PLBs proliferation in liquid <b>shake</b> flask culture; <b>shoot</b> multiplication and rooting were investigated. The effect of immersion time on PLB proliferation in temporary immersion bioreactor systems (RITA® and twin-flask (BITO) systems was also investigated. Plantlets were subjected to photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic conditions prior acclimatization process to study their effects on the survival percentage. Callus induction from leaf tip explant was triggered when half-strength MS medium was used as basal medium and cultures were incubated under 24 -hr dark photoperiod. However, the percentage of callus formation was very low at only 2. 00...|$|R
40|$|Yield {{and soil}} mapping {{were carried out}} in 2007 and 2008 in a 9. 1 ha {{commercial}} olive tree plantation for olive oil production. The orchard is in the southern Peloponnese, where olives are cultivated extensively for {{extra virgin olive oil}} production. The field is planted in rows with about 1650 trees in total. Weed control was practiced during the previous 3 years using post emergence herbicides under no-tillage over about 2 / 3 of the field, and over the remaining 1 / 3 by mechanical weeding using a rotary cultivator. For yield mapping, olives were collected manually using rods to <b>shake</b> the tree <b>shoots</b> and letting the olives fall onto a plastic net covering the ground. Sacks of approximately 58 kg capacity were filled with olives from as many adjacent trees as were needed to fill a sack. The location of the sacks, or group of closely placed sacks, was identified using a commercial GPS (5 m resolution). In addition, 91 cores of soil were taken at a depth of 0 - 30 cm on a 30 -m systematic sampling grid corresponding to a density of 10 soil samples per ha. The soil properties measured were penetration resistance, soil texture, organic matter, pH, P, NO(3) -N, K, Mg, Zn, Mn, Fe, B and Ca contents. The effect of the method of weed control on the soil condition for post emergence herbicides under no-tillage versus rotary cultivation was evaluated on the basis of soil organic matter content and penetration resistance. The data were analyzed using both descriptive statistics and geostatistical methods. Maps were created as a basis for site-specific management of P, K and lime, and these were applied 15 days after harvest in the winter of 2008. The results indicated considerable spatial variation in yield and soil properties. The soil organic matter content was about 22 % greater and the penetration resistance about 26 % less in the areas under no-tillage. The mean pH increased from 5. 9 to 7. 0 as a result of lime application in the areas with pH below 6. 5...|$|R
