5|$|Although the {{architect}} Robert Smirke was appointed in December 1834 {{to design a}} replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir Edward Cust to open the process up to a competition gained popularity {{in the press and}} led to the formation in 1835 of a Royal Commission. This body determined in which style the new construction should be built, and in June they decided that either Elizabethan or gothic styles should be used. The commission also decided that although competitors would not be required to follow the outline of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen's <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be incorporated into the new complex.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men <b>should</b> <b>all</b> be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E

There's not even the {{remnants}} of homes for blocks ... I think it <b>should</b> make <b>all</b> of us humble. It <b>should</b> make <b>all</b> of us sympathetic. It <b>should</b> make <b>all</b> of us thankful for {{what we have been}} spared." [...] The legislators toured the area three days before they convened for a special session called by Democratic Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco to consider hurricane-recovery issues.|$|R

5|$|Themistocles {{therefore}} {{suggested a}} second strategy to the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. The pass could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy {{was adopted by the}} congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth <b>should</b> <b>all</b> else fail, whilst the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jan starts {{playing one}} of Frankie's CDs, but Graham {{turns it off}} to talk about money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because {{she asked him to}} blow up the balloon. She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the balloon. The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop the balloon, Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the balloon. Graham says they <b>should</b> <b>all</b> settle down and have lunch. In the kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone goes back into the lounge, erroneously thinking that the balloon has burst. Graham and Si take the balloon to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on.|$|E

We’ve seen so many revolutions and wars. We need decades of calm and harmonious development.|$|E
