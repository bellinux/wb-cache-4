5|$|Mouse lemurs (Microcebus), sifakas (Propithecus), and the indri (Indri) {{use their}} toothcombs to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus), and galagos (particularly the genera Galago and Euoticus) use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is {{specially}} adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> the insect and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take the insect back to its roost and eat it there. Slower moving bat species such as the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} shape, injera compares to the French crêpe and the Indian dosa as a flatbread cooked {{in a circle}} and used as a base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the crêpe and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian appam. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, will have a {{relatively}} smooth texture, while the top will become porous. This porous structure allows the injera to be a good bread to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> sauces and dishes.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part {{swallows}} are insectivorous, taking flying insects on the wing. Across the whole family {{a wide range of}} insects are taken from most insect groups, but the composition of any one prey type in the diet varies by species and with the time of year. Individual species may be selective, they do not <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> every insect around them, but instead select larger prey items than would be expected by random sampling. In addition the ease of capture of different insect types affects their rate of predation by swallows. They also avoid certain prey types; in particular stinging insects such as bees and wasps are generally avoided. In addition to insect prey a number of species will occasionally consume fruits and other plant matter. Species in Africa have been recorded eating the seeds of Acacia trees, and these are even fed to the young of the greater striped swallow.|$|E
500|$|Little brown bats are insectivores, eating moths, wasps, beetles, gnats, mosquitoes, midges and mayflies, among others. [...] Since many {{of their}} {{preferred}} meals are insects with an aquatic life stage, such as mosquitoes, they prefer to roost near water. Brown bats forage near bodies of water and {{move in and out}} of adjacent vegetation. Evening forages are done in groups and above the water. They echolocate to find their prey. They are particularly good at hunting insects when they are at close range and packed together. When hunting, little brown bats capture prey both by gleaning and by catching them in the air. When in flight, bats <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> the prey with their wings, while prey above water is directly grabbed with the mouth.|$|E

500|$|The poor playing {{conditions}} {{resulted in}} frequent fumbles by both teams and prevented either team from converting a single first down. [...] Only one pass was attempted in the game, an incomplete pass by Friedman. [...] Northwestern's three points {{were the only}} ones allowed by Michigan during the 1925 season. [...] Michigan kicked off to Northwestern to open the game. [...] Seeking {{to take advantage of the}} weather conditions, Leland [...] "Tiny" [...] Lewis of Northwestern punted on the first play from scrimmage. Benny Friedman tried to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> the ball, but he fumbled it and Northwestern recovered on Michigan's three-yard line. [...] Michigan's defense held on three straight runs by Northwestern. On fourth down, Lewis kicked a field goal from the 18-yard line with the ball having [...] "barely enough power" [...] to go over the crossbar.|$|E
500|$|The Sex Pistols reunited {{for five}} {{performances}} in the UK in 2007. In 2008, they undertook a series of European festival appearances, titled the Combine Harvester Tour. In August, after performing at the Dutch festival A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise, Lowlands director Eric van Eerdenburg declared the Pistols' performance [...] "saddening": [...] "They left their swimming pools at home only to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> some money here. Really, they're nothing more than that." [...] That same year, they released the DVD There'll Always Be An England, recorded at their Brixton Academy appearance on 10 November 2007. In 2010, Fragrance and Beauty Limited announced the release of an authorised Sex Pistols scent. According to {{a statement from the}} cosmetics firm, [...] "the fragrance exudes pure energy, pared down and pumped up by leather, shot through with heliotrope and brought back down to earth by a raunchy patchouli." [...] The band signed with Universal Music Group in 2012 to re-release Never Mind the Bollocks.|$|E

A number of {{synchronized}} effects help achieve this without the vehicle leaving the ground. These include a movable building set, lighting cues, simulator movements, projections and wind effects. Spider-Man attempts to pull the Scoop down, but is attacked by all the supervillains. Spider-Man thwarts them, but not before Doctor Octopus disengages the anti-gravity device, sending the Scoop on a simulated freefall until it is rescued by Spider-Man's webbing right above the ground and another Stan Lee cameo. Spider-Man manages to capture all of the supervillains by tying them with webs. As the vehicle pulls into the unload station, Spider-Man thanks the guests for their help and sends {{them back to the}} Daily Bugle, where he has rigged the anti-gravity cannon to lift Jameson up to the ceiling in his office. Guests unload while a modern rendition of the classic Spider-Man theme song plays and a voiceover by Stan Lee instructs the riders on exiting properly.|$|E

500|$|Marketing for {{the film}} {{included}} $20million spent by Disney for advertising as well as advertisers such as Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Payless ShoeSource paying $125million in tied promotions {{for the film}}. Marketing consultant Al Ries reflected on the promotion: [...] "This will be a killer deal. How can a kid, sitting through a one-and-a-half-hour movie with an army of recognizable toy characters, not want to own one?" [...] Despite this, Disney Consumer Products was slow to see the potential of Toy Story early on. When the Thanksgiving release date was announced in January 1995, many toy companies were accustomed to having eighteen months to two years of runway time and passed on the project. In February 1995, Disney took the idea to Toy Fair, a toy industry trade show in New York. There, a Toronto-based company with a factory based in China, Thinkway Toys, became interested. Although Thinkway was a small player in the industry, mainly producing toy banks {{in the form of}} film characters, it was able to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> the worldwide master license for Toy Story toys simply because no one else wanted it. Walt Disney Home Video put a trailer for the film on seven million copies of the VHS re-release of Cinderella; the Disney Channel ran a television special on the making of Toy Story; Walt Disney World in Florida held a daily Toy Story parade at Disney-MGM Studios.|$|E

2500|$|In Cambodia, a {{fork and}} spoon are the typical {{utensils}} used in Cambodian dining and etiquette. Spoons are used to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> food or water and the fork is there to help guide the food onto the spoon. Chopsticks are normally used in noodle dishes such as the Kuy Tiev and soup dishes. When eating soup the chopsticks will typically be paired with the spoon, where the chopsticks {{will pick up the}} food and the spoon will be used to drink the broth. Forks are never to touch the mouth, it is thought as rude, thus it is not used to eat such dishes.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known Ethiopian cuisine {{consists}} {{of various types}} of thick meat stews, known as wat in Ethiopian culture, and vegetable side dishes served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> the entrées and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, {{it is common to}} eat from the same dish {{in the center of the}} table with a group of people. It is also a common custom to feed others in your group with your own hands—a tradition referred to as [...] "gursha". Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no pork or shellfish of any kind, as they are forbidden in the Islamic, Jewish, and Ethiopian Orthodox faiths.|$|E

2500|$|Chimpanzees {{exhibit a}} variety of population-specific tool use: termite-fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for {{termites}} using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> termites. [...] Some of this variation {{may be the result}} of [...] "environmental shaping" [...] (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know how to eat insects. [...] When children see their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly learn to do the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.|$|E
2500|$|At harvest time, gardeners usually dig up {{potatoes}} with a long-handled, three-prong [...] "grape" [...] (or graip), i.e., a spading fork, or a potato hook, {{which is similar}} to the graip but with tines at a 90° angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large potato harvesters, which <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.|$|E
