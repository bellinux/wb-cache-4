50|$|The <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> of a {{chemical}} compound is a graphic representation of the molecular structure, showing how the atoms are arranged. The chemical bonding within the molecule is also shown, either explicitly or implicitly. Unlike chemical formulas, which have {{a limited number of}} symbols and are capable of only limited descriptive power, <b>structural</b> <b>formulas</b> provide a complete geometric representation of the molecular structure. For example, many chemical compounds exist in different isomeric forms, which have different enantiomeric structures but the same chemical <b>formula.</b> A <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> is able to indicate arrangements of atoms in three dimensional space in a way that {{a chemical}} formula {{may not be able to}} do.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The layer {{charge of}} five smectites, one vermiculitic material, and five reduced-charge clays was {{determined}} by the alkylammonium and <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> methods. The two sets of results were found to be linearly correlated (r=. 961); however, the values that were determined bythe alkylammonium method were 20 to 30 % lower than those determined bythe <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> method, and the regression slope for their linear relationship was 1. 67. The fact that the <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> method includes the effects of cations on the lateral edges of the clay particles probably accounted for some of the differences in the magnitude of the results but should not have caused the regression slope to deviate substantially from 1. 00. Therefore, inaccurate stimates of the packing density of alkylammonium cations in the interlayer space of 2 : 1 phyllosilicates were deemed responsible for the systematic divergence {{of the results of the}} two methods. To satisfy the need for a relationship between the two methods of determining layer charge, an empirical means of adjusting the alkylammonium values has been proposed and shown to yield values of layer charge that are comparable to those determined by the <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> method.
