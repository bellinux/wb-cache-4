5|$|In 1948, De Mauro {{moved to}} Palermo in Sicily under an assumed name, {{and worked for}} local {{newspapers}} such as Il Tempo di <b>Sicilia,</b> and Il Mattino di <b>Sicilia.</b> In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans.|$|E

5|$|For 1903, the Active Squadron was {{on active}} service for seven months, {{with the rest}} of the year spent with reduced crews. In 190405, <b>Sicilia</b> and her sisters were still in service with the Active Squadron, which was kept in service for nine months of the year, with three months in reduced commission. The {{following}} year, the ships were transferred to the Reserve Squadron, along with the three s and the ironclad , three cruisers, and sixteen torpedo boats. This squadron only entered active service for two months of the year for training maneuvers, and the rest of the year was spent with reduced crews. <b>Sicilia</b> was still in the Reserve Squadron in 1908, along with her two sisters and the two s.

40|$|A {{sequence}} {{analysis of the}} 16 S rRNA of Methanolobus <b>siciliae</b> T 4 /M(T) (T = type strain) showed that this strain {{is closely related to}} members of the genus Methanosarcina, especially Methanosarcina acetivorans C 2 A(T). Methanolobus <b>siciliae</b> T 4 /M(T) and HI 350 were morphologically more similar to members of the genus Methanosarcina than to members of the genus Methanolobus in that they both formed massive cell aggregates with pseudosarcinae. Thus, we propose that Methanolobus <b>siciliae</b> should be transferred to the genus Methanosarcina as Methanosarcina <b>siciliae...</b>|$|R

5|$|All three ships {{served in}} the Active Squadron for {{the first decade of}} their careers, which proved to be uneventful. They were {{transferred}} to the Reserve Squadron in 1905, and by the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, they were serving as training ships. They provided fire support to Italian troops fighting in Libya during the conflict and took part in the seizure of several Ottoman ports, including Tripoli. During World War I, Sardegna was used as a guard ship in Venice, while Re Umberto served as a floating battery in Brindisi and <b>Sicilia</b> was reduced to a depot ship. All three ships survived the war and were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Andorra {{has been}} a co-principality since the signing of a paréage in 1278, when the count of Foix and the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell agreed to share {{sovereignty}} over the landlocked country. After {{the title of the}} count of Foix had been passed to the kings of Navarre, and after Henry of Navarre had become Henry IV of France, an edict was issued in 1607 which established the French head of state as the legal successor to the count of Foix in regard to the paréage. Andorra was annexed by the First French Empire together with Catalonia in 1812–1813. After the Empire's demise, Andorra became independent again. The current joint monarchs are Bishop Joan Enric Vives <b>Sicília</b> and President Emmanuel Macron of France.|$|E
