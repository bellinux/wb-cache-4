40|$|M. Tech. (Ceramic Sculpture) The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} is the idea that ceramic objects reveal processes of thought and action, form and function, within set parameters. These parameters involved the idea of harmony and balance within a piece of work. The work speaks of diverse forms and concepts, the columnar aspect being a recurrent theme. All standard forming methods within the ceramic dicipline were used and combined in different ways to 'achieve the desired results. These methods include throwing, slip-casting, slabforming, pinching, press-moulding, and extruding. Designs were applied by means of coloured slips, glazes and on-glazes. In some instances the pieces were multiple-fired in order to achieve the desired effect. <b>Sprayed</b> <b>enamel</b> paint was also used, in two instances, where a particular effect was required. The technical problems of transporting large structures was resolved by the use of modular forms and segmented parts which could be dismantled and reassembled. Once a permanent site is found, the works will be assembled as follows :- A concrete foundation will be made. All segments of the column will be cemented together. A core of reinforced concrete will be set into the inner columnar space so that the pieces are structurally sound. This refers in particular to the Partially Disintegrated Columns I & II. Measurements listed on the drawn illustrations were all taken prior to firing...|$|R

Some pieces utilize mixed media including masks, found objects, and baroque moldings. His pen and ink drawings frequently evoke stark, decaying cityscapes of crumbling tenement buildings patrolled by strange vehicles and airborne creatures.|$|R
50|$|Haste {{went on to}} {{graduate}} from the Royal College of Art, where she first became interested in wire sculpture, using galvanised wire mesh over a steel armature, later on using the wire mesh as sculpting material on its own for indoor work. Haste's sculptures are generally created by building up many layers of wire mesh over the steel armature skeleton, <b>spray</b> finished with <b>enamel</b> paint.|$|R
50|$|St. Claire created {{many large}} scale hand painted pieces that she {{installed}} {{around the city}} of Los Angeles. The work was instantly recognizable and stylistically unlike anything being done in L.A. at the time. Every piece was drawn, painted and installed by hand. She utilized wheat pasting, graphic design, silk screening, acrylic, <b>spray</b> and <b>enamel</b> painting in her work on the street, and stood out as a force in the L.A. street art scene with her distinctive style. Most of her pieces surround the female form or face, and a ghostly energy; crystals, skulls, pupil-less eyes, peer {{into the depths of}} your soul. With fangs, sharp jaw lines, and a feminine strength that's unmatched, her work stands out from the crowd of other L.A. artists.|$|R
50|$|Lloyd's work {{generally}} {{takes the}} form of large mixed media paintings, but his work has also manifested in photography, printmaking, drawing, installation art, sculpture and digital imagery. Religious imagery features heavily Lloyd's new work. Lloyd co-opts the Hindu practice of Antiyesti, using pigment made from the ash of burnt artwork, as well as oil, acrylic, <b>spray</b> paint, marker, <b>enamel</b> and resin in this new series of twelve large artworks-in-progress entitled 'Eternal Singularity'.|$|R
5000|$|Typically {{the term}} [...] "enamel paint" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} oil-based covering products, usually with {{a significant amount of}} gloss in them, however recently many latex or water-based paints have adopted the term as well. The term today means [...] "hard surfaced paint" [...] and usually is in reference to paint brands of higher quality, floor coatings of a high gloss finish, or <b>spray</b> paints. Most <b>enamel</b> paints are alkyd resin based. Some enamel paints have been made by adding varnish to oil-based paint.|$|R
5000|$|Kubinyi {{reportedly}} {{once said}} of his collaboration with Hall, [...] "Control of color, design {{and most of the}} application of the enamel is done by Doris. I beat out the large sculptural forms, the metal forming, fabrication, ground coats, compounding of <b>enamels,</b> <b>spraying</b> and burning of undercoats. I take the brunt of the preparation." [...] During the 1940s, Kubinyi and his wife opened a gallery and studio in Gloucester, Massachusetts. They later opened a studio/gallery in downtown Boston, and finally a studio in Stockbridge, where Kubinyi also directed the art department for Hans Maeder's Stockbridge School.|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Nowadays lasers {{are used}} as {{alternatives}} to the tooth preparation because of reducing pain and bloodshed. The {{aim of this study}} was to observe the effect of ArF laser on the dental hard tissues. Materials and Methods: For this research human molar teeth with no caries or dental restoration and enamel cracks were used. Irradiation laser energies were taken 95, 70 and 50 mJ for enamel and 80, 70 and 50 mJ for dentine. Then, for each of energy values pulse numbers (repetition rate) were adjusted at 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1500. Ablation was carried out without water <b>spray</b> on both <b>enamel</b> and dentine. Finally, the dimensions of ablated areas were measured by using a camera connected to the computer and results were applied in graphs. Results: For each energy value, the ablation dimension increased by increasing pulse numbers. Ablation depth in dentine was more than that of for enamel. Trends of graphs for dentine and enamel were the same. SEM images of ablations by 95 mJ energy on enamel and 80 mJ energy on dentine showed sharp edges. Conclusion: Ablation depths increased by increasing pulse numbers, for each energy level. However, this increase was not that as expected, because the lack of water spray while irradiating...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} (steady state) {{value of}} the conductivity of different coatings was determined {{by a combination of}} optical shearography and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The behavior of organic coatings, i. e., ACE Premium-grey Enamel, white <b>Enamel,</b> beige <b>Enamel</b> (<b>spray</b> coatings), a yellow Acrylic Lacquer, and a gold Nail Polish, on a metallic alloy, i. e., a carbon steel, was investigated over a temperature range of 20 - 60 0 C. The {{value of the}} conductivity of coatings was obtained by correlating the in plane displacement of the coatings, from optical shearography, and by the alternating current (AC) impedance (resistance) of the coatings, from the EIS. The integrity of the coatings with respect to time was assessed by comparison the measured conductivity to the critical (steady state) or asymptotic value of conductivity. By shearography, measurement of coating properties could be performed independent of parameters such as UV exposure, humidity, presence of chemical species, and other parameters which may normally interfere with conventional methods of the assessing of the integrity of coatings. Therefore, one may measure the critical (steady state) value of the conductivity of coatings, regardless {{of the history of the}} coating, in order to assess the integrity of coatings. In this investigation, the obtained data of shearography were correlated with the data of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3 %NaCl solution in order to obtain the critical (steady state) value of the conductivity of coatings...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{testing was}} {{completed}} {{on the ground}} handling equipment for transporting the Ce/sup 144 / heat source container and loading the SNAP 1 A generator. Mercury shield fill and drain tests for the generator system and the collar shield were conducted. Heat-transfer tests of the isotope heat source shipping cask were conducted. Simulated rocket-launch environmental tests of vibration, acceleration, and shock were completed on the G- 2 generator. Analysis of the environmental test data was initiated. Final dssign studies for the G- 3 generator were completed, and a thermoelectric module concept was selected {{for use in the}} isotope-fueled generator. Development tests of thermoelectric modules in a module tester were initiated. Voltage breakdown tests were conducted on a porcelain <b>enamel</b> <b>spray</b> coat. The matenial was evaluated for application to the G- 3 generator inner skin as a possible second discrete barrier against hot junction electrical shorts. SNAP 3 generator 3 M- 1 G 10 completed 322 days of life test operation, and the power input was terminated after the generator was operated under a full range of external loads to obtain performance characteristics. Electrical power output after 322 days at steady-state heat source and external load conditions was 1. 92 watts, for an over-all efficiency of 2. 9 %. Tear-down inspection of the generator conformed previous indications of incrsased internal electrical resistance and thermal conductivity, which account for the gradual reduction in generator performance from the start-of-life electrical output of 3. 45 watts and 5. 2 % over-all efficiency. The SNAP 3 3 M- 1 G 5 generator was successfully fueled with Po/sup 210 /. Maximum electrical power output was 4 watts at an over-all efficiency of 5. 2 %. Radiological safety studies for space power were initiated. (For preceding period see MND-P- 3012 -I.) (auth...|$|R
40|$|Glasses {{have been}} widely used as {{substrates}} in new technologies especially flat panel displays (FPD), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting, and lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications. They are inexpensive, chemically inert with excellent optical, mechanical and thermal properties. In addition, they are biocompatible, and some compositions possess bioactive properties which are highly desirable in biomedical applications. This dissertation seeks to develop fundamental understanding of feature formation mechanisms and changes in morphology, structural, and mechanical properties of glasses induced by lasers in both high (a femtosecond laser) and low (a continuous wave laser) intensity regimes, and to investigate novel processes for modification and integration of glasses. Due to its nonlinear absorption capability in glasses, a femtosecond laser is used to generate internal features inside glass. Their morphology, structure, and mechanical properties such as modulus, hardness, ductility, and fracture toughness are experimentally characterized. Fundamental understanding of the feature formation and these property changes is developed through differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy, spatially resolved nanoindentation, and predictive numerical simulations. The improved understanding lays ground work to investigate novel processes of transmission welding (TW) and single step channeling (SSC) in glasses. Joining or sealing of glasses in FPD, OLED, and LOC applications are currently based on adhesives. They are susceptible to moisture permeability and require high curing temperatures of entire parts {{for a long period of}} time. TW is investigated and the mechanism of joint formation is analyzed. A numerical model, developed to predict the welding widths, demonstrates the inverse teardrop-shaped absorption volume like the experimental weld seam geometry. Using indentation fracture analysis, the joint is determined to have better mechanical properties than the base material. Fabrication of microfluidic networks in LOC using traditional lithographic processes, or other hybrid processes is cumbersome because they involve multiple steps. SSC is investigated, and numerical models are also developed and experimentally validated to predict the channel lengths resulting from different laser and focusing parameters. The understanding of the channel formation mechanism, and the channel length variation corresponding to the working parameters is developed. TW has the potential to achieve a reliable, highly localized sealing process while SSC has the potential to simplify LOC designs requiring no adhesive for FPD and biomedical industry, respectively. Reduction of the risk of early failure for load-bearing biomedical implants could be achieved by coating bioactive glass onto bioinert metallic substrates. High bioactivity of bioactive glass accelerates the bone-bonding time. Coatings of 45 S 5 Bioglass, which has the highest rate of bioactivity by plasma <b>spraying</b> and <b>enameling</b> usually fail due to its significant crystallization and weak adhesion to the substrates. Double layer coating by a continuous wave (CW) laser is investigated to produce a dense bond coat having a strong adhesion and a porous top coat having high bioactivity. The morphology and microstructure of the resultant laser coatings are experimentally characterized. A mixed interfacial layer is found at the glass-titanium interface indicating a relatively strong chemical bonding. The top coat is examined revealing a porous structure with low crystallinity. A numerical model is developed to aid in understanding laser sintering mechanisms and is validated experimentally to predict the overall porosity and crystallinity of laser coating...|$|R
