40|$|This Position Statement {{responds}} to the Communication of 10 January 2017 by which the European Commission launched a public consultation on the future legal framework for data-driven markets that emerge {{in the course of}} the current digitization of industrial production and the advent of smart products in which sensors are embedded. In particular, the Position <b>Statement</b> <b>comments</b> the Commission’s ideas on a possible future data producer’s right as a means of promoting access to data. While the Max Plank Institute agrees that there are indeed instances where there is a need to “unlock data”, it rejects a data producer’s right. Rather, the Institute recommends considering more targeted data access rights that would specifically react to situations in which a manufacturer of smart products would otherwise try to reserve related markets for itself. The Max Planck Institute thereby takes inspiration from the data portability right that has already been implemented as part of the Basic Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, general principles on the design of data access regimes are developed. In sum, the Max Planck Institute favours a sector-specific approach to the introduction of a general data access right or a generally applicable data access regime. Sector-specific rules are especially needed for answering more concrete questions such as regarding the person entitled to claim access or the one of whether a data holder should be remunerated for granting access to data...|$|E

The reason for the suit was that the newspaper, quoting an expert hired by Marc Lemire {{as part of his}} lawsuit with Warman, said that Warman was the author of a 2003 Internet post regarding Canadian Senator Anne Cools that used racist and sexist epithets. Warman denied that he was the author of the post and sued for libel damages from those who posted the information. The National Post and Kay apologized and retracted its statement and settled out of court with Warman. Levant, McMillan and Shaidle settled and publicly apologized on June 10, 2015. The apology posted on Levant's website read as follows:In the past, I have made certain derogatory <b>statements</b> and <b>comments</b> about Mr. Richard Warman on January 20, 23 and 28, 2008 and November 10, 2008.

5000|$|... (* Example Allman code {{indenting}} {{style in}} Pascal *)procedure dosomething(x, y: Integer);begin while x = y do begin something (...) somethingelse (...) end;end;Consequences of this style {{are that the}} indented code is clearly set apart from the containing statement by lines that are almost all whitespace and the closing brace lines {{up in the same}} column as the opening brace. Some people feel this makes it easy to find matching braces. The blocking style also delineates the block of code from the associated control <b>statement.</b> <b>Commenting</b> out or removing a control statement or block of code, or code refactoring, are all less likely to introduce syntax errors via dangling or missing braces. Also, it is consistent with brace placement for the outer-function block.|$|R
