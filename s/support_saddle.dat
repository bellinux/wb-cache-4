40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the extensive structural analysis {{and design of}} the support saddles for the Extended Barrel of the ATLAS Tilecalorimeter {{that has taken place}} at Argonne National Laboratory over the past several months. This work has been a continuation and expansion of work that has taken place {{over the course of several}} years within the ATLAS Tilecalorimeter collaboration. This paper will be divided into four main sections. Section 1 is the introduction to the analysis and will give a brief history of the work that had previously been done. Section 2 examines the design and structural analysis that has occurred on the support saddles. The design of the support saddles has evolved over the last few months. There are three main analyses of the saddles that are discussed in Section 2. First, the forces that act upon the support saddles and the resulting deflections and stresses are examined when the <b>support</b> <b>saddle</b> is subjected only to gravity loading. Next, the saddles are examined when subjected to a combination of gravity and a seismic load of. 15 g in the X, Y, and Z directions. Finally, the saddles are analyzed when subjected to a combination of gravity, magnetic, and seismic loading. Section 3 describes a detailed analysis of the back cryostat support structure in the Extended Barrel. This design has evolved significantly throughout the analysis process and every design iteration and analysis is described in detail. The initial design is described in Section 3. 1 that analyzed the back cryostat support only under vertical static loading. Section 3. 2 then examines the stiffening of the cryostat support plate that had to be included in the design in order to provide sufficient stiffness in the case of seismic loading in the X, Y, and Z directions. Finally, Section 3. 3 describes the final design, which has a modified stiffener...|$|E

The purpose of this analysis {{is to examine the}} forces, stresses, and deflections acting on the <b>support</b> <b>saddles</b> and modules at various stages of assembly. The nominal weight of a barrel module is 20 tons. CERN Document number ATL-LB-EA- 0001 'Summary of the Structural Analysis of the Barrel Support Saddles' describes in detail the structural analysis of the saddles and the completed barrel assembly. These calculations followed Eurocode 3. This paper examined several load cases which occur during the assembly of the Barrel. The following are the main conclusions: (1) The assembly is not stable until 18 modules are in place, and only then can the support cradle be removed; (2) The forces between modules are nominal and are far less that the forces in the completed cylinder with 64 modules in place and the cryostat load applied; (3) All of the stresses in the connections between modules are within acceptable limits; and (4) The interface between the cryostat supports and the cryostat move approximately 1. 0 mm in the X and Y directions when the load of the cryostat is transferred to the Barrel...|$|R

40|$|The static {{behavior}} of horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shells {{is the subject}} of numerous research works since long time. For the dynamic load of these tanks only few theoretical and no experimental examinations are known to this day. In the present work a contribution to the calculation of horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shells under vertical dynamic load is performed. In this connection, special attention is directed upon the simple manipulation for practical purposes. For the numeric calculation a model is generated on basis of the finite-element-method (FEM) with 4 -node shell elements after the discreet Kirchhoff'schen theory for the simulation of the vertical oscillation of lying liquid tanks. The contact between saddle and cylindrical shell is simulated by framework beams to which for pressure a linear-elastic material behavior is assigned, while with strains the Young's-module is set to zero. Through here the local take off of the cylindrical shell of the saddle can be simulated. An additional simplification of the model is the calculation of the liquid pressure from the toe acceleration of the oscillating tank. To confirm the FEM model experimental examinations of horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shells are executed in the present work for the first time. To measure the pressure between saddle and cylinder shells the Tekscan measurement system is used. Although the measuring system is used in different areas at research and production, no systematic examination of the measuring system is known to this day. Therefore, the functional principle of the measurement system is described in detail and the mistake influences and measuring accuracies are analyzed systematically {{for the first time in}} the present work. In this connection, the measuring accuracy is examined for different calibration loads and areas, different surface materials, temperature changes, dynamic load of different frequency, shear effects of folios and the temporal drift and indicated quantitatively. For the experimental examinations of horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shells a experimental plant is developed in the present work, so the vertical dynamic oscillation of the vessel is possible. In the main attempts of this work the filling degree, the saddle position, the saddle angle, the elasticity of an interposition between saddle and cylinder shell and the exciter frequency are varied. The displacement and strain condition of the vessel was measured at 60 measuring points, the support pressure distribution was measured with the Tekscan measurement system. With the FEM model the experimental results are checked and extended, as well as other shell and saddle parameters, as for example the shell length, the shell radius, the shell thickness etc. are examine. To represent the dependence of the numeric results of the different shell and saddle parameters, only one parameter is varied in every calculation series and the others are held. The numeric results are standardized on the parameter shell radius. A dynamic factor is developed in the present work which can be determined as a product from three partials dynamic factors diagrammatically. With the present work a systematic experimental and numeric examination of the horizontal, <b>saddle</b> <b>supported</b> cylindrical shell under vertical dynamic load is presented for the first time and also the used Tekscan measurement system was examined for the first time systematically for its mistake influences and measuring accuracies.

40|$|The {{maximum strain}} in a {{glass-reinforced}} plastic vessel, <b>supported</b> on rigid <b>saddle</b> <b>supports,</b> invariably {{occurs at the}} uppermost point of the support known as the saddle horn. The strain, {{which is in the}} circumferential direction, is compressive on the outside and tensile on the inside surfaces of the vessel. This can create problems in composite vessels since local cracking of the inner surface may allow liquid ingress to the glass through the matrix, with premature local failure by stress corrosion cracking. The analysis of this support problem has been solved using a double Fourier series by Tooth et al, [8], by which the maximum strain in the support region can be derived. The present paper presents a parametric study for an extensive range of vessels, in use in the process and chemical industries, using this analysis. To aid the design process the results for the crucial maximum strain values are presented in a 'closed form', using an equation-fitting technique. The details of the procedure used to achieve these equations should be of interest to analysts in other fields of work. Typical examples are given to illustrate the use of the derived equations for a symmetric laminate...|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of the boneshaker {{was similar to the}} dandy horse: wooden wheels with iron tires and a framework of wrought iron. As the name implies it was extremely uncomfortable, but the discomfort was somewhat ameliorated by a long flat spring that <b>supported</b> the <b>saddle</b> and absorbed many of the shocks from rough road surfaces. The boneshaker also had a brakea metal lever that pressed a wooden pad against the rear wheel. The front wheel axle ran in lubricated bronze bearings, and some had small lubrication tanks that would wick oil from soaked lamb's wool into the bearings to help them run smoothly. Like the High Wheel bicycles that became popular later in the 19th century, boneshakers were front-wheel drive, but in comparison they had smaller wheels (only about 1m), and were heavy, with a lightweight model weighing 30 pounds or more.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} patients to manifest vasovagal reactions after orthotopic heart transplantation. Background. Paradoxic stimulation of left ventricular baroreceptors may be the afferent limb of the vasovagal reflex in humans. Orthotopic heart transplantation causes surgical denervation of these receptors and would therefore be expected to abolish the vasovagal reflex. Methods. To attempt to confirm this hypothesis, 10 patients with orthotopic heart transplantation underwent both head-up tilt testing while resting on a <b>saddle</b> <b>support</b> and testing for parasympathetic innervation of the donor heart before and after atropine infusion. Native and donor heart sinus rates were monitored by using an esophageal pill electrode throughout tilting and during parasympathetic testing. Results. Unexpectedly, seven patients had vasovagal responses at <b>saddle</b> <b>support</b> tilt testing, during which native heart rate decreased by 25 ± 7 beats/min and mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 55 ± 9 mm Hg. In three of these patients, {{there was also a}} decrease in donor heart rate of 23 ± 26 beats/min. Parasympathetic testing showed possible evidence of donor heart vagal reinnervation in these patients with donor heart bradycardia during tilt but not in those with vasovagal reactions to tilt without slowing of the donor heart rate. Conclusions. Vagal efferent reinnervation can occur after orthotopic heart transplantation in humans. However, the absence of sach reinnervation in some patients with vasovagal responses to tilt calls into question the role of left ventricular receptors in inducing the vasovagal reaction...|$|R
