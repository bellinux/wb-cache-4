40|$|Sustainability is {{a concept}} that has become {{ubiquitous}} in <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> policy and practice. Despite this ubiquity, there remains a lack of clarity in practical understandings of the concept of sustainability. Moreover, research on sport and sustainability is limited and lacks theoretical underpinning. This article addresses these problems by proposing frameworks {{that can be used to}} examine and understand sustainability in <b>sports</b> <b>development.</b> In particular, two frameworks are developed through synthesising sustainability concepts presented in the literature on health programmes and adapting them to <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> through consideration of recent policies and programmes. The first framework addresses definitional issues by identifying four forms of sustainability that may be addressed by <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> programmes, namely individual, community, organisational and institutional sustainability. The second framework allows classification of processes that affect sustainability according to dimensions that concern the level of control held by agencies responsible for <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> sustainability and the level of integration between processes to achieve desired <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> outcomes and processes to achieve sustainability. Presentation of a case study of sustainability in the New Opportunities for PE and Sport Activities programme in Scotland enables discussion of the applicability of the frameworks to <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> as well as identification of implications that are derived from application of the frameworks. On the basis of this analysis, conclusions are drawn concerning the relationships between different forms of sustainability and the effectiveness of <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> programmes and the types of processes that affect different forms of sustainability. The implications for future research on <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> sustainability are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Partnerships are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the practice}} of contemporary <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> and, as a result, have increasingly become a focus for research in a variety of countries (e. g. Alexander, Thilbault, & Frisby, 2008; Babiak & Thilbault, 2008; Lindsey, 2009). To date, this research has tended to focus on explaining the prominence and formation of partnerships as well as describing the form and nature of partnerships that exist. Recognising these themes in the existing research on the wider practice of network governance, Søresnsen & Torfing (2008, p 10) recognise the need for a ‘renewal and enlargement’ of the research agenda. Similarly, {{there is a need to}} move beyond the initial descriptive focus of research on <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnerships to begin to consider issues, such as the reasons for the success of failure of partnerships, which may be more enlightening for academics and practitioners alike. Moreover, research on <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnerships would also benefit from encompassing more diverse methodological approaches that would augment the qualitative, retrospective interviews that have been used in the majority of studies thus far. To these ends, this study examines a formally constituted <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnership operating across a local authority area in Southern England. Three research questions underpin the study: •	What internal structures and processes enhance or constrain the <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnership? •	What external factors enhance or constrain the <b>sports</b> <b>development?</b> •	What contribution can research examining these questions make to the effectiveness of the <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnership? Adopting a ‘decentered’ approach advocated by Bevir & Richards (2009), the study utilises ethnographic methods to focus on the beliefs, interpretations and actions of partnership members. Interviews with partnership members, observations of partnership meetings and facilitated group discussions are being undertaken over an extended period of time. In line with the third research question, and recommendations by Huxham & Vangen (2005) and McKay & Romm (2008), an ‘active research’ approach underpins the design of all of the research methods. In this way, it is hoped that conducting and disseminating the research contributes to the improvement of the <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnership though encouraging both individual and collective reflection. As the study nears its conclusion, contributions by both the chairperson of the <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnership and the researcher will consider the extent to which the research has met its objectives. The chairperson will examine the contribution of the research process to encouraging reflection within the <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnership on group dynamics, representation, individual contributions and other influences on the overall character and strategic direction of the partnership. From the researchers’ perspective, comments will be made as to whether the research approach has been effective in developing new understandings of <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnerships. Moreover, other issues pertinent to conducting ethnographic, active research on <b>sports</b> <b>development</b> partnerships will be identified...|$|R
