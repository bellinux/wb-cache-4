5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that,</b> fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

The Beast, who plans to tell Belle he loves her, asks Belle if she is happy here, to which she responds positively but notes that she misses her father.

[...] As the first verse begins, she breaks into a research facility and battles with suited henchmen. Spears ends up gaining access to a highly secured laboratory and walks through aisles of clones held in liquid cocoons. <b>She</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> one is a clone of her, kisses her and plants a bomb on the tank. After this, Spears infiltrates {{the base of the}} apparent villain, kissing him, and then destroying him, revealing him to be a robot also. From there, she dodges a bullet and sets off a panic among the newly arrived henchmen, meanwhile the bomb's timer runs lower and lower.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Over" [...] {{was directed by}} Jake Nava in Los Angeles, California, who also directed the video for her previous single [...] "Rumors" [...] (2004). It {{was inspired by the}} 1999 film American Beauty. In the video, Lohan is walking home, when she sees her love interest (played by Drew Fuller) looking out of a window in his house as his mother sets the table behind him. Then his father comes up to him, and they begin to argue. The curtains close and Lohan continues on to her house, next door to her boyfriend’s, and runs up to her bedroom. Looking out her window, <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> he is looking back at her. As noted inside Lohan’s bedroom, she is starting to experiment with rebellious adolescence. There are Teletubbies and stuffed pandas, but also posters of bands such as L7, the Dead Kennedys and CBGB. These imagery are intercut with shots of Lohan and her band playing in a garage, a pool party, and also her love interest destroying his father’s car in the family garage.|$|E
500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which {{differs from that of}} Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's Birds of Prey issue #10, [...] "State of War", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that [...] "he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. <b>She</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she'll drop the hammer." [...] She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.|$|E

[...] Later, at a park, Liz visits Dennis, in which <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> he is building a strange contraption. Dennis tells her that he is trying to recreate and improve on the Balloon boy incident, a reference to the October 2009 hoax in which two parents claimed their son was on board a helium balloon that had floated away, but later {{turned out to be a}} publicity stunt.

500|$|Nookie in New York, the TV {{show that}} Marge watches with her sisters, spoofs the TV series Sex and the City. When Marge leaves with Artie, <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> Homer has spelt the words [...] "Keep Your Clothes On" [...] {{as a direct}} {{reference}} to the M*A*S*H series finale, Goodbye, Farewell and Amen. In the video that Homer recorded for Marge, Homer holds two toys.

The fictional area of [...] "West Springfield" [...] is modeled after the American state Texas (purposely once again a red-herring to where Springfield is based - it seems to be right next to Texas, until Lisa states that West Springfield is [...] "Three times the size of Texas"). The scene in which Homer and Lenny are travelling to West Springfield is a reference to the last scene in the 1969 drama film Midnight Cowboy. The music heard during the scene is also made to resemble the theme from said film. The scene in which Homer and Lenny are working in an oil rig is a reference to the 1970 film Five Easy Pieces. The song produced by Artie's invention {{at the end of the}} episode is Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), originally by The Eurythmics.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: [...] "Little Marie Allen, a penniless orphan, lives with her granddad. Out for a walk she admires a huge doll in a shop window. That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have {{another look at the}} doll. Arriving at the toy shop, <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} themes {{found in this}} book; some that are {{recurring}} are roles in society, religion, relationships, and also hybrid nature of American and Mexican ethnicities. Within these short stories Cisneros concentrates on the identities which women appropriate {{as a result of}} relationships, and how these are connected with their roles in society. [...] Critic Mary Reichart observes that in Cisneros's previous work as well as [...] "in Woman Hollering Creek (1991), the female characters break out of the molds assigned to them by the culture in search of new roles and new kinds of relationships. Cisneros portrays women who challenge stereotypes and break taboos, sometimes simply for the sake of shocking the establishment, but most often because the confining stereotypes prevent them from achieving their own identity." [...] An example of this is Cleófilas, who had hoped for a better life after leaving her home in Mexico to live in the United States. [...] The soap operas she had seen had led her to believe that her life {{was going to be a}} fairy tale. [...] Instead, with a failing marriage and another child on the way <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> her life resembles only the saddest aspects of a soap opera. [...] Another example of this is found in the final section of this book, entitled [...] "There Was A Man, There Was A Woman", where Cisneros illustrates how women can use their bodies as political instruments in their attempts to fight against male domination. [...] The two female protagonists in [...] "Never Marry a Mexican" [...] and [...] "Eyes of Zapata" [...] use their bodies in attempts to gain recognition and acceptance from husband and lover. [...] However, in doing so, they face the problems of objectification and oppression; two issues which end up adversely shaping the characters' identities. [...] In the end, the illegitimate societal roles of these women influence their quest for female identity. For example, Inés, in [...] "Eyes of Zapata", talks about the role she plays as lover, not a wife: [...] "You married her, that woman from Villa de Ayala, true. But see, you came back to me. You always come back. In between and beyond the others. That's my magic. You come back to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. [...] "The {{funny thing}} about Austin {{is that there was}} {{initially}} much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," [...] commented Schwahn. [...] "When that happens, I {{pick up the phone and}} try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually I get my way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as I suspected he would in the first place." [...] Schwahn added, [...] "This is not to say that there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would be surprised at how things work behind the scenes." [...] A regular from season 7, Julian initially comes to Tree Hill to win Peyton back. He offers to produce a film based on Lucas's first book. At first, Peyton does not reveal to Lucas that Julian is her ex-boyfriend, but she is forced to do so when the plans of the movie take shape. Brooke rebuffs his advances until Peyton gives her blessing when <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> <b>that</b> Brooke has a serious interest in Julian.
