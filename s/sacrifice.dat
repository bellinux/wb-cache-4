By extension, the <b>sacrifice</b> of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human <b>sacrifice.</b> Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E

50|$|The Hebrew Bible {{says that}} Yahweh {{commanded}} the Israelites to offer offerings and <b>sacrifices</b> on various altars. The <b>sacrifices</b> were {{only to be}} offered by {{the hands of the}} Kohanim. Before building the Temple in Jerusalem, when the Israelites were in the desert, <b>sacrifices</b> were offered only in the Tabernacle. After building Solomon's Temple, <b>sacrifices</b> were allowed only there. After the Temple was destroyed, <b>sacrifices</b> was resumed when the Second Temple was built until it was also destroyed in 70 CE. After the destruction of the Second Temple <b>sacrifices</b> were prohibited because there was no longer a Temple, the only place allowed by halakha for <b>sacrifices.</b> Offering of <b>sacrifices</b> was briefly reinstated during the Jewish-Roman wars of the second century CE and was continued in certain communities thereafter.|$|R
5|$|In {{the world}} of Hibiki's Magic, {{in order to gain}} magic one must make a <b>sacrifice.</b> It can be a {{physical}} <b>sacrifice,</b> such as Ahito experiencing pain, or a mental <b>sacrifice,</b> such as Shirotsuki losing his memories. Hibiki tries to help by making the sacrifices a little more bearable.|$|E
5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a <b>sacrifice</b> of propitiation, or <b>sacrifice</b> to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a <b>sacrifice.</b> The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a <b>sacrifice</b> of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic <b>sacrifice.</b> He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|The Skanda Purana narrates that Bhikshatana-Shiva {{appears on}} another {{occasion}} as a naked, fierce Kapali beggar. Once, at a <b>sacrifice</b> hosted by Brahma, Bhikshatana appears and begs for food. The Brahmins performing the <b>sacrifice</b> try to drive him away, considering a hungry beggar unfit for sacrificial rites. Bhikshatana throws his skull begging-bowl {{on the ground and}} the Brahmins throw it out, but another skull bowl appears in its place. Consequently, hundreds of skulls appear, polluting the <b>sacrifice,</b> which compels Brahma to promise Shiva that no <b>sacrifice</b> will be deemed complete without an invocation to him, Kapaleshvara—the Lord of the skulls.|$|E

5|$|In rabbinical tradition, {{the age of}} Isaac at {{the time}} of binding is taken to be 37, which {{contrasts}} with common portrayals of Isaac as a child. The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended <b>sacrifice</b> of Isaac. The <b>sacrifice</b> of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended <b>sacrifice</b> of Isaac, called the aqedah ("binding"). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the <b>sacrifice</b> and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.|$|E

2500|$|A {{popular belief}} claims soap takes {{its name from}} a {{supposed}} Mount Sapo, where animal <b>sacrifices</b> were supposed to have taken place; tallow from these <b>sacrifices</b> would then have mixed with ashes from fires associated with these <b>sacrifices</b> and with water to produce soap, but {{there is no evidence of}} a Mount Sapo in the Roman world and no evidence for the apocryphal story. The Latin word sapo simply means [...] "soap"; it was likely borrowed from an early Germanic language and is cognate with Latin sebum, [...] "tallow", which appears in Pliny the Elder's account. Roman animal <b>sacrifices</b> usually burned only the bones and inedible entrails of the <b>sacrificed</b> animals; edible meat and fat from the <b>sacrifices</b> were taken by the humans rather than the gods.|$|R
