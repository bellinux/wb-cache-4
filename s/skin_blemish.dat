5000|$|The [...] "Clone" [...] tool is very {{important}} in photograph manipulation on computer graphics software. The clone tool is used to actively copy and offset pixels from one area of an image to another while the artist moves the clone tool around the area to be copied. A good example is the use of the clone tool to cover a <b>skin</b> <b>blemish</b> by copying skin from one area of an image and placing it over the blemish. An important aspect of making a clone tool blend well in an image is to use feathering on the clone tool. This makes the pixels being copied have more effect on the area they are copied to closer to where the artist is dragging his or her mouse or stylus, and makes the pixels have less effect the farther they are from the clone tool (and where the artist is using it). Thus, with the skin example, skin pixels copied directly over the blemish will have strong effect on the blemish, thus hiding it, but skin pixels copied to the area around the blemish will not affect this area much, and will keep the natural look of the skin (wrinkles etc.) intact as much as possible.|$|E

The workshop was mainly aimed at potato advisors, including the potato industry, and scientists from the Nordic and Baltic countries. In addition, we also had participants that are plant breeders, students, and and other people interested in potato quality. In total there were about 60 participants at the workshop from the Nordic countries, UK, Switzerland, USA and China. This Workshop was an activity in Bioforsk project: “Improved potato quality by reduced <b>skin</b> <b>blemish</b> diseases (scab and scurf) in Norwegian potato production” (2008 - 2012). This project was financed by grants from the Research Council of Norway, the Foundation for Research Levy on Agricultural Products, the Agricultural Agreement Research Fund, and Norwegian potato growers and food industries; Gartnerhallen, Bama, ICA-Norge, NF-Grønt, KiMs and Maarud. The foreign experts attached to this project, Alison Lees (UK), Leslie Wanner (USA) and Jari Valkonen (Finland), were contributors in the workshop.

40|$|Both {{black dot}} and silver scurf caused by Colletotrichum coccodes and Helminthosporium solani, respectively, cause {{blemishes}} on the potato periderm. These diseases often occur together and frequently confused, cause reductions in fresh and ware potato production potential and damage value of seed potatoes. These diseases are largely distributed in all potato growing {{regions of the}} world, but black dot is most important in areas with dry and hot conditions, such as the Mediterranean regions, western USA, South Africa and southern Australia, although it is also well established in more temperate areas, such as UK, France, the Netherlands and Germany. Both diseases became {{a major problem in}} potato production over the past decade due to an increased demand for washed potatoes with a high-quality appearance. C. coccodes appears as a highly diverse species morphologically, physiologically and genetically; the existence of vegetative compatibility groups might explain this diversity, despite the fact that no sexual stage is known for the pathogen. C. coccodes is also diverse from a pathological point of view: it infects a range of plant species within and outside the Solanaceae, and shows some specific interactions with individual potato cultivars. In contrast, with H. solani there are no alternative hosts except to tuber-bearing Solanum species. Changes in cropping systems and in consumer dictate a reassessment of the economic importance of the <b>skin</b> <b>blemish</b> diseases, that severely affects the economic value of fresh market and seed potato production in regions of the world where external appearance is an essential driver of market access. An integrated disease management approach that includes cultural, biological and chemical control methods, in the field and in storage, is necessary for long-term control of <b>skin</b> <b>blemish</b> diseases. The fungicide TBZ was used for silver scurf control until the 1980 s, but due to high frequency of resistance imazalil has become the main fungicide used on seed tubers in Europe. However, C. coccodes is not sufficiently controlled by imazalil, suggesting another reason why black dot became a major pathogen on potato. Additional fungicides e. g. prochloraz, fludioxonil and azoxystrobin that control both pathogens are being introduced, however resistance to fludioxonil in H. solani was recently reported. Adequate control of the <b>skin</b> <b>blemish</b> diseases with very low tolerance for market access is highly problematic, and will require integrated strategies combining all currently available control methods. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|E

40|$|Background Sentinel {{lymph node}} spread {{is a crucial}} factor in {{melanoma}} outcome. We aimed to define the impact of minimal cancer spread and of increasing numbers of disseminated cancer cells on melanoma-specific survival. Methods and Findings We analyzed 1, 834 sentinel nodes from 1, 027 patients with ultrasound node-negative melanoma who underwent sentinel node biopsy between February 8, 2000, and June 19, 2008, by histopathology including immunohistochemistry and quantitative immunocytology. For immunocytology we recorded the number of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) per million lymph node cells (DCC density [DCCD]) after disaggregation and immunostaining for the melanocytic marker gp 100. None of the control lymph nodes from non-melanoma patients (n= 52) harbored gp 100 -positive cells. We analyzed gp 100 -positive cells from melanoma patients by comparative genomic hybridization and found, in 45 of 46 patients tested, gp 100 -positive cells displaying genomic alterations. At a median follow-up of 49 mo (range 3 - 123 mo), 138 patients (13. 4 %) had died from melanoma. Increased DCCD was associated with increased risk for death due to melanoma (univariable analysis; p< 0. 001; hazard ratio 1. 81, 95 % CI 1. 61 - 2. 01, for a 10 -fold increase in DCCD + 1). Even patients with a positive DCCD 3 had {{an increased risk of}} dying from melanoma compared to patients with DCCD= 0 (p= 0. 04; hazard ratio 1. 63, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 2. 58). Upon multivariable testing DCCD was a stronger predictor of death than histopathology. The final model included thickness, DCCD, and ulceration (all p< 0. 001) as the most relevant prognostic factors, was internally validated by bootstrapping, and provided superior survival prediction compared to the current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging categories. Conclusions Cancer cell dissemination to the sentinel node is a quantitative risk factor for melanoma death. A model based on the combined quantitative effects of DCCD, tumor thickness, and ulceration predicted outcome best, particularly at longer follow-up. If these results are validated in an independent study, establishing quantitative immunocytology in histopathological laboratories may be useful clinically. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary Editors' Summary Background Because the skin contains many different cell types, there are many types of skin cancer. The most dangerous typemelanomadevelops when mutations occur in melanocytes, the cells that produce the pigment melanin. Less than 5 % of skin cancers are melanomas, but melanoma causes most skin cancer deaths. Early signs of melanoma are a change in the appearance of a mole (a pigmented <b>skin</b> <b>blemish)</b> or {{the development of a new}} and unusual pigmented lesion. If these signs are noticed and the melanoma is diagnosed before it has spread from the skin into nearby lymph nodes and other tissues, surgery often provides a cure. For advanced melanomas, the outlook is generally poor, although novel therapies may prolong a patient's life. Why Was This Study Done? When a person is diagnosed with melanoma, it is important to stage the tumor. Knowing the extent and severity of the melanoma helps oncologists plan treatments and estimate their patients' likely outcomes. The detection of isolated melanoma cells in sentinel lymph nodes (the nodes to which cancer cells are most likely to spread from a primary tumor) is included in melanoma staging recommendations. However, finding rare tumor cells in sentinel lymph node biopsies by examining the tissue requires the analysis of many slides from each node removed from the patient and is extremely time-consuming. In this study, the researchers investigate the predictive value of a quantitative immunocytological assay that involves disaggregation of the sentinel node and detection of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) by immunostaining for gp 100 (a marker for melanoma cells). They also use this new assay to examine the effect of increasing numbers of DCCs on melanoma-specific survival. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers used routine histopathology and immunocytology to analyze 1, 834 sentinel lymph nodes from 1, 027 patients with melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at one German hospital. For immunocytology, the researchers recorded the number of gp 100 -positive cells per million lymph node cells (the DCC density). During follow-up, 138 patients (13. 4 %) died from melanoma. The results indicated that increased DCC density was associated with an increased risk of death due to melanoma. Specifically, every 10 -fold increase in DCC density + 1 was associated with a near doubling of the risk of death from melanoma (a hazard ratio of 1. 81). Even patients with three or fewer gp 100 -positive cells per million lymph node cells had an increased risk of dying from melanoma compared to patients with no gp 100 -positive cells (hazard ratio 1. 63). When other predictors of outcome such as age and primary tumor location were taken into account, DCC density was a stronger predictor of death than histopathology. Finally, a survival model that included tumor thickness, tumor ulceration, and DCC density provided survival prediction superior to that of a model based on the current standard staging recommendations. What Do These Findings Mean? These findings show that quantification of cancer cell dissemination from melanomas to sentinel lymph nodes is feasible and can be combined with other characteristics of the primary tumor to provide an accurate prediction of outcomes for individual patients with melanoma. Notably, the new prediction model identifies a group of patients at high risk of progression for whom the current clinical standard underestimates the risk of death. These patients may benefit from adjuvant therapies, so the new analysis presented in this study may help to stratify patients for clinical trials. Importantly, quantitative immunocytology and the new model, although internally validated in this study, need to be validated in an independent group of patients before they can be considered for routine clinical use. If external validation is successful, quantitative immunocytology, which is much less labor-intensive than histopathology, has the potential to change the routine clinical care of patients with melanoma and probably with other solid tumors, conclude the researchers.

Methods: An open-label, single arm study of healthy adults who had been previously diagnosed with mild to moderate acne vulgaris was performed. Subjects were asked to take the study agent, a dietary supplement containing pantothenic acid, for eight weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the feasibility of oral administration of the study agent in subjects over an eight week period. Safety and tolerability were measured utilizing the assessment of adverse events by the National Cancer Institute’s Common Criteria for Adverse Event Reporting. Secondary endpoints measuring the efficacy of an oral panthothetic acid dietary supplement for the treatment of mild to moderate facial acne utilized changes in the extent of global facial <b>skin</b> <b>blemishes,</b> assessment of quality of life utilizing the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and analysis of questions about the subject's beliefs and attitudes towards skin care and lifestyle. Results: Eleven subjects were enrolled and ten completed the study (90. 9 %). There were no reported adverse events. Of the 10 evaluable subjects, the average age (mean ± SD) was 31. 8 ± 8. Analysis of the global number of <b>skin</b> <b>blemishes</b> demonstrated a significant mean reduction in lesion count following the use of the study agent at week 8 (endpoint) (11. 18 ± 6. 38, p = 0. 02) compared to the average number of baseline blemishes (20. 45 ± 10. 44).

40|$|Significant {{interactions}} {{have been}} demonstrated between production factors and postharvest quality of fresh fruit. Accordingly, there is an attendant need for adaptive postharvest actions to modulate preharvest effects. The most significant preharvest effects appear to be mediated through mineral nutrition influences on the physical characteristics of fruit. Examples of specific influencers include fertilisers, water availability, rootstock, and crop load effects on fruit quality attributes such as skin colour, susceptibility to diseases and physiological disorders, and fruit nutritional composition. Also, rainfall before and during harvest can markedly affect fruit susceptibility to <b>skin</b> <b>blemishes,</b> physical damage, and diseases. Knowledge of preharvest-postharvest interactions can help determine the basis for variability in postharvest performance and thereby allow refinement of postharvest practices to minimise quality loss after harvest. This knowledge can be utilised in predictive management systems. Such systems can benefit from characterisation of fruit nutritional status, particularly minerals, several months before and/or at harvest to allow informed decisions on postharvest handling and marketing options.

Transgenic mice were generated using the keratin- 14 promoter/enhancer to direct expression of wild-type human CXCR 2 (K 14 hCXCR 2 WT) or mutant CXCR 2, in which the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) was truncated at Ser 331 and the dileucine AP- 2 binding motif was mutated to alanine (K 14 hCXCR 2 331 T/LL/AA/IL/AA). Our results indicate that K 14 hCXCR 2 WT transgenic mice exhibited a normal phenotype, while K 14 hCXCR 2 331 T/LL/AA/IL/AA transgenic mice were born with tails of normal length, but three to eight days after birth their tails degenerated, leaving only a short tail stub. The tissue degeneration in the tail started between caudal somites with degeneration of bone and connective tissue distal to the constriction, which was replaced with stromal tissue heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells. The tail lesion site revealed coagulation in enlarged vessels and marked edema that eventually led to loss of the distal tail. Moreover, 66 % of the mice exhibited focal <b>skin</b> <b>blemishes</b> and inflammation that exhibited {{an increase in the number}} of sebaceous glands and blood vessels, enlargement of the hair follicles due to increased number of keratinocytes, reduction in the connective tissue content, and a thickening of the epidermis. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of the epidermis from tail tissue in the transgenic mice indicated a loss of the cell adhesion markers E-cadherin and desmoplakin. These data suggest that keratinocyte expression of a CTD mutant of CXCR 2 has effects on homeostasis of the connective tissue in the tail, as well as the maintenance of the epidermis and its appendages...|$|R

40|$|In {{automatic}} fruit {{inspection and}} classification {{in real time}} modelling and segmenting the blemish from images and image sequences is an imperative pre-curser {{to a number of}} high-level computational tasks in computer vision such as fruit segmentation, identification and classification. This thesis investigates modelling methods and contributes new algorithms in this area. The research investigates advanced computer vision algorithms for fruit inspection and classification in real time. A new system architecture using advanced computer vision algorithms is introduced. The new methods with improve parameters of the existing industrial fruit sorters has increased their inspection and classification performance and ability. In general the fruits are classified for size, shape and <b>skin</b> <b>blemishes.</b> On the computer vision side the related methods include shape, surface and texture reconstruction form multiple views. On the pattern recognition side the methods applied include variety of neural networks including radial-basis functions and support vector machines. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a new and a capable classification method can be seen as substitute training technique for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptions classifiers. Support vector learning machines achieved high simplification ability by minimizing a bound on the expected test error; this new method has incorporated all known attributes, parameters, colour models, features and transformation of this invariance by applying transformations to support the vectors is achieved and tested for real-time application to allow fruit classification. This research work was supported in collaboration with the Industry Partner, Colour Vision Systems (CVS) and was funded and supported by Australian Research Council's (ARC) Discovery Projects funding scheme (project LP 0560847). All the fruit image data, company’s research facility was used and at our discretion to modify and calibrate and setup a test bed at the CVS company’s research centre. [Author edited abstract]...|$|R
40|$|Each year, the world’s top orange {{producers}} output {{millions of}} oranges for human consumption. This production {{is projected to}} grow {{by as much as}} 64 million in 2010 and so the demand for fast, low-cost and precise automated orange fruit grading systems is only deemed to become more increasingly important. There is however an underlying limit to most orange blemish detection algorithms. Most existing statistical-based, structural-based, model-based and transform-based orange blemish detection algorithms are plagued by the following problem: any pixels in an image of an orange having about the same magnitudes for the red, green and blue channels will almost always be classified as belonging to the same category (either a blemish or not). This however presents a big problem as the RGB components of the pixels corresponding to blemishes are very similar to pixels near the boundary of an orange. In light of this problem, this research utilizes a priori knowledge of the local intensity variations observed on rounded convex objects to classify the ambiguous pixels correctly. The algorithm has the effect of peeling-off layers of the orange skin according to gradations of the intensity. Therefore, any abrupt discontinuities detected along successive layers would significantly help identifying <b>skin</b> <b>blemishes</b> more accurately. A commercial-grade fruit inspection and distribution system was used to collect 170 navel orange images. Of these images, 100 were manually classified as good oranges by human inspection and the rest are blemished ones. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm using these images as the benchmarking test set. Our results show that the system garnered 96 % correctly classified good oranges and 97 % correctly classified blemished oranges. The proposed system is easily customizable as it does not require any training. The fruit quality bands can be adjusted to meet the requirements set by the market standards by specifying an agreeable percentage of blemishes for each band...|$|R
