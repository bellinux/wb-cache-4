25|$|The Adventures of Shuggy is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video game developed by <b>Smudged</b> Cat Games {{and published by}} Valcon Games. It was released June 15, 2011 for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade and was released for Microsoft Windows on June 13, 2012. It follows the vampire Shuggy as he seeks to rid his newly inherited mansion of its undesirable inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|László Bíró, a Hungarian {{newspaper}} editor {{frustrated by the}} amount of time that he wasted filling up fountain pens and cleaning up <b>smudged</b> pages, noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge free. He decided to create a pen using the same type of ink. Bíró enlisted the help of his brother György, a chemist, to develop viscous ink formulae for new ballpoint designs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{contention}} {{is that the}} Brown crime scene fingerprint has the appearance of having been rolled, which is the practice of taking a person's inked finger and rolling it on an index card, and not the <b>smudged,</b> bloody and unreadable print as originally reported. Traditionally, after the fingertip is covered in ink from either the suspect's hand being pressed {{on top of an}} ink pad or an ink roller being run across it, the finger is placed on the card on one edge. It is rolled once from one edge to the finger's other edge to produce a large, clear print.|$|E

50|$|<b>Smudge</b> {{then became}} a fixture of the museum, which sold <b>Smudge</b> {{merchandise}} including ceramic replicas designed by noted potter Margery Clinton. In the 1980s, <b>Smudge</b> {{became a member of}} the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Trade Union, after NALGO refused her admission as a blue collar worker. <b>Smudge</b> was used as a mascot by a number of campaigns including 'Save the Glasgow Vet School' (1989), 'Paws Off Glasgow Green' (1990). In 1987, <b>Smudge</b> disappeared for a number of weeks, but after a number of appeals including one by the Lord Provost of Glasgow, she was recovered.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason why}} he is called <b>Smudge</b> or Cascão is because he never takes a bath. <b>Smudge</b> hates water and never, ever touches it. <b>Smudge</b> {{is well known for}} being {{creative}} and having interesting ideas. He assists Jimmy Five in his 'Infallible Plans'.|$|R
25|$|While {{on their}} second road trip, Humbert becomes {{suspicious}} that a driver is following them. On one occasion, Humbert leaves Dolores in a Texas hotel to run errands. After returning, he discovers Dolores's hair is disheveled and her make up is <b>smudged.</b> He strongly suspects {{she has had}} sex with another man while he was out {{but he has no}} way to prove it. Later in the trip, Dolores falls ill and Humbert checks her into a hospital while he stays in a nearby motel. After several days, he contacts a nurse at the hospital to inquire about Dolores's condition. However, the nurse surprises him by saying her uncle has paid her bill, checked her out and has taken her to her grandfather's home. Humbert knows Lolita has no living relatives and immediately realizes something is very wrong. He embarks on a frantic search to find Dolores and her abductor but fails.|$|E
500|$|To give Pam {{the proper}} look, the makeup {{department}}, headed by Cheri Montesanto-Mecalf, applied mascara under Hamilton's eyes and then <b>smudged</b> it {{to give her}} a [...] "haunted" [...] look. Pam's stringy and multi-hued hairstyle was Hamilton's creation. Dena Green, the hair department head, was tasked with creating an exact wig replica to be worn by Hamilton's stunt double.|$|E
500|$|In {{the period}} {{preceding}} {{and following the}} release of Pornography, the band started to develop their trademark image of big hair, <b>smudged</b> makeup and black clothes. Smith applied lipstick smeared around the eyes and the mouth. Under the lights, the lipstick melted, making it look, as Smith later put it [...] "like we'd been smacked in the face". It was supposed to symbolise {{the violence of the}} new material but backstage, another kind of violence had begun to surface from the first dates of the tour.|$|E
5000|$|Dustine (Cascuda) - <b>Smudge's</b> girlfriend. Although she {{was created}} {{only to be}} <b>Smudge's</b> lover, he {{sometimes}} chases other girls.|$|R
50|$|The <b>smudge</b> attack {{relies on}} {{detecting}} the oily <b>smudges</b> {{left behind by}} the user's fingers when operating the device using simple cameras and image processing software. Under proper lighting and camera settings, the finger <b>smudges</b> can be easily detected, and the heaviest <b>smudges</b> can be used to infer the most frequent user input pattern (the password). The researchers were able to break the password up to 68% of the time under proper conditions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Smudge</b> {{left the}} People's Palace in 1990 with the {{departure}} of Elspeth King, the museum's curator. When Elspeth became director of Stirling's Smith Art Gallery and Museum, <b>Smudge</b> was called on again {{to deal with a}} rodent problem. <b>Smudge</b> died at her home in 2000 after a long illness.|$|R
500|$|The {{scene in}} the cafeteria, in which the four boys are annoyed by Pip, is a cut scene from the {{original}} version of the South Park pilot, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"; as such, the animation in that individual scene is actually traditional paper cutout stop motion, while the animation {{throughout the rest of}} the episode is done with computers. In order to illustrate the aftermath after the destruction scenes, Parker and Stone <b>smudged</b> the paper sets with their fingerprints and stains to make them look like scorch burns.|$|E
500|$|Bewick {{sometimes}} used his fingerprint {{as a form}} of signature, (accompanied by the words [...] "Thomas Bewick his mark"), as well as engraving it in one of his tail-pieces as if it had clouded the tiny image of a rustic scene with a cottage by mistake. Uglow notes one critic's suggestion that Bewick may have meant we are looking at the scene through a playfully <b>smudged</b> window, as well as drawing our attention to Bewick, the maker. Adrian Searle, writing in The Guardian, describes the tiny work as [...] "A visual equivalent to the sorts of authorial gags Laurence Sterne played in Tristram Shandy, it is a marvellous, timeless, magical joke".|$|E
500|$|The show is {{staged in}} what is {{described}} as an [...] "unapologetically low-tech" [...] manner. The play uses clothing {{as a metaphor for}} women's experiences. In addition to clothing, accessories such as a purse are important, and Charles Isherwood of The New York Times notes that when Ms. Ephron views a purse, [...] "In the chaos of its interior she sees a symbol of herself, as in a dark mirror <b>smudged</b> with old lipstick and smelling of spilled perfume." [...] The show consists of five women's monologues about wardrobe malfunctions, puberty's relationship with personal wardrobe, first date outfits, lucky underwear, prom dresses, favorite boots, irreplaceable shirts, the detested, disorganized purse, and experiences in the dressing room. The recollections about the clothing prompt the women's memories about their mothers, boyfriends, husbands, ex-husbands, sisters and grandchildren.|$|E
5000|$|The meal is {{prepared}} {{just in time}} for the arrival of Mr. <b>Smudge,</b> boss and customer. Chloe greets the guests as Smith whispers to <b>Smudge,</b> [...] "Psst, your cook left this morning." [...] <b>Smudge's</b> countenance drastically changes and is now in a dither about dinner; he knows how Chloe cooks.|$|R
5000|$|Dona Lurdinha (Mrs. Lurdinha) - <b>Smudge's</b> mother. Just {{like her}} husband, she tries hard to {{convince}} her son to take a bath, but the results are the same. She eventually tries to force <b>Smudge</b> to take a bath, using brute force, but there's always something to save <b>Smudge</b> from what he calls [...] "death".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Smudge</b> Bid: Some {{variations}} allow {{a special}} bid. If a player or team believes {{they can make}} every possible point, they may bid [...] "smudge." [...] In basic pitch, a <b>smudge</b> bid is a 5-point bid. In some variants, making <b>smudge</b> grants additional points. To make a <b>smudge</b> bid, a player or team must make all possible points and win every trick and capture the Jack of trumps. The bid must be made before the hand is played or the extra point is not awarded.|$|R
500|$|... "Microphone", the album's lead promotional single, was {{released}} on March 26, 2010. The song charted at 33 on Billboard's Japan Hot 100 and 10 on the RIAJ Digital Track Chart. The accompanying music video was shot in London. The music video continues from the [...] "Sexy Little Things" [...] video; it features Hamasaki in a grand hall, and {{in different parts of}} London. After the album's release, [...] "Don't Look Back", [...] "Sexy Little Things", [...] "Lady Dynamite", [...] "Count Down", [...] "Meaning of Love", and [...] "Last Links" [...] charted at: 20, 52, 66, 67, 49, and 50 on the RIAJ Digital Track Chart respectively. [...] "Don't Look Back", [...] "Sexy Little Things", and [...] "Lady Dynamite" [...] received music videos each. The video to [...] "Don't Look Back" [...] features Hamasaki at a dining table, with one half of her face done with make-up and the other side <b>smudged</b> with make-up; Hamasaki also poses in front of a ragged portrait of her album cover, [...] The video to [...] "Sexy Little Thing" [...] features Hamasaki inside a black and white room, dancing with Englishmen while wearing circus clothing; the ending scene includes the starting scene for the video [...] "Microphone". The video to [...] "Lady Dynamite" [...] has Hamasaki partying in a gay club with drag queens.|$|E
500|$|Greed {{received}} mostly negative reviews. The {{trade paper}} Harrison's Report said that [...] "f a contest {{were to be}} held to determine {{which has been the}} filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture {{in the history of the}} motion picture business, I am sure that Greed would win." [...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is <b>smudged</b> in." [...] A March 1925 review in Pictureplay magazine stated, [...] "perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Smudged</b> Cat Games started {{development}} on The Adventures of Shuggy shortly after Microsoft released the XNA framework, {{a set of}} tools that would allow individuals to program their own games for the Xbox 360. It was entered as a competitor in Microsoft's Dream.Build.Play competition, a program awards winning games with a publishing contract on Xbox Live Arcade and development funding to complete the game. The game made the top 20 contestants, but ultimately was not awarded a publishing contract. Later that year the developer {{signed a contract with}} Sierra Online. When Sierra Online's parent company, Vivendi Games, was acquired by Activision Blizzard Sierra was shut down, terminating the contract with <b>Smudged</b> Cat Games. Shuggy was later picked up by Valcon Games. It passed Microsoft's Xbox Live certification process on May 1, 2011 and was released on June 15, 2011. Programmer David Johnston stated that in retrospect he wishes he had not spent four years in development. [...] "On reflection, once I entered into Dream Build Play, I probably should have released it as soon as I could," [...] Johnston stated. [...] "It could have done with a bit of polish - but not three and half years’ worth." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Smudge</b> is {{surprised}} by the quality and taste of the courses Chloe has presented {{to him and his}} guests. Smith interjects that the entire course only cost <b>Smudge</b> a grand total of $2.83. As Penny secretly sneaks away, Smith also lies to <b>Smudge</b> saying Chloe cooked the entire meal herself. Of course, Chloe emphatically nods in agreement, much to her dog's disbelief.|$|R
5000|$|Seu Antenor (Mr. Antenor) - <b>Smudge's</b> father, an avid Corinthians {{supporter}} {{just like}} his son. He sometimes tries to convince his son to take a bath, with no results. He spends the weekends with <b>Smudge,</b> and sometimes with his friend Seu Cebola and Jimmy Five, and sometimes both Cebola and Antenor even force Jimmy and <b>Smudge</b> {{to do what they}} enjoyed when younger.|$|R
40|$|<b>Smudge</b> cells {{has been}} classically {{associated}} with {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL), but they are found in peripheral blood tests for other chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases (CLD). We investigated whether the percentage of <b>smudge</b> cells in peripheral blood smears {{can be used in}} the clinical practice to differentiate CLL from other B-cell CLD. The peripheral blood smears of 63 patients with the diagnosis of CLL and 62 with other B-cell CLD were analyzed. Three hundred cells (both lymphoid cells and <b>smudge</b> cells) were counted for each peripheral blood smear. A comparison of the percentage of <b>smudge</b> cells between the two groups was performed and, subsequently, 5 cut-off values were fixed (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of <b>smudge</b> cells) with the aim of defining cases as "positive" or "negative" for <b>smudge</b> cells and verifying whether there are any differences between CLL and the other B-cell CLD. The percentage of <b>smudge</b> cells in patients with CLL (median 26 %, 4 %- 86 %) was higher than in patients with B-cell CLD (median 14 %, 1 %- 64 %). However, none of the cut-off values tested presented suitable values of sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value to separate the two groups. As it is necessary to have a single cut-off value with high sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value to infer the diagnosis of CLL in the clinical practice, we concluded that <b>smudge</b> cells are not fitting to differentiate CLL from other B-cell CLD...|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, an {{exhibition}} of Twombly's paintings, Blooming, a Scattering of Blossoms and Other Things, and other works on paper from gallerist Yvon Lambert's collection, was displayed from June to September at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Avignon in Avignon. On July 19, 2007, police arrested Cambodian-French artist Rindy Sam after she kissed one panel of Twombly's triptych Phaedrus. The panel, an all-white canvas, was <b>smudged</b> by Sam's red lipstick and she was tried in a court in Avignon for [...] "voluntary degradation {{of a work of}} art".|$|E
2500|$|Latent prints may exhibit only a {{small portion}} of the surface of a finger and this may be <b>smudged,</b> distorted, {{overlapped}} by other prints from the same or from different individuals, or any or all of these in combination. For this reason, latent prints usually present an [...] "inevitable source of error in making comparisons", as they generally [...] "contain less clarity, less content, and less undistorted information than a fingerprint taken under controlled conditions, and much, much less detail compared to the actual patterns of ridges and grooves of a finger." ...|$|E
2500|$|The three {{signatures}} on {{the will}} were first reproduced by the 18th-century scholar George Steevens, {{in the form}} of facsimile engravings. The two relating to the house sale were identified in 1768, and the document itself was acquired by Edmond Malone. Photographs of these five signatures were published by Sidney Lee. The final signature was discovered by 1909 by Charles William Wallace. There is also a signature on the fly-leaf of a copy of John Florio's translation of the works of Montaigne, which reads [...] "Willm. Shakspere". This is no longer considered genuine, but was accepted by some scholars until the late 20th century. Another possibly authentic signature appears on a copy of William Lambarde's Archaionomia (1568). Though <b>smudged,</b> the spelling appears to be [...] "Shakspere".|$|E
50|$|Two of the watchmen who had lit <b>smudge</b> pots to {{keep away}} {{mosquitoes}} on their watch were immediately arrested. It {{soon became clear that}} the <b>smudge</b> pots had not caused the fire and that the blast had not been an accident.|$|R
50|$|<b>Smudge</b> pots {{were used}} by the Germans during World War II and by the North Vietnamese in their invasions of Laos during the Vietnam War to protect {{valuable}} targets. The oily black clouds of smoke produced from these <b>smudge</b> pots was intended to limit the ability to locate a target. In Vietnam, smoke from <b>smudge</b> pots {{was used as a}} defense against laser-guided bombs. Smoke would diffuse the laser beam and break the laser's connection with its intended target.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Smudge</b> was {{a little}} boy who {{described}} himself as 'the scruffiest boy in town and proud of it', relishing any opportunity to get filthy. His main rival was the snooty Percival Primm. Other characters in the strip included <b>Smudge's</b> Mum and over the years he had two different pets firstly a mouse and an animal of a never revealed although bipedal species (this is something of a running joke in <b>Smudge</b> strips) completely covered in mud and called Spludge.|$|R
2500|$|Until the 1980s, {{most large}} {{newspapers}} were printed with turn-of-the-century [...] "letterpress" [...] technology using easily <b>smudged</b> oil-based ink, off-white, low-quality [...] "newsprint" [...] paper, and coarse engraving screens. While letterpresses produced legible text, the photoengraving dots that formed pictures often bled or smeared and became fuzzy and indistinct. In this way, even when newspapers used photographs well— a good crop, a respectable size— murky reproduction often left readers re-reading the caption {{to see what}} the photo was all about. The Wall Street Journal adopted stippled hedcuts in 1979 to publish portraits and avoid the limitations of letterpress printing. Not until the 1980s did a majority of newspapers switch to [...] "offset" [...] presses that reproduce photos with fidelity on better, whiter paper.|$|E
2500|$|To promote [...] "New Year", a {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Alex Hamming and filmed in London, England. It was included on the song's CD release. The video is mainly black-and-white, but also features shades of pink and blue. During the video, the group's members sing {{in front of a}} white background, while computer graphics such as snow, letters and butterflies appear throughout. Other features in the video include a bird cage, stars and a calendar. Donaghy, Buena and Buchanan are shown both individually and collectively in the video; in some clips they are seated on chairs and against walls. The Daily Telegraphs Bernadette McNulty described their appearance in the clips, writing: [...] "The original trio sulk their way through the video in boot-cut jeans and <b>smudged</b> eyeliner".|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{negative}} reviews, Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert wrote: [...] "Tommy Boy {{is one of}} those movies that plays like an explosion down at the screenplay factory. You can almost picture a bewildered office boy, his face <b>smudged</b> with soot, wandering through the ruins and rescuing pages at random. Too bad they didn't mail them to the insurance company instead of filming them." [...] The film is on Ebert's [...] "Most Hated" [...] list. Caryn James of The New York Times wrote that the film was [...] "the very poor cousin of a dopey Jim Carrey movie". Owen Gleiberman graded the film a [...] "C" [...] on an A+ to F scale, and Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress said that it was [...] "nothing great." [...] Bo Derek was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.|$|E
40|$|Touch screens are an {{increasingly}} common feature on personal computing devices, especially smartphones, where size and user interface advantages accrue from consolidating multiple hardware components (keyboard, number pad, etc.) {{into a single}} software definable user interface. Oily residues, or <b>smudges,</b> on the touch screen surface, are one side effect of touches from which frequently used patterns such as a graphical password might be inferred. In this paper we examine the feasibility of such <b>smudge</b> attacks on touch screens for smartphones, and focus our analysis on the Android password pattern. We first investigate the conditions (e. g., lighting and camera orientation) under which <b>smudges</b> are easily extracted. In {{the vast majority of}} settings, partial or complete patterns are easily retrieved. We also emulate usage situations that interfere with pattern identification, and show that pattern <b>smudges</b> continue to be recognizable. Finally, we provide a preliminary analysis of applying the information learned in a <b>smudge</b> attack to guessing an Android password pattern. ...|$|R
50|$|Colored dye or <b>smudges</b> {{can affect}} the {{perceived}} color of a gem. Historically, some jewelers' diamonds were mis-graded due to <b>smudges</b> on the girdle, or dye on the culet. Current practice is to thoroughly clean a gem before grading its color as well as clarity.|$|R
