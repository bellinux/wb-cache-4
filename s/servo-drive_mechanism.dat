40|$|The {{electric}} discharge machining process is B very useful, economic and reliable process to machine extremely hard and brittle materials which cannot be machined {{by any of}} the conventional processes. It is based on the principle of erosion of metals by an interrupted electric spark. To ensure stable and effective machining, the spark-gap between the two electrodes (the tool and the work-piece) must be maintained at the desired level by servo-controlled electrode feed mechanism. The present paper reviews the various schemes for controlling the <b>servo-drive</b> <b>mechanism</b> for achieving better performance of the machining process...|$|E
