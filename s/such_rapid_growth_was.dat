40|$|Blue-flowered Conospermum are {{endemic to}} Western Australia, and show great {{potential}} as cut flowers. Propagation from cuttings or seed proved difficult, and root initiation in vitro is problematic. This thesis examines the floral biology {{of the species}} {{and the possibility of}} using somatic embryogenesis to overcome propagation problems. A survey of explant tissue types for C. eatoniae and C. caeruleum was carried out to identify tissue that could be induced into embryogenic pathways. Vegetative, semi-floral and floral buds were initiated into culture from February to June, but were found unsuitable for embryogenesis, producing shoots, callus or dying in culture. Leaves from in vitro leaf cultures formed callus in the presence of 2, 4 -D and BAP, but were unable to differentiate into embryos {{in the presence of a}} variety of growth regulator combinations and concentrations. Immature zygotes died in culture. Direct embryogenesis and/or embryogenic callus was observed on mature zygotes of the species C. caeruleum, C. spectabile, C. dorrienii and C. brownii, and somatic embryos were maintained in culture for up to 18 months for C. caeruleum. Maturation and germination of somatic embryos proved difficult; treatments of cold, ABA, desiccation or mannitol did not induce maturation. It appears that developmental pathways in Conospermum are well defined and are difficult to alter in vitro. It was concluded that somatic embryogenesis has limited commercial potential in these species. Conospermum species have an active pollination mechanism where the style is held in a state of tension when the flower opens. When pressure is applied at the base of the style by an insect, the style flicks downwards, striking the insect pollinator and releasing pollen from the anther in a single dusty mass. However, the breeding systems of blue-flowered Conospermum have not previously been well explored. Flowers on a C. eatoniae inflorescence opened from the basal end upwards acropetally, with the terminal two or three buds never opening. Fruit and seed set occurred only from the basal one to three buds. Isolation of C. eatoniae and C. amoenum flowers showed they were unable to self-pollinate in the absence of insect pollinators. Experiments to determine the timing of the peak of stigmatic receptiveness were inconclusive. Pollen germinated and penetrated the stigma 0 - 6 days after anther dehiscence. Pollen loads on the stigma did not relate to the number of pollen tubes observed down the style. Controlled pollinations of cultivated C. eatoniae at a field station using self and cross pollen, revealed compatibility with a range of pollen genotypes, as pollen tubes were observed extending down the style. However, late-acting incompatibility could not be ruled out as controlled crosses failed to set any seed as flowers were shed from the bush. DNA analysis of open pollinated C. eatoniae seed progeny from two plants from a field station and two plants in natural bushland revealed very different pollination habits. Plants from the field station showed no outcrossing, with progeny closely resembling the maternal parent, whereas plants from the wild population showed outcrossing with several different paternal parents. These results suggest self-pollinated seed can be reliably obtained in a plantation situation using stands of ramets of the same clone. Alternatively, assuming that the required insect pollinators are present in a cultivated stand, it should be possible to obtain cross pollinated seed by surrounding the maternal plant with the desired paternal parent. Unusual pollen behaviour was observed for many blue-flowered species, a white-flowered species of Conospermum, and close relative, Synaphea petiolaris. Up to three pollen tubes emerged from the triporate pollen in vitro, and at rates of up to 55 mcgms- 1. This rate was maintained for only 2 s but is greater than 20 times faster than reported in the literature for any species, in vitro or in vivo. Pollen with multiple tubes was also observed on the stigma in vivo in C. amoenum flowers. Changing the osmotic pressure of the germination medium by altering sucrose concentration influenced the number of tubes to emerge from the pollen grain; generally the number of tubes decreased as sucrose increased. However, the rate of tube growth was unaffected. The addition of calcium channel blockers to the germination medium had no effect on Conospermum growth rate, nor did they eliminate pulses of tube growth. Observation of Conospermum pollen ultrastructure revealed similarities to Gramineae pollen. The tube cytoplasm was packed with vesicles filled with material of similar electron density to the cell wall. Few golgi were identified, and the apical end of the tube contained these vesicles, smaller secretory vesicles and mitochondria. This is atypical of the tip, which is normally free of large vesicles. Distinct zones in the cytoplasm were not identified, which is similar to Gramineae. Like the grasses, Conospermum appears to pre-manufacture cell wall material and store it in vesicles ready for rapid germination and extension. A biological function of multiple pollen tube emergence with <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> not elucidated. This research has shown Conospermum to be a complex and very interesting genus. Further investigation into the remarkable growth of multiple pollen tubes would enhance our knowledge of the biological processes involved in tube growth and the process of fast wall formation. The potential benefits to the cut flower industry of commercialising some of these species warrants further effort to find an efficient method of propagation. Introduction into horticulture may be the only means by which these threatened species will survive...|$|E

40|$|Cities world-wide <b>are</b> {{experiencing}} <b>rapid</b> spatial <b>growth</b> {{and cities}} in the less developed countries are already accounting for more of this <b>growth.</b> If <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> unplanned and uncontrolled, it would have adverse {{effect on the environment}} and in most cases, vegetation is highly endangered. Such removal of vegetation cover causes great harm to the ecosystem and contributes greatly to the global warming effect. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze urban expansion and its impact on vegetation cover in Kaduna metropolis, Nigeria using geospatial techniques. Landsat MSS imagery of 1973, Landsat TM image obtained in 1990, Landsat ETM+ data of 2001 and Nigerian Sat- 1 image (2009) were used. Visual interpretation method was used to sort the various datasets into land use/cover classes. The built-up area and vegetation cover were extracted and the rates of change were ascertained for each of the landcover types. ILWIS 3. 3 software was used for the analysis. The results show that the built-up area increased from 14. 3 % in 1973 to 44. 1 % in 2009. The city was growing at the rate of 5. 72 % per annum within the period studied. Within the same period, 81. 8 % of the vegetation cover was lost at an annual rate of 2. 3 %. The regression analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between increase in built-up land and vegetation loss at 0. 175 significant level. The R value of 0. 825 and R 2 of 0. 680 suggests that 68. 0 % of the vegetation loss in the area was accounted for by built-up. At this rate of vegetation loss and urban expansion, the city may be stripped bare of almost all her vegetation cover within the shortest possible time if no adequate control measure is put in place. This paper recommends: i) the application of geospatial techniques for proper planning and development of Kaduna and other cities ii) proper monitoring of the pattern of urban expansion proper decision making on the planning process...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} several years, the field of data mining has been rapidly expanding, and {{attracting}} many new researchers and users.

For example, since late 1990 s, the number of expressways under PPP contracts, programmed in the Chinese National Expressway Network Plan (The 7918 Plan), has increased from 0 to 122 PPP contracts at present [6]. <b>Such</b> a <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> the result of the gap between public funding and actual project costs. Governments were hoping to seek more funding from private sector and meanwhile reallocate responsibilities of design, construction, operation, and maintenance by means of PPPs. At the same time, the trend towards PPPs in the provision and maintenance of infrastructure projects in the United States has been increasing mildly due to the strengths of financial and institutional arrangements that support the traditional procurement across the country. However, as the U.S. infrastructure system matured, the needs for repairing and expanding urban networks of roads, bridges, and tunnels have escalated beyond the fiscal and managerial capabilities of traditional procurement. This has led to an increasing willingness by infrastructure agencies at each government level to consider and in some cases apply alternative structures of public service delivery, including financing, contract delivery, and life-cycle preservation methods to leverage the scarce public resources.|$|R
40|$|Grid parity-reducing {{the cost}} of solar energy to be {{competitive}} with conventional grid-supplied electricity-has long been hailed as the tipping point for solar dominance in the energy mix. Such expectations {{are likely to be}} overly optimistic. A realistic examination of grid parity suggests that the cost-effectiveness of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems may be further away than many are hoping for. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness may not guarantee commercial competitiveness. Solar hot water technology is currently far more cost-effective than photovoltaic technology and has already reached grid parity in many places. Nevertheless, the market penetration of solar water heaters remains limited for reasons including unfamiliarity with the technologies and high upfront costs. These same barriers will likely hinder the adoption of distributed solar photovoltaic systems as well. The <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> in PV deployment in recent years is largely policy-driven and <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> would not <b>be</b> sustainable unless governments continue to expand financial incentives and policy mandates, as well as address regulatory and market barriers.

It tries to identify episodes of credit boom and analyzes the possible correlation between such booms, consumption booms and a country external account position. Estimating an aggregate consumption function, under the assumption of liquidity-constrained households, the paper finds that current trends in household credit markets largely reflect an equilibrium phenomenon, in which household credit increases rapidly from extremely low initial levels, {{in the context of}} a relaxation of liquidity constraints. The rate of growth of credit responds to changing market conditions on the supply side and to good prospects for income growth. In such an environment, loosening credit market conditions can have sizable effects on consumption, which, in some cases may create macroeconomic imbalances, both in terms of current account deficits and inflationary pressures. credit booms; household credit; new members of the European Union...|$|R

The site was notable for the nearby deposits of iron ore, coal and limestoneâ€”the three principal raw materials used in making steel. Its founders adopted the name of England's principal industrial city to advertise the new city as a center of iron and steel production.

40|$|High-speed rail (HSR) {{is drawing}} {{attention}} as an environmentally-friendly transportation mode, {{and is expected}} to be a solution for socio-technical transportation issues in many societies. Currently, its market has been rapidly expanding all over the world. In the US, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) released a strategic vision to develop new HSRs in 2008, specifically focusing on 10 corridors, including the Northeast Corridor (NEC) from Boston to Washington D. C. With <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth,</b> safety <b>is</b> a growing concern in HSR projects; in fact, there have been two HSR accidents over the past three years. In developing a new HSR system, it is crucial to conduct risk analysis based on lessons learned from these past accidents. Furthermore, for risk analysis of complex socio-technical systems such as HSR systems, a holistic system-safety approach focusing not only on physical domains but also on institutional levels is essential. With these perspectives, this research proposes a new system-based safety risk analysis methodology for complex socio-technical systems. This methodology is based on the system safety approach, called STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes). As a case study, the proposed HSR project in the NEC is analyzed by this methodology. This methodology includes steps of conducting STAMP-based accident analysis, developing a safety model of the HSR system in the NEC, and analyzing safety risks of it based on lessons learned from the analyzed accidents, with a specific focus on the institutional structure. As a result of this analysis, 58 NEC-specific risks are identified, and with them, weaknesses of safety-related regulations applied to the project are discussed. Additionally, this research introduces System Dynamics to analyze further detailed causal relations of the identified risks and discusses its potential usage for risk analysis. Thus, this thesis research concludes with specific recommendations about safety management in the project in the NEC, making a point that the proposed methodology can be valuable for the actual project processes as a "safety-guided institutional design" tool. by Soshi Kawakami.

50|$|The {{courthouse}} {{was completed}} in May 1887, although the first court was held there on 24 January 1887 reflecting {{the urgency of the}} need. The use of corrugated iron as wall cladding reflects local conditions where suitable timber was scarce and voracious termites made keeping buildings in good repair a constant problem. Croydon had the services of a visiting mining warden from Georgetown from 1886 and it was clear that provision would need to be made for an office in the town. It was common for wardens to have offices in the court building and soon after completion, the court was extended by adding offices for the Mining Warden and Registrar. This raised the final cost of the work to Â£2075. Additional cells and stables for police horses were added to the police reserve {{about the same time as}} the demand for police services grew. The district was first proclaimed the Division of Croydon (an early form of local government) in 1887/88 and declared a municipality in 1892. A new police barracks were built in 1896 and further cells in the following year. In the first ten years of its existence the population of the town had mushroomed and by 1897 Croydon had the third highest population in North Queensland after that of Townsville and Charters Towers. The police and court buildings and the town hall along the main street illustrate the way in which administrative services were provided for towns in <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> areas.1897 <b>was</b> also the year in which a disastrous fire that destroyed much of the town's centre possibly marked the beginning of a decline in its fortunes. Unlike Charters Towers, the Croydon field did not prove to have the deep reefs that would have provided work for large numbers and the population consequently fell. The district was redesignated as Shire of Croydon in 1903-1904 and by 1907 the field was considered to be effectively exhausted. The town became the centre of a pastoral district rather than a goldfield and by 1912 the gold warden's offices were being used by a surveyor and his assistant. Following World War I, when mining generally diminished and the price of gold dropped, it was obvious that the field would not recover. Mining came to a virtual stop by 1925. The last court was held in 1926 and rooms at the rear of the building were used for storage, though the Clerk of Petty Sessions maintained an office into the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the past}} three decades, since World War II, {{development}} has been viewed as an important goal of national life {{for the poor and}} rich nations alike. The emerging nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America have come to see development as a continuation of the struggle that has won them independence. Development of these nations is thus often associated with the ever continuing struggle to remain free from alien domination. The post World War II era was consequently characterized by an active pursuit of economic development. As the LDC's plunged into planning for development, the developed nations while pursuing their own goals have shown an even greater tendency and preparedness to assist the low income countries attain their goals of improving the conditions of life {{for the majority of the}} poor who seem to have been bypassed by the progress thus far achieved. Tremendous progress has been made over the past quarter century for virtually all the less developed countries incomes have risen faster than population with a consequential rise in per capita income. <b>Such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> has <b>been</b> accompanied by dramatic expansion of education systems, growing literacy, improvements in nutrition and health, increasing technological sophistication and structural changes including a growing industrial base and urbanization. A great deal however still remains to be done. While incomes have risen, the available empirical evidence suggests that a large number of people in the LDC's remain inadequately fed or malnourished, poorly housed and poorly clothed and not provided with adequate medical care. Furthermore many of these countries have not yet completed the transition to modern economies and societies and their growth and development continues to be hampered by a variety of both domestic and international factors. For many people in the LDC's there has been little or no improvements in living standards while for others their living standard may even have deteriorated. However, there has been a growing awareness and agreement that <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> and the alleviation or elimination of poverty are inextricably intertwined and that development objectives should focus on <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> as well as the reduction of the number of people in abject poverty. The record over the past two decades suggests that most countries in the underdeveloped world have either moved or are moving towards these objectives in designing their development strategies. The obstacles to development in the LDC's are neither homogenous nor of the same magnitude or degree and the diversity of development obstacles reflects differential endowment with respect to natural resource availabilities, economic structure, social and political institutions, managerial and technical skill availability as well as their relationship with the international economy. With average income per capita hovering around $ 250 per annum, alleviation or elimination of poverty will increasingly have to focus on seeking to raise the level of output from agriculture, increase the productivity of both land and labor, create jobs and thus curb unemployment and raise the wages paid to labor. These tasks are not at all easy and there is a growing awareness that twenty-five years is not long enough to warrant high expectations especially when viewed against the background that most of the countries in Africa attained the status of nationhood in the 1960 's. Since a greater proportion of the population of the LDC's live in the countryside with agriculture as the main source of income and sustenance, greater attention will have to be given to programs that seek to improve the productivity and profitability of the operations of these people.

40|$|Defending Australia costs $ 80, 281, 391. 78 per day, {{finds this}} report which about the complex {{workings}} of the Defence Budget. Executive summary This yearâ€™s federal budget was dominated by budget repair. Yet amid the spending cuts and tax increases, Defence did very well. Nominal defence spending will grow by $ 2. 3 billion next financial year (2014 - 15) to $ 29. 3 billion, representing 1. 8 % of GDP. In real terms, the year-on-year increase amounts to a 6 % boost. The increase would have been larger still but for extra funding provided for the current year (2013 - 14) by the Gillard ($ 359 million) and Abbott ($ 500 million) governments in response to mounting funding pressures. Critically, this yearâ€™s budget establishes a credible base from which the government can deliver its promise to spend 2 % of GDP on defence by 2023 - 24. Key initiatives in this budget included the shifting of $ 2 billion of funding previously planned for 2017 - 18, of which $ 1. 5 billion was brought forward to address immediate pressures, and $ 520 million was deferred until 2019 - 20 and 2020 - 21. By doing so, near-term budget pressures have been reduced and the medium-term funding profile has been smoothed. Funding was also provided to reintroduce the ADF gap-year program ($ 192 million) and provide more generous indexation arrangements for some legacy military superannuation schemesâ€”each an election pledge made good. At the same time, the existing defined benefit military superannuation scheme is being closed to new entrants and a new accumulation scheme introduced. Despite a promise of â€˜no further cuts to Defence spendingâ€™, an increase to the efficiency dividend on non-operational areas will see $ 75 million returned to Treasury over four years. Next yearâ€™s boost to defence spending was not entirely, or even predominately, the result of funds brought forward by the new government. The previous government had already budgeted for a substantial recovery in defence spending in 2014 - 15. Setting aside automatic supplementation for foreign exchange movements and operational costs, and allowing for the additional funds provided by the previous government mid-year, this governmentâ€™s first budget only boosted the GDP share in 2014 - 15 from 1. 78 % to 1. 80 % of GDP. In fact, the largest contributions to the result relative to the estimate from May 2013 were slower than expected nominal GDP growth leading to a 0. 05 % increase in the defence GDP share and foreign exchange supplementation leading to a 0. 04 % increase. Nonetheless, the government clearly demonstrated {{a strong commitment to}} defence in the 2014 budget; every extra dollar allocated to Defence meant deeper cuts to social programs and higher increases to taxes than would have otherwise been the case to achieve its fiscal goals. Over the next three years, defence spending is slated to remain largely steady in real terms before jumping up in the fourth year. Because the economy is expected to grow in the intervening period, on current plans the share of GDP will decline to 1. 75 % in 2017 - 18. Defence will face two challenges over the next several years; accommodating <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> in capital investment, and rebuilding ADF numbers after three successive years of unplanned decline. Recent cuts to defence spending fell disproportionately on the capital investment program. So although total spending will only rise in real terms by around 6 % next year, investment in new equipment will grow from $ 3. 6 billion this year to $ 6. 1 billion. Experience shows that <b>such</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>growth</b> will <b>be</b> very difficult to achieve. Hopefully, the relatively large number of off-the-shelf purchases in the portfolio will lessen the challenge. But even if money is handed back, itâ€™ll have been worth the risk to regain momentum in the investment program. On the personnel front, the size of the permanent ADF has fallen {{three years in a row}} despite attempts otherwise. Several factors are likely at play, including a higher than anticipated separation rate and overly conservative recruiting targets. Given the stubborn persistence of the problem, it may be that Defenceâ€™s workforce analysis and planning capability needs a revamp. Finally, and as usual, this yearâ€™s budget announced yet another round of savings and efficiencies. According to the budget night press release; â€˜$ 1. 2 billion in back office savings over the Forward Estimates will be reinvested into Defence capabilityâ€™. So the good news is that funding will not be lost. However, looking to the Treasury Papers for more detail, it turns out that the savings include a delayed investment in military accommodation ($ 300 million), reduced Smart Sustainment initiatives ($ 64 million) and reduced use and support of military trucks ($ 60 million). In terms of what might be labelled â€˜back officeâ€™, civilian numbers will fall by 1, 200 and thereâ€™ll be 300 fewer service provider staff ($ 606 million), although the latter does not accord with figures given elsewhere for the contractor workforce. Again, as usual, weâ€™ve been given an incomplete and confusing picture of whatâ€™s happening with internal savings...|$|R
