500|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{outgoing}} Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric (GE), researches company Kabletown (which {{recently purchased}} the NBC network as a charitable, tax-deductible act), {{to find a}} way he can contribute in the corporation's development. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) lets it slip that he may have been living forever, when he shows concern that Kabletown may impose new rules for [...] "age limits and age verification" [...] for pages. A former colleague, Dave Hess (Scott Bryce), who left NBC for Kabletown, reveals that Kabletown's success comes from running pay-per-view adult channels; the company runs [...] "the perfect business" [...] and needs no investment in new <b>services</b> <b>or</b> <b>products.</b> On learning this, Jack is horrified at the prospect of no longer making things. Later, however, while giving a eulogy at former GE CEO Don Geiss's (Rip Torn) funeral, he has an epiphany and proposes to Kabletown executives that they produce [...] "porn for women" [...] (specifically, channels featuring attractive men who [...] "listen" [...] while women blather on).|$|E
2500|$|Most dot-com {{companies}} operated at a {{net loss}} to harness network effects to build market share or mind share as fast as possible, using the mottos [...] "get big fast" [...] and [...] "get large or get lost".

2500|$|For example, in the United States, class {{lawsuits}} sometimes bind all {{class members}} {{with a low}} settlement. These [...] "coupon settlements" [...] (which usually allow the plaintiffs to receive a small benefit such as a small check or a coupon for future <b>services</b> <b>or</b> <b>products</b> with the defendant company) are a way for a defendant to forestall major liability by precluding {{a large number of}} people from litigating their claims separately, to recover reasonable compensation for the damages. However, existing law requires judicial approval of all class action settlements, and in most cases class members are given a chance to opt out of class settlement, though class members, despite opt-out notices, may be unaware of their right to opt out because they did not receive the notice, did not read it, or did not understand it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of divisional structure {{is that it}} uses delegated authority so the performance can be directly measured with each group. This results in managers performing better and high employee morale. [...] Another {{advantage of}} using divisional structure {{is that it is}} more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions, and there is more flexibility to respond when there is a change in the market. Also, a company will have a simpler process if they need to change the size of the business by either adding or removing divisions. When divisional structure is utilized more specialization can occur within the groups. When divisional structure is organized by product, the customer has their own advantages especially when only a few <b>services</b> <b>or</b> <b>products</b> are offered which differ greatly. When using divisional structures that are organized by either markets or geographic areas they generally have similar function and are located in different regions or markets. This allows business decisions and activities coordinated locally.|$|E
