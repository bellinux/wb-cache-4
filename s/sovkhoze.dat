50|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{situation}} in Ukraine, the central grain collection plan was lowered by 18.1%, {{in comparison to the}} 1931 plan. Kolkhozes were expected to harvest 4,751.2 thousand tons, with the peasants responsible for 1,080.1 thousand tons. <b>Sovkhozes</b> were to submit 475,034 tons. In addition Ukrainian kolkhozes and <b>sovkhozes</b> were to return 132,750 tons of grain which had been provided in spring 1932 as aid.

50|$|After grain {{collection}} {{difficulties in}} 1927 and 1928, Stalin ordered {{the creation of}} state grain and meat enterprises - <b>sovkhozes</b> - which, accordingly to his initial vision, should deliver more than 100 million of poods of grain in 1932. However, in 1932 their production results were disastrous because of poor general and agricultural management and planning, despite the significant (as compared to kolkhozes) amount of modern agricultural mechanisms (agricultural tractors, harvesters, etc.) employed. But the biggest reason was that they continually seed wheat from 1929 on the same areas and even without fertilizers. <b>Sovkhozes</b> also suffered {{from a lack of}} manpower and infrastructure (roads, elevators etc.). Losses during harvesting were extremely high.Thus despite an expected 290 millions of poods (more than 5 million tons) in 1932, <b>sovkhozes</b> produced 5 time less, while the situation with livestock was even worse.

50|$|Agriculture was {{organized}} {{into a system}} of collective farms (kolkhozes) and state farms (<b>sovkhozes).</b> Organized {{on a large scale}} and highly mechanized, the Soviet Union was one of the world's leading producers of cereals, although bad harvests (as in 1972 and 1975) necessitated imports and slowed the economy. The 1976-1980 five-year plan shifted resources to agriculture, and 1978 saw a record harvest followed by another drop in overall production in 1979 and 1980 back to levels attained in 1975. Cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, and flax were also major crops.|$|R
50|$|Azeris {{living in}} rural {{parts of the}} country were mainly engaged in {{agriculture}} and animal husbandry in kolkhozes and <b>sovkhozes,</b> as well as small-scale trade and industry. Farmer unions were assigned relatively small units of land, which, however, gave more output than most state-owned lands elsewhere in Georgia. Factors such as fertile land, proximity of the capital city and easy access to major Soviet markets allowed Azeri farmers to enjoy relatively prosperous lives, according to Soviet standards. Azeris also occupied many top posts in local governments across Kvemo-Kartli.|$|R
50|$|Approaches to {{changing}} from individual farming to a collective type of agricultural production had existed since 1917, but {{for various reasons}} (lack of agricultural equipment, agronomy resources, etc.) were not implemented widely until 1925, {{when there was a}} more intensive effort by the agricultural sector {{to increase the number of}} agricultural cooperatives and bolster the effectiveness of already existing <b>sovkhozes.</b> In late 1927, after the XV Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, then known as the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), a significant impetus was given to the collectivization effort.|$|R

2500|$|In November 1929, the Central Committee {{decided to}} {{implement}} accelerated collectivization {{in the form}} of kolkhozes and <b>sovkhozes.</b> This marked the end of the New Economic Policy (NEP), which had allowed peasants to sell their surpluses on the open market. [...] Stalin had many so-called [...] "kulaks" [...] transported to collective farms in distant places to work in agricultural labor camps. In response to this, many peasants began to resist, often arming themselves against the activists sent from the towns. As a form of protest, many peasants preferred to slaughter their animals for food rather than give them over to collective farms, which produced a major reduction in livestock.|$|R
40|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, a large number of collective farms (kolkhozes and <b>sovkhozes)</b> were transformed into agricultural production co-operatives. After two decades, most of these production co-operatives are still in operation. Although they face problems as regards e. g. wage levels, profitability and productivity, they are strong in many regions of the Russian Federation and within many types of crops. The continued existence of such agricultural production co-operatives puzzles many Western economists. This paper attempts to provide an explanation in terms of the history of Russian co-operatives in the agricultural sector and of the institutional settings, i. e. the legal and administrative environment of the cooperatives...|$|R
50|$|Land {{in rural}} areas was allotted for housing and some {{sustenance}} farming, and persons had certain rights to it, {{but it was not}} their property in full. In particular, in kolkhozes and <b>sovkhozes</b> there was a practice to rotate individual farming lots with collective lots. This resulted in situations where people would ameliorate, till and cultivate their lots carefully, adapting them to small-scale farming, and in 5-7 years those lots would be swapped for kolkhoz ones, typically with exhausted soil due to intensive, large-scale agriculture. There was an extremely small number of remaining individual farmsteads (khutors хутор), located in isolated rural areas in the Baltic states, Ukraine, Siberia and cossack lands.|$|R
50|$|Such {{approach}} notwithstanding, the sovkhoz was {{a success}} and enjoyed growth throughout the Soviet period, providing a regular salary from the state to its employees from the very start, granting considerable purchasing power in local stores and allowing the local population out in the tundra the chance to purchase new furniture and even television sets. Unlike in kolkhozes, where farmers spent {{a certain amount of}} time working on plots of land allocated to them, this practice was not so common in <b>sovkhozes,</b> and the population of Snezhnoye, despite their ability to use the local shops, supplemented their diet by foraging in the tundra for berries and wild mushrooms.|$|R

5000|$|The theory behind {{collectivization}} included {{not only}} {{that it would be}} socialist instead of capitalist but also that it would replace the small-scale unmechanized and inefficient farms that were then commonplace in the Soviet Union with large-scale mechanized farms that would produce food far more efficiently. Lenin saw private farming as a source of capitalist mentalities and hoped to replace farms with either sovkhozy which would make the farmers [...] "proletarian" [...] workers or kolkhozy which would at least be collective in nature. However, most observers say that despite isolated successes, collective farms and <b>sovkhozes</b> were inefficient, the agricultural sector being weak throughout the history of the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{agricultural}} production cooperative in Cuba is UBPC - Unidad Básica de Producción Cooperativa (Basic Unit of Cooperative Production). The law authorizing the creation of UBPCs was passed on 20 September 1993. It {{has been used to}} transform many state farms into UBPCs, similar to the transformation of Russian <b>sovkhozes</b> (state farms) into kolkhozes (collective farms) since 1992. The law granted indefinite usufruct to the workers of the UBPC in line with its goal of linking the workers to the land. It established material incentives for increased production by tying workers' earnings to the overall production of the UBPC, and increased managerial autonomy and workers' participation in the management of the workplace.|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from plan to market during the 1990 s radically changed the agricultural employment patterns in Russia. The number of employed in large corporate farms (former kolkhozes and <b>sovkhozes)</b> declined dramatically, and rural labour shifted {{in large numbers}} to individual farming, including traditional household plots and emerging peasant farms. Household plots are becoming increasingly polarized between commercially oriented operations, which may employ some hired help, and subsistence operations, which continue to provide a safety net and employment of last resort to the rural population. The article describes the magnitude {{and the consequences of}} these transition-related changes and develops some policy recommendations.

The rapid rate of growth of agricultural production is possible thanks to the vast superiority of the socialist economic system, the growing might of Soviet Industry, which is supplying kolkhozes and <b>sovkhozes</b> with machinery and all other material and technical equipment. ...|$|R
