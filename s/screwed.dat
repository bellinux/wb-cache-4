5|$|Placement of the implant: The implant screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then <b>screwed</b> into place with a torque controlled wrench at a precise torque {{so as not to}} overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{stimulus}} evoked electromyography (EMG) {{is commonly}} used to confirm the accuracy of pedicle <b>screw</b> placement. There are no studies to differentiate between solid <b>screws</b> and hollow <b>screws</b> to the electrical resistance of pedicle <b>screws.</b> We speculate that the electrical resistance of the solid and hollow pedicle <b>screws</b> may be different and then a potential source of error with stimulus-evoked EMG may happen. Materials and Methods: Resistance measurements were obtained from 12 pedicle <b>screw</b> varieties (6 <b>screws</b> of each manufacturer) across the <b>screw</b> shank based on known constant current and measured voltage. The voltage was measured 5 times at each site. Results: Resistance of all solid <b>screws</b> ranged from 0. 084 Omega to 0. 151 Omega (mean = 0. 118 +/- 0. 024 Omega) and hollow <b>screws</b> ranged from 0. 148 Omega to 0. 402 Omega (mean = 0. 285 +/- 0. 081 Omega). There {{was a significant difference}} of resistance between the solid <b>screws</b> and hollow <b>screws</b> (P < 0. 05). The <b>screw</b> with the largest diameter no matter solid <b>screws</b> or hollow <b>screws</b> had lower resistance than <b>screws</b> with other diameters. No matter in solid <b>screws</b> group or hollow <b>screws</b> group, there were significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the 5. 0 mm <b>screws</b> and 6. 0 mm <b>screws,</b> 6. 0 mm <b>screws</b> and 7. 0 mm <b>screws,</b> 5. 0 mm <b>screws</b> and 7. 0 mm <b>screws,</b> 4. 5 mm <b>screws</b> and 5. 5 mm <b>screws,</b> 5. 5 mm <b>screws</b> and 6. 5 mm <b>screws,</b> 4. 5 mm <b>screws</b> and 6. 5 mm <b>screws.</b> The resistance of hollow <b>screws</b> was much larger than the solid <b>screws</b> in the same diameter group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Hollow pedicle <b>screws</b> have the potential for high electrical resistance compared to the solid pedicle <b>screws</b> and therefore may affect the EMG response during stimulus-evoked EMG testing in pedicle <b>screw</b> fixation especially in minimally invasive percutaneous pedical <b>screw</b> fixation surgery.

Created by Munir Ali in 1464, the Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 300 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation.

5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is <b>screwed</b> on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel <b>screwed</b> {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator.

5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is <b>screwed</b> down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E

30|$|Burghardt et al. {{proposed}} two {{modifications in}} order to avoid hardware failure. The first is to apply two TBPs side by side and the second is to use solid <b>screws</b> rather than cannulated <b>screws</b> [10]. Solid <b>screws</b> are stronger and bear the mechanical stresses more than cannulated <b>screws</b> [12]. The mechanical strength of a <b>screw</b> depends on the core diameter.
