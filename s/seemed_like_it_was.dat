25|$|In early 2011, Vinnie Paz {{announced}} on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn {{is due to}} be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} Jerry-centered episode arose {{when the}} writers decided one of the {{characters}} would get mugged. Muharrar said, [...] "Once we thought about it, it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for Jerry's revenge." [...] Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and that Jerry does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur said once it was established in the episode [...] "Practice Date" [...] that Jerry was the co-worker everyone else picked on, he felt it was important to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense.|$|E
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the series, Rey {{appearances}} changes drastically. These changes <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{coming from}} the merge between Rey and the Pasa sword's demon spirit, but also something deep within Rey is slowly surfacing.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a {{combination}} of pyromania and bad behavior that initiates fire setting. Fire setting among children and teens can be recurring or periodic. Some children and teens may set fires often to release tension.|$|R
500|$|Mars {{had been}} filming the music video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] as he {{announced}} on his Twitter account, on October 2, 2013. He said [...] "Sorry i've been M.I.A, I was shooting a music video. #WinkWink #FRIKIKIKIKI #BangBang Wait {{till you see}} this". It was directed by Mars' himself and regular collaborator Cameron Duddy. On October 10, 2013 it was announced on Bruno Mars' official website, {{leading up to the}} release of the video, the unveil of teasers every day via Mars' Instagram account. The teasers included a car parked in front of a strip club, a reptile, and an angry boss played by Luis Guzmán. Duddy along with Mars sought to create [...] "more than a standard strip-club video" [...] by researching and going into strip clubs to appreciate the architecture of the local. Nevertheless, the search for the ideal strip club was fruitless, so Mars and Duddy decided to build one: [...] "a joint that <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> lifted straight out of Havana, dark and sweaty and seemingly untouched by time. They painted the walls themselves, and went back and forth on just what color neon they should use". When the time came to cast someone to play a stripper, the only name was Freida Pinto's one. However, Duddy had some doubts her choice, since he considered her [...] "safe". To this, Mars replied [...] "it's important to use someone who hasn't been seen in this light before". All in all, Duddy confessed that he trusted Mars instincts regarding Pinto's choice for the role. Duddy explained that some scenes recorded for the video were dangerous. Pinto could have harmed herself in the scene where [...] "she sheds her clothes among a sea of sparks", as well as Mars' guitar player [...] "He got dangerously close to having his head burned". Muriel Villera starts as one of the jealous strippers. The official music video was set to premiere on October 14, 2013. Nevertheless, its release was delayed one day by Mars himself stating [...] "I want it to be the best it can be. With that being said, I need one more day". The video, finally arrived on October 15, 2013 exclusively via Facebook.|$|E
2500|$|That {{was what}} we liked to call a [...] "pay the rent" [...] job. It wasn't a script I liked, but I {{remember}} my agent at the time saying, [...] "Look, {{you only have to}} work two weeks, and they're going to pay you a lot of money. We'll just say it was your first movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I wasn't on the movie the whole time, but it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a mess. Like, when I'd go, I'd think--I like to make a movie where I know who the boss is. I like a big boss. I like a real director. And it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just, [...] "Who's driving the ship here? What's going on?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Kyle MacLachlan says Dylan McDermott was {{the first}} choice for the {{character}} of Zack Carey, but he declined and MacLachlan was then cast. The actor later recalled, [...] "That was a decision {{that was sort of}} a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly Robocop, which I loved. I look back on it now and it’s a little dated, but it’s still fantastic, and I think it’s got some of the great villains of all time in there. It was Verhoeven and [...] Eszterhas, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be kind of dark and edgy and disturbing and real." ...|$|E
50|$|Corman did {{not want}} the film to <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done in the Philippines so he had Curtis Hanson shoot an opening {{sequence}} in Los Angeles where Pat Anderson jumped in a taxi cab driven by Dick Miller.|$|R

5000|$|Abdul {{criticized the}} way the program's {{segments}} were edited. She explained, [...] "That {{was hard for me}} to watch. Disturbing. They’d put a camera on me when I got wind that my dog was in a coma, and they’d make <b>it</b> (<b>seem)</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about hair and makeup." ...|$|R
2500|$|Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels {{first met}} and {{struck up a}} {{friendship}} when they both competed for the National Wrestling Alliance's Central States Wrestling territory in Kansas City in 1985. Initially they would only travel together (along with Dave [...] "D.J." [...] Peterson) since Jannetty was either teaming with Tommy Rogers (better known as Tommy Lane of the Rock 'n' Roll RPMs) as the Uptown Boys, or he was teaming with Central States booker ”Bulldog” Bob Brown. After the team of Jannetty and Brown broke up Michaels and Jannetty started teaming up, although they were not given a team name. On May 15, 1985 Michaels and Jannetty defeated The Batten Twins (Brad & Bart) to win the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship. Their first title reign was short-lived as the Batten Twins regained the title only a week later on May 22, 1985. Shortly after the team lost the CSW tag team title, Michaels left Kansas City and the NWA, {{and returned to his}} homestate of Texas to work for Texas All-Star Wrestling. In TASW Shawn began teaming with Paul Diamond as ”American Force” and the team of Jannetty and Michaels <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never meant to be a permanent thing.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 and 2008, {{there were}} no Trans-Am Series races of any kind, and for a while, it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the end of the}} Trans-Am Series, but that would soon change.|$|E
5000|$|Over time, we’ve {{seen more}} people {{assume that they}} are Google's opinion, or that Google has hand-coded the results for these Google-bombed queries. That's not true, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth trying to correct that misperception.|$|E
5000|$|Fantastic Movie Musings & Ramblings wrote, [...] "the {{violence}} is a bit nastier than that of RAIDERS, and the script <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> thrown together without much care, but I rather like the British soldier who is paired with the hero. Still, this one is routine at best." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{river is}} named [...] "Aibiki" [...] (roughly {{translating}} as [...] "mutual pulling") because both its source and its mouth {{are in the}} Seto Inland Sea. During low tide, the river flows towards both the mouth and the origin, making <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> being pulled both ways.|$|R
5000|$|Oggs Cruz from Rappler {{states in}} his review that [...] "At first, 1st Sem <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all about jokes and punch lines.

5000|$|The {{show has}} been {{described}} as [...] "Destination Truth mixed with MythBusters". A Variety magazine review says - [...] "Now we know what Fox Mulder would have done after leaving [...] "The X-Files" [...] unit: Get his own reality-TV show!" [...] Will Wade of Common Sense Media said the squad <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> selected for the skill set rather than their readiness for TV.|$|E
5000|$|... "Heaven" [...] by The Walkmen {{features}} in the final scene of [...] "Last Forever". Gowan said that [...] "it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written for our show".

5000|$|Others {{felt that}} the use of celebrities diminished the {{relevance}} of the message; Roisin Donnelly of Procter & Gamble commented: [...] "In this print campaign, the celebrities, complete with injuries provided by the make-up artist, do get attention, but it <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a trick just to get attention, and was focused more on the celebrity and fake make-up rather than the central issue of domestic violence." ...|$|E

"Ultimately, the Anywhere Festival {{is about}} {{entertainment}} and theatre but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also about encouraging businesses {{to engage with}} their community in a new way", says co-founder and creative producer, Alex McTavish."

5|$|There {{was some}} criticism, {{as well as}} confusion, {{regarding}} {{the title of the}} film. Many reviewers, including James Rolfe, felt that it should have officially been titled Rocky VI, and that simply adding his last name to the end made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a remake of the original film rather than a sequel.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} Steve Leggett states, [...] "Byard was a jazz player by trade, but {{his real}} allegiance {{was to the}} piano itself, and few players have brought so much variety out of the instrument and still made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all cut from the same elegant and comfortable cloth. All of that is on display here".|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Trans List", Mac {{describes}} his life before transitioning genders. [...] "I really don't know why I {{was waiting for}} so long," [...] Mac says. [...] "It <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> no longer an option for my sanity or for my health. I had to stop {{spending so much time}} trying to cover up my emotions and my problems, and I had to deal with myself." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{had never}} seen {{anything}} like it, in terms of narrative structure, characters, the character's point of view, all the pop culture references and humor. It <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> coming from my own sensibility... though the world of Pulp Fiction is so fantastic and obviously not my world, it felt like these were characters who were speaking from the perspective of people in your world. And I don't know that a movie has done that since.|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} season of episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer were produced, Noxon's agent {{encouraged}} her to watch them and try to take meetings and get on the show. Noxon was skeptical as she wasn't wowed by the concept, and knew the original film hadn't done well. After watching the initial episodes, she realized she loved the show, but was already booked to work on The Pretender, which was picked up to air, so <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a more safe bet.|$|E
500|$|Judicial Investigation Police {{were unable}} to {{immediately}} determine a motive for Mora's death. Lizano suspects poachers were involved, saying Mora was targeted for protecting the turtle nests. [...] Chacón said drug traffickers, who often are also poachers, were likely behind the killing. Given Mora's recent calls for police help, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an act of revenge", he said.|$|R

5000|$|Lakeshore Records issued soundtrack albums {{for both}} the {{featured}} music and original score. The soundtrack also got a special collector's edition vinyl designed by Los Angeles-based creative services company iam8bit to create [...] "something that <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an artifact from the seventies" [...] and also [...] "drew from the fictional world of the movie and give you something tactile you can hold in your hand", with the gatefold being a 3D centerfold of Misty Mountains, and the packaging including posters of Sid Shattuck films and a business card for The Nice Guys Agency.|$|E

50|$|At {{first it}} <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be}} another dark day for Nebraska in Minneapolis, the site of so many severe drubbings, as Minnesota took the early lead. As the clock wore on, however, the Golden Gophers began to stall, and the Cornhuskers {{capitalized}} to go up 13-12 by the half. Minnesota came out flat after the break and never scored again, as Nebraska punched in another 19 points to secure an unexpected and long-sought victory over their main northern rival. It was only the 6th win that the Cornhuskers had earned over Minnesota in 36 attempts dating back to 1900.|$|E
5000|$|This essay {{begins with}} a {{discussion}} of Simone de Beauvoir’s account of women’s existence as constrained. Young believes that de Beauvoir neglected some important aspects and made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> women’s bodies, their anatomy, that determine their being unfree. The female body then becomes something to transcend, or break free from, rather than something that people recognize is in fact conditioned to <b>be</b> the way <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R
50|$|The actor {{worked very}} intensively, making four movies per year, {{which led to}} nervous {{breakdowns}} and health problems. In 1929 he committed suicide which became a great shock for everyone. As Lev Kuleshov wrote, «Fogel, mercilessly overloaded with uninteresting work, became schizophrenic and committed suicide. <b>Seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an inherited illness. His brother, a flying ace, ended similarly: he jumped out of a plane after setting a flight altitude record».|$|R
