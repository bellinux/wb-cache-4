40|$|Relaying is an {{effective}} technique to achieve reliable wireless connectivity in harsh communication environment. However, most of the existing relaying schemes are based on relays with fixed locations, or <b>static</b> <b>relaying.</b> In this paper, we consider a novel mobile relaying technique, where the relay nodes {{are assumed to be}} capable of moving at high speed. Compared to <b>static</b> <b>relaying,</b> mobile relaying offers a new degree of freedom for performance enhancement via careful relay trajectory design. We study the throughput maximization problem in mobile relaying systems by optimizing the source/relay transmit power along with the relay trajectory, subject to practical mobility constraints (on the relay speed and initial/final relay locations), as well as the information-causality constraint at the relay owing to its decode-store-and-forward (DSF) strategy. It is shown that for fixed relay trajectory, the throughput-optimal source/relay power allocations over time follow a "staircase" water filling (WF) structure, with non-increasing and non-decreasing water levels at the source and relay, respectively. On the other hand, with given power allocations, the throughput can be further improved by optimizing the relay trajectory via successive convex optimization. An iterative algorithm is thus proposed to optimize the power allocations and relay trajectory alternately. Furthermore, for the special case with free initial and final relay locations, the jointly optimal power allocation and relay trajectory are derived. Numerical results show that by optimizing the trajectory of the relay and power allocations adaptive to its induced channel variation, mobile relaying is able to achieve significant throughput gains over the conventional <b>static</b> <b>relaying.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures, submitted for possible journal publication...|$|R

We show that, in dynamic relaying the optimal strategy to minimize the average end-to-end bit error rate is a threshold rule on the instantaneous SNR of the source-relay channel. In this case, the optimal threshold value is a function of average SNR of relay-destination and source-destination channels.

Methods of model interface are classified as playback or open-loop simulation, and real-time or closed-loop simulation. This paper presents an implementation of the current differential relay and the directional comparison relay using EMTP MODELS based on closed-loop simulation tools. Because EMTP MODELS is a PC-based closed-loop simulation tool, simulation can be tested dynamically, and also the cost is low.

40|$|The {{communication}} link between a tactical mobile robot and its control station {{is currently the}} Achilles ’ heel of any ground robotic operation in the field. High-bandwidth digital radios, while providing the robot greater mobility than tethered links, perform mostly on lines of sight. The {{communication link}} degrades quickly as a robot penetrates {{the interior of a}} building, tunnel, or cave, or is shielded by intervening structures. We have demonstrated a solution to this problem through the use of autonomous mobile relay nodes. Each node is a small robot carrying a high-bandwidth digital radio. The relay robots convoy behind the main robot {{at the start of a}} mission, and automatically stop where needed to form an ad hoc network guaranteeing a link between the lead robot and the base station. This is accomplished without the need for an operator’s intervention. The relay robots ’ mobility allows for even more versatility in the network.

40|$|Privacy, {{including}} the right to privacy of correspondence, is a human right. Privacy-enhancing technologies, such as the Tor anonymity network, help maintain this right. The increasing use of Tor from mobile devices raises new challenges for the continued effectiveness of this low-latency anonymity network. Mobile Tor users may access the Internet from a range of wireless networks and service providers. Whenever a wireless network hands-off a mobile device’s connection from one access point to another, its external Internet Protocol (IP) address changes, and the connection to the Tor network is dropped. Every dropped connection requires the Tor circuit to be rebuilt. The time required to rebuild the circuit negatively impacts client performance. This research is the first to highlight this negative impact and to investigate the likely extent of the impact for typical usage scenarios and mobility models. The increased network churn caused by circuit rebuilding also negatively impacts anonymity. A novel metric (q-factor) is proposed here to measure the trade-off between anonymity and performance over the duration of a communication session. Two new solutions to the problems of managing mobility in a low-latency anonymity network are proposed in this thesis. The first solution relies on adaptive client throttling, based on a Kaplan-Meier estimator of the likelihood of a mobile network hand-off. The second solution relies on the use of a <b>static</b> bridge <b>relay</b> (mBridge) that acts as a persistent ‘home’ for a mobile Tor connection, so avoiding the need to recreate the Tor circuit whenever the mobile device is handed-off. The effectiveness of these solutions has been measured using the new q-factor metric. Both solutions provide better performance for mobile Tor clients than the standard Tor client implementation, although some performance reduction by comparison with static Tor clients remains. The bridge relay solution (mBridge) has been shown to offer better performance than client throttling, but is more vulnerable to certain types of attack. A strength of both solutions is that changes are restricted to client devices, the existing algorithms and protocols of the interior Tor network are unaffected...|$|R

Technical constraints push researchers and operators to provide solutions allowing users to acquire high performances independently of their geographical distance from Base Station (BS). In addition to the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology, relays are among the principal features of the fourth generation (4 G) wireless systems. Relaying technologies, inspired from ad hoc multihop networks, are currently receiving much attention to improve cellular network’s performance where bandwidth and power are limited. Instead of deploying BS, relay stations become a solution to reduce high deployment cost and can provide capacity and coverage comparable to small cells. Relaying data aims to upgrade user’s performance especially in cell border where users suffer from large signal attenuation. Relaying topology and behavior are standardized in both long term evolution (LTE) Advanced [1] and International Mobile Telecommunication Advanced (IMT-Advanced).

40|$|Diversity-multiplexing {{trade-off}} {{has been}} studied extensively to quantify the benefits of different relaying strategies in terms of error and rate performance. However, even {{in the case of}} a single half-duplex relay, which seems fully characterized, implications are not clear. When all channels in the system are assumed to be independent and identically fading, a fixed schedule where the relay listens half of the total duration for communication and transmits the second half combined with quantize-map-and-forward <b>relaying</b> (<b>static</b> QMF) is known to achieve the full-duplex performance [1]. However, when there is no direct link between the source and the destination, a dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF) strategy is needed [2]. It is not clear which one of these two conclusions would carry to a less idealized setup, where the direct link can be neither as strong as the other links nor fully non-existent. In this paper, we provide a generalized diversity-multiplexing trade-off for the half-duplex relay channel which accounts for different channel strengths and recovers the two earlier results as two special cases. We show that these two strategies are sufficient to achieve the diversity-multiplexing trade-off across all channel configurations, by characterizing the best achievable trade-off when channel state information (CSI) is only available at the receivers (CSIR). However, for general relay networks we show that a generalization of these two schemes through a dynamic QMF strategy is needed to achieve optimal performance.
