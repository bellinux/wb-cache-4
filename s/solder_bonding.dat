40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The durability and lifetime of photovoltaic (PV) modules {{is one of the}} chief concerns for an industry which is rapidly approaching maturity. Guaranteeing the economic viability of potential PV installations is paramount to fostering growth of the industry. Whilst certification standards have helped to improve the reliability of modules, with a significant reduction in early failures, long-term performance degradation and overall lifetimes are yet to be addressed in a meaningful way. For this, it is necessary to quantify the effects of use-environment and module design. Long-term degradation of the <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> in PV modules causes steady power loss and leads to the generation of more devastating, secondary mechanisms such as hot-spots. Whilst <b>solder</b> <b>bond</b> degradation is well-recognised and even tested for in certification protocols, the potential rate of degradation is not well understood, particularly with respect to different environmental conditions and material selection. The complex nature of a standard silicon PV module construction makes it difficult to observe the stresses experienced by the various components during normal operation. This thesis presents the development of a finite-element model which is used to observe the stresses and strains experienced by module components during normal operating conditions and quantifies the degradation of <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> under different environmental conditions. First, module operating temperatures are examined across a range of climates and locations to evaluate the thermal profiles experienced by modules. Using finite-element techniques, the thermomechanical behaviour of modules is then simulated using the same thermal profiles and a quantification of <b>solder</b> <b>bond</b> degradation potential in each location is achieved. It is shown that hot climates are responsible for the highest degradation potential, but further to this, hot environments with many ii clear sky days, allowing for large swings in module temperature, are significantly more damaging. A comparison is drawn between indoor accelerated stress procedures and outdoor exposure, such that an equivalence between test duration and location-dependent outdoor exposure can be determined. It is shown that for the most damaging climate studied, 86 standard thermal cycles is appropriate for one-year of outdoor exposure whereas the least damaging environment would require 11 standard thermal cycles. However, these conclusions may only be applicable to the specific module design which was modelled as the material selection and interaction within a device {{plays a major role in}} the thermomechanical behaviour and degradation potential. In addition to a study on the influence of use-environment, a study on the influence of the encapsulating material is conducted with a particular focus on the effects of the viscoelastic properties of the materials. It is shown that the degradation of <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> can vary depending on the encapsulating material. Furthermore, the intended use-environment could inform the selection of the encapsulating material. The temperature-dependency of the material properties means that some materials will mitigate thermomechanical degradation mechanisms more than others under certain conditions i. e. hotter or colder climates...|$|R

The microstructure and thermal aging characteristics of <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> of crystalline silicon solar cells are investigated, whereby two solders, Sn 60 Pb 40 and a lead-free, low melting point alternative Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 are considered. <b>Solder</b> <b>bonds</b> of front side busbars are formed with a semi-automatic tool and cross sections are prepared, which are characterized with confocal laser microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDX). The kinetic of IMC growth is modeled with a diffusion model, and the parameters are obtained with systematic thermal aging studies and the Arrhenius relationship. The model is capable of processing non-isothermal temperature profiles and is used to simulate IMC growth during PV module reliability tests like thermal cycling 600 (TC) and damp heat for 3000 h. Furthermore, the thicknesses of the IMCs are estimated for a PV module in an outdoor location. It is found that solder joints undergo strong ripening processes during thermal aging. In particular, Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 solder joints show faster IMC growth, grain coarsening and Sn-penetration into the busbar than Sn 60 Pb 40 bonds. Sn-penetration is observed already in the as-soldered condition and EDX confirms the existence of significant amounts of diffused Sn around cavities in the busbar. Large portions of the busbar are consumed by the Ag 3 Sn IMC after 155 h at 130 °C and further aging of the Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 joint leads to Bi segregation and, in some cases, complete depletion of Sn from the solder matrix. The simulation of IMC growth shows a final IMC thickness after TC 600 of 1. 2 7 ̆fm and 1. 5 7 ̆fm; furthermore, a thickness after 3000 h at 85 °C of 2. 6 7 ̆fm and 3. 7 7 ̆fm respectively for Ag 3 Sn in Sn 60 Pb 40 and Ag 3 Sn in Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 bonds.

40|$|Interconnects in microelectronic {{packages}} and devices {{serve as the}} mechanical and electrical connections as well as thermal paths for heat dissipation. Miniaturization of electronic devices demands very high density interconnects and <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> {{with only a few}} microns of stand-off height. Although Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are essential to form a reliable joint, large volume ratios of IMCs can be degrading to long term reliability. At very small joints, the volume of IMCs becomes significant, and in some cases, joints may completely transform to IMCs. Furthermore, small joints experience anisotropy {{due to the fact that}} all compositions may only contain a few grains. However, very few studies have been conducted to analyze the effect of the IMCs thickness and anisotropy on the mechanical behavior of <b>solder</b> <b>bonds.</b> In this work, these effects are studied through a combination of experiments and finite element simulations. Traditionally, regular finite element (FE) modeling techniques have been used to simulate the solder joints. However, in order to evaluate joint with only a few grains, a more sophisticated modeling of elastic and plastic behavior of grains is needed through crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) modeling. In this study, CPFE is used to model all materials including solder, IMCs, and Cu in joints with different IMC thicknesses. Nanoindentation experiment on single grains of IMCs and CPFE simulation of the same were combined to obtain slip system parameters of IMCs that are necessary constants for CPFE modeling. Furthermore, the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis was used to determine the preferred grain growth orientation of Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC on polycrystalline Cu substrate. A lap-shear experiment was designed and conducted to investigate the effects of the different volume fraction of IMCs on the shear behavior of micro-scale solder joints with a 50 µm stand-off height. The local strain was measured using a micro-scale Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. This experiment was used to determine the local and global stress-strain behavior of these joints. The joints were tested to failure, and fractography was conducted to determine the failure modes and failure sites. Comparison between experiment and modeling shows that the CPFE models are successful in capturing the local mechanical behavior of the <b>solder</b> <b>bonds.</b> CPFE models are observed to be more efficient in predicting the local plastic deformation behavior of micro-scale bonds with few grains than the regular FE analysis. Simulation results show that the overall stress distribution and shear deformation changes as the IMC thickness increases. Stiffer response and higher shear yield strength are seen as the IMC thickness increases for both simulation and experiment results. Also, the stress-strain distributions observed in the CPFE analysis performed to mimic the experiment gave a clear idea of the locations of the possible failure sites. Fractography shows failure mode changing from ductile to brittle where crack propagation path is modulated by the different volume fraction of IMCs. A significant influence of Cu 3 Sn/Cu 6 Sn 5 interfacial morphology on the ultimate shear strength at a higher volume fraction of IMC samples was observed during the lap-shear experiment where planar interfacial morphology promoted lower ultimate shear strength. The effect of different interfacial morphologies on the shear behavior was verified using CPFE simulation. Calculation of the fatigue life indicates that high volume fractions of IMCs could degrade fatigue life of the <b>solder</b> <b>bonds...</b>|$|R

Cylindrical compound samples (Ø 10 mm × 56 mm) made of alumina toughened zirconia (ATZ), as well as titanium grade 5, were bonded by glass solder on their end faces. As a control, a two-component adhesive glue was utilized. The samples were investigated without further treatment, after 30 and 90 days of storage in distilled water at room temperature, and after aging. All samples were subjected to quasi-static four-point-bending tests. We found that the glass <b>solder</b> <b>bonding</b> provided significantly higher bending strength than adhesive glue bonding. In contrast to the glued samples, the bending strength of the soldered samples remained unaltered by the storage and aging treatments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses confirmed the presence of a stable solder-ceramic interface. Therefore, the glass solder technique represents a promising method for optimizing dental and orthopedic implant bondings...|$|E
40|$|For high {{temperature}} interconnection sintered silver can be used, however, it induces new {{demands on the}} thermo-mechanical design. That issue requires knowledge on the thermo-mechanical reliability of silver sintered devices, {{the subject of this}} paper. Material characteristics of the sinter layers are needed for simulation, which are addressed {{in the first part of}} the paper. Based on material properties of pure silver, for sintered silver with different porosities effective material characteristics have been derived by use of a micromechanical cell model. Shear loadings with in-situ deformation analyses have also been made to investigate sintered silver behavior. A complicated dependence on processing, temperature, and deformation rate is seen. Based on different effective constitutive models for the sintered interconnects, stress loadings are studied for a power module, an IGBT on DCB substrate, for passive and active thermal cycling. For the passive cycle complex interactions of the different layers of the stack are observed, which are not seen in a module with soft <b>solder</b> <b>bonding.</b> This result can be attributed to the missing decoupling by the soft soldering layer. Failure risks are evaluated by both conventional FEA and cohesive zone modeling. A quite different stress situation is depicted for active power cycling. The situation is even more complex and it is obvious from the simulations, that active power cycling can induce failure modes different from passive cycling...|$|E
40|$|This paper details an {{investigation}} into the appearance of hot-spots in two large grid-connected photovoltaics (PV) plants, which were detected after the visual inspection of trackers whose energy output was decreasing at anomalous rate. Detected hot-spots appeared not only in the solar cells but also in resistive <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> (RSB) between cells and contact ribbons. Both types cause similar irreversible damage to the PV modules, but the latter are the main responsible for the detected decrease in energy output, which was confirmed in an experimental testing campaign. The results of this investigation, for example, how hot-spots were detected or their impact on the output power of PV modules, may be of interest for the routine maintenance of large grid-connected PV plants...|$|R
40|$|Intermetallic {{compounds}} (IMC) in soldered interconnections {{influence the}} reliability of PV modules. Thus, the microstructure of solar cell interconnections {{and the growth of}} IMCs are to be investigated in this paper. Sn 60 Pb 40 and Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 are chosen as alloy coatings of copper interconnectors and semi-automatically soldered to screen-printed front Ag-busbars of industrial mono-crystalline solar cells. The microstructure of the <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> is characterized with metallographic cross sections and confocal laser microscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy and electron dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The cross section samples are isothermally aged between 85 °C to 150 °C and for 15 hour to 155 hour to obtain the kinetic parameters of a diffusion-based growth model of the IMCs. The model is used to estimate the IMC thickness after 3000 h at 85 °C, and after 600 thermal cycles as well as after 25 years in the outdoor location Freiburg, Germany. It is found that extensive microstructural changes take place within the <b>solder</b> <b>bonds</b> during thermal aging. Grain coarsening within the solder matrix, in particular for Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 solders, is observed, which can lead to an entire Sn depletion of the solder matrix. Moreover, non-uniform Sn penetration and IMC growth at cavities and lead-glass particles of the busbar are observed for both solders, which is discussed in terms of its effect on metallization adhesion. Eventually, simulating the IMC growth for 3000 h at 85 °C forecasts a 3. 7 μm thick Ag 3 Sn IMC at the busbar for the Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 solder compared to 2. 6 μm for Sn 60 Pb 40. The prognosis of the IMC thickness after 25 years in Freiburg yields an Ag 3 Sn thickness of 1. 3 μm for Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2...|$|R
40|$|Ball {{shear test}} {{is the most}} common test method used to assess the {{reliability}} of bond strength for ball grid array (BGA) packages. In this work, a combined experimental and numerical study was carried out to realize of BGA solder interface strength. <b>Solder</b> mask defined <b>bond</b> pads on the BGA substrate were used for BGA ball bonding. Different bond pad metallizations and solder alloys were used. Solid state aging at 150 degC up to 1000 h has been carried out to change the interfacial microstructure. Cross-sectional studies of the solder-to-bond pad interfaces was conducted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer to investigate the interfacial reaction phenomena. Ball shear tests have been carried out to obtain the mechanical strength of the solder joints and to correlate shear behaviour with the interfacial reaction products. An attempt has been taken to realize experimental findings by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). It was found that intermetallic compound (IMC) formation at the solder interface {{plays an important role in}} the BGA <b>solder</b> <b>bond</b> strength. By changing the morphology and the microchemistry of IMCs, the fracture propagation path could be changed and hence, reliability could be improve...|$|R
