25|$|Roughly {{one third}} of the {{population}} are highly susceptible to motion sickness and most of the rest may get motion sickness under extreme conditions. Several factors influence susceptibility to motion <b>sickness.</b> <b>Statistics</b> indicate that {{women are more likely to}} be affected than men and that the risk decreases with advancing age. There is some evidence that people with Asian ancestry get motion sickness more frequently compared with people of European ancestry, and there are situational and behavioral factors, such as whether a passenger has a view of the road ahead, and diet and eating behavior.|$|E
40|$|In Austria, {{a decline}} in the number of persons on sick leave can be {{observed}} over the medium as well as long term. This trend is accompanied by a shortening of average sick spells and an increase in short-term sick leaves. At the same time, a shift can be found in the ranking of causes – thus injuries are down while mental problems are on the rise. Underlying these trends are developments caused by structural change, reflected foremost in the sectoral and occupational structure of the labour market. As is indicated by the accidents at work example, the greater prevalence of high-skilled white-collar occupations and the shifting of labour-intensive production with its inherent health-related risks to third countries have had a positive impact on <b>sickness</b> <b>statistics.</b> As a result, the gap between sick leave spells among blue- and white-collar workers is diminishing. Such structural aspects are overlaid by institutional as well as economic cycle and economic policy changes. The high fluctuation of sick leave rates among older workers signals that the modes of transition used between employment, unemployment and retirement are of great importance for sick leave figures.

40|$|Aim and questions: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the {{responsibilities}} employers have for rehabilitation and to explore how it conforms to an employers' actual condi-tions. Furthermore, the intention is to increase knowledge of how employers interact with other partners in the rehabilitation process and what affects sick people to return to work. The following three questions form the basis of this paper: What are employers’ responsibilities for rehabilitation under the law and how is it consistent with an employer's actual conditions? What is the role of employers in the rehabilitation co- operation with other actors? What factors influence sick people to return to work? Method: The paper has used a true scientific and a legal sociological method to examine how the regulated employer responsibility for rehabilitation relates to what is practical in re-ality. To achieve the purpose, four empirical interviews were conducted with Örebro Municipality, Insurance, occupational health Previa and a doctor, which all of them have an important role in the rehabilitation process. The interviewees received questionnaires in advance so they knew what was requested. Results: Sickness absence rates increased in Sweden during 2000 -´s which has brought more attention to rehabilitation. Previous research shows that a dysfunctional workplace often has more sick leave than a well-functioning workplace and that employer’s incentives to improve working conditions differ. Employers have statutory occupational health and rehabilitation responsibilities, but the question is how it is fulfilled? The results show that Örebro Municipality has several documents that describe how they should proceed with their occupational health and rehabilitation work, and that they have introduced a so called health package. It is hoped that this preventative approach will lead to a reduction in <b>sickness</b> absence. The <b>statistics</b> also show that the proportion of long-term sickness has subsided, which they among other things think may be due to the rehabilitation chain introduced in 2008 with fixed time limits. Conclusion: Prevention and health promotion is essential to reduce the risk of sick leave and that earlier rehabilitation measures, the better. The rehabilitation chain has led to an earlier and more structured rehabilitation program and that more cases of illnesses are concluded more quickly. However, the rehabilitation interaction needs further improvement, in hopes that ongoing efforts will bring...|$|R
