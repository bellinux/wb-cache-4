The writer does this study by asking the subjects to retell the Indonesian folk story, titled Sangkuriang, in English. Finally, the writer finds out that the good <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking VI use more Conceptual Strategies and use fewer Linguistic Strategies than the poor <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking VI do. In addition, the good <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking II also use more Conceptual Strategies and use fewer Linguistic Strategies than the poor <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking II while the poor <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking II almost use Conceptual and Linguistic strategies equally. Then both the good <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking VI and Speaking II use more Conceptual Strategies than both the poor <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking VI and Speaking II do. However, the <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking II tend to use Borrowing Strategy while the <b>students</b> <b>of</b> Speaking VI tend to use Literal translation Strategy. These differences possibly mean that different quantity of linguistic knowledge; different characteristics of learning that the good and the poor students have, and different distance of their L 1 with L 2 between the high semester and low semester students have may cause differences in the use of Compensatory Strategies...|$|R
