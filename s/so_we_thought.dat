But 20th Century Fox was really keen; our producer was really keen. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> OK, we'll write the script. And after three months, we fell {{madly in love with}} the script. Unfortunately, Fox did not.|$|E

Her husband, {{property}} developer Rod Weston, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's almost our silver anniversary <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we had better get on with it".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Scott {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as Jim Moriarty in [...] "The Great Game". Moffat said, [...] "We knew {{what we wanted to}} do with Moriarty from the very beginning. Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> someone who was genuinely properly frightening. Someone who's an absolute psycho." [...] Moffat and Gatiss were originally not going to put a confrontation between Moriarty and Holmes into these three episodes, but realised that they [...] "just had to do a confrontation scene. We had to do a version of the scene in 'The Final Problem' in which the two archenemies meet each other." ...|$|E

500|$|The album did not chart {{as well in}} the United States as its predecessor, peaking {{at number}} 148 on the Billboard 200. It was, however, the band's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We thought we had a lotta songs that should've been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> since our music was doin' something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened was we were so alien that no one wanted to touch us. And so we wouldn't get played" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{initial set}} release date was late 2004, {{and the band}} had to delay the album to January 2005. But as the new target date was approaching, the band again {{discarded}} songs, which they deemed [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "passionless". Sixty songs were written during these sessions, fifty-two of which were ditched. The band started rehearsing the songs for a planned tour, but felt the songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions: [...] "We realized that we didn't really have the right songs {{and some of them}} were starting to sound better because we were playing them than they did on record, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we better go back and record them again." [...] Guitarist Jonny Buckland has said that the band had pushed themselves [...] "forward in every direction" [...] in making the album, but they felt it sounded like they were going backwards compared to their earlier works.|$|E
500|$|The title {{sequence}} of SpongeBob {{for the special}} was made exclusively for the series' tenth anniversary. It was animated in stop motion animation, with Cee Lo Green performing the theme. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan of Screen Novelties animated its opening titles. Finnegan claimed that the crew were [...] "thrill" [...] to do the title sequence because [...] "the original title sequence is so recognizable and everyone seen {{it over and over}} and it's so great in its own way." [...] Executive producer and the episode's writer Paul Tibbitt said [...] "We don't just want to redraw it , {{we want it to be}} something special and different <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we would do it in three dimensions" [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson lauded the new title sequence and said it is [...] "SO great!" [...] Some traditional animation on scraps of brown paper are intermixed into the stop motion.|$|E

"Well, Cheviot {{wanted me}} to send up for him at dinner-time," [...] said Harry; [...] "for {{as soon as we}} sat down in the hall, June turned off giddy, and could not stay, and looked <b>so</b> horrid, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was all over with him, and {{he would not be able}} to go up at all." ...|$|R

500|$|Following {{a scratch}} match {{at the start}} of the 1859 {{football}} season, the Melbourne Football Club officially came into being on 14 May. Three days later, Wills and three other members—Hammersley, journalist J. B. Thompson and teacher Thomas H. Smith—met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, to devise and codify the club's rules. The men went over the rules of four English schools; Hammersley recalled Wills' preference for the Rugby game, but it was found to be confusing and too violent. Subsequently, they rejected common features such as [...] "hacking" [...] (shin-kicking) and produced a signed document listing ten simple rules suited to grown men and Australian conditions. Heading the list of signatories, Wills, too, saw the need for compromise. He wrote to his brother Horace: [...] "Rugby was not a game for us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> differently." [...] Thompson and Hammersley's promotion of the new code, together with Wills' star power, encouraged the spread of football throughout Victoria.|$|E
500|$|The band {{began working}} on the track in 2011, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "We {{recorded}} {{a little bit in}} Louisiana with the Haitian percussionists [...] and we kind of lived with that. It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have a listen to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{concluded}} the North American [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] {{leg of the}} tour on 25 November 1992, leaving them with a six-month break before the tour resumed in Europe in May 1993 with the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg. Rather than use the time to rest, lead vocalist Bono and guitarist The Edge were keen to record new material. Following a hectic year of touring, the two {{did not want to}} settle back into domestic life. Bono said, [...] "We thought we could live a normal life and then go back on the road [...] But it turns out that your whole way of thinking, your whole body has been geared toward the madness of Zoo TV... So we decided to put the madness on a record. Everybody's head was spinning, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> why not keep that momentum going...?" [...] The Edge also wished to distract himself from the emotions he was feeling after separating from his wife during the Achtung Baby sessions in 1991. The other members, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., ultimately agreed to join them for recording.|$|E

500|$|While El Broide of People Magazine {{wrote that}} the single is {{performed}} in English and French, website Aficia's Valentin Malfroy noted that Spanish is also incorporated, also pointing out a male voice providing vocals for the refrain sung with a strong African accent. However, {{in an interview with}} Romanian station Kiss FM, Inna explained that the chorus is written in a language created by her and her label Global Records, further stating that, [...] "At Global Records, we stay so much together that we don't understand ourselves in Romanian, but also not in any other language. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> to create an own language. If the ones from Game of Thrones can do it, then why can't we do it as well?" [...] People Magazine called the track a [...] "catchy" [...] tropical house song that [...] "effortlessly blends together" [...] tropical sounds with a Middle Eastern flair, along with [...] "simple and cheesy" [...] lyrics. Jonathan Currinn from Outlet Magazine labelled [...] "Heaven" [...] an [...] "exotic anthem", while Urban.ro called it a dance-pop song with exotic elements. Radio 21 noted that the track seemed to be influenced by Arabic rhythms.|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{originated}} when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, [...] "We {{had a lot}} of {{luck with}} Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, so maybe we could look to other commandments. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Honor the Sabbath' would be a good one. So the 'Homer doesn't go to church' storyline was given to George Meyer." [...] Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would [...] "bring the proper degree of rage" [...] to the episode. Meyer {{had a lot of}} fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it was almost as if Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.|$|E

2500|$|Inside Higher Ed {{noted that}} the U.S. News is {{entering}} into the international college and university rankings area that is already [...] "dominated by three major global university rankings": the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities, and the QS World University Rankings.

Having sex is an activity where we clearly show our true natures. Examining the relationships between men and women is one of the best ways to show the essence of human beings. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that by working with the theme of sex, we could explore ourselves more deeply and express the very core of the world."

2500|$|Hangshing said, [...] "And {{we found}} that the stories, the customs and {{practices}} of the Israeli people were very similar to ours. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that we must be one of the lost tribes." [...] After making contact with Israelis, they began to study normative Judaism and established several synagogues. Hundreds of Mizo-Kuki-Chin emigrated to Israel. They were required to formally convert to be accepted as Jews, because their history was not documented. Also, given their long migration and intermarriage, they had lost the maternal ancestry of Jews.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the game}} sharing the [...] as the 1998 {{installment}} in the franchise, the game’s creative director, Craig Sullivan, told why they didn’t name the game something totally different, stating: [...] "To be honest {{when we started}} out making the game we didn’t know {{it was going to}} be called Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, we just didn’t. We got to the game before we got to the name. We realized we were making something that had a lot of cops in it and was really interesting to us, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> what can we call this? Eventually we thought this actually fits quite well with Hot Pursuit and went with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hell's Kitchen {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Superjesus {{on the eve of}} the Big Day Out in Adelaide on Australia Day long-weekend, January 1996. Tennent {{provided}} the new name. Berryman explained, [...] "It was basically just a piss-take on commonly used words in the '90s. Like The Jesus and Mary Chain, [...] "Jesus Built My Hotrod", the Jesus Lizard, Jesus Jones; there's just heaps of Jesus' out there in the music world <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we would have that and super was kind of like a '90s catch word." [...] Their debut five-track extended play, Eight Step Rail, was released in August 1996 on Aloha Records. It spent a couple of months on top of the Australian Independent charts.|$|E
2500|$|The show held auditions in Dublin and Belfast for {{the first}} three series, with Belfast auditions {{continuing}} for series 4 before being dropped, though Irish singers could still audition in other cities. Dublin first round auditions returned in 2010 with the auditions held on 28 June. In 2011, The X Factor did not hold auditions in Ireland, instead replacing them with a new audition city, Liverpool. A source from The X Factor said: [...] "There are only so many places we can go for auditions. We went to Dublin last year but we haven't been to Liverpool <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we should do it this year. Obviously this is a blow to the Irish contestants but it's only a short hop across the Irish Sea to Liverpool." [...] Auditions did return to Dublin in 2014, however.|$|E
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first.
