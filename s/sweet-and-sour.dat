500|$|Stuffed vegetables, called memula’im, were {{originally}} designed to extend cheap ingredients into a meal. They are prepared by cooks in Israel from all ethnic backgrounds and are made with many varying flavors, such as spicy or <b>sweet-and-sour,</b> with ingredients such as bell peppers, chili peppers, figs, onion, artichoke bottoms, Swiss chard, beet, dried fruits, tomato, vine leaves, potatoes, mallow, eggplants and zucchini squash, and stuffing such as meat and rice in Balkan style, bulgur in Middle Eastern fashion, or with ptitim, a type of Israeli pasta.

The personal focus is welcome, but {{the book is a}} little too compressed and rushed to evoke exactly the emotional response that it desires." [...] While at the same time describing the first volume as having an [...] "inspirational tone", the review ends by saying, [...] "Don't come to Hibiki's Magic expecting a life-changing re-examination of magic. It's a heavy dose of pure cuteness for those who like their <b>sweet-and-sour</b> drama with lots of cheese." [...] The first volume of Hibiki's Magic was featured in ANN's Right Turn Only column in January 2007, where Carlo Santos compares the series to [...] "Someday's Dreamers with more guts and heart," [...] which portrays magicians as similar to normal people with [...] "weaknesses and all" [...] as opposed to [...] "other tales of magic [...] focus on how cool and different magicians are [...]" [...] Visually, the series is described as being too similar to [...] "every other fantasy series" [...] and even cites similarities with [...] "Hogwarts' magic robes and school logo." [...] IGN Comics' review said, [...] "This book ought to be fairly popular for its intended age group....Make no mistake, this book is cute {{in every sense of the}} word...but at the same time it's a solid story that breaks out of that cuteness mold." ...|$|E
500|$|Fever is {{considered}} to be a prominent example of Minogue's constant [...] "reinventions". The image she adopted during this period was described by Baker as [...] "slick, minimalist and postmodern", and it was seen as a step forward from the [...] "camp-infused" [...] tone of Light Years. Larissa Dubecki from The Age used the term [...] "nu-disco diva" [...] to describe Minogue during this period. Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that Minogue's public image and her persona in her music videos [...] "presented herself as a mechanical muse whose every gesture snapped and locked into place with the sound of a vacuum seal". He further remarked that the singer's [...] "hygienic coo summoned a cool sort of cyborg soul, and her videos showed her gliding through sleek futurescapes, tonguing the <b>sweet-and-sour</b> tang of a techno kiss". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters felt that the simplicity of the album made it a [...] "classy piece of work" [...] and commented that Minogue's experience and choice of collaborators resulted in [...] "the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless, brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [...] and Christina [...] ". Robbie Daw from Idolator pointed out that Britney Spear's recording of her 2004 hit [...] "Toxic", Madonna's comeback album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Paris Hilton's musical debut Paris (2006), and radio stations' shift towards playing [...] "more groove-oriented sounds" [...] all followed the release of Fever, although he admitted that [...] "we have no way of knowing whether Kylie Minogue's eighth studio album was directly responsible for these pop happenings". Chris True from AllMusic, in his biography of Minogue, commented that the release of the album and lead single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] cemented her position as an international music icon, saying [...] "Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001, and she would be reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well".|$|E

50|$|Mecklenburg {{food has}} {{traditionally}} been considered as rather down-to-earth and hearty.

Potatoes, known locally as Tüften, play a particularly important role in the region also, as evinced by the existence of a potato museum (the Vorpommersches Kartoffelmuseum) in neighbouring West Pomerania), and a variety of cooking methods are used to prepare them. Other staples are kale, known as Grünkohl and a <b>sweet-and-sour</b> flavour produced, for example, by using dried fruit. Although Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania have both had long, independent histories, the similarity in living conditions and landscapes in both regions has resulted in both populations having similar eating habits.|$|E

By the 19th century, typical American recipes for shrubs used vinegar poured over fruit—traditionally berries—which was left to infuse anywhere from overnight up to several days; afterwards, the fruit would be strained out and the remaining liquid would be mixed with a sweetener such as sugar or honey and then reduced to make a syrup. [...] The <b>sweet-and-sour</b> syrup could be mixed with either water or soda water and served as a soft drink, or it {{could be used as a}} mixer in alcoholic cocktails.
