40|$|Abstract. Sn-based {{lead-free}} solders {{have some}} characteristics {{that are different}} from the conventionally used Sn-Pb eutectic. One is the high dissolution rate of metals and alloys into molten lead-free solder. Several problems due to this high dissolution rate were reviewed. The prominent materials that suffered from this high dissolution rate are copper and iron based. High dissolution rate of Cu resulted in thick Cu-Sn intermetallic compound formation during soldering and Cu enrichment in wave soldering bath. The iron-based materials used for <b>soldering</b> <b>equipments</b> are damaged by erosion. Suppression of the dissolution rate is important to secure quality of micro-soldered joints, to prevent contamination of solder bath and to prolong the life of <b>soldering</b> <b>equipments.</b> The method of suppressing dissolution in practical soldering operation and some examples of erosion damage are introduced...|$|R

40|$|Advancement in {{integrated}} circuit (IC) chips packaging involves three-dimensional (3 D) versus two-dimensional (2 D) packaging technology. 3 D packaging involves stacking of daughter die/s on {{to a mother}} die in a vertical configuration for obvious reasons.

Flip chip technology requires the formation of solder bumps on processed silicon wafers, which were diced to form a single diced die. Relatively expensive and elaborate evaporation and electroplating processes used in the formation of solder bumps leads to a development in a simpler and cheaper bumping technology. The present experimental work describes challenges and updates methods in stencil printing for the development of solder bumps on copper as an arbitrary substrate.

50|$|Resistance {{soldering}} {{is unlike}} using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then {{passed through a}} thermally conductive tip into the joint area. A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance <b>soldering</b> <b>equipment,</b> unlike conduction irons, {{can be used for}} difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.|$|E
50|$|It is good {{practice}} to remove solder from a joint prior to resoldering—desoldering braids or vacuum desoldering <b>equipment</b> (<b>solder</b> suckers) can be used.

40|$|As {{far as the}} Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) {{manufacture}} {{industry is}} concerned, for high production volumes, solder paste is applied on the connection pads through customized stencils. This is a very productive method, yet if the design has to be updated, cost is increasing as the stencil should be changed. For higher exibility, such as in rapid prototyping, jet-printing machines similar to Mycronic MY 500 are used. In these <b>equipments,</b> <b>solder</b> paste is jet-printed on the circuit board.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{drive to}} further miniaturization and heterogeneous system integration {{leads to a}} need for new packaging technologies which also allow large area processing and 3 D integration with potential for low cost applications. Large area mold embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-inPolymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. Mold embedding is currently done on wafer level, typically with diameters of 8 " to 12 ", for future process optimization, PCB technologies offer the potential of real large areas up to 610 × 457 mm 2. For mold embedding as e. g. for fan-out wafer level packaging compression molding equipment is used in combination with liquid, granular or sheet epoxy molding compounds, with the boundary condition, that mold processes do need a product specific tool (with defined diameter & thickness). Within this paper the potential of tool-less lamination processes, a standard in PCB manufacturing, is evaluated. Lamination is done in panel format using well-known molding compounds from wafer level compression molding. To evaluate the potential of today's encapsulants for large area embedding processes, different liquid, granular and sheet molding compounds have been intensively evaluated on their processability, on process & material induced die shift and on resulting warpage - all on panel level. Acting as an interconnection layer, PCB based redistribution technologies using lamination of resin coated copper (RCC) films are used. Within the paper, different RCC materials are introduced and discussed concerning their reliability potential based on the available layer thicknesses and thermo-mechanical material properties. The feasibility of the proposed technologies is demonstrated using a two chip package. Dies are embedded in panel size by lamination technologies. Subsequently the wiring is done by lamination of an RCC film over the embedded cmponents and on the panel backside for double sided redistribution. In a process flow also similar to conventional PCB manufacturing µvias to the die pads and through mold vias are drilled using a UV laser and are metalized by Cu-electroplating in one step. This way dies {{are connected to the}} front copper layer as well as front to backside of the panel. Conductor lines and pads are formed by Cu etching. Finally, a solder mask and a solderable surface finish are applied. If solder depots are necessary, e. g. for BGA packages, those can be applied by <b>solder</b> balling <b>equipment</b> - either by printing or by preform attach.

This device enables the operator to execute the full test in one minute or less. This innovation is a simple apparatus that plugs into a digital multimeter (DMM) and the Common Point Ground (CPG) reference. It enables the user to perform two of the electrostatic discharge tests required in ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000. The device consists of a small black box with two prongs sticking out of one end, two inputs on the opposite end (one of the inputs is used to connect the reference CPG to the DMM), and a metal tab on one side. Inside the box are wires, several washers of various materials, and assembly hardware (nuts and screws/bolts). The device is a passive electronic component that is plugged into a DMM. The operator sets the DMM to read voltage. The operator places the heated tip of the soldering iron onto the metal tab with a small amount of solder to ensure a complete connection. The voltage is read and recorded. The operator switches the DMM to read resistance. The operator places the heated tip of the soldering iron onto the metal tab with a small amount of solder to ensure a complete connection. The resistance is recorded.

It contains 23 tables, 5 figures, 45 graphs and 4 photographs. Actuality of the theme was substantiated, object and tasks of work were formulated, scientific novelty of obtained results and their practical significance were reported, tenets of defense were formulated and also publications of work results were enlisted. Review of scientific literature both on question of physical-mechanical features of metal surfaces and on question of interaction of conjugated surfaces during static contact and under shear conditions was implemented. Earlier known methods of use of surface coatings for metal joining were reported and short review of foundation hypothesis of metal joining during their combine plastic deformation was given. On base of analysis of existing "cold" methods of metal joining (cold welding, cold soldering, cold shear welding) a conclusion was drawn considering necessity of an experimental testing of use of soft metal coatings in combination with shear in order to join metal specimens - so called cold shear <b>soldering.</b> Both experiment <b>equipment</b> and experiment method was described. Optimal routing for strenght test of soldered joining was worked out. After testing the well-known methods of experiments on strenght of joining it was decided to characterize the strenght of joining through strenght on edge (under normal load which equal to zero) that is carried out in the same direction because in this case there were obtained more stable results. Deduction of nondiscrete-logical model of process of cold shear soldering was implemented. On NL-model basis main technological parameters of process was determined. Afterwards their preliminary optimization was fulfilled. As pre-optimization result there were obtained values of parameters which were used later for optimization process by Box-Wilson method. Influence of main technological parameters to the process of cold shear soldering was investigated. Optimization of process using method of many-factors experiment planning was accomplished and optimal mode cold shear soldering was refined. The largest strenght of specimens joining was observed for specimens which were treated with emery paper M 40. Time of specimens hold-up on air after their treatment till shear has no significant influence of result. Optimal parameters were obtained as follows: thickness of tin covering on copper - equal to 0. 130 mm, value of specimens shear relatively each other -equal to 7 mm. Value of mormal loading is limited with experiment conditions. For our conditions of experiment optimal value was declared equal to 2600 N and shear exertion equal to 8500 N. Comparative analysis of rating and experimental values of actual contact area was implemented. Dependence of value of actual contact area on the main technological parameters was investigated. Basic normality of interaction of being sheared relatively each other metal solids and basic normality of joining formation mechanism under condition of simultaneous affection on contacting specimens the normal load and tangential displacements was described. Work contains results that confirm expediency of further study of cold shear soldering process. Possibility of its practical application is substantiated.

40|$|Selective {{soldering}} is {{a process}} for soldering thru-hole components on the bottom side of an assembly. In a selective soldering process a robot system is used {{to pick up the}} assembly and drag it over a single point select wave, or dip the assembly into multiple nozzles that are mounted on a product specific nozzle plate. In contrast, the soldering process utilizing traditional wave <b>soldering</b> <b>equipment</b> consists of transporting the entire assembly, by means of a conveyor system, over a liquid solder wave. The implementation of lead-free alloys will affect the thermal load of components and board material due to higher process temperatures. Not all of the components can withstand the high temperatures that they may be exposed to during wave and reflow processes. For this reason selective soldering becomes interesting since in this process only the areas that come into contact with the lead-free solder will reach higher temperatures while other sections and components remain significantly below critical temperature levels. This paper focuses on the effects of board surface finishes and selective soldering process parameters such as drag speed and solderpot temperatures, on the formation and strength of the solder joints.

In some cases those defects can lead to catastrophic failure depending on the application and energy available. Cracks could be introduced at virtually any point in the surface mount assembly process from pick and place, soldering and assembly handling after soldering. Understanding the application, assembly process and final product configuration are necessary to eliminate capacitor cracking.

It is still the question whether all concerned products have already been successfully converted from non-compliance to compliance and what economical and environmental effects result from the RoHS transition. Within the EU project "GreenRoSE", a cooperation of industrial associations, research institutions and industry, a survey has been conducted in 40 electronic enterprises in Poland in October 2006. Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) make 85 % of the responders. The survey covered different sectors ranging from end producers, suppliers to producers of <b>soldering</b> <b>equipment,</b> and addressed the pre-RoHS situation, transition process and the post-RoHS status in view of management (logistics), environmental and economical issues. This paper gives an overview about the compliance status, identifies the critical issues in the RoHS transition process and evaluates the environmental and economical impact. Detailed data on costs of the transition process will be given.
