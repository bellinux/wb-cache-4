5000|$|The {{strength}} of spider silk is highly variable.

After tasseling and <b>silking,</b> timing becomes less important since plant expansion will have slowed down. The disease pressure in the field and weather conditions should be monitored and evaluated beforehand to determine if fungicides are needed or not.|$|E

50|$|Ninety-eight {{percent of}} the {{flowering}} time QTLs identified in this paper were found to affect flowering time by less than one day (as compared to the B73 reference). These relatively small QTL effects, however, were also shown to sum for each family to equal large differences and changes in days to <b>silking.</b> Furthermore, {{it was observed that}} while most QTLs were shared between families, each family appears to have functionally distinct alleles for most QTLs. These observations led the authors to propose a model of “Common genes with uncommon variants” to explain flowering time diversity in maize. They tested their model by documenting an allelic series in the previously studied maize flowering time QTL Vgt1 (vegetation-to-transition1) by controlling for genetic background and estimating the effects of vgt1 in each family. They then went on to identify specific sequence variants that corresponded to the allelic series, including one allele containing a miniature transposon strongly associated with early flowering, and other alleles containing SNPs associated with later flowering.|$|E

The same temperature coefficients were established for crop ontogeny before <b>silking,</b> and the rates of leaf initiation, leaf tip {{appearance and}} full leaf expansion, the base, optimum and maximum temperatures for each being 8, 34 and 40 degrees C.

The report covers three areas. Firstly, I review various names used for black mud-treated <b>silks</b> and begin to contextualize the production and use region. Two mud-treated <b>silk</b> samples from early- 1930 s Southeast Asia are introduced in this discussion. Secondly, I initiate investigation into the role of mud-treated black <b>silks</b> in Chinese fashion history during the transition from the late-imperial era to twentieth-century modernity. Thirdly, the use of mud-treated <b>silks</b> in twenty-first-century fashion is highlighted. Context of Mud-Treated <b>Silks</b> “Gummed silk” is apparently a common euphemism for a variety of mud-treated or mud-coated <b>silks.</b> In the context of Asian black <b>silks,</b> gummed is not a reference to the raw state of <b>silk</b> filaments, but rather a general name for shiny black <b>silk</b> fabrics coated with tannin-rich mud. Jiāo-chou and xiang-yun-shā are the names most often employed in China to refer to slightly stiff bi-colored <b>silks</b> that are brownish-orange on one side and black on the other. Fashion designers, manufacturers, retailers, and authorities on textiles employ several other names for these bi-colored and other solid black mud-treated <b>silks.</b> For example, contemporary fashion designer Luiang Zi calls the bi-colored <b>silks</b> Liangchou. Other names for mud-treated <b>silks</b> include Canton <b>silk,</b> gambiered <b>silk,</b> Guangdong <b>silk,</b> lacquered <b>silk,</b> liang <b>silk,</b> Tang <b>silk,</b> and tea <b>silk.</b> The array of names suggests both a variety of southeastern Chinese and Southeast Asian ethnic groups making and using various mud-treated <b>silk</b> fabrics, and the imprecision in translating the names into English. To further confound clarity in researching or discussing these fabrics, codification of particular mud-treated <b>silk</b> textiles and their specific techniques and characteristics remains to be accomplished. Thus, to simplify terminology at this time, I employ the descriptive adjectives gummed (already widely applied) or mud-treated, as noted above) when referring to textiles from this broad category.
