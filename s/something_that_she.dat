5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by manga artist and writer Hato Moa—author of the series Vairocana and a former Dengeki Comic Grand Prix honoree—under her dōjin circle PigeoNation Inc. As she had no experience with game development prior to Hatoful, Hato initially wanted {{to start with a}} visual novel, as she believed it was an easier game type for amateur developers to make; the format also allowed visuals to easily accompany her stories, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> as a manga artist, was accustomed to and viewed as being necessary in her work. She first came up with the concept for Hatoful as a 2011 April Fools' Day joke: despite her lack of familiarity with the genre, she initially intended to create a parody of otome game stereotypes. Birds in particular were used as a theme due to Hato's fondness for pigeons; however, this was also partially due to Hato's prioritization of writing over illustrating, as the use of bird photographs instead of hand-drawn sprites allowed her more freedom to focus on the script. The first incarnation of the game was created over the course of half a day and posted as a browser game made with Adobe Flash; but due to strong word of mouth from social media it was taken down after immense traffic caused the web server it was hosted on to crash on two separate occasions. Following the unexpected popularity of the Flash game, development began on a longer visual novel using the FamousWriter game engine.|$|E

25|$|Poirot {{claims that}} he can solve the mystery within twenty-four hours simply by {{interviewing}} the suspects. During these interviews he establishes a timeline that seems impossible: Sarah King places {{the time of death}} considerably before the times at which various of the family members claim last to have seen the victim alive. Attention is focused on a hypodermic syringe that has seemingly been stolen from Dr. Gerard’s tent and later replaced. The poison administered to the victim is believed to be digitoxin, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> already took medicinally.|$|E
25|$|In January 1886, the Duke was {{appointed}} commander-in-chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, based in Malta. In October 1886, the family settled there. For {{the next three}} years, they spent every winter at the San Anton Palace in Malta. Life in the island was unexciting for the Duchess of Edinburgh, {{but it was a}} welcome respite from living in England. While in Malta, the Duchess proved to be an excellent hostess, entertaining naval officers and their wives. In 1887, the couple returned briefly to London to take part in Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Her husband's career in the British navy and their many relations in the European courts allowed Maria Alexandrovna to travel extensively, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> truly enjoyed. She visited most European countries, including Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, and even Montenegro, making annual trips to Germany, England, and Russia.|$|E

He tested the fragrance out on his three sons, stating that: [...] "That's the good thing about having three boys, they are so honest and they said it was amazing".|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{clarified}} {{that her}} age {{did not have}} anything to do with the sense of urgency reflected in the track; instead, it was just <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had in mind for a long time and with [...] "4 Minutes", the sense seeped into her music. Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing [...] "the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was [...] "a funny paradox" [...] and was one of the inspirations behind her documentary I Am Because We Are (2008). The documentary dealt with the acute suffering and food shortage afflicting the African nation of Malawi.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> created with Judd.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 12 of Gylfaginning, Gangleri tells High {{that the}} sun moves quickly, {{almost as if she}} were moving so quickly that she fears <b>something,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not go faster even if she were afraid of her own death. High {{responds}} that [...] "It is not surprising that she moves with such speed. The one chasing her comes close, and there is no escape for her except to run." [...] Gangleri asks who chases her, to which High responds that two wolves give chase to Sól and Máni. The first wolf, Sköll, chases Sól, and despite her fear, Sköll will eventually catch her. Hati Hróðvitnisson, the second wolf, runs ahead of Sól to chase after Máni, whom Hati Hróðvitnisson will also catch. In chapter 35, Sól's status as a goddess is stated by High, along with Bil.|$|E

Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [...] trait in all the characters), Mama will say <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed.

500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} Central St Martins College, Arulpragasam {{wanted to}} make films and art depicting realism that would be accessible to everyone, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> felt was missing from her classmates' ethics and the course criteria. At college, she found the fashion courses [...] "disposable" [...] and more current than the film texts that she studied. Maya told Arthur magazine [...] " [...] exploring apathy, dressing up in some pigeon outfit, or running around conceptualising... It missed {{the whole point of}} art representing society. Social reality didn’t really exist there; it just stopped at theory." [...] She cited [...] "radical cinema" [...] including Harmony Korine, Dogme 95 and Spike Jonze as some of her cinematic inspirations during film school. As a student, she was approached by director John Singleton to work on a film in Los Angeles after he had read a script she had written, though she decided not to take up the offer. For her degree, M.I.A. prepared her departmental honours thesis on the film CB4.|$|E
500|$|During {{a series}} of {{interviews}} to promote his film Sing Street in 2016, Carney repeatedly criticized Knightley for her acting in Begin Again. When asked about the critical reaction to Sing Street by The Independent, Carney responded unprompted that [...] "it's a small personal movie with no Keira Knightleys in it. It's really rewarding." [...] In the same interview Carney also referred to her repeatedly as a model, despite the fact that Knightley had been working professionally as an actress since childhood, saying [...] "I'll never make a film with supermodels again." [...] He also criticized her in an interview with Heyuguys.com, saying, [...] "I just think with Keira it was like asking her to do <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not do." [...] Though he did not specifically name Knightley, he did, in an interview with Den of Geek, say that his desire to make Sing Street came from his [...] "experience of working, let's face it, with a model on my last film". Filmmakers Massy Tadjedin, Mark Romanek, Lorene Scafaria and Lynn Shelton, who had worked with Knightley on other films, tweeted their support for her after Carney's comments.|$|E

500|$|According to Swift, [...] "Back to December" [...] is {{an apology}} to a past lover {{in the form}} of a song, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has never done before. She continued, [...] "I've never felt the need to {{apologize}} in a song before. But in the last two years I've experienced a lot, [...] a lot of different kinds of learning lessons. And sometimes you learn a lesson too late and at that point you need to apologize because you were careless." [...] Critics have speculated that the song is Swift's apology to her ex-boyfriend, The Twilight Saga actor Taylor Lautner, due, in part, to the lyrics [...] "your tan skin, your sweet smile", as well as the hidden lyrics in the booklet, which spelled out [...] "TAY." [...] Lautner confirmed these rumors while promoting the TV series Scream Queens in 2016. [...] "Back to December" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Speak Now on October 12, 2010 as a part of the exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store leading up to the album's release. [...] On November 15, 2010, the song was released as the second single from Speak Now.|$|E
500|$|Because Jones's costume {{does not}} evolve much {{throughout}} the season, Maslansky used flashbacks {{to show how}} her costume had evolved to the present day: for 'pre-Kilgrave' Jessica Jones, Maslansky gave the character [...] "more pulled together" [...] clothes, albeit [...] "still kind of edgy" [...] clothes that did not change who she was as a character, but were just [...] "different". For instance, in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment, she does not wear a suit, instead [...] "wear her jeans and find a really cool jacket, maybe a vintage thing, maybe <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> borrowed from Trish". For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume, a [...] "variety" [...] of costumes were ordered online, with the chosen suit then distressed to [...] "look dirty and old"; [...] "a mere shadow of its former sandwich self," [...] becoming [...] "more of a hoagie than a sandwich." [...] In another flashback, Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character's real situation, with Maslansky calling it [...] "so beautiful and so free and so light".|$|E
500|$|Throughout her 11-year {{period of}} fieldwork, Berger {{had to use}} snowball {{sampling}} to retrieve her data on the Pagan community, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> attributed to the [...] "secrecy of groups and practitioners". She conducted formal interviews with over 40 practicing Pagans, and over 60 others instead were informally interviewed during conversations at Pagan events, following which Berger recorded their responses in her fieldnotes. She participated in rituals with ten different Wiccan covens, two of which were all-female covens, and the other eight of which were mixed-gender in structure, but all of whom assembled in the Northeastern United States. Accepting that this regional focus might affect her results, she supplemented her fieldwork by reading literature on Paganism from across the country, concluding that [...] "the differences among groups and practitioners within the United States are {{less important than the}} similarities." [...] Unlike the sociologists Margot Adler and Loretta Orion, both of whom had been or became Pagans whilst studying the movement, Berger stated that she had not joined the religion, thereby remaining an [...] "outsider" [...] throughout her research, but had made many friends within the Pagan community.|$|E

500|$|In 1966, Lansbury took on {{the title}} role of Mame Dennis in the musical Mame, Jerry Herman's musical {{adaptation}} of the novel Auntie Mame. The director's first choice for the role had been Rosalind Russell, who played Mame in the non-musical film adaptation Auntie Mame, but she had declined. Lansbury actively sought the role {{in the hope that}} it would mark a change in her career. When she was chosen, it came as a surprise to theatre critics, who believed that it would go to a better-known actress; Lansbury was forty-one years old, and it was her first starring role. Mame Dennis was a glamorous character, with over twenty costume changes throughout the play, and Lansbury's role involved ten songs and dance routines which she trained extensively for. First appearing in Philadelphia and then Boston, Mame opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in May 1966. Auntie Mame was already popular among the gay community, and Mame gained Lansbury a cult gay following, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> later attributed to the fact that Mame Dennis was [...] "every gay person's idea of glamour... Everything about Mame coincided with every young man's idea of beauty and glory and it was lovely." ...|$|E
500|$|John Ford {{reportedly}} once commented in {{a letter}} that O'Hara was the finest actress in Hollywood, but he rarely praised her in person. Bertrand Tavernier, on the contrary, professed that O'Hara {{was one of the}} actresses he most detested. [...] Though she was quite proud of her own versatility as an actress, saying [...] "I played every kind of role. I was never petite or cute so there was never anything about me which would go out of style", critics found fault with her range. Malone wrote that she [...] "seemed to struggle in comedic roles but proved her mettle in films that called on her to take charge of situations or find courage in the face of adversity". One critic remarked that it took a director like John Ford to bring out a good performance from her. [...] The Irish critic Philip Moloy thought the opposite, saying [...] "It is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would accept herself, but Maureen O'Hara's career probably suffered from its long-term association with John Ford. John Ford's view of Ireland, and things Irish, tended to be broad, sentimental and sociologically distorted, and his characters were often cliched representatives of their nationality". In the 1960s, O'Hara ventured into maturer roles as she aged.|$|E
500|$|Letha was {{a devout}} {{adherent}} of the Pentecostal denomination of Christianity, regularly attending the Palm Lane Church of God in Christ in South Los Angeles. Sylvester {{and his brothers}} accompanied her to the church's services, where he developed a particular interest in gospel music. Having been an avid singer {{since the age of}} three, Sylvester regularly joined in with gospel performances; he sang the song [...] "My Buddy" [...] at the funeral of one of the other children in the Park Lane congregation. The young Sylvester was often accused of effeminacy and recognized his own homosexuality from an early age. At the age of eight, he engaged in sexual activity with a far older man at the church—at the time rumored to be the church organist—although he would always maintain that this was consensual and not an example of sexual molestation. Sylvester was taken to a doctor after receiving injuries during anal sex with this man; it was the doctor who informed Letha that her son was gay, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not accept, viewing homosexual activity as a perversion and a sin. News of Sylvester's homosexual activity soon spread through the church congregation, and feeling unwelcome, he ceased his attendance at age 13.|$|E
