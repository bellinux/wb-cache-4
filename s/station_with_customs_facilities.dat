50|$|The Royal Württemberg State Railways (Königlich Württembergischen Staats-Eisenbahnen, KWSt.E) {{opened the}} station in 1866 on the Neckar Railway (Neckarbahn) and Lower Jagst Railway (Untere Jagstbahn) from Heilbronn to Osterburken in the then {{independent}} town of Jagstfeld. This route is now {{considered part of the}} Franconia Railway (Frankenbahn). In 1869 the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway (BadStB) opened the West Fork Railway (Westlichen Gabelbahn, the modern Elsenz Valley Railway) to Meckenheim, connecting to Heidelberg. In 1879, it opened another line to Heidelberg, the Neckar Valley Railway, via Neckarelz and Eberbach. Jagstfeld was a border <b>station</b> <b>with</b> <b>customs</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the {{transfer}} of control of the Saar to the League of Nations {{in the wake of}} the Treaty of Versailles, Türkismühle station became a border <b>station</b> to Germany <b>with</b> <b>customs</b> <b>facilities,</b> resulting in an increase in population. In freight operations, there were some enhancements, such as the extensive expansion of the station premises and the creation of new freight operators. The line to Wolfersweiler was opened in November 1934 and extended to Kusel in 1936, establishing the Türkismühle-Kusel railway. The Saar returned to Germany in 1935. In 1937, the Deutsche Reichsbahn office was moved from Türkismühle to St. Wendel. In 1938, during the construction of the Siegfried Line, the station had 12 tracks.|$|R

5|$|Lympne Airport , was a {{military}} and later civil airfield , at Lympne, Kent, United Kingdom, which operated from 1916 to 1984. During the First World War RFC Lympne was originally an acceptance point for aircraft being delivered to, and returning from, France but was later designated as a First Class Landing Ground, RAF Lympne. It became a civil airfield in 1919 and saw the operation of early air mail services after the 1918 armistice.

50|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, {{after the}} peace treaty of Trianon that reduced Hungarian {{territory}} by 72%, the railway network was cut from around 22000 to 8141 km (the 7784 km long MÁV-owned network decreased to 2822 km). The number of freight cars was 102,000 {{at the end of}} World War I, but after 1921 only 27,000 remained in Hungary, of which 13,000 were in working order. The total number of locomotives was 4,982 in 1919, but after the peace treaty only 1,666 remained in Hungary. As many existing railway lines crossed Hungary's new borders, most of these branch lines were abandoned. On the main lines new border stations had to be constructed <b>with</b> <b>customs</b> <b>facilities</b> and locomotive service.|$|R

40|$|Drift Tubes {{chambers}} {{were designed}} {{to be used in}} CMS trigger to allow muon tagging in the barrel of the detector [1]. Local Trigger logic reconstructs chamber-level track segments that are assembled into full tracks by the DT Track Finder in parallel over smaller sections of the barrel. In the final stage of the regional trigger the Muon Sorter has to select the best four candidates in the barrel and to filter fake muons generated by system redundancy. The hardware implementation of Muon Sorter satisfies large I/O and fast timing requirements using latest FPGA technology. The hardware was tested <b>with</b> <b>custom</b> <b>facilities.</b> Constraints, design implementation and test setup will be reported. I. DRIFT TUBES REGIONAL TRIGGER A. Regional Trigger partitioning The arrangement of muon detectors determines the partition of trigger logic [2]. CMS Drift Tubes detectors [3] are arranged in stations. Each <b>station</b> is provided <b>with</b> Local Trigger logic that reconstructs track segments [4]. Dimensions and positioning of the stations are such that four stations along the radial direction form a sector that covers 30 ° in the r-φ projection. Thus, 12 sectors at the same η cover the full φ angle making a wheel, while 5 sectors at the same φ make a wedge...|$|R
40|$|Drift Tubes {{chambers}} {{are used}} in the CMS barrel for tagging the passage of high Pt muons generated in a LHC event and for triggering the CMS data read out. The Sector Collector (SC) system synchronizes the track segments built by trigger modules on the chambers and deliver them to reconstruction processors (Track Finder, TF) that assemble full muon tracks. Then, the Muon Sorter (MS) has to select the best four candidates in the barrel and to filter fake muons generated by the TF system redundancy. The hardware implementations of the Sector Collector and Muon Sorter systems satisfy radiation, I/O and fast timing constraints using several FPGA technologies. The hardware was tested <b>with</b> <b>custom</b> <b>facilities,</b> integrated <b>with</b> other trigger subsystems, and operated in a beam test. A test beam on a 40 MHz bunched beam validated the local trigger electronics and off-detector prototype cards and the synchronization tools. The CMS Magnet Test and Cosmic challenge in 2006 proved stable and reliable operation of the Drift Tubes trigger and its integration with other trigger systems and with the readout system. Constraints, design, test and operation of the modules are presented...|$|R

5000|$|The Basel SBB station {{building}} {{is characterized by}} its extraordinary length: Basel SNCF, <b>with</b> its <b>customs</b> <b>facility</b> for the international transit traffic, is [...] "attached" [...] to its western side. The asymmetrical layout of the station creates an external appearance representative of the federal buildings of the time. The station {{building is}} aligned to the centre line of the Centralbahnplatz, and features a huge glazed tudor arch window between two clock towers under curved domes.Behind the facade, one might suspect a terminus, {{but that is not}} the case in Basel. Through the entrances in the clock towers, travellers reach the ticket hall under a timber-lined steel-arch structure. Like the rest of the interior, the ticket hall is broad and high. Large murals dating from the 1920s advertise tourist destinations in Switzerland. The ticket and currency exchange offices are embedded in the side wall. The baggage check-in and hand luggage storage facilities were formerly also located here, but today they are in the basement, and accessed by means of an escalator and stairs.In the eastern part of the station, the baggage claim was formerly to be found where the travel centre is now located. The first/second class restaurants (now Migros) and the third class facility (now a brasserie/kiosk) were in the north west wing. The station was previously known for its station buffets, but these were gradually closed down in the 1990s. The high rooms, their walls decorated with murals, now house other commercial uses together with the sole remaining specialty restaurant.|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} tie {{impacts of}} MGNREGA on labour scarcity, wages, {{cost of production}} and the linkages among wage rates in agriculture and non-agriculture employment. The study is based on field data of the semi-arid villages from Telangana and Maharashtra states under Village Dynamic Studies in South Asia (VDSA). The results reveal-that the real-wages for farm and nonfarm works exhibited upward trend especially after implementation of MGNREGA in both the states. The average daily wage rate of male farm worker has grown sharply after MGNREGA in both the states compared to almost negative growth rate of before MGNREGA. Beside farm wage, non-farm wage of male labour has also increased resulting shift in labour force from agriculture to non-agriculture. Both the farm and nonfarm wage has increased by almost 3 times {{during the period of}} MGNREGA implementation in some area, whereas MGNREGA wage has increased only by half of it. However, the perpetual phenomenon of gender wage inequality in rural labour market is continuing over the period (2001 - 2012). There has been a steady decline in labour use for some of the crops; the shortage of male labour for farm worker has been more prominent, whereas the increased participation of female labour in some major crop confirms the feminization of agriculture. The share of labour cost formed a significant proportion of the total cost impacting on net returns. In order to address labour scarcity, technological developments that are amenable for mechanisation along <b>with</b> <b>custom</b> hiring <b>facility</b> is crucial. Further, capacity building programmes for skill augmentation especially for female labour is required...|$|R
