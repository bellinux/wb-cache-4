50|$|The PLGen module {{stands for}} the virtual model {{generator}} or the pre-processor of the PLPAK. It mainly changes any <b>structural</b> <b>drawing</b> to {{what is called the}} “virtual model”. Modeller can import structural drawings from DXF CAD files or can draw then directly using the CAD capabilities of the PLGen. The virtual model looks very similar to the original <b>structural</b> <b>drawing.</b> The PLGen mainly define the structure using series of objects. These objects are classified into one of three categories: the geometrical objects (single slab and openings), the loading objects (column load, wall load, load patch, load assembly) and the supporting objects (column, wall, wall assembly, soil support, beam). Using such objects the modeler can define all elements in the building slab. It has to be noted that the virtual model represents the actual slab shape (not like the centre-line model of the finite element method). Columns and walls are represented by the actual cross section shape. The PLGen can also input the numerical models of each object such as the number of boundary elements for each segments, the discretization of the beam-slab contact areas, etc. Load cases only (i.e. no load combinations) are defined in the PLGen module. Material properties are also defined herein. The below Figure demonstrates the graphical user interface of the PLGen module.|$|E
50|$|A <b>structural</b> <b>drawing,</b> {{a type of}} Engineering drawing, is a plan or set {{of plans}} for how a {{building}} or other structure will be built. Structural drawings are generally prepared by registered professional structural engineers, and informed by architectural drawings. They are primarily concerned with the load-carrying members of a structure. They outline the size and types of materials to be used, {{as well as the}} general demands for connections. They do not address architectural details like surface finishes, partition walls, or mechanical systems. The structural drawings communicate the design of the building's structure to the building authority to review. They are also become part of the contract documents which guide contractors in detailing, fabricating, and installing parts of the structure.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} goal {{of studying}} experimental exchange networks {{is to understand}} the relationship between power and network position. In this paper we provide a formal definition of the appropriate notion of position, and explore some of the consequences of assuming that power is a function of position. It is shown that, in highly structured graphs, the space of possible power outcomes is significantly reduced if power is entirely <b>structural.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the notion of role colorings (Everett and Borgatti 19911, we formalize the frequently expressed intuitive idea that a node’s power {{is a function of the}} powers of its neighbors, just as their power is determined by the powers of their neighbors, and so on. We use a combination of two role colorings to express this idea. One, called ecological coloring, states that if two nodes have the same power neighborhoods (i. e. distinct levels of power exhibited by their neighbors), then they must have equal power. The other, called regular coloring, states that if two nodes have equal power, then we can infer that they have the same power neighborhoods. Together, these colorings imply a one-to-one relationship between the power of a node, and the power(s) of its neighbors. It is found that applying these colorings in addition to assuming power is a function of position, radically reduces the sample space of possible power outcomes, leaving only a few possibilities. With two revealing exceptions, the reduced space of possible power outcomes always contains the experimentally observed result. In recent years, there has been considerable research investigating the structural determinants of power in experimental exchange network...|$|E

40|$|ASPIRE {{designed}} the gravity, lateral, and foundation systems, utilized finite element software for structural optimization, designed steel and concrete connections, {{and studied the}} effects of creep and shrinkage during a year-long analysis of the Chicago Spire. Preliminary analysis included research of different lateral load resisting systems in order to select the system that would best suit {{the needs of the}} structure. The lateral system chosen was a central concrete core with outriggers and belt trusses connecting the core with the exterior steel columns. The gravity design of the structure explored the use of non-composite and composite beams and columns in the Spire. ASPIRE selected steel beams with a composite metal decking system. A column load takedown based on tributary areas was used for the preliminary column design. The Chicago Spire was modeled using MIDAS Gen, a structural finite element software, to accurately understand the lateral behavior of the building. A sensitivity analysis was performed to resize the concrete core, the outriggers, and the belt truss members from the initial hand calculation sizes. Core wall thicknesses were optimized across the height of the building. Vertical columns and transfer columns were redesigned as a series of steel built-up shapes through energy optimization methods. The foundation system featured the design of a seven level below-grade parking garage and a retaining wall along the site perimeter. Rock-socketed caissons were designed to support the tower, extending {{from the base of the}} building to the bedrock 119 feet below grade. There are hundreds of connections in the Chicago Spire ranging from standard steel connections to complex designs for the outriggers and the lobby level mega-columns. Several steel-to-steel and composite connections were designed throughout the tower. A study of concrete creep and shrinkage estimated differential settlement between the concrete core and the exterior steel columns using the GL 2000 model. Creep and shrinkage are dependent on variables such as loading schedule, curing period, and material properties, making it difficult to predict the actual amount of creep and shrinkage. However, failure to acknowledge these effects leads to cracks in the concrete and uneven floors. Through the course of the project, ASPIRE faced many challenges that required the design team to seek guidance from outside sources, including weekly meetings with our faculty advisor and bi-weekly conference calls with our professional advisors from Thornton Tomasetti. The structural design of the Chicago Spire was a collaborative effort of eighteen students and the advisors. The project provided a realistic design experience incorporating team management, iterative design, and professional reporting. For the final deliverable ASPIRE has prepared a cumulative design narrative, calculation book, and final <b>structural</b> <b>drawing</b> set...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{reinforcement}} in Ontario bridges is causing severe soffit spalling in many situations. These spalled areas are often {{located within the}} lap splices and curtailment zones of the primary reinforcement. This can lead to inadequate bar development lengths {{and the possibility of}} failures. In order to better predict the residual strength of these deteriorated bridges, a test program was designed, which involved mid-sized concrete beam specimens, with partially de-bonded reinforcement. The de-bonding was simulated in various beam locations, with various de-bonding patterns. The test program consisted of thirteen beams; ten under-reinforced and three over-reinforced. All beams had dimensions of 2100 × 150 × 100 mm. The span between simple supports was 1900 mm with a single point load applied at the midspan. Rebar strains and displacement at the midspan were recorded. The goal of this experimental {{study was to determine the}} correlation between the spatial location and surface area of de-bonding with the strength of the beams. This was achieved by testing beam specimens with different combinations of de-bonding patterns with respect to location and area. Four beams had de-bonded reinforcement in the flexural zones, seven were de-bonded in the anchorage and flexural zones, and two were fully bonded. In a previous study, a so-called “modified area concept” was developed for rapid assessment of the remaining capacity of heavily spalled girders. This concept was integrated in a computer program, which assesses girder capacity, given a graphical spalling survey and a <b>structural</b> <b>drawing</b> of the girder. The developed program can be easily adapted for full bridge analysis, and to evaluate the effects of reinforcement cross section loss and bond deterioration. The research presented in the current thesis investigates several of the assumptions made in this previous study. The current thesis includes the rationale for the design of the experimental program. In addition, the test results are presented and analyzed. By analyzing the failure modes, failure loads, and crack patterns, along with the load-displacement, load-stiffness, and load-strain behaviour of the various beams, it is concluded that: 1) reinforced concrete beams can carry a significant portion of their original capacity after losing cover over a significant portion of their flexural reinforcement, 2) predictions of the beam capacities and failure modes using the modified area concept are reasonably accurate and conservative in most cases, and 3) the flexural stiffness of the beams was seen to decrease with an increase in the length of the exposed area, in most cases. Recommended areas of future research are identified, including: 1) tests of beams with splices in the flexural reinforcing along the span, 2) field investigation of the concrete strength in regions of the soffit immediately adjacent to the spalled regions, and 3) the development of a correction factor to account for the effects of violating the plane sections assumption. 1 yea...|$|E
