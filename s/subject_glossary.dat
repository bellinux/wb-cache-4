40|$|This {{document}} presents, in summary, {{a compilation}} of the physical and environmental parameters of the moon. A determined attempt {{has been made to}} be objective at all times. Many of the physical sciences are presented in sufficient depth to adequately identify the basic information available. It is expected that the appropriate references will be consulted when additional detail is required. It is obvious both from the text and the reference material that divergent opinions prevail and uncertainties exist in almost every phase of lunar science; e. g., the existence of the lunar bulge, the thickness of the dust layer, etc. No pretense is made to resolve these differences, but by bringing together many references, it is hoped that some contribution will be made in lunar science. The subject index will be of particular value since it relates the reference section by <b>subject.</b> A <b>glossary</b> of terms used throughout the text is also provided...|$|R

40|$|Animal Housing is a {{multidisciplinary}} scientific area which requires {{the involvement of}} scientists from {{different fields such as}} engineers, physicians, animal scientists, veterinarians, etc. Their collaboration requires the establishment and use of a standardized vocabulary that provides consistency and reduces misunderstandings among scientists with diverse background or Nationality. A first dictionary entitled 'Glossary of Terms on Animal Housing: Basic Engineering, Physical and Physiological Definitions' has been prepared by a Working Group (Animal Housing in Hot Climate) established under CIGR-Section II. The glossary made reference to Engineering, Thermal Biology and Environmental physiology disciplines and it aimed at (1) setting-up uniformity in Animal Housing terms related to climatization and to (2) serve as a focal point for the development of valuable new terms and definitions, and become a functional tool for all those involved in this study <b>subject.</b> Furthermore, the <b>glossary</b> can eventually become a background document for opening-up further discussions on the meaning of various terms used in Animal Housing. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} {{at the request}} of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) with support from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) to assess strategies for linking the ECLAC Damage and Loss Assessment (DaLA) Methology to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA). Each metholodolgy was individually outlined and their use in the Caribbean context was explored in detail to set the framework or lens through which their linking would be viewed. Other methologies that are used within the recovery process were identified and outlined. A gap analysis was conducted on moving from the PDNA with a focus on initial rapid reponse to DaLA. DaLA training materials were reviewed to assess where improvements can be made to seamlessly move from one methology to the next. Additionally, both DaLA and PDNA reports were reviewed to identify specific areas of information which could serve as common data links, and note how this linkage could inform the overall disaster assessments in the region. This is in addition to noting any similarities or variance in the application of both methologies. Challenges to linking both methodologies were identified such as countries lacking well defined recovery frameworks and their ability to fund or finance recovery efforts, in addition to recurrent challenges in the Caribbean region such as inadequacy of baseline data, human resource and training, and identifying teams to conduct the data collection. Recommendations made in terms of the strategies to be employed for the successful linking of both the DaLA and PDNA Methodologies included: creating and maintaining a recovery framework and baseline data; creation of a minimum requirements list for the successful implementation of PDNA and DaLA implementation; and increasing political will in addition to identify a champion to push the <b>subject</b> [...] <b>Glossary</b> of terms and definitions.

40|$|An Index of Images in English Manuscripts {{from the}} Time of Chaucer to Henry VIII, by Martha Driver, PhD, Distinguished Professor of English, Dyson College of Arts and Sciences, and Michael Orr An Index of Images, by Martha Driver and Michael Orr, was {{published}} by Harvey Miller and Brepols Publishers in spring 2007. The book {{is one of a}} series of publications that lists and identifies all illustrations in English manuscripts from the time of Chaucer to Henry VIII. I contributed initially to the development of methodology for cataloguing images, and co-authored the introduction that appears in all five volumes of this series; I also wrote entries for the volume that describes images in manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, which was published in 2001. The current volume is a collaboration between myself and Michael Orr, and catalogues illustrations in manuscripts in libraries in New York City, including the collections of the Morgan Library, the New York Public Library, and the Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library, among others. The volume is essentially a catalogue drawn from primary sources that notes the subject-matter of every illustration in 79 manuscripts, accompanied by a comprehensive index of pictorial <b>subjects,</b> an extensive <b>glossary</b> of <b>subjects</b> and terms, and indexes of authors/texts and medieval manuscripts with coats of arms. The range of subjects illustrated is of significance to historians of art, religion, literature, costume, natural science, and cultural history. Also published this summer by Brepols Publishers is The Making of Poetry: Late-Medieval French Poetic Anthologies by Jane H. M. Taylor, the first in the new series Texts and Transitions, which I co-edited for the Early Book Society at Pace University. The EBS series produces monographs dealing with medieval manuscripts and early printed books to 1550 that examine questions to do with readers, owners and patronage, and the circulation and reception of medieval texts.
