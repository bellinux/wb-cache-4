5|$|A line to Horsham, {{now part}} of the Arun Valley Line, was opened on 14 February 1848. A station was {{provided}} next to Crawley High Street from that date. A new station was constructed <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, in conjunction with the Overline House commercial development, and replaced the original station which closed on 28 July 1968. The ticket office and Up (London-bound) platform waiting areas form the ground floor of the office building.|$|E

Maple Avenue on the south marks the former northern terminus of NY361. After that junction, Route44 leaves the village. It passes some strip development on the south, bends <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and crosses the Connecticut state line just past a car dealership on the south.|$|E

5|$|Four main {{proposals}} were suggested {{for the new}} fixed link. One involved a four-lane subsea tunnel, one involved building a second, two-lane bridge immediately adjacent to the current one, which would {{give the impression of}} a single bridge, another involved a new four-lane bridge <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, and the last involved a new bridge considerably further to the south, which would connect to County Road 557.|$|E

5|$|The Green is not {{perfectly}} rectangular, as {{its southern}} border along Wheelock Street runs <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast rather than due east-west. This irregularity {{is due to}} the Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street. The Green had previously extended 30 feet (nine meters) farther south on that corner.|$|E

Its shape in face view is ovate (egg-shaped) to roughly rhomboid, while {{viewed from the}} side it appears elliptical. The spore wall is brown, smooth, about 0.8–1μm thick, and has a germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and somewhat club-shaped, tapering <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base; they are clamped, and measure 25–31 by 7–8.5μm.|$|E

40|$|Spiracle-blocking {{insecticides}} and microbial insecticides {{are widely}} used for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Japan while Nesidiocoris tenuis {{is used for the}} control of thrips and whiteflies in Kochi Prefecture, Japan. However, the effects of the insecticides mentioned above on N. tenuis were unclear. This study investigated the effects of five spiracle-blocking insecticides and two microbial insecticides on the nymphs and adults of N. tenuis. Propylene glycol fatty acid monoester was <b>slightly</b> harmful <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> nymphs and adults. Hydroxypropyl starch was <b>slightly</b> harmful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nymphs, while sodium oleate was <b>slightly</b> harmful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adults. Decanoyloctanoylglycerol and hydrogenated starch hydrolysate were not harmful <b>to</b> either <b>the</b> nymphs or adults. Beauveria bassiana was extremely harmful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adults and was moderately harmful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nymphs. Lecanicillium muscarium was <b>slightly</b> harmful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adults. Therefore, decanoyloctanoylglycerol and hydrogenated starch hydrolysate can be used in combination with N. tenuis to establish an IPM program...|$|R

5|$|A new {{station was}} built in 1897, <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast, behind the Lovell Block. In 1927, the Fitchburg Cutoff became freight-only between the Alewife area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were {{diverted}} to the Fitchburg mainline and began to stop at Cambridge station. In 1937, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at street level and the waiting room and platforms below.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} localities {{in the area}} are named after the Ashbridges. Just to the south of the house is Jonathan Ashbridge Park (named after Sarah's son), while <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east is Sarah Ashbridge Avenue. The bay that marked the {{southern}} edge of the property is now known as Ashbridge's Bay, named for John Ashbridge. On the east and north sides of the bay is the large Ashbridge's Bay Park. Ashbridge's Bay Park North, {{to the north of the}} bay, is the site of the Ashbridge's Bay Skate Park, opened in 2009. The west side of the bay is the location of the Ashbridge's Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant, Toronto's main sewage treatment plant and the second largest such facility in Canada.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
