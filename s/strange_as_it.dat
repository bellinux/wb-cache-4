5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film <b>Strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined.|$|E
5|$|After Caracalla {{concluded}} {{his campaign}} against the Alamanni, it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with the Greek-Macedonian general and conqueror Alexander the Great. He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire, Caracalla decided to equip 16,000 of his men with Macedonian-style phalanxes, despite the Roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation. The historian Christopher Matthew mentions that the term Phalangarii has two possible meanings, both with military connotations. The first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes, and the second bears similarity to the 'Marian Mules' of the late Roman Republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole, which were in use until at least the 2nd century AD. As a consequence, the Phalangarii of Legio II Parthica {{may not have been}} pikemen, but rather standard battle line troops or possibly Triarii. Caracalla's mania for Alexander went so far that Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign of Caracalla's increasingly erratic behaviour. But this mania for Alexander, <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was, was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{may seem}} when the veteran leg-spinner Bill O'Reilly {{announced}} his retirement {{at the beginning of}} the season there were fears that Australia's untried bowlers would suffer against the much-vaulted England batting line up of Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton and Wally Hammond. The opposite became true as the English batsmen initially failed and Australia won the First and Second Tests by an innings.|$|E

60|$|It is all {{so hard to}} put in words, Carley. To {{lie down}} with death and get up with death was nothing. To face one's {{degradation}} was nothing.

25|$|In the 1940s, {{newspaper}} journalist John Hix's syndicated comic <b>Strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> Seems {{published an}} interesting, but apocryphal, explanation for Charles Carroll's distinctive signature on the Declaration of Independence. Every {{member of the}} Continental Congress who signed this document automatically became a criminal, guilty of sedition against King George III. Carroll, because of his wealth, had more to lose than most of his companions. Some of the signators, such as Caesar Rodney and Button Gwinnett, had unusual and distinctive names which would clearly identify them to the King; other signators, with more commonplace names, might hope to sign the Declaration without incriminating themselves.|$|E
25|$|His most {{significant}} accomplishment of 1974 was qualifying for the 22nd Nihon Ki-in Championship, especially since this came after being beaten {{out of the}} Honinbo preliminaries by Takaho Kojima. He beat Kazuo Sometani, Masao Kato, Yoshio Ishida, and Rin Kaiho. His win against Ishida was something <b>strange,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> came a week after Ishida achieved Meijin-Honinbo. He didn't make it past the second game in the 18th Prime Minister Cup, which again went to Kobayashi. He then took revenge on Kobayashi by beating him in the 6th Shin-Ei. He was awarded a Special Merit Prize by Kido magazine after his most impressive record thus far of 33 wins and 9 loses.|$|E
500|$|Ali's act was {{captured}} in two films: the 1930 short <b>Strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> Seems, and Politiquerias (1931), the expanded Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Ali also had a bit part as the [...] "Turkish landlord" [...] in Warner Bros.' 1932 film Scarlet Dawn starring Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Nancy Carroll. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville, a documentary produced by KCTS-TV that exhibits 90 vaudeville acts over a two-hour running time. The documentary has since aired on the Public Broadcasting Service's American Masters series numerous times.|$|E

500|$|Scott Meslow for Vulture {{scored the}} episode four stars out of five, saying {{it makes the}} season's stakes clear by being an origin story for both Ghost Rider and Morrow, and praising the series for {{focusing}} on those elements {{rather than trying to}} closely tie-in with Doctor <b>Strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> did in previous seasons. Meslow also said that Gabe Reyes was [...] "a welcome addition, successfully recognizing and calling out anything that seems like bullshit." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick at ScreenCrush said the episode was easily the best of the season so far, though he was still [...] "on the fence as to whether Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has the clearest sense of where Season 4 is going". Fitzpatrick noted that Lucy had [...] "inarguably [...] the weakest element" [...] of the season and was not surprised with the Morrow reveal, and questioned the series' stance on the morality of the Ghost Rider, feeling that it should have been made more clear. He added that the episode [...] "seemed to position itself a bit better with regard to coming episodes".|$|E

5000|$|He {{resigned}} {{his place}} in 1623 {{in a fit of}} pique, on not being allowed to be present when the Spanish match was discussed. It was rumoured in April 1624 that he was to succeed Sir Edward Herbert as ambassador to France, and later that he had refused the appointment, which, Dudley Carleton wrote, was <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> that <b>it</b> was offered to him. By this time under the patronage of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and before 26 July he was formally appointed to Paris. He was injured in November of the same year by a fall from his horse.|$|R

And now look at how richly they affect New York. All these people that can remain true to themselves, give their own flair and character to American life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review of The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, the NME dubbed it [...] "an album sounding like Pink Floyd {{without all the}} self-indulgent solos", concluding that [...] "Reality is inside a pair of headphones overflowing with The Orb. Life {{will never be the}} same again. The flotation tank beckons." [...] Selects Russell Brown wrote that [...] "long and <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is, Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld is without doubt a good trip."

2500|$|Cochems' own star, Bradbury Robinson, also disputed Cochems' {{claim to}} be the {{developer}} of the forward pass. In a 1940 letter to Ed Wray, Robinson wrote :"The story of the beginning and development of the forward pass does not reside with Eddie Cochems but with myself. <b>Strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> may seem I began the development of the forward pass in [...] at Wisconsin university before I ever came to St. Louis. [...] I anticipated that it would be introduced into the rules because of the efforts Theodore Roosevelt as president was making to tone down the game and make it more spectacular. ... Mr. Cochems' connection with this development only occurred in 1906, in Wisconsin, where the St. Louis university squad had gone for early training." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, <b>strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Strange</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{may seem}} England had few qualms about the Australian bowling {{at the start}} of the series. Dennis Lillee and Bob Massie had been overbowled in 1972 and 1973 and had both broken down with {{crippling}} injuries, while Jeff Thomson – if they had heard of him – had taken 0/110 in his only Test. However, Lillee returned to Test cricket after considerable determination to overcome his injuries and though he lost a yard or two of pace he had lost none of his old venom and [...] "bowled with a hostility that bordered on savagery". His new bowling action was a text-book model and his straight arm gave him movement through the air and off the pitch that made him more dangerous than ever. But the real revelation was Thomson, whose javelin throw action gave him enormous pace and [...] "slung the ball down at sizzling pace, getting dangerous lift off a length, and not worrying overmuch where the ball landed" [...] In 1975–76 his bowling was clocked at 99.6mph compared to Lillee's 86.4 and his very inaccuracy made him dangerous, the batsmen never knew where the ball was going to land next. They were given wholehearted support by Max Walker, as fast-medium bowler whose awkward whirlwind bowling action gave him the nickname of Tangles. 6'4" [...] tall and as strong as a bull Walker was an accurate swing bowler and took 8/143 in the last Test when Lillee and Thomson were injured. Geoff Dymock was a left-arm swing bowler who struggled to keep his pace in a strong Australian team, but became the first Australian to dismiss all 11 opposition batsmen in a Test when he took 12/166 at Kanpur in 1979–80. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply. Tom Graveney thought he was the finest Australian off-spinner since the war and came second in the averages after Thomson. Historically Australian selectors preferred a leg-spinner, but Terry Jenner failed to hold his place and as fast-bowling rose in prominence the Australian 'leggie' became almost extinct.|$|E

The feeling was not like an {{electric}} shock, but <b>it</b> was quite <b>as</b> sharp, <b>as</b> <b>strange,</b> <b>as</b> startling: <b>it</b> acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
