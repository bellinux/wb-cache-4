[...] Amina understood her sister's meaning, and collecting the dishes, glasses, and musical instruments, she carried them away, while Sadie swept the hall and put everything in order. Having done this she begged the Calenders to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa</b> {{on one side of}} the room, and the Caliph and his friends to place themselves opposite. As to the porter, she requested him to come and help her and her sister.|$|E

5000|$|The show {{begins with}} an {{announcer}} introducing Brand. Controversially, he was once introduced as being [...] "bigger than Jesus" [...] in reference to a misquoted claim by John Lennon claiming that The Beatles were bigger than Jesus. After entering Brand sits in a flamboyantly upholstered chair with a zebra fabric for the seat covering. He then introduces the musical act for the show and they will play a track. After this, an announcer will introduce the first guest (usually the biggest star) with a comically fabricated fact or anecdote about them. The guest will then be interviewed whilst they <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa</b> next to Brand. After this interview, there is usually a commercial break.|$|E
5000|$|The play is brief (45 min) {{and without}} an intermission. It was first {{produced}} at the Royal Court Theatre in London {{with the world}} premiere on 10 November 2006. Sam's counterpart was initially named Jack emphasizing the British nature of the person, while in the 2008 American production he becomes Guy, a possible Mr. Anybody. The American version, therefore, also may be a [...] "mirror" [...] as it addresses {{the relationship between the}} government and its supportive voters. [...] The play received a generally positive reception {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. The Guardians Michael Billington suggested that the two characters reflect the Bush-Blair political relationship and noted that [...] "the sexuality of politics" [...] takes centerstage. Benedict Nightingale of The Times criticized the one-sightedness of the playwright's perspective, but recognised an underlying anxiety and anger. Ben Brantley of the New York Times admired Churchill's [...] "canny exploration of the theatrical language." [...] In both productions the two actors <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa</b> in front of a black background. In the course of the play the sofa becomes more and more levitated, possibly reflecting the notion that the two men are becoming more estranged and losing their footing in reality.|$|E

Windows {{are open and}} the front door is ajar {{when there is a}} crash as the crosswinds blow the front door wide open and a gush of wind fills the room. Suddenly you are wide awake and your eyes are owl-like wide open. This is what comes to my mind when I try to describe the impact of new technology – such as open access and web 2. 0 – in my life as a music and arts librarian. Sudden, so far unknown possibilities open and give me a feeling of anticipation and awe. I will try to convey some of the observations I have made since in this short paper and I will do it in a somewhat shorthand form, trying to transmit my feeling of being a wide open pair of eyes in a strange somewhat disorganized world...|$|E
30|$|Beaudin et al. (2007) took TANGO to {{the next}} level by {{detecting}} more user interactions with objects inside a house. Aside from tagging objects with RFID, they used three more sensors: switches for opening and closing cabinets, water flow detectors for the plumbing system, and piezo-triggered accelerometers to detect movements of objects. Overall, they tagged over 100 objects inside the house with 400 Spanish phrases. The system identifies the users through their mobile phones. When they use a particular object (e.g., open a door, <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa),</b> the system plays the relevant English word and its Spanish translation. If they want to browse previously encountered content, they can access the phrases through their mobile phones. They asked a couple to use the system for 10  weeks. On the average, the phrases where presented 57 times per hour. However, even at this intense interaction, the couple found it acceptable even for extended use. The male participant recalled 158 of the 274 phrases he encountered and he correctly guessed 65 out of the 126 phrases that were not presented to him. The female participant recalled 79 of the 178 phrases presented to her and she correctly guessed 26 of the 92 phrases that were not presented to her.|$|E
50|$|The Octoroon Girl {{features}} {{a woman who}} is one-eighth black. In the image a graceful young woman with dark hair, dark eyes and light skin <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa</b> while leaning against a warm red wall. She wears a black velvet dress with red satin trim, a dark brown hat and a small gold chain with a pendant. In her right hand, she holds a pair of leather gloves. The woman stares directly at the viewer with a soft, but composed gaze. Her face is serene. Motley balances the painting with a picture frame {{and the rest of the}} couch on the left side of the painting. Her clothing and background all suggest that she is of higher class. The poised posture and direct gaze creates a certain confidence that radiates from her. The way in which her elongated hands grasp her gloves demonstrates her sense of style and elegance. Motley’s use of physicality and objecthood in this portrait demonstrates conformity to white aesthetic ideals, and shows how these artistic aspects have very realistic historical implications.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> table and then <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa.</b> <b>As</b> her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and walks over to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|R
60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Stistick {{were the}} next comers. Mrs. Stistick sat herself down <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{opposite}} <b>sofa,</b> {{and seemed to}} think that she did her duty to society by sitting there. And so she did. Only permit her so to sit, and there was no further labour in entertaining Mrs. Stistick. She was a large, heavy woman, with a square forehead and a square chin, and she had brought up seven children most successfully. Now, in these days of her husband's parliamentary prosperity, she was carried about to dinners; and in her way she enjoyed them. She was not too shy to eat, and had no wish whatever either to be talked to or to talk. To <b>sit</b> easily <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa</b> and listen to the buzz of voices was life and society to her. Perhaps in those long hours she was meditating on her children's frocks or her husband's linen. But they never seemed to be long to her.|$|R

5000|$|Each show {{began with}} the {{spectral}} image of the wasp-waisted Vampira gliding through knee-deep fog down a dark corridor toward the viewer. At {{the end of her}} trance-like walk she would suddenly let out a long, piercing scream as the camera zoomed in on her face. She would then smile and coyly remark, [...] "Screaming relaxes me so." [...] After that Nurmi would <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Victorian double-ended <b>sofa</b> decorated with skulls and introduce the movie of the night, sometimes pausing to play with her pet spider Rolo, talk with off-camera ghosts, torment her advertiser, Fletcher Jones, in amusing commercials, or drink a Vampira Cocktail at her poison bar. The show's theme music was from the Adagio movement in Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta by Béla Bartók and excerpts from Uranus from The Planets by Gustav Holst. Nurmi's salary for the show was $75 per week.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She <b>sits</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa</b> and sees <b>a</b> wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|R

Bisurya says it isn't what he heard of and takes a leave. Chandar notices Sudha’s neck was turned and asks what happened. She says she was practicing to be like Pammi.
