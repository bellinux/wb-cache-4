40|$|Abstract There exist two {{important}} design criterions for unitary space time codes. In {{the situation where}} the {{signal to noise ratio}} is large {{it is well known that}} the diversity product of a constellation should be as large as possible. It is less known that the diversity sum is a very important design criterion for codes working in a low SNR environment. In this paper we introduce numerical methods which allow us to find codes with near optimal diversity sum. We also demonstrate how these numerical techniques lead to codes with excellent diversity product(sum). 1 Introduction and Model One way to acquire high transmission rate on a wireless channel is to use multiple transmit or receive antennas. Either because of rapid changes in the channel parameters or because of limited system resources, it is reasonable to assume that both the transmitter and the receiver don't know about the channel state information. In [7], Hochwald and Marzetta study unitary space-time modulations. Consider a wireless communication system with M transmit antennas and N receive antennas operating in a Rayleigh flat-fading channel. We assume time is discrete and at each time <b>slot,</b> <b>signals</b> are transmitted simultaneously from the M transmitter antennas.

30|$|Due to the {{increasing}} MTC devices, major challenges are the allocation of RA <b>slots</b> and <b>signaling</b> overhead. In such cases, group-based communication would {{play a vital role}} in managing increasing MTC traffic [21]. The primary objective of group-based communication is to reduce the signaling congestion on the air interface. A group head can be selected which collects uplink/downlink data packets, status information, etc. and then forwards the collected information to the corresponding eNB/MTC devices. Since efficient preamble allocation mechanisms are required to avoid collisions, game theory can additionally be a useful tool to optimize preamble allocation [107]. In addition to reduce the network congestion risks, it can also reduce the power consumption of MTC devices. This is due to the fact that machines need to send/receive data to/from a nearby point, e.g., a relay node. In addition, categorizing MTC devices into groups demands special attention as the grouping should be based either on logical or physical characteristics on the basis of, e.g., QoS, jitter, and other MTC traffic characteristics.|$|R

An experimental prototype is under development at the laboratories of Politecnico di Torino. In this paper, we study two different strategies of slot synchronization for such networks: in the former, a <b>slot</b> synchronization <b>signal</b> is transmitted by the master station on a dedicated control wavelength; in the latter, slave nodes achieve slot synchronization aligning on data packets received from the master. Emphasis {{has been given to}} the architecture of the WONDER network. The performance of the two synchronization strategies, in terms of packet collision probability, has been evaluated by simulation. The technique based on transmitting a timing signal on a dedicated control wavelength resulted in achieving a better performance, although being more expensive due to need of an additional wavelength. However, the technique based on aligning on data packets received from the master should be not discarded, although attaining lower timing stability, especially if limiting the number of wavelengths and receivers is a strong requirement.
