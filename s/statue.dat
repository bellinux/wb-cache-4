The <b>statue</b> was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull and unveiled in 1920. The <b>statue</b> stands in the northwest corner of the cemetery and gazes directly at the <b>Statue</b> of Liberty in New York Harbor. In 2006, the Minerva <b>statue</b> was invoked in a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to the <b>Statue</b> of Liberty in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery and marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument.|$|E
50|$|The <b>statues</b> at Amenhotep III temple wasn't a {{good place}} for them {{topography}} wise because they were put in an area that suffered from rising ground water and would destroy the <b>statues.</b> For that reason the <b>statues</b> were moved to other sites like the temple of Mut. Sekhmet <b>statues</b> found at the temple of Mut on the east bank at Luxor were the same ones used in Amenhotep III courts. The Sekhmet goddess and goddess Mut are linked together. Mut is the wife of Amun and was worshipped at the Mut Precinct. The Sekhmet <b>statues</b> had begun to be moved to the temple of Mut by the 19th dynasty. The <b>statues</b> were identified together and give religious influence. The two <b>statues</b> religious influence were meant to balance each other with fierce and gentle attributes and avoid destruction. The British Museum has the largest collection of Sekhmet <b>statues</b> outside of Egypt. Many of the <b>statues</b> can still be found at their original sites. The <b>statues</b> were positioned near the sacred lake in the temple of Mut. Other areas where rituals that involve Sekhmet are by similar kidney shaped lakes. Many felt the number of <b>statues</b> found is unusual, but when looking at the evidence they were used as a calendar and for sed festivals. The <b>statues</b> were used in rituals to please the goddess. Sekhmet <b>statues</b> at Mut at Karnak on the east bank at Luxor were from Amenhotep III courts. The <b>statues</b> can be traced back through the epithets found on the <b>statues.</b>|$|R

40|$|Ancient <b>statues</b> are {{cultural}} heritages {{that should}} be preserved and maintained. Nevertheless, such invaluable <b>statues</b> may be targeted by vandalism or burglary. In order to guard these <b>statues</b> by using image processing, this research aims to develop a technique for detecting images of ancient <b>statues</b> with missing parts using digital image processing. This paper proposed the effective feature extraction method for detecting images of damaged <b>statues</b> or <b>statues</b> with missing parts based on the Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG) technique, a popular method for object detection. Unlike the original HOG technique, the proposed method has improved the area scanning strategy that effectively extracts important features of <b>statues.</b> Results obtained from the proposed method were {{compared with those of}} the HOG method. The tested image dataset composed of 500 images of perfect <b>statues</b> and 500 images of <b>statues</b> with missing parts. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields 99. 88...|$|R

30|$|In Japan, {{the wood}} of Torreya sp. played an {{important}} part in the history of Buddhism; woods of this genus were frequently used for Buddhist <b>statues</b> made in the eighth and ninth centuries [3, 4]. Many <b>statues</b> in this period were carved from the single stem of a tree of Torreya sp., a peculiar characteristic of them. In the seventh century, {{the wood of}} Cinnamomum sp. was used for many Buddhist <b>statues,</b> that is, the wood species used for <b>statues</b> suddenly changed from hardwood to softwood in the eighth century. This major change in wood material might be needed to produce the single-bole <b>statues</b> using sophisticated techniques during that period. However, a question still remains about the process of transition to the production of Buddhist <b>statues</b> in the eighth century, that is, how the wood of Torreya sp. was introduced into the production of single-bole <b>statues.</b> Researchers who study Buddhist <b>statues</b> infer that Jianzhen, a Chinese Buddhist monk, influenced the major change in the styles of wooden <b>statues</b> after the eighth century [3]. Therefore, to clearly answer the question about the Buddhist <b>statues</b> produced in the eighth century, it is essential to identify the wood species used for the <b>statues</b> in the genus Torreya distributed in Japan and China.|$|R

5|$|Another theory {{found in}} colonial-era texts {{such as one}} by John Murraya missionary in British India and Jainism scholar, states the main image carved in Cave5 {{is that of a}} Jaina figure. According to a third theory, by Henry Cousens and A.Sundaraarchaeologists, and {{supported}} by local legends, the <b>statue</b> is of an ancient king; in a photograph of the <b>statue</b> taken before its face was damaged, the figure lacked the Ushnisha lump that typically goes with Buddha's image. The <b>statue</b> has several unusual, non-Buddha ornaments such as rings for fingers, a necklace and a chest-band; it wears a Hindu Yajnopavita thread and its head is stylistically closer to a Jina head than a Buddha head. These features suggest the <b>statue</b> may be of a king represented with features of various traditions.
