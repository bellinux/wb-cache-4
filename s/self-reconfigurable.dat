50|$|Self-reconfiguration is {{different}} from the concept of self-replication, which is not a quality that a <b>self-reconfigurable</b> module or collection of modules needs to possess. A matrix of modules {{does not need to be}} able to increase the quantity of modules in its matrix to be considered <b>self-reconfigurable.</b> It is sufficient for <b>self-reconfigurable</b> modules to be produced at a conventional factory, where dedicated machines stamp or mold components that are then assembled into a module, and added to an existing matrix in order to supplement it to increase the quantity or to replace worn out modules.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} methods of segment {{articulation}} that <b>self-reconfigurable</b> mechanisms can utilize to reshape their structures: chain reconfiguration and lattice reconfiguration.|$|E
50|$|One {{application}} that highlights {{the advantages of}} <b>self-reconfigurable</b> systems is long-term space missions. These require long-term self-sustaining robotic ecology that can handle unforeseen situations and may require self repair. <b>Self-reconfigurable</b> systems {{have the ability to}} handle tasks that are not known a priori, especially compared to fixed configuration systems. In addition, space missions are highly volume- and mass-constrained. Sending a robot system that can reconfigure to achieve many tasks may be more effective than sending many robots that each can do one task.|$|E
5000|$|Given these advantages, {{where would}} a modular <b>self-reconfigurable</b> system be used? While {{the system has}} the promise of being capable of doing {{a wide variety of}} things, finding the [...] "killer application" [...] has been {{somewhat}} elusive. Here are several examples: ...|$|E
50|$|Modular self-reconfiguring robotic {{systems or}} <b>self-reconfigurable</b> modular robots are {{autonomous}} kinematic machines with variable morphology. Beyond conventional actuation, sensing and control typically found in fixed-morphology robots, self-reconfiguring robots are {{also able to}} deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of their parts, in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover from damage.|$|E
50|$|Other modular robotic systems exist {{which are}} not <b>self-reconfigurable,</b> and thus do not {{formally}} belong to this family of robots though they may have similar appearance. For example, self-assembling systems may be composed of multiple modules but cannot dynamically control their target shape. Similarly, tensegrity robotics may be composed of multiple interchangeable modules but cannot self-reconfigure.|$|E
5000|$|A third {{long term}} vision for these systems {{has been called}} [...] "bucket of stuff". In this vision, {{consumers}} of the future have a container of <b>self-reconfigurable</b> modules say in their garage, basement, or attic. When the need arises, the consumer calls forth the robots to achieve a task such as [...] "clean the gutters" [...] or [...] "change the oil in the car" [...] and the robot assumes the shape needed and does the task.|$|E
50|$|A hybrid type <b>self-reconfigurable</b> system. Each module is two cube size (65 mm side), and has 2 {{rotational}} DOF and 6 {{flat surfaces}} for connection. It is the 3rd M-TRAN prototypes. Compared {{with the former}} (M-TRAN II), speed and reliability of connection is largely improved. As a chain type system, locomotion by CPG (Central Pattern Generator) controller in various shapes has been demonstrated by M-TRAN II. As a lattice type system, it can change its configuration, e.g., between a 4 legged walker to a caterpillar like robot. See the M-TRAN webpage at AIST.|$|E
50|$|Rus’ {{research}} interests include robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. She is known for her work on self-reconfiguring robots, shape-shifting machines that {{have the ability to}} adapt to different environments by altering their internal geometric structure. They do this on their own, without remote control, for locomotion, manipulation, or sensing purposes. She has shown that these <b>self-reconfigurable</b> machines could be used in many situations where the possible obstacles and constraints on movement could not ever be fully anticipated in preprogrammed control software (e.g., deep sea or planetary exploration).|$|E
5000|$|The {{roots of}} the concept of modular <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robots {{can be traced back to}} the [...] "quick change" [...] end {{effector}} and automatic tool changers in computer numerical controlled machining centers in the 1970s. Here, special modules each with a common connection mechanism could be automatically swapped out on the end of a robotic arm. However, taking the basic concept of the common connection mechanism and applying it to the whole robot was introduced by Toshio Fukuda with the CEBOT (short for cellular robot) in the late 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|By saying [...] "self-reconfiguring" [...] or [...] "self-reconfigurable" [...] {{it means}} that the {{mechanism}} or device is capable of utilizing its own system of control such as with actuators or stochastic means to change its overall structural shape. Having the quality of being [...] "modular" [...] in [...] "self-reconfiguring modular robotics" [...] is to say that the same module or set of modules can be added to or removed from the system, as opposed to being generically [...] "modularized" [...] in the broader sense. The underlying intent is to have an indefinite number of identical modules, or a finite and relatively small set of identical modules, in a mesh or matrix structure of <b>self-reconfigurable</b> modules.|$|E
5000|$|Being {{inspired}} form social insects, multicellar organism and mophogenetic robots. The {{aim of the}} Sambot is {{to develop}} swarm robotics and conduct research on the swarm intelligenc, self-assembly and co-evolution {{of the body and}} brain for autonomous morphogeneous. Differing from swarm robot, <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robot and morphgenetic robot, the research focuses on self-assembly swarm modular robots that interact and dock as an autonomous mobile module with others to achieve swarm intelligence and furtherly discuss the autonomous construction in space station and exploratory tools and artificial complex structures. Each Sambot robot can run as an autonomous individual in wheel and besides, using combination of the sensors and docking mechanism, the robot can interact and dock with the environments and other robots. By the advantage of motion and connection, Sambot swarms can aggregate into a symbiotic or whole organism and generate locomotion as the bionic articular robots. In this case, some self-assembling, self-organizing, self-reconfigurating, and self-repairing function and research are available in design and application view.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robot is {{a robotic}} device {{that can change}} its own shape. <b>Self-reconfigurable</b> robots are {{commonly}} built from mul-tiple identical modules that can manipulate each other to change {{the shape of the}} robot. The robot can also perform tasks such as locomotion without changing shape. Programming a modular, <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robot is however a complicated task: the robot is essentially a real-time, distributed embedded system, where control and communication paths often are tightly coupled to the current physical configuration of the robot. To facilitate the task of programming modular, <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robots, we have developed a declarative, role-based language that allows the programmer to associate roles and behavior to structural elements in a modular robot. Based on the role declarations, a dedicated middle-ware for high-level distributed communication is generated, significantly simplifying the task of programming <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robots. Our lan-guage fully supports programming the ATRON <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robot, and has been used to implement several controllers running both on the physical modules and in simulation. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a biologically inspired approach to two basic problems in modular <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robots: adaptive communication in <b>self-reconfigurable</b> and dynamic networks, and {{collaboration between the}} physically coupled modules to accomplish global effects such as locomotion and reconfiguration. Inspired by the biological concept of hormone, the paper develops the Adaptive Communication (AC) protocol that enables modules continuously to discover changes in their local topology, and the Adaptive Distributed Control (ADC) protocol that allows modules to use hormone-like messages in collaborating their actions to accomplish locomotion and selfreconfiguration. These protocols are implemented and evaluated, and experiments in the CONRO <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robot and in a Newtonian simulation environment {{have shown that the}} protocols are robust and scaleable when configurations change dynamically and unexpectedly, and they can support online reconfiguration, module-level behavior shifting, and locomotion. The paper also discusses the implication of the hormone-inspired approach for distributed multiple robots and <b>self-reconfigurable</b> systems in general.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{locomotion}} {{in the context}} of <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robots. <b>Self-reconfigurable</b> robots are robots built from many connected modules. A <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robot can change its shape and configuration by changing the way these modules are connected. The focus {{of this paper is to}} understand how several locomotion gaits can be represented in such a robot and how the robot can select one of these gaits depending on its configuration. We implement a control system based on role based control in a physical <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robot built from seven modules. In several experiments we successfully demonstrate that the robot can change from a sidewinder snake gait to a quadruped walking gait when the robot is manually reconfigured from a chain to a quadruped configuration.

The robot can also perform tasks such as locomotion without changing shape. We observe that the challenges in programming <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robots are similar to the challenges in programming sensor networks: a large number of lowend embedded systems connected using ad-hoc networking need to gather information using sensors and to communicate information to other systems in the network. However, there are significant differences as well, notably a <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robot must typically function autonomously and the network topology will evolve continuously as the robot changes its shape. Software for <b>self-reconfigurable</b> robots, beyond controlling shape-change and locomotion, remains largely unexplored, but we believe experiences from sensor networks to be applicable within this domain. Moreover, we present an initial design of a middleware for selfreconfigurable robots and relate it to similar solutions for sensor networks. ...|$|E
