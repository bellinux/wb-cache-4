Recognition of clusters of values was evident in their hand-drawn representations, with {{over half of the}} students focusing on the frequency with which the measured values occurred. Students' representations enabled them to gain a sense of the ‘signal in noise’ (Konold and Pollatsek, 2002, p. 268) in their data, that is, an indication of what the actual arm <b>span</b> <b>measurement</b> of the designated person might be.|$|E

30|$|With {{respect to}} the first {{research}} question (measuring one designated class member), the students recognised {{that the use of}} different measuring tools and how accurately they were used led to variation in values obtained and difficulty in predicting the student's actual arm span. Any outliers that occurred were readily detected and, if no such values existed, the students considered their cluster of values to predict the approximate arm span of the student. This reference to a modal notion was evident in the students' reflections on their accuracy, with recognition of the ‘most popular’ value/s as the likely arm <b>span</b> <b>measurement.</b> Variation in values, however, was considered by some to indicate less accuracy, as was {{the way in which the}} measuring tools were used.

This age-dependent induction is cell-autonomous, as it persists in hepatocytes in primary culture. We further show, using methylation-sensitive enzymes, a correlation between the life-time kinetics of this process and a liver-specific demethylation of the IAP promoter. These results strongly support a model whereby the progressive demethylation and turning on of the IAP sequence is the sole result of the transient, daily activation—throughout the mouse life span—of its promoter. This phenomenon, which develops on a timescale of months to years in the aging mouse, might reveal a general epigenetic—and stochastic—process, which could account for a large series of events associated with cell and animal aging...|$|E
40|$|Predictive {{maintenance}} of wind turbines could provide an estimated 50 % reduction in cost {{when compared to}} reactive maintenance, which is the current industry approach. The ability to identify damage using wind turbine operating data is necessary for implementing a predictive maintenance approach. Wind turbine blade damage is the most costly type of damage to repair and requires significant down time. Furthermore, blade damage often leads to secondary component damage, such as the low speed shaft bearings and gearbox. It is proposed that rotor mounted inertial sensors {{can be used to}} measure static and dynamic rotor blade responses to monitor blade health to facilitate improved maintenance scheduling for individual turbines. ^ In this thesis, free and forced dynamic response measurements on a 2. 1 meter horizontal axis wind turbine are used to characterize the rotor structural dynamics of a turbine operating in steady wind flow. Several blade damage mechanisms were initiated to demonstrate that rotor mounted inertial sensors are an effective means of detecting and characterizing blade damage based on the blade structural dynamic response in operation. It was shown that for a particular damage condition, trends are observed in the forced response linear spectra. Notable, the lead-lag measurement degree of freedom was sensitive to blade root damage; however, tip delamination was most readily identified using the <b>span</b> <b>measurement</b> degree of freedom. For the case of blade ice accretion, aerodynamic and power output indicators confirmed changes that were observed in the forced response spectra for the flap measurement degree of freedom. Additionally, operational modal analysis was used to verify the observed changes in the forced response linear spectra. ...|$|E
40|$|A tall-form spray dryer, {{equipped}} with a Spraying Systems ¼ J, full-cone, two-fluid nozzle, was instrumented and commissioned {{for the purpose of}} investigating control of the spray droplet size distribution and the effect of such control on the product powder properties. A Malvern Instruments Particle Sizer provided online measurement of the droplet size distribution. The volume-surface mean diameter of pure water and 2 wgt% sodium nitrate sprays was successfully controlled by a software-based, proportional-integral controller. Electron microscope photographs indicated that control of the powder volume-surface mean diameter might be achieved but was not attainable with the available equipment. The distribution log <b>span</b> <b>measurement</b> proved too noisy to control adequately. A theoretical model of the variation in droplet volume concentration and droplet diameter as functions of radial distance from the spray axis was developed using laser-obscuration data from the Particle Sizer. Errors in the measured volume-surface mean diameter and log span of up to 50 % were predicted as a result of radial non-homogeneities in the spray. Use of the model in a control algorithm would allow control of the true volume-surface mean diameter and log span. The evolution of the volume-surface mean diameter and the log span, as functions of axial distance from the atomizing nozzle, were measured. The volume-surface mean diameter was found to decrease as droplet breakup occurred, pass through a sharp minimum and increase with droplet agglomeration. The distribution log span increased with droplet breakup, decreased as droplets agglomerated and increased again with drying. Electron micrographs of dried sodium nitrate sprays showed evidence of two distinct drying mechanisms resulting in predominantly porous spheres or dense, crystalline particles. The crystalline particles were thought to be produced by a mechanism similar to the graupel formation of snowflakes...|$|E

40|$|The Earth's {{rotation}} is not constant but exhibits minute {{changes on}} all observable time scales ranging from subdaily to secular. This rich spectrum of observed Earth rotation changes reflects the rich variety of astronomical and geophysical phenomena that are causing the Earth's rotation to change, including, {{but not limited}} to, ocean and solid body tides, atmospheric wind and pressure changes, oceanic current and sea level height changes, post-glacial rebound, and torques acting at the core-mantle boundary. In particular, the decadal-scale variations of the Earth's rotation {{are thought to be}} largely caused by interactions between the Earth's outer core and mantle. Comparing the inferred Earth rotation variations caused by the various core-mantle interactions to observed variations requires Earth rotation observations spanning decades, if not centuries. During the past century many different techniques have been used to observe the Earth's rotation. By combining the individual Earth rotation series determined by each of these techniques, a series of the Earth's rotation can be obtained that is based upon independent <b>measurements</b> <b>spanning</b> the greatest possible time interval.

40|$|In many {{geodetic}} (surveying) applications {{positions of}} {{points in the}} terrain need to be determined with high precision (cm-accuracy or even better). The Global Positioning System (GPS) is very suitable for this purpose. High positioning accuracy is in principle feasible when a relative measurement setup is used and in the processing procedure certain systematic errors in the GPS observations are properly taken into account. The largest of these errors {{is due to the}} propagation of the GPS signals through the ionosphere, the part of the atmosphere from about 80 km altitude. When the distance between the GPS receivers in the relative measurement setup is sufficiently short (e. g. a few km) it is known that these errors almost cancel, such that the positioning can be conducted using only a short time <b>span</b> of <b>measurements,</b> which is very favorable from an economical point of view.
