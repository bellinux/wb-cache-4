40|$|Presence of {{specific}} auxin-binding sites in <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> (Fragaria ananassa Duch. cv. Ozark Beauty) membranes has been demonstrated. These 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) -binding {{sites in the}} 80, 000 g to 120, 000 g fraction of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> membrane were pronase sensitive with an estimated equilibrium dissociation constant for NAA of 1. 1 × 10 − 6 molar. The minimum concentration of NAA required to stimulate <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> growth {{was at least one}} order of magnitude higher than the minimum concentration of NAA required to stimulate corn coleoptile elongation. This was consistent with the higher equilibrium dissociation constant (lower affinity) for auxin binding to <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> membranes than to corn coleoptiles. Twelve auxin analogs, ranging from very strong to weak auxins, were tested for abilities to stimulate in situ <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> growth and to bind (displace or compete with NAA) to <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> membranes. The observed positive correlation (r = 0. 74) between the in vitro binding to the 80, 000 to 120, 000 membrane fraction and the in situ biological activity of these analogs indicated that the NAA-binding sites in <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> membranes may represent physiologically relevant auxin receptors...|$|R

Freshly harvested <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> were treated with 0 (control), 0. 05, 0. 20 or 0. 50 g l- 1 BTH for 5 min.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} proteomic {{investigation of}} <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> ripening employing stable isotope labeling by peptide dimethylation {{was conducted on}} 'Mira' and 'Honeoye' <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit.</b> Postharvest physiological quality indices, including volatile production, total phenolics, total anthocyanins, antioxidant capacity, soluble solids and titratable acidity, were also characterized in white, pink and red fruit. More than 892 and 848 proteins were identified and quantified in the 'Mira' and 'Honeoye' fruit, respectively, using at least two peptides for each protein identification. Using the normalized ratio of protein abundance changes, proteins that changed two-fold or more were identified as proteins that are up- or down-regulated during fruit ripening. Among the quantified proteins, 111 proteins were common to both cultivars and represented five significant clusters based on quantitative changes. Among the up-regulated proteins were proteins involved in metabolic pathways including flavonoid/anthocyanin biosynthesis, volatile biosynthesis, antioxidant metabolism, stress responses and allergen formation. Proteins that decreased during fruit ripening {{were found to be}} responsible for methionine metabolism, antioxidant-redox, energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Our results show that strawberry ripening is a highly complex system involving multi-physiological processes made possible through changes in protein expression. This study provides new insights on the regulation of proteins during <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> ripening that lay the foundation for further targeted studies. Biological significance: Research on the postharvest physiology and biochemistry of <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> as a model of non-climacteric fruit ripening has been conducted for many years. However, the mechanism(s) for the initiation and metabolic regulation of non-climacteric fruit ripening remains unknown. Little information on <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> ripening is available at the proteome level. This paper is the first report of a quantitative proteomic investigation of <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> ripening employing stable isotope labeling by peptide dimethylation. Postharvest physiological quality indices, including volatile production, total phenolics, total anthocyanins, antioxidant capacity, soluble solids and titratable acidity, were also characterized in ripening fruit. Significant biological changes associated with ripening were revealed and proteins that change significantly under these conditions were identified. Therefore, our study links the biological events of <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> ripening with proteomic information and provides insights into possible mechanisms of regulation. Proteins that changed during ripening were analyzed through function analysis, which provides new insights into metabolic changes occurring during ripening.

Subsequently, the ability of multispectral imaging technology to classify fruit based on ripeness stage was tested using SVM and principal component analysis-back propagation neural network (PCA-BPNN) models.

A higher weight loss was observed for the untreated raspberries (16 %) than for the fruits treated with 2 % calcium chloride (5. 3 %). Similarly, untreated <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruits</b> lost more weight (8. 5 %) than those treated with 2 % calcium chloride – only 4. 1 %. The application of calcium chloride did not significantly influence the total acid content of the fruits. After 8 days storage the total soluble solids (TSS) had decreased to 10. 22 ± 0. 06, 9. 60 ± 0. 05 and 9. 65 ± 0. 12 in the raspberry fruits treated with 0 %, 1 % and 2 % calcium chloride, respectively, and to 7. 00 ± 0. 17, 6. 57 ± 0. 08 and 6. 35 ± 0. 04 in the <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruits</b> treated with 0 %, 1 % and 2 % calcium chloride, respectively.

Here, we report a FERONIA/FER-like receptor kinase, FaMRLK 47, that regulates both strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit ripening and quality formation. Overexpression and RNAi-mediated downregulation of FaMRLK 47 delayed and accelerated fruit ripening, respectively. We showed that FaMRLK 47 physically interacts with FaABI 1, a negative regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, and demonstrated that FaMRLK 47 regulates fruit ripening by modulating ABA signaling, a major pathway governing <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> ripening. In accordance with these findings, overexpression and RNAi-mediated downregulation of FaMRLK 47 caused a decrease and increase, respectively, in the ABA-induced expression of a series of ripening-related genes. Additionally, overexpression and RNAi-mediated downregulation of FaMRLK 47 resulted in an increase and decrease in sucrose content, respectively, as compared with control fruits, and respectively promoted and inhibited the expression of genes in the sucrose biosynthesis pathway (FaSS and FaSPS).

RESULTS: Threemethods of extractionwere used: solvent-assisted evaporation (SAFE), headspace solid phasemicro-extraction (HS-SPME) and liquid–liquid extraction (LLE). Ninety-nine volatile compounds were identified by GC-MS, of which 75 showed odor activity using GC-O.

Seventeen comparative microarray analyses revealed 15 genes that were differentially (more than 200 -fold) expressed in phenolics-rich versus phenolics-poor varieties. The results were validated by heterologous expression of the peroxidase FaPRX 27 gene, which showed the highest altered expression level (more than 900 -fold). The encoded protein was functionally characterized and is assumed to be involved in lignin formation during <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> ripening.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the effect of the type of coating and drying temperatures on the chemical and physical properties in <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruit</b> during storage. The model of experimental design methods used in the research is a randomized block design (RAK) with two (2) factors. The first factor is consisted of a type of coating that is beeswax 4...|$|R
40|$|Postharvest quality {{losses of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} during storage are global horticultural problems. This study evaluates the effect of gamma irradiation doses (0, 300, 600 and 900  Gy) on quality parameters and phytochemical content of <b>strawberry</b> <b>fruits</b> during storage periods at 10  °C. The data revealed the irradiation significantly reduced the fruits weight loss and decay rate at storage periods; in comparison with control (unirradiated sample) which gave the maximum value of these quality parameters. Neither radiation treatment nor storage period had significant effect on titratable acidity and pH of fruits. All treatments decreased vitamin C levels during storage but the anthocyanin contents increased gradually during the storage period and reached its highest values {{near the end of the}} storage period. <b>Strawberry</b> <b>fruits</b> treated with 600  Gy had the highest total phenolic content and antioxidant activity followed by 300  Gy. Irradiation stimulated the biosynthesis of some phenolic compounds such as, pyrogallol, gallic, catechol, chlorogenic and ellagic acid...|$|R
