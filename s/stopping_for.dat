5|$|Allowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the {{seventeen}} dogs left Cape Denison {{early in}} the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later. <b>Stopping</b> <b>for</b> the night, they took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges. The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half {{the weight of the}} party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second dog team.|$|E
5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the year, Robson had reached the top 50 {{for the first time in}} her career. She {{followed}} this with her first victory at the Australian Open with a convincing straight sets victory over Melanie Oudin. In the second round she played former Wimbledon champion, and fellow left-hander, Petra Kvitová. Robson came back after losing the first set to beat Kvitová in a three-hour match, to set up a third-round meeting with Sloane Stephens. After <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> several shoulder treatments, Robson was eventually beaten in two sets. After the Australian Open, Robson played six matches in Fed Cup competition that saw Great Britain earn a World Group II Play-off spot against Argentina. Following this success she went on to lose two successive matches, losing to Daniela Hantuchová in Doha and to wildcard Yulia Putintseva in Dubai.|$|E
5|$|Not all cyclists were {{competing}} for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists {{in the history of the}} Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.|$|E
5|$|Two laps {{from the}} finish of the 1998 British Grand Prix, Schumacher {{was leading the}} race when he was issued a stop-and-go penalty for {{overtaking}} a lapped car (Alexander Wurz) during the early moments of a Safety Car period. This penalty involves going into the pit lane and <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> 10 seconds, and the rules state that a driver must serve his penalty within three laps of the penalty being issued. On the third lap after receiving the penalty, Schumacher turned into the pit lane to serve his penalty, but as {{this was the last}} lap of the race, and as Ferrari's pit box was located after the start/finish line, Schumacher technically finished the race before serving the penalty. The stewards initially resolved that problem by adding 10 seconds to Schumacher's race time, then later rescinded the penalty completely due to the irregularities in how the penalty had been issued.|$|E

25|$|The {{automatic}} reset design permits higher field efficiencies since <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> stones is practically eliminated.

25|$|Most {{mass transit}} systems move people in groups over {{scheduled}} routes. This has inherent inefficiencies. For passengers, time is wasted by {{waiting for the}} next vehicle to arrive, indirect routes to their destination, <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> passengers with other destinations, and often confusing or inconsistent schedules. Slowing and accelerating large weights can undermine public transport's benefit to the environment while slowing other traffic.|$|E

Her next contacts were unfavorable for attack, and problems with her surface search radar hampered her efforts to seek out enemy shipping.|$|E

Eleanor was married by proxy on 29 March 1539, and set sail from Naples, 11 June, accompanied by her brother Garcia with seven galleys following. They arrived at Livorno on the morning of June 22. That same morning, Eleonora left for Pisa and halfway through, met Cosimo. After a short stay in Pisa, the ducal couple left for Florence, <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> a few days at the Poggio a Caiano.

25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get {{anywhere}} near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, at the , Räikkönen {{qualified}} 6th. In the race, he {{opted for}} a one-stop tyre strategy, placing him {{in the second place}} at the closing stages of the Grand Prix. However, during the final few laps, his pace was more than a second slower than those chasing him, including Nico Rosberg and Räikkönen's Lotus teammate Romain Grosjean. With eight laps remaining, Rosberg was able to take over Räikkönen for second. Grosjean then caught up with Räikkönen on the fourth last lap, but was not immediately able to pass him. At this point, the Lotus trackside operations director Alan Permane had a heated radio exchange with Räikkönen, commanding him {{to move out of the}} way. The radio conversation was widely noted in the press, raising questions about the health of his relationship with the team. Räikkönen eventually finished 7th after <b>stopping</b> <b>for</b> new tyres with only two laps to go.|$|E
