Usually, increased availability of resources is limited to major exercises, international conferences (WEF), or crises (e.g. the Libyan Civil War in 2011).

The <b>Swiss</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Assembly</b> has adopted a requirement that armed interceptors are to be ready 24 hours all day, but the Federal Council has not released the necessary funding. Meeting the parliamentary requirement would require increased operations at two air bases as well as modifications to civilian sites Geneva Airport and Zürich Airport.

500|$|However, in 1930the {{military}} and civilian leadership decided to establish an effective air force.

This is not, however, the case. Firstly, Swiss banking secrecy was not introduced in 1934, but rather reinforced; secondly, Swiss ruling circles performed the 1934 reinforcement without humanitarian motives in mind.|$|E
