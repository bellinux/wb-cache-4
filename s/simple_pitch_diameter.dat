5000|$|Thread limit or <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> {{limit is}} a {{standard}} used for classifying the tolerance of the thread <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> for taps. For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted H3, would have a <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than base <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> and would thus result in cutting an external thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits {{which is the same}} system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of 0.013 mm.Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.The <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> of a thread is measured where the radial cross section of a single thread equals [...]5 x Pitchexample: 16 pitch thread = 1/16" [...] = [...]0625" [...] the <b>pitch</b> actual <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> of the thread is measured at the radial cross section measures [...]03125" ...|$|R

50|$|When gear {{dimensions}} {{are in the}} metric system the pitch specification is generally in terms of module or modulus, which is effectively a length measurement across the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter.</b> The term module is understood to mean the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> in millimeters divided {{by the number of}} teeth. When the module is based upon inch measurements, it is known as the English module to avoid confusion with the metric module. Module is a direct dimension, unlike diametral pitch, which is an inverse dimension ("threads per inch"). Thus, if the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> of a gear is 40 mm and the number of teeth 20, the module is 2, which means that there are 2 mm of <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> for each tooth. The preferred standard module values are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40 and 50.|$|R

40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameters</b> of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the <b>pitch</b> <b>diameters</b> of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread <b>pitch</b> <b>diameters.</b> For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces male thread <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller <b>pitch</b> <b>diameter</b> dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces male thread control.
