40|$|A {{saturation}} {{mechanism for}} microturbulence in a regime of weak zonal flow generation isinvestigated {{by means of}} electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations. The study identifies a newsaturation process of the kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) turbulence originating from the spatial structure <b>of</b> the <b>KBM</b> instabilities in a finite-beta Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma. Specifically, the most unstable KBM in LHD has an inclined mode structure {{with respect to the}} mid-plane of a torus, i. e., it has a finite radial wave-number in flux tube coordinates, in contrast to KBMs in tokamaks as well as ion-temperature gradient modes in tokamaks and helical systems. The simulations reveal that the growth <b>of</b> <b>KBMs</b> in LHD is saturated by nonlinear interactions of oppositely inclined convection cells through mutual shearing {{as well as by the}} zonal flow. The saturation mechanism is quantitatively investigated by analysis of the nonlinear entropy transfer that shows not only the mutual shearing but also a self-interaction with an elongated mode structure along the magnetic field line...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the impact}} of growth {{opportunities}} on company value has been recognized since Miller and Modigliani (1961), relatively little empirical work has been undertaken to value growth opportunities. In this study the validity <b>of</b> the <b>KBM</b> model (Kester (1984) and Brealey and Myers (1981)) is tested on a sample of 278 large UK companies for 1987 - 1995. Applying standard assumptions, the value of growth opportunities is found to account for {{a larger proportion of}} market values than assets-in-place. However, tests <b>of</b> the <b>KBM</b> model cast doubt on the credibility of these results and the validity of the model. The KBM model is highly sensitive to the inclusion of inflation in the risk free interest rate, and with a real interest rate (which on theoretical grounds is preferable), the model ceases to provide credible results. The model also fails to provide results consistent with expectations derived from option pricing theory regarding the relationship between the value of growth opportunities and the value of assets-in-place. These limitations <b>of</b> the <b>KBM</b> model indicate a need for a reappraisal of the method of measuring the value of growth opportunities. ...|$|R

40|$|When solving {{clinical}} decision-making {{problems with}} modern graphical decision-theoretic models such as influence diagrams, we obtain decision tables with optimal decision alternatives describing {{the best course}} of action for a given patient or group of patients. For real-life clinical problems, these tables are often extremely large. This is an obstacle to understand their content. KBM 2 L lists are structures that minimize memory storage requirements for these tables, and, at the same time, improve their knowledge organization. The resulting improved knowledge organization can be interpreted as explanations of the decision-table content. In this paper, we explore the use <b>of</b> <b>KBM</b> 2 L lists in analyzing and explaining optimal treatment selection in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the stomach using an expert-designed influence diagram as an experimental vehicle. The <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> the appropriate treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the stomach is, as for many other types of cancer, difficult, mainly because of the uncertainties involved in the decision-making process. In this paper we look at an expert-designed clinical influence diagram as a representation of a body of clinical knowledge. This diagram can be analyzed and explained using KBM 2 L lists. It is shown that the resulting lists provide high-level explanations of optimal treatments for the disease. These explanations are useful for finding relationships between groups of variables and treatments. It is demonstrated that these lists can act as a basis for gaining {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying clinical problem...|$|R

40|$|RNA {{sequencing}} {{represents a}} major procedural simplification for nucleotide sequence {{analysis of a}} transcribed gene. Using newly adapted mRNA and cDNA sequencing procedures, we have sequenced 855 nucleotides <b>of</b> <b>Kbm</b> 9 mRNA, corresponding to the codons for the aminoterminal 285 amino acids. The inferred DNA sequence <b>of</b> the <b>Kbm</b> 9 gene differs from the parental Kb sequence by single nucleotide alterations in each of codons 116 and 121, resulting in Tyr [...] Phe and Cys [...] Arg substitutions, respectively. The Kbm 9 sequence is identical to that of another independently arising MHC mutant gene, Kbm 6. As both the Kbm 9 and Kbm 6 genes were generated by recombination between the Kb and Q 4 genes, our data indicate that the identical genetic interactions have occurred at least twice. The relatively large extent of identity between Q 4 and Kb {{may be responsible for}} frequent recombination between the two genes. The parents of the original bm 9 mutant mice had five identical mutant offspring, which can be explained by mitotic recombination in the germ cells, producing gonadal mosaicism in the C 57 BL/ 6 mother. Thus, mitotic recombination, and not meiotic recombination, appears to be responsible for the formation of {{at least some of the}} Kb mutants. Such a mechanism probably plays a major role in the generation of diversity in the major histocompatibility complex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When {{practicing}} secure programming, it {{is important}} to understand the restrictive influence programmed entities have on the propagation of authority in a program. To precisely model authority propagation in patterns of interacting entities, we have generalized an earlier formalism [SV 05 b] into “Knowledge behaviour Models ” (KBM). To describe such patterns, we present a new domain specific declarative language SCOLL (Safe Collaboration Language), which operational semantics are expressed by means <b>of</b> <b>KBMs.</b> To interpret SCOLL patterns we have built SCOLLAR: a model checker and generator based on constraint logic programming. SCOLLAR not only indicates whether the safety requirements are guaranteed by the restricted behaviour of partially trusted subjects, but also lists the different ways in which the behaviour of a trusted entity can be restricted to guarantee the safety properties without restricting its required functionality and (re-) usability. The tool helps programmers to build correct trusted components that can safely interact with partially trusted and untrusted components. ...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} and bifurcations of a harmonic oscillator with a hysteretic restoring force and sinusoidal excitation are investigated. A multilinear model of hysteresis is presented. A hybrid system approach {{is used to}} formulate and study the problem. A novel method for obtaining exact transient and steady state response {{of the system is}} discussed. Simple periodic orbits of the system are analyzed using the KBM method and an analytic criterion for existence of bound and unbound resonance is derived. Results <b>of</b> <b>KBM</b> analysis are compared with those from numerical simulations. Stability and bifurcations of higher period orbits are studied using Poincar?e maps. The Poincar?e map for the system is constructed by composing the corresponding maps for the individual subsystems of the hybrid system. The novelty of this work lies in a.) the study of a multilinear model of hysteresis, and, b.) developing a methodology for obtaining the exact transient and steady state response of the system...|$|R
40|$|The Ku-binding motif (KBM) {{is a short}} peptide module first {{identified}} in APLF that we now show is also present in Werner syndrome protein (WRN) and in Modulator of retrovirus infection homologue (MRI).

We show that WRN possesses two KBMs; one at the N terminus next to the exonuclease domain and one at the C terminus next to an XLF-like motif. We reveal that the WRN C-terminal KBM and XLF-like motif function cooperatively to bind Ku complexes and that the N-terminal KBM mediates Ku-dependent stimulation of WRN exonuclease activity. We also show that WRN accelerates DSB repair by a mechanism requiring both KBMs, demonstrating the importance of WRN interaction with Ku.
