40|$|This paper {{describes}} the theoretical-experimental study of an auto-adjustable <b>stroke</b> <b>end</b> cushioning device utilized in hydraulic cylinders, focusing {{the characterization of}} the bush geometry effect on the cushioning achieved. A nonlinear model is presented which includes the physical phenomena that exert a significant influence {{on the performance of}} this hydraulic component, such as: friction, fluid compressibility and pressure energy loss in the cushioning section. The model is validated through the comparison between theoretical and experimental results, under different conditions of load, supply pressure and piston speed. From this point it is possible to obtain a model applicable for the design of <b>stroke</b> <b>end</b> cushioning devices in hydraulic cylinders. Consequent contributions related to proportional directional valves modeling are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{functional}} automotive part, reaction shaft support, was fabricated {{by local}} squeeze and vacuum Diecasting (LSVD) with light-weight Al- 15 %Si hypereutectic alloy which has good fluidity and excellent wear resistance. The effects of local squeezing pressure and time-lag of LSVD process on the microstructure {{of the product}} were investigated. Measurement of specific gravity with the change of local squeeze pressure and time-lag showed that the local squeezing effect can be increased by increasing squeeze pressure and decreasing time-lag. However, too high a squeeze pressure and too a low time-lag brought about insufficient squeezing effect due to instant movement to the squeeze plunger <b>stroke</b> <b>end</b> point. Through the combination of vacuum suction before melt injection and local squeezing after melt injection in LSVD process, light-weight Al- 15 %Si alloy reaction shaft support was successfully developed, resulting in excellent microstructural and mechanical propertie...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly and {{is associated with}} significant cardiovascular adverse effects. The authors tested the hypothesis that, in patients with type II diabetes, intensive glucose control as evidenced by lowering the glycated hemoglobin level to to = 6. 5 % would result in lower rates of major microvascular and macrovascular events. There were 11, 140 patients with Type 2 diabetes who {{were randomly assigned to}} undergo standard glucose control or intensive glucose control. Intensive glucose control was achieved with the use of gliclazide (modified release) and other drugs as required to reach a glycated hemoglobin = 6. 5 %. Primary end points were composites of major microvascular events (new or worsening nephropathy or retinopathy) or macrovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal <b>stroke).</b> <b>End</b> points were assessed both jointly and separately.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} stroke {{risk factors}} in Goteborg, Sweden, during 1970 - 1973 {{a cohort of}} 7, 495 participating men from a general population sample of 9, 998 men aged 47 - 55 years were examined with respect to cardiovascular risk factors. Men with hypertension and hypercholes-terolemia and men who were heavy smokers were treated. We assessed <b>stroke</b> <b>end</b> points and cause-specific mortality using a stroke register and death certificates. During a mean follow-up of 11. 8 years, 230 strokes occurred in the entire population sample (participants and nonparticipants) (7 % subarachnoid hemorrhages, 13 % intracerebral hemorrhages, 42 % cere-bral infarctions, and 38 % unspecified strokes). Using univariate analysis, we found measured high blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), smoking, known hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke in either parent, severe psychological stress, marital status, atrial fibrillation, previous transient ischemic attacks, previous myocardial infarction, effort-induced chest pain, and intermittent claudication to be significantly related to all stroke. Of the stroke types, subarachnoid hemorrhage {{was not related to}} any of these indicators, and intracerebral hemorrhage was related only to measured high blood pressure. Using multivariate analyses, we found measured high blood pressure, smoking, and severe psychological stress as well as atria...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{assess a}} robotic device (Handexos) during {{the design process}} with regard to usability, end user {{satisfaction}} and safety, (2) to determine whether Handexos can improve the {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients and stroke patients with upper-limb dysfunction. Methods: During a 2 -year development stage of the device, a total of 37 participants (aged 22 – 68), 28 clinicians (experts) and nine patients with SCI or <b>stroke</b> (<b>end</b> users) were included in a user-centered design process featuring usability tests. They performed five grasps wearing the device. The assessments were obtained {{at the end of the}} session by filling out a questionnaire and making suggestions. Results: The experts’ opinion was that the modified device was an improvement over the preliminary version, although this was not reflected in the scores. Whereas end user scores for comfort, grasp, performance and safety were above the sufficiency threshold, the scores for year 2 were lower than those for year 1. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that although Handexos meets the initial functional requirements and underlines the potential for assisting SCI and post-stroke subjects in ADLs, several aspects such as mechanical complexity and low adaptability to different hand sizes need to be further addressed. Implications for RehabilitationWearable robotics devices could improve the activities of daily living in patients with spinal cord injury or stroke. They could be a tool for rehabilitation of the upper limb. Further usability tests to improve this type of tools are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Pulse {{pressure}} (PP) {{remains an}} elusive cardiovascular risk factor with inconsistent findings. We clarified the prognostic value {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia in the Trial to Reduce cardiovascular Events with Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) Therapy. In 4038 type 2 diabetes patients, darbepoetin alfa treatment {{did not affect the}} primary outcome. Risk related to PP at randomization was evaluated in a multivariable model including age, gender, kidney function, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other conventional risk factors. End points were myocardial infarction (MI), <b>stroke,</b> <b>end</b> stage renal disease (ESRD) and the composite of cardiovascular death, MI or hospitalization for myocardial ischemia, heart failure or stroke (CVD composite). Median (interquartile range) age, gender, eGFR and PP was 68 (60 – 75) years, 57. 3 % women, 33 (27 – 42) [*]ml[*]min− 1 per 1. 73 [*]m 2 and 60 (50 – 74) mm[*]Hg. During 29. 1 months (median) follow-up, the number of events for composite CVD, MI, stroke and ESRD was 1010, 253, 154 and 668. In unadjusted analyses, higher quartiles of PP were associated with higher rates per 100 years of follow-up of all end points (P 0. 04), except stroke (P= 0. 52). Adjusted hazard ratios (95 % confidence interval) per one quartile increase in PP were 1. 06 (0. 99 – 1. 26) for MI, 0. 96 (0. 83 – 1. 11) for stroke, 1. 01 (0. 94 – 1. 09) for ESRD and 1. 01 (0. 96 – 1. 07) for CVD composite. Results were similar in continuous analyses of PP (per 10 [*]mm[*]Hg). In patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD and anemia, PP did not independently predict cardiovascular events or ESRD. This may reflect confounding by aggressive antihypertensive treatment, or PP may be too rough a risk marker in these high-risk patients...|$|E

40|$|Direct drive {{wave energy}} {{converters}} using linear generators are attractive {{due to their}} high efficiency and reliability. Air-cored generators in particular are receiving increasing attention due to the elimination of attraction forces between the stator and translator and the resulting reduction in structural mass. In this paper, details {{of the construction of}} a novel air-cored linear generator are presented. A custom test rig is constructed for testing the generator, particularly with zero overlap between its stator and translator at the <b>stroke</b> <b>ends.</b> Predictive control for maximum power transfer from the generator is first proposed and tested as an alternative to methods employing linear position feedback and EMF estimation with sense coils. The control strategy is demonstrated to work correctly and it is shown that zero overlap at the <b>stroke</b> <b>ends</b> improves power generated per translator mass compared to complete stator-translator overlap during the entire stroke. © 2011 IEEE.
