To achieve this, mortar specimens were immersed in ponds <b>storing</b> <b>pig</b> slurry. Mortar specimens, of 40 ? 40 ? 160 mm, were made from four types of cement commonly used and recommended for rural areas.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the microbial community of a pig slurry was followed in a pig farm during 6 months. Sampling was carried out on all the different management steps of effluent: faeces, storage tank, lagoon of storage and soil before and after slurry spreading. Total DNA of these various samples were extracted and analyzed by PCR-SSCP, in particular for the archaea and bacteria domains and for specific bacterial groups. This study shows a relative stability in time of the dominant microbial populations present in the <b>stored</b> <b>pig</b> slurry. However, micro-organisms from the effluent could not be detected any longer in soil after spreading, using the SSCP technique. The dominant archaea of the flora of faeces and pig slurry were identified as hydrogenotrophic achaea methanogens belonging to Methanosphaera, Methanobrevibacter and Methanogenium. No aceticlastic archaea methanogen was found, {{in spite of the}} strong acetate content measured in pig slurry. SSCP bacte-ria profiles obtained, reflect a large bacterial diversity where 9 dominant phylotypes could be character-ized. Due to the complexity of the profiles obtained, three dominant bacterial groups were targeted: the Clostridiacea, the Bacillus-Streptococcus-Lactobacillus and the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides. Identification of dominant phylotypes was carried out for these 3 groups. The majority of identified phy-lotypes are close to uncultivated bacteria.

40|$|AbstractThe {{study shows}} that high rate {{anaerobic}} digestion may be {{an efficient way to}} obtain sustainable energy recovery from slurries such as pig manure. High process capacity and robustness to 5 % daily load increases are observed in the 370  mL sludge bed AD reactors investigated. The supernatant from partly settled, <b>stored</b> <b>pig</b> manure was fed at rates giving hydraulic retention times, HRT, gradually decreased from 42 to 1. 7  h imposing a maximum organic load of 400  g COD L− 1 reactor d− 1. The reactors reached a biogas production rate of 97  g COD L− 1 reactor d− 1 at the highest load at which process stress signs were apparent. The yield was ∼ 0. 47  g COD methane g− 1 CODT feed at HRT above 17  h, gradually decreasing to 0. 24 at the lowest HRT (0. 166 NL CH 4 g− 1 CODT feed decreasing to 0. 086). Reactor pH was innately stable at 8. 0  ±  0. 1 at all HRTs with alkalinity between 9 and 11  g L− 1. The first stress symptom occurred as reduced methane yield when HRT dropped below 17  h. When HRT dropped below 4  h the propionate removal stopped. The yield from acetate removal was constant at 0. 17  g COD acetate removed per g CODT substrate. This robust methanogenesis implies that pig manure supernatant, and probably other similar slurries, can be digested for methane production in compact and effective sludge bed reactors. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis indicated a relatively fast adaptation of the microbial communities to manure and implies that non-adapted granular sludge can be used to start such sludge bed bioreactors...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} part of the total phosphorus (P) in soil solution and leachates can be present as dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). The DOP may be more mobile than inorganic orthophosphate and thus {{it can be an}} important P source for surface water eutrophication. This paper describes a series of four experiments that investigated the effects of animal waste application to sandy soil on DOP leaching. The first experiment examined the effect of <b>storing</b> <b>pig</b> slurry on DOP fractionation, using gel permeation chromatography. Experiment two and three examined the immediate and long-term effects of animal waste application to soil in laboratory columns and outdoor maize-grown lysimeters, respectively. In the fourth experiment concentrations of DOP and total P (TP) in soil solutions at various depths were determined in a long-term field experiment. Results indicate that DOP in pig slurry is mainly found in high molecular weight (MW) compounds (Exp. 1). From the soil column more than 90 %, and from the lysimeters more than 70 % of TP leached as DOP (Exp. 2 and 3). In the lysimeter experiment (Exp. 3), leaching of TP mainly occurred in periods of low Cl and NO 3 concentrations, induced by high leaching rates. This may indicate that P transport in these periods was mediated by DOC or other colloidal particles. The field experiment (Exp. 4), showed that DOP as a percentage of TP in the soil solution increased from about 10 % in the topsoil to more than 70 % at 70 to 80 cm depth, which was mainly due to a decrease in MRP. Thus, DOP is an important form of P in leachates and in soil solutions in the subsoil, and characterization of this DOP can improve our understanding of P leaching from soils...|$|R
40|$|Pancreas {{transportation}} between {{donor center}} and islet production facility is frequently associated with prolonged ischemia impairing islet isolation and transplantation outcomes. It is foreseeable that shipment of pig pancreases from distant centralized biosecure breeding facilities to institutes {{that have a}} long-term experience in porcine islet isolation is essentially required in future clinical islet xenotransplantation. Previously, we demonstrated that perfluorohexyloctan (F 6 H 8) is significantly more efficient to protect rat and human pancreata from ischemically induced damage compared to perfluorodecalin (PFD). To evaluate the effect of F 6 H 8 on long-term <b>stored</b> <b>pig</b> pancreases in a prospective study, we utilized the split lobe model to minimize donor variability. Retrieved pancreases were dissected into the connecting and splenic lobe, intraductally flushed with UW solution and immersed alternately in either preoxygenated F 6 H 8 or PFD for 8 - 10 h. Prior to pancreas digestion, the intrapancreatic pO 2 and the ratio of ATP-to-inorganic phosphate was compared utilizing 31 P-NMR spectroscopy. Isolated islets were cultured for 2 - 3 days at 37 °C and subjected to quality assessment. Pancreatic lobes stored in preoxygenated F 6 H 8 had a significantly higher intrapancreatic pO 2 compared to pancreata in oxygen-precharged PFD (10. 11 ± 3. 87 vs. 1. 64 ± 1. 13 mmHg, p < 0. 05). This correlated with a higher ATP-to-inorganic phosphate ratio (0. 30 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 14 ± 0. 01). No effect was observed concerning yield and purity of freshly isolated islets. Nevertheless, a significantly improved glucose-stimulated insulin response, increased viability and postculture survival (57. 2 ± 5. 7 vs. 39. 3 ± 6. 4 %, p < 0. 01) was measured in islets isolated from F 6 H 8 -preserved pancreata.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) availability related to fertilizer type, catch crop management, and rotation composition on cereal yield and grain N were investigated in four organic and one conventional cropping systems in Denmark using the FASSET model. The four-year rotation studied was: spring barley–(faba bean or grass-clover) – potato–winter wheat. Experiments were done at three locations {{representative of the}} different soil types and climatic conditions in Denmark. The three organic systems that included faba bean as the N fixing crop comprised a system with manure (<b>stored</b> <b>pig</b> slurry) and undersowing catch crops (OF+C+M), a system with manure but without undersowing catch crops (OF−C + M), and a system without manure and with catch crops (OF + C−M). A grass-clover green manure was used asNfixing crop in the other organic system with catch crops (OG+C+M). Cuttings of grass-clover {{were removed from the}} plots and an equivalent amount of total-N in pig slurry was applied to the cropping system. The conventional rotation included mineral fertilizer and catch crops (CF+C+F), although only non-legume catch crops were used. Measurements of cereal dry matter (DM) at harvest and of grain N contents were done in all plots. On average the FASSET model was able to predict the yield and grain N of cereals with a reasonable accuracy for the range of cropping systems and soil types studied, having a particularly good performance on winter wheat. Cereal yields were better on the more loamy soil. DM yield and grain N content were mainly influenced by the type and amount of fertilizer-N at all three locations. Although a catch crop benefit in terms of yield and grain N was observed in most of the cases, a limited N availability affected the cereal production in the four organic systems. Scenario analyses conducted with the FASSET model indicated the possibility of increasing N fertilization without significantly affecting N leaching if there is an adequate catch crop management. This would also improve yields of cereal production of organic farming in Denmark...|$|R

It is well established that mitochondrial membrane potential is an important viability parameter of spermatozoa and it is intimately related to reproductive efficiency. In this manner, new technologies in order to improve the activity of sperm cells and, finally, the fecundity of swine herds are of extremely importance. Due to the lack of knowledge of homeopathic treatment effect on spermatozoa, the aim {{of the present study was}} to verify the effect of three different homeopathic treatments on viability of boar sperm cells. &# 13; Methods: semen samples were obtained from two sexually mature boars (18 mo of age). The boars were cross bred, with similar genetics of Pietrain versus Duroc, BP 450 progeny from a supplier company of similar reproductive performance animals. The animals were maintained in individual stalls, study conducted in Sao Paulo - Brazil. Three homeopathic treatments: Pulsatilla 6 CH, Avena 6 CH or both, compared to placebo treatment (sucrose), the homeopathic medicaments or the control were administrated as globules manipulated according Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacology. Each globule weighted 30 mg and contained sucrose as vehicle. One dose of two globules was added per 100 mL of diluted boar semen, which were chilled for 24 or 48 hours. All samples were labeled in codes in order to allow all laboratory analysis and evaluations being performed as a blind test. Data were tested for normality of residues and homogeneity of variances using the Guided Data Analysis software. Variables and interactions were analyzed by the PROC MIXED of the SAS package (SAS Institute Ins. Cary, NC). Adjusted least squares means (LSMEANS) of treatments were compared using the Tukey Test. &# 13; Results: The different treatments contributed to maintain acrossome integrity for prolonged periods of cooling over 48 hours.

Increased amount of sulphur in manure {{can result in}} toxicity and odour problems during storage as well as potential inhibition problems in case of anaerobic digestion treatment. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the behaviour of different sulphur feed contents on pig excretion via faeces and urine, to evaluate the speciation of sulphur forms excreted and to determine further behaviour of sulphur in pig slurry during anaerobic storage. The sulphurs content of 76 different raw materials usually used to formulate pig feeding diets was measured and classified. Total sulphurs content varied between 0. 5 to 10 gS. kg- 1 of dry material. For most of these raw materials, total sulphur content was correlated with sulphur amino acid composition. Then, two experiments were conducted with ﬁnishing castrated male pigs (n= 10; n= 20) randomized and individually housed in metabolic cages which allowed precise control for feed alimentation and excretion collection. Ten experimental diets based on wheat and on soybean meal were compared. They differed by the incorporation of different raw materials with different total S content (wheat malt, beets pulp or rapeseed meal). Total crude protein content for all formulations tested varied between 16. 5 and 20 %. Trials were realised during 20 days with 10 days dedicated for new feed adaptation followed by 10 days when urine and faeces were individually collected. At the end of the experimental procedure, the feed, faeces and urine collected for each studied pig were analysed for total solids, volatile solids, total sulphur and sulphate. Feed sulphur content varied between 1. 6 and 4. 1 g. kg- 1 of total solids. For all experiments, sulphur retention by animals was close to 25 % of the total ingested S whereas 75 % was excreted. Sulphurs were excreted as 100 % sulphate speciation form in urine and 50 % sulphate in faeces. With this dataset, sulphurs concentrations as sulphates in fresh pig slurries were determined and ranged between 0. 5 and 1. 7 gS. kg- 1 depending on the feed formulation. Behaviour of sulphate content of fresh pig slurry was studied with spiking raw pig slurry with different amounts of sulphate (0 to 2 gS. kg- 1) and volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic and butyric acids). Kinetics of sulphate consumption and sulphide apparition were measured. In anaerobic storage condition of pig's slurries, added sulphate was consumed within 3 weeks by a first order kinetics reaction to form solely sulphides.

There is a need to quantify the emission, to assess the effect of emission on NH 3 and ammonium (NH 4 +) deposition to ecosystems and on the health risks posed by NH 4 +-based particles in the air. To obtain a reliable estimate of the emission from these sources, the processes involved in the transfer of NH 3 from the manure to the free atmosphere have to be described precisely. A detailed knowledge of the processes of NH 3 transfer from the manure and transport to the free atmosphere will contribute to development of techniques and housing designs that will contribute to the reduction of NH 3 emission to the atmosphere. For this reason, this review presents the processes and algorithms involved in NH 3 emission from livestock manure in livestock buildings and manure <b>stores</b> for <b>pigs</b> and cattle. Emission from poultry buildings and following land application of manure, although significant sources of NH 3, have been reported in earlier reviews and are not included here. A clear description of the features that contribute to the total NH 3 emission from buildings will include information on stock class, diet and excreta composition, the distribution of emitting surfaces and knowledge of their mass transfer characteristics in relation to the building as a whole, as well as environmental variables. Other relevant information includes the quantity and composition of excreta produced by different classes of livestock and the influence of feeding regime; the influence of environmental variables on the production of NH 3 from excreta; how excreta is distributed and managed in livestock buildings; and factors that affect mass transfer of NH 3 in the building to the atmosphere outside. A major factor is the pH of the manure. There is a great need for algorithms that can predict pH as affected by feeding and management. This chapter brings together published estimates of NH 3 emissions and abatement techniques, and relates these to the factors listed above (excreta, NH 3 production, building, and mass transfer) ...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{language}} programs typically <b>store</b> {{words like}} <b>pig</b> and pigs as independent entries in their dictionaries, thus neglecting the obvious morphological relationship between them. Lexicrunch tries to induce such relationships from examples of root forms {{of words and}} the corresponding inflected forms. The program collates,he examples into classes according {{to the difference between}} the inflected form and its root [...] e. g. the classes for the plural noun inflection in English might include "root forms to which an -s is added" pig, apple, etc.) and "root forms which take -es" (fox, box, etc.. It then characterizes each class using a modified version of Quinlan's ID 3 procedure. The resulting rule will be along the lines of, "If a noun ends in -x, form its plural by adding -es; otherwise, add -s. " The program then needs to store only root forms in its dictionary; it can reconstruct plurals on demand by applying its rule. It thereby eliminates redundancy and compacts the lexicon. Lexicrunch's formalism for representing morphological rules wag influenced by the Two-level model of Koskenniemi. The program was tested on the past tense inflection in English, the first person singular present indicative of Finnish, and the past participle in French. It appeared to pick up most of the regularities in the data successfully. However, a meta-level extension to the program is indicated to enable it to capture regularities across its rules...|$|R

50|$|By 1928, the Lytton Quarantine Station {{facilities}} {{had been}} extended and enhanced. Vessels were {{met at the}} river mouth by the Health Authorities who boarded each ship (two launches were kept at Lytton) and inspected all goods and personnel on board. Suspect people and goods were landed at Lytton for fumigation and isolation. Jetty facilities permitted passengers to disembark on foot and a crane was provided for conveying sick passengers, luggage and stores to shore. A tram line ran from the jetty to the reception house. A permanent staff of a foreman assistant, two engine-drivers, a coxswain and four assistants was employed to maintain the facilities and attend to non-human quarantine, which included disinfection of luggage and materials using a steam disinfector (autoclave) with attachments for cyanide or formaldehyde gas. A bathing block permitted 10 cabin passengers and 20 crew, third class or deck passengers to bathe simultaneously. Separate accommodation in tents or troop huts had been established for Asiatics, with separate kitchen, dining-room, shelter shed, lavatory and bath blocks. Lighting was supplied from kerosene lamps. A water carriage sewerage system discharged directly into the river, with a chlorination chamber available for disinfection of sewerage as necessary. The medical officer's and foreman assistant's quarters were connected to the city telephone service and internal telephones served most of the principal buildings. A cemetery was located within the grounds. The Lytton facility functioned as a human quarantine station until the early 1980s, by which time the decision {{had been made to}} phase out human quarantine services. Arrangements were made for Kenmore Repatriation Hospital to provide observation facilities in the event that they were required, and in 1982 the Lytton facility reverted to its earlier role as an animal quarantine station, re-designated the Lytton Quarantine Complex and Animal Detention Centre. Facilities comprised a launch jetty, workshop, inflammable <b>store,</b> guinea <b>pig</b> area, imports treatment laboratory, utility buildings area, offices, stores, and animal quarantine detention facilities. In addition to its role as an animal quarantine centre, Lytton served as a communications centre, a base for south side shipping clearance and inspection, a facility for dealing with quarantine treatment and detention of materials, a training area and a depot for stores. Many of the buildings associated with the human quarantine station at Lytton were removed after the 1982 closure, some relocated to sites in the Lytton and Wynnum districts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract When {{not enough}} {{conventional}} autologous nerve grafts are available, alternatives {{are needed to}} bridge nerve defects. Our aim was to study regeneration of nerves in chemically-extracted acellular nerve grafts from frogs, mice, humans (fresh and <b>stored</b> sural nerve), <b>pigs</b> and rats when defects in rat sciatic nerves were bridged. Secondly, we compared two different extraction procedures (techniques described by Sondell et al. and Hudson et al.) with respect to how efficiently they supported axonal outgrowth, and remaining laminin and myelin basic protein (MBP), after extraction. Isografts (rat) and xenografts (mouse) were transplanted into defects in rat sciatic nerves. Acellular nerve allografts from rats, extracted by the Sondell et al's technique, had an appreciably longer axonal outgrowth based on immunohistochemical staining of neurofilaments, than acellular nerve xenografts except those from the pig. Among acellular xenografts there was considerably longer axonal outgrowth in the grafts from pigs compared with those from humans (fresh), {{but there were no}} other differences among the xenografts with respect to axonal outgrowth. Axonal outgrowth in acellular nerve xenografts from mice, extracted by the method described by Sondell et al. was longer than in those extracted by Hudson et al's method, while {{there was no difference in}} outgrowth between extracted nerve isografts from rats. Electrophoretic analysis of extracted acellular nerve grafts showed remaining laminin, but not MBP, after both extraction procedures. These preserved laminin and removed MBP in acellular nerve grafts. Such grafts can be used to reconstruct short defects in nerves irrespective of their origin. However, selecting and matching a suitable combination of graft and host species may improve axonal outgrowth...|$|R
40|$|DURING a {{study of}} the effect of various {{manufacturing}} processes upon the nutritive properties of milk, a superiority of evaporated milk over fresh whole (raw) milk as food for young albino rats was demon strated. It was assumed that differences in digestibility might be one of the factors responsible for the nutritive differences and trials were conducted to determine the correctness of this assumption. The literature on infant feeding is replete with references to the "ease" of digestibility of evaporated milk, particularly of its protein. The present study, however, deals only with completenessof digestibility and has no bearing upon the "ease " or time factor. Daniels and Loughlin (3) observed a less satisfactory growth in rats fed evaporated milk than in those fed quickly boiled milk or sweetened con densed milk. It was found that the manufacturing processes then in use permitted a settling out of salts from the milk and that when these were incorporated in the feedings the differences in growth were largely over come. Magee and Harvey (5) report poorer retention of calcium, phosphorus, and nitrogen in pigs fed pasteurized than in those fed fresh or sour milk. Morgan (7) studied the biological values of wheat gluten, whole wheat proteins, and casein both raw and after toasting at 200 Â°C. for 45 minutes. Heating lowered the biological values but affected digestibility only a little. Rettger (9) reports the partial decomposition of milk proteins with liberation of volatile sulfide on heating above 85 Â°C., the pasteurized and condensed milk liberating smaller amounts of sulfide than normal milk. Washburn and Jones (12) found that young <b>pigs</b> <b>stored</b> the nitrogen of raw milk somewhat better than that of evaporated milk. Some investigators, on the other hand, have found that the heating or cooking of proteins increases their nutritive value. Bateman (1) report...|$|R

40|$|Norway is an {{important}} fish catching and producing country and has traditionally used fish and fish by-products in feed for monogastric animals, the pig is no exception. Fish and fish by products are excellent sources of essential amino acids, healthy fatty acids, vitamins {{and serves as a}} mineral supplier. Extended use has, however, caused negative effects on pork quality in terms of fat firmness, off-flavours and off-odours. During the last years feed recommendations, for most pigs in Norway, have been: no use of fish or fish by-products in feed for slaughter pigs, maximum iodine value product (IVP) 57 /feed unit and minimum 200 mg/kg vitamin E. These limitations have challenged the formulation of pig feeds. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of different dietary fat level, fatty acid composition and of sex (entire male and female) on sensory, technological and nutritional pork quality parameters. Three feeding experiments were conducted using entire males and females of the crossbreed [(Norwegian Landrace x Yorkshire) x (Duroc) ]. Pigs were individually and restricted fed. Fat sources used were soybean oil, palm kernel oil and fish oil. Experimental diets varied in IVP: 31 to 118, fish oil inclusion in percent: 0, 0. 25, 0. 48, 0. 52, 0. 72 and 3. 0 and fat level in percent of dry matter 2. 9 up to 9. 6. The ribs, pork chops and mince for meat balls were shortterm frozen stored at - 20 ˚C for 3 months, and belly and neck were short-term frozen stored for 2 and 4 months, respectively, at - 80 ˚C. All products were tested by sensory profiling after short-term frozen storage. Long-term stored ribs, loins and meat balls were wrapped in plastic bags and frozen stored at - 20 ˚C for additional 6 months and meat balls for additional 7 months. The ribs were long-term stored in darkness while the chops and meat balls were exposed to light simulating normal retail display. Long-term stored bellies were stored for 12 months at - 80 ˚C with additional 6 months at - 20 ˚C. Fatty acid composition was measured in shoulder fat (outer and inner layer), in backfat (outer and inner layer) at P 2 location and in neutral lipids and phospholipids of M. longissimus dorsi (LD). Backfat firmness and colour, and meat colour were also evaluated. The results from the present study showed that the fatty acid composition of backfat, inner and outer layer and neutral lipids of LD changed towards the dietary fatty acid composition. Feeding low fat diets seemed to enhance the de novo fatty acid synthesis, producing SFA and MUFA, especially C 18 : 1. Pigs fed low fat diets had low percentages of the very long chain (VLC) n- 3 fatty acids, mostly C 22 : 5 n- 3 in backfat and in neutral fat of LD. These pigs had also a high C 20 : 4 n- 6 percentage indicating production from C 18 : 2 n- 6. Dietary soybean oil, giving a high IVP, led to an increase in the percentage of C 18 : 2 n- 6 linearly to the dietary contribution. These pigs were also low in VLC n- 3 and still the C 22 : 5 n- 3 was dominating. When introducing fish oil, high in VLC n- 3 fatty acids, a substantial increase in the percentages of C 20 : 5 n- 3, C 22 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 in backfat and neutral lipids of LD was found indicating a higher nutritional quality. Increasing the fat level, by use of other added fat in combination with fish oil, seemed to improve the wanted incorporation of VLC n- 3 fatty acids into both backfat and neutral fat of LD. Our results further suggest that fish oil and high PUFA diets can be used for slaughter pigs without detrimental effects on sensory attributes like odour and flavour on short-term frozen stored products. After long-term frozen storage rib, meat balls and belly were not negatively influenced by high dietary PUFA, or dietary fish oil up to 0. 7 %. Only pork chops from the highest dietary IVP group showed increased odour and flavour rancidity and intensity. Longterm <b>stored</b> belly from <b>pigs</b> fed the second highest fish oil inclusion (0. 5 %) gave no offflavour or off odour. Only tendencies to higher fish oil flavour in the long-term stored belly was found in the highest fish oil group. After reheating, bellies from the highest fish oil group had a slightly increased fish oil flavour and odour together with a significant rancid flavor and odour. Dietary IVP slightly influenced the backfat firmness. Higher firmness scores were obtained when the dietary IVP declined. Fat colour was less influenced by the dietary fatty acid composition. Phospholipids had, as expected, high percentages of PUFA but were also influenced by the dietary treatments. Both low fat and soybean oil diets gave higher C 20 : 4 n- 6 percentages and lower percentage of VLCn- 3 fatty acids than fish oil fed pigs. The supply of C 18 : 3 n- 3 seemed to enhance the desaturation and elongation into C 20 : 5 n- 5 and C 22 : 5 n- 3 but a decrease in the percentage of C 22 : 6 n- 3 when feeding these diets strongly supports the view that the synthesis of this fatty acid is very limited in pigs. Providing dietary VLC n- 3 fatty acids by using fish oil, these fatty acids were incorporated into phospholipids, now with the C 20 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 as the prominent Sex had an impact on fatty acid composition. Males had higher PUFA and lower MUFA percentages in outer and inner layers of backfat and shoulder fat and in neutral fat of LD. The percentage of C 18 : 1 was in particular lower in males, indicating a lower delta- 9 -desaturase activity as compared to females. In conclusion, it is possible to change the fatty acid composition of pork towards healthier products for human consumption without detrimental effects on important sensory traits. Care must, however, be taken when long term storage or reheating is intended...|$|R
