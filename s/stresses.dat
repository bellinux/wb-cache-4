In Modern English verse {{the pattern of}} <b>stresses</b> primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided).

Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong <b>stresses</b> in each line.|$|E

Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN).
