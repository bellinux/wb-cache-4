5|$|Exotic species (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by sticking to vehicle tires, <b>shoes,</b> <b>or</b> cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants of particular concern in the forest include spotted knapweed, yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, and cheatgrass.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots {{began to emerge}} in the professional era, taking the place of everyday <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|E

5|$|The TWHNC {{features}} {{a wide variety}} of classes in both in-hand and performance, including divisions for youth, amateurs, and professionals. Horses may be shod with keg <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> performance stacks; flat-shod classes are particularly popular among amateur owners who train their own horses. Leadline classes, for children under six, are a crowd favorite. All horses entered must be registered with the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, although some may be registered with the Spotted Saddle Horse and Racking Horse associations as well. Double registration does not affect a horse's ability to enter the Celebration.|$|E

However, traditional Japanese low tables and cushions, usually found on tatami floors, are also very common. Tatami mats, which are made of straw, can be easily damaged and are hard to clean, thus <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> any type of footwear are always taken off when stepping on tatami floors.|$|E
25|$|The Toda {{religion}} exalted high-class men as holy milkmen, {{giving them}} sacred status as priests {{of the holy}} dairy. According to Frazer in 1922 (see quote below from Golden Bough, the holy milkman was prohibited from walking across bridges while in office. He had to ford rivers by foot, or by swimming. The people are prohibited from wearing <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> any type of foot covering.|$|E

Twenty tons of flour - about four kilos per person - were also transported, but the barges contained no other food, cooking utensils, or tools. All supervisory personnel, two commanders and fifty guards, were newly recruited. The guards had no <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> uniforms.|$|E

25|$|Distinctive {{features}} on the male were a white scar on his forehead, a vaccination scar on his left shoulder and another on his left wrist. On his right foot, he had hammer toe deformities, {{which may have been}} due to wearing tight-fitting <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> possibly other reasons. After the examination of his body was complete, the young man was buried in the Tooele City Cemetery, after the case remained unsolved.|$|E
25|$|Acro dances are {{typically}} performed on hard stages with widely varying surfaces. Such floors differ substantially from a gymnastics floor, which is constructed by layering a standard surface over cushioning foam and spring floor. Whereas gymnasts perform barefoot {{and rely on}} the standard gymnastics floor for traction and cushioning, acro dancers seldom dance barefoot, instead depending on footwear such as acro <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> foot thongs to provide the necessary traction and cushioning.|$|E

25|$|Although high-heeled <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> boots {{have more}} often been worn by women, in various {{times and places}} they have been {{standard}} features of men's footwear too, either for practical reasons or as fashionable items. Mongolian horsemen {{were among the first}} to use heels as means to keep their feet from sliding out of their stirrups. Actors playing tragic roles in ancient Greek drama wore the buskin, a boot with a platform sole, designed to give them greater height over other actors.|$|E
25|$|Automobile brakes {{inherently}} rely on friction, slowing {{a vehicle}} by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this {{large amount of}} heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. Disk brakes rely on friction between a disc and brake pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In Drum brakes, brake <b>shoes</b> <b>or</b> pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.|$|E
