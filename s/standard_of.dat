40|$|This {{article is}} a {{follow-up}} on our previous work examining Canadian chiropractors’ attitudes towards chiropractic philosophy and scope of practice and their implications {{for the implementation of}} clinical practice guidelines. In this current study, we examined Canadian chiropractors’ attitudes toward <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> care, the organizations developing them and their relationship to the philosophy index. The findings indicated that there was no agreement about the definition <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> care among chiropractors, although there was strong support for the concept. Most chiropractors preferred that chiropractic organizations set <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> care - the strongest support was for the Canadian Chiropractic Association. Finally, we found differences among chiropractors’ attitudes toward <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> care and the organizations developing them with respect to philosophy. Empirically oriented chiropractors supported only a narrow definition <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> care limited to issues surrounding safety and diagnosis. In addition, empirically oriented chiropractors would only support the development <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> care by an expert panel of chiropractors. Rationalist and moderates supported the development <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> care by a broader range of chiropractic organizations. We concluded that successful implementation <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> care could occur if the CCA, in consultation with other chiropractic organizations, was actively committed to this initiative...|$|R

5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; <b>Standard</b> <b>of</b> Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; <b>Standard</b> <b>of</b> California, which became Chevron; <b>Standard</b> <b>of</b> New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; <b>Standard</b> <b>of</b> New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and <b>Standard</b> <b>of</b> Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP. Pennzoil and Chevron have remained separate companies.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} {{then turned}} {{its attention to}} the question of a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> proof in loss-of-citizenship cases.

The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> preponderance of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E
