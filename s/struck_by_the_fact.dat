5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E

[...] Writing in 1973, Lin Carter described The Face in the Frost as one of the three best fantasy novels to appear since The Lord of the Rings. Carter stated that Bellairs was planning a sequel to The Face in the Frost at the time.

50|$|Imad al-Dawla was not {{the master}} of the entire Buyid empire. Rukn al-Dawla, {{partly as a result of}} Imad al-Dawla's failure to send him {{military}} support during his struggles in central Iran, was relatively independent of his brother. Mu'izz al-Dawla, on the other hand, had been given support by his brother in his efforts to take Khuzestan, and was a subordinate of Imad al-Dawla.

Imad al-Dawla himself claimed the title of senior amir during his lifetime, and although he never officially held it, nor was entitled to do so, he was recognized as the de facto holder of that position.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "official" [...] {{version of}} Lavoisier's Easter Memoir {{appeared}} in 1778. In the intervening period Lavoisier had {{ample time to}} repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but [...] "nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air" [...] or the [...] "eminently respirable part of the air". The same year he coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning [...] "acid former". He was <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle.|$|E

[...] A decade later, Guthrie's poem was set to music and given a haunting melody by a schoolteacher named Martin Hoffman.

40|$|If we glance {{again at}} <b>the</b> {{classification}} proposed <b>by</b> Andrewes and Horder we are <b>struck</b> at once <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that no {{hard and fast}} differences in fermentative properties characterize the various groups, and that the authors prefer to have recourse to the most frequent habitat of the organisms and to chemical tests, rather than to confine themselves to the latter method alone. From what has been said earlier in this paper, it becomes clear at once that <b>the</b> results gained <b>by</b> these authors are not convincing, for in their work they have failed to use the most favorable medium for growth of the organisms. And thus it can hardly be doubted that different reactions might have been obtained, under <b>the</b> conditions adopted <b>by</b> us. How otherwise could <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> be explained that of thirty-four of their pneumococci only eight fermented inulin. We had a similar experience while using the plain broth which led us to reject it as an unfavorable medium. Further, all our pneumococci fermented lactose with great rapidity. Andrewes and Horder report that eight of their series left lactose unchanged. Taking our own tests into consideration we find that working with but {{a small number of}} carbohydrates we were able to find six different varieties of streptococci among only 33 pathogenic strains. Which of the various substances is to decide us in the grouping of the organisms? Would we not find even greater variations from the most common type (see No. 4 in table) if we were to extend our tests over a larger series of chemical agents? These questions are difficult to answer and only extended experimentation with a great many streptococci and many media will clear up the doubtful points. In concluding it may be stated: 1. Streptococci vary considerably in their ability to produce acid from various carbohydrates. 2. Chemical tests of this kind should be made only in the media which are most favorable for the growth of the organisms. 3. Our results gave us six groups of streptococci, when tested upon dextrose, levulose, galactose, maltose, saccharose, lactose, inulin, dextrin and mannite, viz. : Those fermenting (1) all; (2) all but mannite; (3) all but inulin; (4) all but inulin and mannite; (5) all but inulin and lactose; and (6) all but inulin, mannite and saccharose. 4. In view of the comparatively small number of streptococci employed we are hardly warranted in making a definite classification. Perhaps a larger series of tests upon the media employed will enable us to divide streptococci into distinct classes characterized by certain fixed fermentative properties...|$|R

It would be intelligible enough that the mountains should rise gradually higher and higher towards {{the middle of the}} chain, so that the summit at a in the upper diagram of Fig. 23 should be concealed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> intermediate eminences b, c, from the valley at d. But this is not, <b>by</b> any means, <b>the</b> manner in which the concealment is effected. The great peaks stand, as at a in the lower diagram, jagged, sharp, and suddenly starting out of a comparatively tame mass of elevated land, through which the trench of the valley of the Rhone is cut, as at c. The subdivision of the bank at b by thousands of ravines, and its rise, here and there, into more or less notable summits, conceal <b>the</b> real <b>fact</b> of <b>the</b> structure from a casual observer. But the longer I stayed among the Alps, and the more closely I examined them, the more I was <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> one broad <b>fact</b> of their being a vast Alpine plateau, or mass of elevated land, upon which nearly all the highest peaks stood like children set upon a table, removed, in most cases, far back {{from the edge of the}} plateau, as if for fear of their falling. And the most majestic scenes in the Alps are produced, not so much by any violation of this law, as <b>by</b> one of <b>the</b> great peaks having apparently walked to the edge of the table to look over, and thus showing itself suddenly above the valley in its full height. This is the case with the Wetterhorn and Eiger at Grindelwald, and with the Grande Jorasse, above the Col de Ferret. But the raised bank or table is always intelligibly in existence, even in these apparently exceptional cases; and, for the most part, the great peaks are not allowed to come to the edge of it, but remain like the keeps of castles far withdrawn, surrounded, league beyond league, by comparatively level fields of mountain, over which the lapping sheets of glacier writhe and flow, foaming about the feet of the dark central crests like the surf of an enormous sea-breaker hurled over a rounded rock, and islanding some fragment of it in the midst. And the result of this arrangement is a kind of division of the whole of Switzerland into an upper and lower mountain-world; the lower world consisting of rich valleys bordered by steep, but easily accessible, wooded banks of mountain, more or less divided by ravines, through which glimpses are caught of the higher Alps; the upper world, reached after the first steep banks, of 3000 or 4000 feet in height, have been surmounted, consisting of comparatively level but most desolate tracts of moor and rock, half covered by glacier, and stretching to the feet of the true pinnacles of the chain.|$|R
