5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched {{what he had in}} mind, Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a <b>sales</b> <b>network</b> was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E

25|$|Part of European {{trade was}} by sea along the Atlantic coast. The English, then the Dutch and Scandinavians from their demand for wine, created a craze for {{planting}} between Bordeaux and La Rochelle. Little {{dry white wine}} was produced for export from La Rochelle while Bordeaux exported mainly wines from the hinterland received via the Garonne. When wine production was introduced {{on the banks of}} the Charente in the 17th century, Charente white wines were introduced as cognac. At the same time, the dry white wine popular with the Dutch was produced to the north, around the port of Nantes from the current areas of Muscadet AOC and Gros-plant AOVDQS in the Loire Valley. Vineyards in the Loire Valley and the South-west had their <b>sales</b> <b>network</b> thanks to the navigability of the Loire and the Garonne.|$|E

It was only sold in {{right-hand}} drive markets like New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Singapore because left-hand drive variants were not produced. Proton attempted to enter the American market in November 1988, but failed to meet strict US automotive regulations. However, the Proton Wira, which launched in 1993 became the company's first car to be produced in both left and right-hand drive configurations, paving the way for Proton's entry into Continental Europe in October 1994 and other markets in the Middle East and Latin America. The company's global <b>sales</b> <b>network</b> peaked between 1994 and the early 2000s, but has since dwindled to around 25 countries as of the 2010s.

Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E
500|$|Sales {{were very}} good, and Ziff-Davis was {{sufficiently}} impressed {{to move the}} magazine from a quarterly to a bimonthly schedule after only two issues, and to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest-size to match Fantastic. [...] Shortly afterwards the decision was taken to eliminate Fantastic Adventures: the March 1953 issue was the last, and the May–June 1953 issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead, though this disappeared with the following issue. [...] Payment started at two cents per word for all rights, but could go up to ten cents at the editor's discretion; this put Fantastic in the second echelon of magazines, behind markets such as Astounding and Galaxy. The experiment with quality fiction did not last; circulation dropped, which led to budget cuts, and in turn {{the quality of the}} fiction fell. [...] Browne had wanted to separate Fantastic from Amazings pulp roots, but now found he had to print more science fiction (sf) and less fantasy in order to attract Amazings readers to its sister magazine. [...] Fantastics poor results were probably a consequence of the overloaded sf magazine market; far more magazines appeared in the early 1950s than the market was able to support. [...] Ziff-Davis sales staff were able to help sell Fantastic and Amazing along with the technical magazines that it published, and the availability of a national <b>sales</b> <b>network,</b> even though it was not focused solely on Fantastic, undoubtedly helped the magazine to survive.|$|E

Selling channels have become a distinctive feature of insurers, together with their products and services. Financial institutions must consider consumers' preferences with regard to distribution channels {{in order to reach}} as many consumers as possible.
