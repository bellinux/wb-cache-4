5|$|Reproduction {{occurs in}} winter; the male <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> the female and forms a cage {{with his legs}} {{protecting}} her while she moults. Internal fertilisation takes place before the hardening of the new carapace, {{with the aid of}} two abdominal appendages (gonopods). After mating, the female retreats to a pit on the sea floor to lay her eggs. Between 250,000 and 3,000,000 fertilised eggs are held under the female's abdomen for up to eight months until they hatch.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century {{religious}} hermits started inhabiting {{the caves}} on Mount Carmel, {{and in the}} 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites. Under Muslim rule, the church which they had built on Mount Carmel {{was turned into a}} mosque, later becoming a hospital. In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery. The altar of the church as we see it today, <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> a cave associated with Prophet Elijah.|$|E
5|$|Nag Nathaiya {{is celebrated}} {{on the fourth}} lunar day of the dark {{fortnight}} of the Hindu month of Kartik (October–November). It commemorates the victory of Krishna over the serpent Kaliya. On this occasion, a large Kadamba tree (Neolamarckia cadamba) branch is planted {{on the banks of}} the Ganges so that a boy, playing the role of Krishna, can jump into the river on to the effigy representing Kaliya. He <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> the effigy in a dancing pose playing the flute, while an audience watches from the banks of the river or from boats. Bharat Milap celebrates the meeting of Rama and his younger brother Bharata after the return of the former after 14 years of exile. It is celebrated during October–November, a day after the festival of Vijayadashami. Kashi Naresh attends this festival in his regal attire. The festival attracts a large number of devotees.|$|E

5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, Henry VIII {{sold it to}} Sir William Sharington for £783, who {{demolished}} {{the abbey}} church and converted the abbey into a house, starting work in about 1539. So {{as not to be}} incommoded by villagers passing close to his residence, he is said to have sold the church bells and used the proceeds to erect a bridge over the River Ray for their convenience. Few other alterations were made to the monastic buildings themselves: the cloisters, for example, still stand below the living accommodation. About 1550, Sir William added an octagonal tower containing two small chambers, one above the other; the lower one was reached through the main rooms, and was for storing and viewing his treasures; the upper one, for banqueting, was only accessible by walking across the leads of the roof. In each chamber is a central octagonal stone table, carved with up-to-date Renaissance ornament. A mid-16th century stone conduit house <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> the spring from which water was conducted to the house. Further additions were made over the centuries, and the house now has various grand reception rooms.|$|E

The Welsh Window is a large stained-glass edifice depicting a black Jesus, with arms outstretched, reminiscent of the Crucifixion of Jesus. Erected at the church in 1965, the Welsh Window <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> {{the front door of}} the sanctuary.|$|E

25|$|The square is {{surrounded}} by buildings that cover the ages of modern Manchester. From old Victorian warehouses and shops dating from the Industrial Revolution and Manchester's role as the cotton marketing capital to the new office block development {{which is part of}} the 21st century regeneration of the square. The building that visitors are likely to notice first is the huge complex of Piccadilly Plaza which <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> Piccadilly.|$|E
25|$|The highest part of Crag Hill is {{near the}} 'cross' where the four ridges meet. Moving further east towards Sail, the ridge tapers down with crags on either side. Scott Crags <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> Coledale and Scar Crag (not to be {{confused}} with Scar Crags) looks down on Sail Beck. Beneath Scar Crag is Addacomb Hole, a deep corrie without a tarn. By contrast {{to the west of the}} summit the slopes are smooth and wide, although still steep.|$|E
25|$|The halt was {{demolished}} by British Rail {{long before}} final {{closure of the}} line in December 1980 and little remains of it today. The crossing keeper's cottage survives in good condition as a private residence, but the original windows {{have given way to}} upvc replacements. The rails remain embedded in the tarmac over Peppin Lane and an old signal <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> the trackbed to the south towards Louth. The gate box was moved to Chappel and Wakes Colne railway station in 1985 as part of the East Anglian Railway Museum.|$|E

25|$|The main {{face of the}} fell <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> Thirlmere Dam, {{and appears}} from there as a sheer 500ft crag, the higher fells behind being hidden by the ridge. Raven Crag is most {{commonly}} climbed from the dam, via a steep waymarked path through the forestry. This ends with made paths and some short sections of boardwalk. The ridge between Raven Crag and High Tove can also be gained from Armboth, or an ascent {{can be made from}} 'behind' via Shoulthwaite. This can include visits to The Benn and the earth ramparts of Castle Crag.|$|E
25|$|This {{two-level}} {{station has}} two island platforms (one on each level) and four tracks. It <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> the south (railroad east) {{side of the}} roadway, but formerly spanned the whole plaza. Trains running into Queens stop on the upper level and Manhattan-bound trains below. The BMT Astoria Line (which to the south joins with the 60th Street Tunnel Connection and heads through the 60th Street Tunnel to the BMT Broadway Line) uses the two tracks west (compass north) of the platforms and the IRT Flushing Line uses the east two tracks.|$|E
25|$|Approximately five to {{ten months}} before her identification, they had {{discovered}} the unidentified person case on The Doe Network and believed that the Jane Doe was their missing niece, as the reconstruction bore a strong resemblance to her. Other characteristics, such as the height and weight approximation, were also similar. After the pair contacted authorities, DNA samples were taken from Criswell's immediate family members to compare to the then-unidentified remains. It was decided that the gravestone that <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> her remains would be removed and updated to bear the victim's name.|$|E

25|$|The Chronicle {{provides}} a mythic tale of Oleg's death. A sorcerer prophesies {{that the death}} of the Grand Prince would be associated with a certain horse. Oleg has the horse sequestered, and it later dies. Oleg goes to visit the horse and <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> the carcass, gloating that he had outlived the threat, when a snake strikes him from among the bones, and he soon becomes ill and dies. The Chronicle reports that Prince Igor succeeded Oleg in 913, and after some brief conflicts with the Drevlians and the Pechenegs, a period of peace ensued for over twenty years.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene is}} within a room where, at an open end on the left, a wide-eyed bull <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> a woman grieving over a dead child in her arms. The center is {{occupied}} by a horse falling in agony {{as if it had}} just been run through by a spear or javelin. The large gaping wound in the horse's side is a major focus of the painting. Under the horse is a dead, apparently dismembered soldier; his hand on a severed arm still grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. On the open palm of the dead soldier is a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. A light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head (the bare bulb of the torturer's cell).|$|E
25|$|It {{has further}} been {{suggested}} that John Milton's Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle (1634) is a sequel to Tempe Restored, a masque in which Circe had figured two years earlier, and that the situation presented there is {{a reversal of the}} Greek myth. At the start of the masque, the character Comus is described as the son of Circe by Bacchus, god of wine, and the equal of his mother in enchantment. He too changes travelers into beastly forms that 'roll with pleasure in a sensual sty'. Having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair, he <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> her, wand in hand, and presses on her a magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), which she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. The picture presented is a mirror image of the Classical story. In place of the witch who easily seduces the men she meets, a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue.|$|E

500|$|The Civic Centre {{tower is}} the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham's centre of local governance. The 15-storey white-brick {{building}} has housed {{the vast majority}} of the local government's offices since its completion in 1977. Standing at the summit of the town, the tower <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> [...] high. It was designed by Cecil Howitt & Partners, and the topping out ceremony was held on 18 June 1976. The Civic Centre can be seen as far away as Salford, Trafford, Wythenshawe and Winter Hill in Lancashire, and offers panoramic views across the city of Manchester and the Cheshire Plain.|$|E
500|$|After Quiriguá {{defeated}} its overlord Copán in 738, {{it brought}} massive blocks of red sandstone from quarries [...] {{from the city}} and sculpted a series of enormous stelae that were the biggest monolithic monuments ever raised by the Maya. StelaE <b>stands</b> <b>over</b> [...] high and weighs more than 60 tons. These stelae were shaped into a square cross-section and were decorated on all four faces. These stelae usually bear two images of the Quiriguá king, on the front and the back, in a lower relief than that found at Copán. They feature highly complex panels of hieroglyphic text that are among the most skillfully executed of all Maya inscriptions in stone. The stelae have weathered well and display fine precision {{on the part of the}} sculptors.|$|E
