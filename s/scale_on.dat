5|$|Hurricane Ioke, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Ioke, was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific. The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Ioke was a record breaking, long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific for 17days, reaching the equivalent of Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> three different occasions.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karl was a {{powerful}} Cape Verde-type hurricane during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the eleventh named storm, eighth hurricane and sixth major hurricane of the 2004 season. Karl formed on September 16, originating from a strong tropical wave that emerged off Africa. It rapidly intensified, becoming a major hurricane on two occasions. Karl peaked as a strong Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> September 21 with 145mph (230km/h) winds. It weakened as it moved northward, becoming extratropical on September 24 in the north Atlantic and becoming absorbed by another system on September 28. The extratropical storm affected the Faroe Islands, but no damage was reported there, nor were there any fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Otto {{produced}} days of torrential rain {{over much}} of the northeastern Caribbean in October2010. Otto originated as a subtropical cyclone lingering north of Puerto Rico on October6, and transitioned into a tropical storm the next day, the fifteenth of the 2010 hurricane season. Accelerating toward the northeast, Otto strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> October8, attaining peak winds of 85mph (140km/h). The storm began weakening due to incompatible surroundings and became extratropical west of the Azores on October10. Otto was the first Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to transition from a subtropical storm since Tropical Storm Laura in 2008.|$|E

5|$|On 15 February 2010, {{services}} between Brussels and London {{were interrupted}} following the Halle train collision, this {{time after the}} dedicated HSL 1 lines {{in the suburbs of}} the Belgian capital were blocked by debris from a serious train crash on the suburban commuter lines alongside. No efforts were made to reroute trains around the blockage; Eurostar instead terminated services to Brussels at Lille, directing passengers to continue their journey on local trains. Brussels services resumed on a limited <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> 22 February.|$|E
5|$|The Effects of Hurricane Dennis in Alabama, USA {{included}} $127million (2005USD) {{in damage}} and three injuries. Dennis made landfall on the Florida Panhandle as a Category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale</b> <b>on</b> July 10, 2005, before tracking over Alabama as a minimal hurricane. In {{preparation for the}} storm, about 500,000people were given evacuation orders, and the Red Cross opened 87shelters. As a result, all southbound lanes of Interstate 65 from Mobile to Montgomery were closed.|$|E
5|$|The F-4s {{and their}} crews, however, proved {{equal to the}} {{situation}} and claimed seven MiG-21s destroyed, {{almost half of the}} 16 then in service with the VPAF without loss to USAF aircraft. Olds himself shot down one of the seven, for which he and the other aircrew were awarded Silver Stars. Follow-up interceptions over the next two days by MiGs against RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft led to a similar mission on a smaller <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> January 6, with another two MiG-21s shot down. VPAF fighter activity diminished to almost nothing for 10 weeks afterwards, thereby accomplishing the main goal of Operation Bolo: to eliminate or diminish the threat of MiGs to the strike formations.|$|E

5|$|The {{experiment}} resumed at 14:00. Weil {{worked the}} final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi {{announced that the}} pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from paper cups.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical cyclone {{moved away}} from the coast and {{strengthened}} to the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale</b> <b>on</b> November1. It began a weakening trend on November2 while taking a wavering path across the north Atlantic Ocean. On November4, the cyclone started a general east-southeast motion, passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain. It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November6 and dissipated, although one proposed track, which is a modified track that differs from the official record due to new evidence or theory, was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a counter-clockwise loop over northwest France until dissipating the storm on November8.|$|E

Salisbury had to ensure that the fire for the interior scenes matched that of the already-filmed exterior scenes. Producers decided to extend the 10 September episode featuring Peggy's departure by ten minutes, meaning it would clash with rival soap opera Coronation Street.|$|E

5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global <b>scale.</b> <b>On</b> March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Dovi {{developed}} on February 5 {{from an area}} of circulation within the SPCZ near the northern Cook Islands. Dovi therefore saw favourable conditions throughout much of its existence. Due to a mid–level ridge to the east, the cyclone progressed on a southward track. Dovi eventually steered to the southwest, and continued to intensify steadily after fluctuating due to diurnal temperature variations, becoming a Category1 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> February 8. An anticyclone positioned {{to the west of}} the system moved closer to Dovi, providing an improved environment. After developing an eye later that day, Dovi attained its maximum wind speeds of 205km/h (125mph) sustained over 10minutes. The cyclone then again steered towards the south, encountering high wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. As a result, Dovi quickly weakened as its convection was displaced. While its outflow in its western and southern quadrants remained favorable, elsewhere outflow was deteriorating. On February 10, Dovi's minimum barometric pressure was 980mbar (28.94inHg) as it moved south-southeast at 11km/h (7mph). The weakening Dovi became an extratropical cyclone on February 11. The remnants continued drifting southwest; the Meteorological Service of New Zealand in Wellington stopped issuing information on it on February 13.|$|E
5|$|Due to low {{amounts of}} {{vertical}} shear, very warm waters, and abundant moisture, steady intensification was forecast, and the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm John later on August 28. Deep convection continued to develop over the storm, while an eye feature developed within the expanding central dense overcast. The storm continued to intensify, and John attained hurricane status on August 29 while 190miles (305km) south-southeast of Acapulco. Banding features {{continued to increase}} as the hurricane moved west-northwestward around the southwest periphery of a mid- to upper-level ridge over northern Mexico. The hurricane underwent rapid intensification, and John attained major hurricane status 12hours after becoming a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the eye became obscured, and the intensity remained at 115mph (185km/h) due to an eyewall replacement cycle. Another eye formed, and based on Reconnaissance data, the hurricane attained Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale</b> <b>on</b> August 30 about 160miles (260km) west of Acapulco, or 95miles (155km) south of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. Hours later, the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle, and subsequently weakened to Category3 status as it paralleled the Mexican coastline a short distance offshore.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Able in 1951 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the earliest forming major hurricane– a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding – however following post-storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder; as it became a major hurricane on June8. Though it developed within the bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season, Hurricane Audrey in 1957 became the earliest developing Category4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June27. However, reanalysis from 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3, making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 on record on July 8, 2005. The earliest-forming Category5 hurricane, Emily, reached the highest intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind <b>scale</b> <b>on</b> July17, 2005.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Allen was a {{rare and}} {{extremely}} powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane that struck the Caribbean, eastern and northern Mexico, and southern Texas in August 1980. The first named storm and first tropical cyclone of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season, {{it was one of}} the strongest hurricanes in recorded history. It was one of the few hurricanes to reach Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale</b> <b>on</b> three separate occasions, and spent more time as a Category5 than all but two other Atlantic hurricanes. Allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the Atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190mph (305km/h), thus making it the strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed. Until Hurricane Patricia in 2015, these were also the highest sustained winds in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debbie was {{an intense}} and {{long-lived}} hurricane that formed during August 1969. The fifth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, third hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Debbie formed on August 14 {{in the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and took a general northwesterly path until turning northward into the central Atlantic. The storm was characterized by numerous fluctuations in intensity, and it reached winds corresponding to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale</b> <b>on</b> four separate occasions. The hurricane bypassed the island of Bermuda to the southeast on August 22, before ultimately brushing southeastern Newfoundland with strong winds. It dissipated over the cold waters east of Greenland. Although Debbie {{had little effect on}} land, it was extensively researched and was subject to a weather modification experiment by Project Stormfury, in which it was seeded with silver iodide.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Josephine was a {{long-lived}} Atlantic hurricane {{that threatened}} the East Coast of the United States {{for several days}} in October 1984. The fifteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm, and third hurricane of the season, Josephine developed from an area of disturbed weather near the Bahamas on October7, forming with subtropical characteristics. It quickly organized, and gained tropical characteristics as it strengthened into a tropical storm on October8. Gradual intensification occurred thereafter, reaching hurricane status on October10. The storm headed northward, remaining well offshore of the eastern United States. Josephine strengthened further and peaked as a moderately strong Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale</b> <b>on</b> October12. On the following day, Josephine weakened back to a Category1 hurricane before becoming nearly stationary. It later headed northeastward and paralleled the coast well offshore of Nova Scotia. By October17, Josephine weakened back to a tropical storm, shortly before beginning to execute a cyclonic loop {{to the south of}} Newfoundland. While executing the cyclonic loop, Josephine became extratropical on October18.|$|E
