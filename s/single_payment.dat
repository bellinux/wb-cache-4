5|$|In December 2005, Kirchner {{decided to}} {{liquidate}} the Argentine {{debt to the}} IMF in a <b>single</b> <b>payment,</b> without refinancing, {{for a total of}} $9.8 billion. The payment was partly financed by Venezuela, who bought Argentine bonds for US$1.6 billion. As of mid-2008 Venezuela hold an estimated US$6 billion in Argentine debt. In 2006, Argentina re-entered international debt markets selling US$500 million of its Bonar V five-year dollar denominated bonds, with a yield of 8.36%, mostly to foreign banks and Moody's boosted Argentina's debt rating to B from B-.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy has}} evolved {{significantly}} {{since it was}} created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy. The 2003 reform has introduced the <b>Single</b> <b>Payment</b> Scheme (SPS) or as it is known as well the Single Farm Payment (SFP). The most recent reform was made in 2013 by Commissioner Dacian Ciolos and applies for the period 2014 to 2020.|$|E

25|$|Details of the UK scheme {{were still}} being decided at its {{introductory}} date of May 2005. Details of the scheme in each member country may be varied subject to outlines issued by the EU. In England, the <b>Single</b> <b>Payment</b> Scheme provides a single flat rate payment of around £230 per hectare for maintaining land in cultivatable condition. In Scotland, payments {{are based on a}} historical basis and can vary widely. The new scheme allows for much wider non-production use of land that may still receive the environmental element of the support. Additional payments are available if land is managed in a prescribed environmental manner.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, bullet or slug {{structures}} return the principal to investors in a <b>single</b> <b>payment.</b> The most common bullet structure {{is called the}} soft bullet, meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date; however, {{the majority of these}} securitizations are paid on time. The second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet, which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date. Hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons: investors are comfortable with soft bullet structures, and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee.|$|E
25|$|At some point, {{probably}} in the late 12th century, for reasons unknown, the dependence of the priory on Haughmond was challenged by Great Bricett Priory in Suffolk, which sued for recognition as the mother house. Bricett also demanded that Haughmond give up its control of Wombridge Priory, which was still less explicable, as it had no control at all over Wombridge. Haughmond eventually got Bricett to drop its suit for a <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> of 40 shillings. However, the underlying tension resurfaced between Ranton, a fairly large house to be considered merely a cell, and Haughmond. After {{an appeal to the}} papacy, an enquiry set up by Bishop Roger Weseham gave Ranton full independence, although it was required to pay an annual pension of 100 shillings to Haughmond.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, CBS {{struck a}} deal with Yahoo! to offer live {{streaming}} of the first three rounds of games under its Yahoo! Platinum service, for $16.95 a month. In 2004, CBS began selling viewers access to March Madness On Demand, which provided games not otherwise shown on broadcast television; the service was free for AOL subscribers. In 2006, March Madness On Demand was made free, and continued to be so to online users through the 2011 tournament. For 2012, it once again became a pay service, with a <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> of $3.99 providing access to all 67 tournament games. In 2013, the service, now renamed March Madness Live, was again made free, but uses Turner's rights and infrastructure for TV Everywhere, which requires sign-in though the password of a customer's cable or satellite provider to watch games, both via PC/Mac and mobile devices. Those that do not have a cable or satellite service or one not participating in Turner's TV Everywhere are restricted to games carried on the CBS national feed, the national semifinals and final (regardless of the broadcaster), and three hours (originally four) of other games without sign-in, or coverage via Westwood One's radio coverage.|$|E
25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every tax period a company {{would make a}} <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E
500|$|The Medicare {{payment system}} {{switched}} from fee-for-service to bundled payments.

In addition, the Medicare Part D coverage gap (commonly called the [...] "donut hole") was to shrink incrementally, closing completely by January 1, 2020.|$|E
40|$|How {{consistent}} is a <b>single</b> farm <b>payment</b> {{system with}} rural development goals? A new economic geography model {{is used to}} compare coupled subsidies to 'single farm payments' effects on the location of farming, agro-industry and non-farm activity between rural and urban areas. This abstract model features a majority of employment in service sectors, farming vertically linked to manufacturing, and strong preferences for geo-varieties. It appears that both coupled subsidies and <b>single</b> farm <b>payments</b> can decrease spatial agglomeration. But only the <b>single</b> farm <b>payment</b> policy raises welfare in both rural and urban regions of this stylised economy. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors.

This question is analyzed in a model of spatial bank competition to understand better the economic foundations of the <b>Single</b> Euro <b>Payments</b> Area (SEPA). An economic research perspective on the mostly informal policy debates about SEPA is developed. The analysis suggests that expectations about {{the positive effects of}} SEPA may be exaggerated as most channels for enhancing public welfare seem rather weak. Still the project may be worthwhile undertaking if the cost of creating SEPA-compliant systems is reduced by extending the time frame for the implementation phase and if the use of electronic payments is promoted.

[...] Charlotte {{was sent back to}} Cranbourne on 2 March, leaving Leopold with the Prince Regent. [...] On 14 March, an announcement was made in the House of Commons to great acclaim, with both parties relieved to have the drama of the Princess's romances at an end.

Fearful of a repetition of the Orange fiasco, George limited Charlotte's contact with Leopold; when Charlotte returned to Brighton, he allowed them to meet only at dinner, and never let them be alone together.|$|E
500|$|Kirchner and Lavagna {{negotiated}} a swap of defaulted national debt in 2005, a write-down to {{one-third of the}} original debt. Kirchner refused a structural adjustment program, and instead made a <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> to the IMF with Central Bank reserves. Although the economy grew at an eight-percent annual rate during Kirchner's term, much of its growth was due to favorable international conditions rather than Argentine policies. Argentina was benefited by the increase of the international price of soybean and other foods[...] However, some argued that this economic growth can also be attributed to Kirchners policies to increase domestic demand. [...] Foreign investment remained low because of the Argentine hostility towards the IMF, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the re-nationalization of privatized companies (such as the water supply, managed by the French company Suez), diplomatic isolation and state interventionism. The energy sector suffered, and lack of investment reduced energy reserves during the 2000s.|$|E

[...] "After years of piecemeal reform the current welfare system is complex and unfair," [...] said Duncan Smith, citing examples of people under the existing system that would see very little incremental income from increasing their working hours due to withdrawal of other benefits. Outlining the scheme in more detail in November 2010, Duncan Smith promised [...] "targeted work activity for those who need {{to get used to the}} habits of work" [...] and sanctions, including the possible removal of benefits for up to three years for those who refused to work. He said welfare reform would benefit all those who [...] "play by the rules" [...] and ensure [...] "work always pays more" [...] by easing the rate at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises.|$|E
