40|$|In many {{installations}} of castering rubber-tired wheels {{there is}} a tendency for the wheel to oscillate violently about the spindle axis. This phenomenon, popularly called 'shimmy,' has occurred in some airplane tail wheels and has been corrected in two ways: first by the application of friction in the spindles of the tail wheels; and, second, by locking the wheels while taxiing at high speeds. Shimmy is common with the large wheels used as nose wheels in tricycle landing gears and, since it is impossible to lock the wheels, friction in the nose-wheel spindle has been the sole means of correction. Because the nose wheel is larger than the conventional tail wheel and usually carries a greater load, the larger amounts of <b>spindle</b> <b>friction</b> necessary to prevent shimmy are objectionable. the present paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of the problem of the stability of castering wheels for airplane landing gears. On the basis of simplified assumptions induced from experimental observations, a theoretical study has been made of the shimmy of castering wheels. The theory is based on the discovery of a phenomenon called 'kinematic shimmy' and is compared quantitatively with the results of model experiments. Experimental checks, using a model having low-pressure tires, are reported and the applicability of the results to full scale is discussed. Theoretical methods of estimating the spindle viscous damping and spindle solid friction necessary to avoid shimmy - lateral freedom - is introduced...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{theory of}} shimmy damping is {{investigated}} including tire <b>friction,</b> <b>spindle</b> bearing <b>friction,</b> and hydraulic damping. A new theoretical improvement in hydraulic damping is presented. Experimental {{results are presented}} along with a discussion concerning the limitations due to the approxima-tions used in the theory. The basic theory of wheelchair caster shimmy was published by the authors in 1984, and an exami-nation {{of the sources of}} shimmy damping is corrected and updated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Double-stack disk {{friction}} {{units were}} used to produce good, high-crimp yarn like wool {{and the results were}} compared to conventional triple-stack disk friction units. The quality of false-twist textured yarn from disk <b>friction</b> <b>spindles</b> is very strongly influenced by unit operating conditions and untwisting tension. The authors previously proposed a method to derive tension and untwisting tension in the yarn given the twisting tension and yarn path in double-stack disk friction units. In this study our goal was to calculate both yarn path and yarn tension. We were able to compare and confirm that the calculated yarn path and yarn tension closely matches experimental results. In addition, we succeeded in using our model to predict conditions for guide hole to produce false-twist yarn. The validity of our model was proven by the results. We have succeeded {{for the first time in}} calculating approximate yarn path and yarn tension for the false-twist process in disk <b>friction</b> <b>spindle</b> units. Our results should be helpful in designing disk <b>friction</b> <b>spindle</b> units. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R

50|$|The {{radiometer}} is {{made from}} a glass bulb from which much of the air has been removed to form a partial vacuum. Inside the bulb, on a low <b>friction</b> <b>spindle,</b> is a rotor with several (usually four) vertical lightweight metal vanes spaced equally around the axis.

50|$|The strap drill {{is similar}} to the bow drill but has no bow. The socket piece is shaped to be held well by the mouth, so that both hands may be free. The strap is held between one hand and the other, and wrapped around the spindle, such that rapidly moving the hands left and right spins the <b>spindle</b> to create <b>friction</b> with the fire board as in the other techniques.|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to establish the dynamic model of a traveling-wave type ultrasonic motor (USM) with beam teeth via finite elements. The modeling is accomplished mainly by finite elements, the task of which consists of three parts – for stator, rotor and contact. It is first assumed that the complex dynamics of the stator emulates a single one-dimensional Euler-beam vibrating harmonically in the transverse direction. On the top surfaces of the stator are vertical beam teeth that is in contact with rotor, which is simply a thin disk fixed to <b>spindle.</b> The <b>friction</b> between the teeth tips and stator rotates the spindle moves the stator and finally rotates the disk to the desired speed. A contact model between beam tips and rotor disk with proper friction assumed is next built {{in conjunction with the}} established finite element model of the rotor disk. With a complete model in hands, the dynamics of the USM is predicted along with associated exerted torques. Experiments are finally conducted for collecting sets of data of rotation speeds versus torques that validate the effectiveness of the built models for the motor, stator and contact force...|$|R
5000|$|Costlier {{turntables}} {{made from}} heavy aluminium castings have greater balanced mass and inertia, helping minimize vibration at the stylus, and maintaining constant speed without wow or flutter, {{even if the}} motor exhibits cogging effects. Like stamped steel turntables, they were topped with rubber. Because of the increased mass, they usually employed ball bearings or roller bearings in the <b>spindle</b> to reduce <b>friction</b> and noise. Most are belt or direct drive, but some use an idler wheel. A specific case was the Swiss [...] "Lenco" [...] drive, which possessed a very heavy turntable coupled via an idler wheel to a long, tapered motor drive shaft. This enabled stepless rotation or speed control on the drive. Because of this feature the Lenco became popular in the late 1950s with dancing schools, because the dancing instructor could lead the dancing exercises at different speeds.|$|R

The dynamic {{characteristic of the}} oil film bearing is affected by temperature increment, thereby affecting the high-speed spindle rotor system dynamics. This study applied the hydrodynamic lubrication theory, the influence of temperature on the viscosity of lubricating oil, associated with the bearing stiffness, oil film damping and other performance parameters, is considered in generalized Reynolds equation of oil film bearing. The theoretical model of the sliding bearing rotor system is established by using the transfer matrix method to analyze the dynamic characteristic and verified by experiments.

40|$|Mn-Zn(Manganese-Zinc) ferrite polycrystals {{have been}} widely used as a core {{material}} of magnetic heads in video cassette recorders or floppy disk drives of personal computers. In this research，slot grinding was performed to investigate the chipping generation mechanism at slot edge of Mn-Zn ferrite polycrystal with metal bonded diamond wheels. A high precision slicing machine with an air <b>spindle</b> of low <b>friction</b> and low thermal expansion was used. After grinding，the chippings at a slot edge was measured by means of a form tracer with a knife edge tip，and analyzed with a newly developed measurement method using a personal computer under various grinding conditions. On the other hand，by means of SEM observation，a material removal mechanism at the edge of Mn-Zn ferrite was investigated. The results are follows. Pre-process，such as lapping，before grinding can reduce chipping size. Most of chipping is generated by transgranular fracture. As chipping size depends on the removal per grain; qw=α・μ 2 (Vw/Vs}，a decrease in removal qw， chipping size after slot grinding could be reduced...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrediction of the thermo-mechanical {{behavior}} of machine-tool spindles {{is essential in}} the reliable operation of high speed machine tools. In particular, the performance of these high speed spindles is dependent on their thermal behavior. The main source of heat generation in the <b>spindle</b> is the <b>friction</b> torque in angular contact ball bearings. This paper presents an effort to develop a comprehensive model of high speed spindles that includes viable models for the mechanical and thermal {{behavior of}} its major components, i. e., bearings, shaft and housing. Spindle housing and shaft are treated as six-degree-of-freedom Timoshenko beam elements. Bearings are modeled as two-node elements with five displacements and a thermal load component at each node. Mutual interaction between the thermal and structural behavior of both spindle shaft/housing and bearings is characterized through thermal expansion {{and the rate of}} heat generation/transfer. Components are combined to form a finite element model for the thermo-mechanical analysis of spindle-bearing systems. The results of simulation for a typical spindle system are presented...|$|R
