40|$|In the 1980 s Chile liberalized its markets, priva-tized <b>state-owned</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>companies,</b> {{and allowed}} the private sector the key role in invest-ment. Before selling the <b>electricity</b> <b>companies,</b> the state split them into {{generation}} and transmission companies and distribution utilities. The distribu-tion utilities were divided according to {{the areas in which}} they operated, but no exclusive distrib-ution rights were granted. The National Energy Commission (Comisión Nacional de Energía, CNE) was created as the main policymaking and regulatory body. A new electricity law established free entry and competition in generation, a nonex-clusive concession system for distribution, and a pricing scheme based on marginal costs, with generation charges reviewed every six months and distribution charges every four years. Rural electrification in Chile had traditionally been the domain of the state-owned power companies, which followed centrally developed plans and relied on subsidies from the central government or cross-subsidies from tariffs set above cost in urban areas. Lack of funding and pressure from other priorities made electrification slow. By the early 1990 s more than 1 million people— almost half the rural population—still had no access to any source of electricity (figure 1). By contrast, 97 percent of urban households had electricity supply. The lack of access was con-centrated in a few regions where most of the rural population lives. It affected mainly lower-income families, since the wealthier could usu-ally afford to install generators or pay for extension of the distribution grid. To increase rural access to electricity, Chile launched a rural electrification program in 1994. The design of the program is compatible with the overall electricity sector reforms—that is, based on competition, private investment and decen-tralized decisionmaking. The goal was, {{with the help of a}} subsidy, to turn rural electrification int...|$|R

50|$|The largest {{share of}} Kenya's {{electricity}} supply comes from hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper Tana River, {{as well as}} the Turkwel Gorge Dam in the west.

Kenya's installed capacity stood at 1,142 megawatts a year between 2001 and 2003. The <b>state-owned</b> Kenya <b>Electricity</b> Generating <b>Company</b> (KenGen), established in 1997 under the name of Kenya Power Company, handles the generation of electricity, while the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) handles transmission and distribution. Shortfalls of electricity occur periodically, when drought reduces water flow. In 1997 and 2000, for example, drought prompted severe power rationing, with economically damaging 12-hour blackouts. Frequent outages, as well as high cost, remain serious obstacles to economic activity. Tax and other concessions are planned to encourage investment in hydroelectricity and in geothermal energy, in which Kenya is a pioneer. The government plans to open two new power stations in 2008, Sondu Miriu (hydroelectric) and Olkaria IV (geothermal), but power demand growth is strong, and demand is still expected to outpace supply during periods of drought.|$|R
