5000|$|Alternatively, floating/barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> can be {{installed}} along with associated piping on the reservoir bed to pump water from the reservoir's dead storage into left and right bank canals and the approach channel of the existing pump house of Hyderabad water supply scheme during drought years. During the good monsoon years, when the reservoir water level is above the dead storage level, the same barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> can be used regularly to pump water into the existing high level (flood flow) canal (near [...] ) located on the left bank of the reservoir in Nalgonda district. Similarly, during the good monsoon years, a lift irrigation scheme can be taken up {{with the help of}} the same barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> to lift water from the reservoir (near [...] ) by 45 m height for irrigating nearly 200,000 acres of uplands situated adjacent to the reservoir in Guntur district. Thus all the installed barge <b>mounted</b> mobile <b>pump</b> houses can be used for regular pumping needs to maximise the water use from the reservoir every year.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 Under extreme conditions, pumps may be {{required}} to withstand severe nozzle loads, which often exceed the API 610 specified values. To meet these requirements, pump mechanical behavior versus nozzle loads must be examined in detail. Others have discussed shaft end displacement of centerline <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> under nozzle loads. However, the subject of stresses on the pedestal bolts and casing is a critical area that must also be analyzed. An in-depth study was made on the deformation and stress analysis of centerline <b>mounted</b> end suction <b>pumps,</b> whose stiffness were relatively low and were frequently required to withstand rather high nozzle loads. The nozzle load analysis consisted of deformation and stress measurements, combined with finite element calculation. The analysis resulted in a versatile empirical formula for end suction, centerline <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> {{that can be used to}} estimate the shaft end displacement, pedestal bolt stress and casing stress for arbitrary nozzle loads. This allows the determination of whether or not specified nozzle loading conditions can be tolerated by a given pump and pump support design...|$|R

50|$|In the 1940s, the LORD Manufacturing Company is incorporated. The {{company would}} supply engine mounts to many {{aircraft}} manufacturers.

Elastomeric compounds are also developed by LORD as substitutes for natural rubber for the Korean War in the 1950s. To isolate aircraft cowling, cowl mountings and motor-nose supports for locomotives are manufactured. LORD develops the outboard motor mounting for the marine industry.

50|$|On the road, {{the easiest}} {{approach}} to a flat tire, should a spare inner tube be available, is to replace the tube.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect that several {{different}} floaters' geometries have on the performance characteristics of tightly moored vertical axisymmetric wave energy converters (WECs). A cylindrical buoy with and without vertical and horizontal <b>skirts</b> <b>mounted</b> at its bottom, a cone, {{as well as two}} piston-like arrangements, consisting of an internal floater (cone or cylinder) and an exterior torus, have been examined and comparatively assessed. The WEC's first-order hydrodynamic characteristics are evaluated using a linearised diffraction-radiation semi-analytical method. Axisymmetric eigenfunction expansions of the velocity potential are introduced into properly defined ring-shaped fluid regions surrounding the bodies and the potential solutions are matched at the boundaries of adjacent fluid regions by enforcing continuity of the hydrodynamic pressures and radial velocities. A dynamical model for the floaters' performance in time domain is developed that properly accounts for the floater's hydrodynamic behaviour, the coupling terms between the different modes of motion and of the power take-off mechanism. Numerical results are presented and discussed, in terms of the expected power production. The results show parametrically {{the effect that}} the varying hydrodynamic characteristics of each particular floater's geometry have on the investigated WEC's performance characteristics. © 2010 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology...|$|R

50|$|Iowa law allowed townships to {{levy a tax}} {{for fire}} protection, and Columbia and East Des Moines Townships {{contracted}} with the City to provide this service. Individual property owners from other townships could contract for fire protection. About 1960, the townships bought a fire truck on an International chassis with a front <b>mount</b> <b>pump,</b> and the chemical tank truck was retired but the pump was salvaged and used later. In the early 1970s the two townships purchased a truck, had a tank built and a pump (from the old chemical truck) installed for use as a tanker truck and the City and the townships built a building to house the tanker as well as certain city operations and equipment. In about 1974, the City purchased a new fire truck on a Ford chassis. A new fire station has since been built on Walnut Street at 6th Street, and there is more room for newer equipment.|$|R
