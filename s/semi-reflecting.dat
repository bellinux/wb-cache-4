40|$|Consider scenes {{deteriorated}} by reflections o# a semireflecting medium (e. g., a glass window) {{that lies}} between the observer and an object. We present two approaches {{to recover the}} superimposed scenes. The first one {{is based on a}} focus cue, and can be generalized to volumetric imaging with multiple layers. The second method, based on a polarization cue, can automatically label the reconstructed scenes as reflected/transmitted. It is also demonstrated how to blindly determine the imaging PSF or the orientation of the invisible (<b>semi-reflecting)</b> surface in space in such situations. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary. A {{theory of}} the Mach-Zehnder {{interferometer}} is developed using the approach of investigating {{the history of a}} wave front produced by an element of an extended light source. Account is taken of the effects of imperfections of the optical components including all the first-order aberrations of the collimating and collecting lenses or mirrors and of the camera lens. The theory can also be applied to other two-beam interferometers. 1. Introduction. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is one of a large class of instruments in which two-beam interference is produced by division of amplitude. Its principle of operation is simple and can be stated very briefly, if the components of the instrument are assumed to be optically perfect. Referring to Fig. 1, S, a point source of monochromatic light in the focal plane of a perfect collimating lens L produces a parallel beam of light which meets a <b>semi-reflecting</b> mirror M 1...|$|E
40|$|For {{orbiting}} astronomical {{telescopes and}} rocket spectroscopy the great angular dispersion of the Fabry-Perot interferometer should permit easier guidance tolerance {{for a given}} spectral resolving power with the added profit of the physical compactness of an etalon spectrometer or spectrograph. Moreover the superiority in luminosity and illumination of the interferometer instruments would permit shorter exposures and greater time resolution. Work aimed at extending the spectral range of the interferometer for high resolution work on the solar Frauenhofer spectrum (3 000 Å- 1 800 Å) from stabilized rockets is reviewed. The first problem of producing suitable <b>semi-reflecting</b> coatings for the region < 2 400 Å has now been solved {{by the development of}} magnesium fluoride overcoated aluminum films and the results obtained are illustrated with interferograms of λ 1 849 of Hg I and transmission curves of interference filters for the range 1 700 Å to 2 400 Å. The development of an optically contacted air gap Fabry-Perot interferometer for rocket spectroscopy is also described. A recorded fringe finesse of 30 for a 2 cm aperture has been obtained at λ 5 461 with this instrument, and the adjustment remains constant with time. Finally, two rocket experiments to study the resonance lines of Mg II at 2 795 and 2 802 Å are described. The first experiment will comprise a Fabry-Perot interferometer crossed with an echelle spectrograph to give a spectral resolution in the fringes of about 0. 03 Å at 2 800 Å with a solar spatial resolution of 10 seconds of arc radially. The second experiment will employ a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer, also crossed with an echelle, with photoelectric detection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Consider {{situations}} where the depth at each point in the scene is multi-valued, due {{to the presence of}} a virtual image <b>semi-reflected</b> by a transparent surface. The <b>semi-reflected</b> image is linearly superimposed on the image of an object that is behind the transparent surface. A novel approach is proposed for the separation of the superimposed layers. Focusing on either of the layers yields initial separation, but crosstalk remains. The separation is enhanced by mutual blurring of the perturbing components in the images. However, this blurring requires the estimation of the defocus blur kernels. We thus propose a method for self calibration of the blur kernels, given the raw images. The kernels are sought to minimize the mutual information of the recovered layers. Autofocusing and depth estimation in the presence of semi-reflections are also considered. Experimental results are presented...|$|R
500|$|The New York Times {{notes that}} this was an example of Lichtenstein's ability to [...] "glorify the American woman by giving {{innocuous}} images of her generic concocted self and her roiling emotions such blazing formal power". Framing a small fragment of the image in the mirror serves an artistic purpose. [...] "Extraordinary sections like... linking the falling hair to the <b>semi-reflected</b> face of the girl in the mirror (Girl in the mirror, 1964)... which cut up, analyse, and unite, all have the one aim of intensifying the signifying fragment." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method to recover scenes {{deteriorated}} by superposition of transparent and <b>semi-reflected</b> contributions, as appear in reflections off windows. Separating the superimposed contributions from the images in which either contribution is in focus is based on mutual blurring and subtraction of the perturbing components. This procedure requires the defocus blur kernels to be known. The use of uncalibrated kernels had previously led to contaminated results. We propose a method for self calibration of the blur kernels from the raw images themselves. The kernels are sought to minimize the mutual information of the recovered layers. This relaxes the need for prior knowledge on the optical transfer function. Experimental results are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|Consider {{situations}} where the depth at each point in the scene is multi-valued, due {{to the presence of}} a virtual image semi-rejlected by a transparent surface. The <b>semi-reflected</b> image is linearly superimposed on the image of the object that is behind the transparent surface. A novel approach is proposed for the recovery of the superimposed layers. By searching for the images in which either of the objects (layers) is focused, the transparent areas are detected and an estimate of the depth map of each layer is obtained. As a result of the focusing, an initial separation of the layers is achieved. The separation is enhanced via mutual blurring of the perturbing components in the images, based on the depths estimate and the parameters of the imaging system. 1...|$|R
60|$|Even to Pierre {{these two}} {{paintings}} {{had always seemed}} strangely dissimilar. And as the larger one had been painted many years after the other, and therefore brought the original pretty nearly within his own childish recollections; therefore, he himself could not but deem it by far the more truthful and life-like presentation of his father. So that the mere preference of his mother, however strong, {{was not at all}} surprising to him, but rather coincided with his own conceit. Yet not for this, must the other portrait be so decidedly rejected. Because, in the first place, there was a difference in time, and some difference of costume to be considered, and the wide difference of the styles of the respective artiste, and the wide difference of those respective, <b>semi-reflected,</b> ideal faces, which, even {{in the presence of the}} original, a spiritual artist will rather choose to draw from than from the fleshy face, however brilliant and fine. Moreover, while the larger portrait was that of a middle-aged, married man, and seemed to possess all the nameless and slightly portly tranquillities, incident to that condition when a felicitous one; the smaller portrait painted a brisk, unentangled, young bachelor, gayly ranging up and down in the world; light-hearted, and a very little bladish perhaps; and charged to the lips with the first uncloying morning fullness and freshness of life. Here, certainly, large allowance was to be made in any careful, candid estimation of these portraits. To Pierre this conclusion had become well-nigh irresistible, when he placed side by side two portraits of himself; one taken in his early childhood, a frocked and belted boy of four years old; and the other, a grown youth of sixteen. Except an indestructible, all-surviving something in the eyes and on the temples, Pierre could hardly recognize the loud-laughing boy in the tall, and pensively smiling youth. If a few years, then, can have in me made all this difference, why not in my father? thought Pierre.|$|R
