Waarom moeten overheden nog steeds onderhandelen met vakbonden en werkgevers, terwijl het ledenaantal van vakbonden bijna overal in Europa daalt? De auteur onderzoekt de politieke fundamenten van het sociaal overleg in deze nieuwe context. De focus ligt op de regulering van arbeidsmobiliteit en werkloosheidsuitkeringen in Oostenrijk en Zwitserland. Het werk laat zien dat overheden belangenorganisaties strategisch betrekken in de beleidsvorming, bijvoorbeeld wanneer een overheid geconfronteerd wordt met partijpolitieke verdeeldheid, of wan- neer impopulaire hervormingen negatieve electorale gevolgen kunnen hebben.

40|$|The ‘green’ {{chapter in}} the Belgian {{recovery}} plan is only limited. This conclusion ‘hides’ however the attention the issue gets in the (tri-partite) <b>social</b> dialogue and <b>concertation.</b> The partners are building in this regard on policy experience, created in the last 10 to 15 years related to the topics of sustainable development, energy and climate. An important recent initiative {{in this regard is}} the eco-cheque. More is certainly to come in the coming months, when the new regional governments will be established. Topics include energy efficiency, mobility, eco-innovation, and sustainable public procurement. This mapping and inventory exercise will help to take stock of what the different Member States and social partners are doing to mitigate the effects of climate change and harness the potential of the green economy. It will also help to identify particularly interesting and successful initiatives which can be shared and disseminated as positive practice examples. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{multiple}} sources and research methods, this article argues that <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> {{is not a}} declining institutional arrangement, but a recurrent and, overall, stable (if not growing) feature of European societies. Case-based evidence suggests that, {{at least in the}} 1990 s, governments engaging in <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> tend to be electorally weak or vulnerable governments seeking to ease the passing and implementation of potentially unpopular (neo-liberal) policies. The institutional and organizations conditions for <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> seem today rather different from those the past corporatist literature focused upon, that is, concentrated and hierarchical interest groups. Indeed democratic decision-making procedures, ensuring procedural legitimacy and providing opportunities for the discursive reshaping of rank-and-file preferences, may have become more important over time. Also, <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> has shown a tendency to move from a tripartite (government, labor, and capital) to a multipartite format, with the institutional involvement of multiple civil society organizations alongside the traditional "social partners". The assessment of concertation outcomes is limited by the availability of appropriate indicators. As far wage bargaining coordination is concerned, this seems to be associated with more moderate wage growth. The other conclusion usually drawn by the literature, that it may also be associated with lower unemployment, seems instead much less robust...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the crisis of <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> in Italy since 2000. We argue that this crisis is not due exclusively to the political shift from a centre-left to a centre-right government led by Silvio Berlusconi, {{or the end of}} the European integration phase. It reflects the continued failure of Italian <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> to address problems of economic growth and work productivity was apparent by {{the second half of the}} 1990 s. We argue that this is due mainly to the stagnation of the decentralisation process at the company and territorial levels and, in particular, the limited development of second-level collective bargaining introduced by the 1993 July Ciampi Protocol. This reflects a weakness in the Italian institutional context as well as the difficulties associated with the altering of industrial relations in global market economies more generally. The prospects for the future of concertative policy making in the Italian context are also discussed. status: publishe...|$|E

It is argued that, in a context of economic and policy uncertainty, when the state creates appropriate institutional mechanisms to communicate effectively with business and build a consensus for reform, in the process it also reduces investment risks. The argument is illustrated with the example of the Sectoral Chamber of the Automotive Industry (1991 - 95), and shows the impact of <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> in neo-corporatist institutions on foreign direct investment. ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to examine the characteristic dynamics of second-generation social concertations and their results, based on the Italian case. From the analytical point of view, we seek to demonstrate that: a) the <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> process emerged from the combination of a specific conjuncture marked by the imperatives of the European construct, an acute national political and economic crisis, and strategic choices by social actors; b) tripartite negotiation gave rise to a collective bargaining structure at two levels, capable of simultaneously guaranteeing wage moderation, maintenance of wage purchasing power, corporate profit margins, and companies' needs for flexibility, with the exception of flexibility in lay-offs...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{alternative}} approaches {{to understanding the}} economic implications of social partnership in Ireland. Discussion of orthodox approaches identifies a number of shortcomings, including a narrow definition of competitiveness {{and the lack of}} a conflict perspective. Previous work within the field of Comparative Political Economy suggest that <b>Social</b> <b>Concertation</b> Agreements can mitigate the effects of social conflict in a manner which is economically advantageous. The literature on National Systems of Innovation places considerable emphasis on the importance of innovation as the basis on long-term competitiveness. Innovation, however, can be process, which is fraught with conflict. It follows, therefore, that a major contribution of social partnership in Ireland may be the facilitation of innovation. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the run-up}} to European Monetary Union (EMU), Italy put in place an {{extraordinary}} fiscal adjustment, whereas Germany encountered serious difficulties that go beyond the re-unification shock. "War-of-attrition" models are employed to explain this puzzle. It is argued that Italy's high debt burden and soft currency regime from 1992 to 1996 turned out as an opportunity. The prospect of EMU membership opened up room for market-induced credibility gains. By allowing a sensible reduction of interest payments, the high-debt GDP ratio de facto reduced the scope for welfare retrenchment, thus minimising conflicts between socio-economic groups over {{the distribution of the}} fiscal adjustment burden. At the same time, <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> offered a locus of conflict resolution. Social partners' fiscal preferences stemmed from an evaluation of the distributional impact of deficit reduction and of trade-offs in other policy areas, e. g. exchange rate policy. Thanks to Italy's soft-currency regime, domestic business agreed to unions' demands for a tax-imposed fiscal consolidation as the devalued Lira allowed them to maintain a competitive edge. The opposite is true for Germany, where the low debt burden and hard currency regime functioned, paradoxically, as straightjackets. With a low debt level, deficit reduction had to come from real government activities, either on the revenue or on the expenditure-side. Also, the appreciated Deutschmark did not offer an alternative "pressure valve" to Germany's export-oriented business. The failure of the 1996 social pact is understood against this background. This thesis sheds light on the political economy of EMU-induced fiscal adjustment {{as well as on the}} determinants of <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> in the EU. In this respect, it contributes simultaneously to two strands of literature; the now flourishing research agenda on fiscal policy in EMU -of which it rejects the strong institutionalist flavour, and the equally recent revival of corporatist studies since the 1990 s...|$|E

40|$|Are social {{partners}} a (atypical) type of interest groups? To quote the Belgian Minister of Economy and Employment: "Social partners are not interest groups, their interest goes further {{than their own}} personal interest". In academic work as well, {{social partners}} seem {{most of the time}} to be treated distinctively from other interest groups, because of their particular features regarding State-society relations. For example, according to Visser (1998 : 13) "the most interesting property of <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> lies in the possibility that interest groups redefine the content of their self-interested strategies in a 'public-regarding way' ". This paper's purpose is to identify what are the differences and similarities between social partners and interest groups in order to determine to what extent it is possible to study social partners through the lens of interest groups and if such approach might be relevant. To foster this reflection, both literature on professional relations and literature on interest groups politics are mobilized...|$|E
40|$|The EMU fiscal {{adjustment}} paths {{of the four}} Southern Europe members (Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal – SE- 4) vary along two dimensions: a) cross-temporal (pre- and post-EMU accession) and b) cross-country. We account for the cross-temporal variation by distinguishing between the ‘hard’ and ‘softer’ EMU conditionality of the pre- and post-accession stage. External constraints {{in the form of}} the Maastricht eligibility criteria constituted a significant common ‘push’ factor in the fiscal stabilization process of EMU candidate countries throughout the 1990 s. However, their potent does not necessarily lead to fiscal sustainability as demonstrated by the postaccession budgetary outlook of the SE- 4. We account for the crosscountry variation by introducing additional ‘pull’ factors related to the reform content, context and capability (such as unemployment, the level of <b>social</b> <b>concertation,</b> and government effectiveness). Only in cases where such factors were at work did governments engage in structural reforms to consolidate public finances instead of the less controversial path of macroeconomic policy reform.

40|$|Not all European {{countries}} have made equal progress in {{their pursuit of}} the Lisbon target of a 12. 5 % participation rate in lifelong learning (LLL) by 2010. In this paper, using LFS 2004 data, we examine which macro-level characteristics can explain the variation between the EU- 15 countries as regards both the overall participation rate and social inequalities in those participation rates. Models examining country-level variations in the overall participation rates clearly favour an employability-oriented interpretation. Both the employment and the innovation rate in the economy {{have a major impact on}} the overall participation rate. Furthermore, comprehensive education systems appear to generate higher participation. A high overall participation rate in LLL is strongly associated with fewer social inequalities in participation. Government intervention in compulsory and adult education as well as active labour market policies play an important part in reducing inequalities in participation. Finally, our results underline the importance of social dialogue and <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> in designing and delivering policies to enhance participation and combat inequalities in participation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|For nearly 20 {{years the}} Irish State {{has engaged in}} a process of <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> that has {{produced}} tri-annual agreements between the social partners and the government. Beginning in 1987 as a response to economic crisis Irish ‘social partnership ’ has received international attention because it has been closely associated with the spectacular success of the Irish economy. This economic success, had {{by the end of the}} 1990 s, produced virtually full employment and budget surpluses giving government the potential for policy choices that had not previously existed. One of the major points of contention in this success story is the persistence of poverty and growing inequality (Layte et al 2000, Kirby 2004). As a result of this, social partnership has been criticised for its failure to provide a policy forum able to address the problem of poverty. From its inception Social Partnership was a contested process, and both its contribution to Ireland’s economic success and its effectiveness as a policy forum have been questioned, especially its capacity to contribute to the development of policy to address poverty and social exclusion. On the other hand, it has als...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the relations between}} institutions, interests and ideas, taking as its reference point experiences in <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> in Europe and welfare system reforms in Latin America in the 1990 s. Recognizing that the current debate over these reforms has incorporated {{the importance of the}} cognitive dimension of political processes as a way of building more complex and adequate approaches to the phenomena in question, we take a different approach to previous analyses, arguing that the emphasis given up to now to the role of ideas is insufficient to explain either the nature and diffusion of the processes of economic and social reforms, or their legitimacy and political support. The process of adopting ideas has to produce results that are positively assessed and offer answers - whether consensual or not - to questions deemed central to the public agenda. In addition, there is also a complex process of policy learning and mimicking that allows for better understanding of complex developments, expressing the fact that these elements cannot be left out of the explanations, since they may add new dimensions to studies of economic and social reforms inspired by the role of institutions or by political competition...|$|E
40|$|Why do {{some states}} develop deeper {{regionalism}} while others do not? Comparing European and Asian regionalism, {{this study provides}} an alternative explanation {{of different types of}} regionalism and the national variations in regionalization since the mid 1980 s. It defines regionalism as a strategy pursued by a state that desires to enhance its governability of the national economy when market authority outgrows state authority. The rise of regionalism in the neoliberal world economic order changes the balance between the state?s public power and the state?s market governability, consequently resulting in a political convergence toward a majoritarian political system based on individualism and delegative democracy. However, regionalism is realized in very distinctive patterns across different regions as the different historical paths of regional capitalism shape the state-society relationship and the state?s capability of governing the national economy. European welfare states developed a deeper regionalism because they sought to impose a neoliberal economic transformation on their societies by shifting their economic priority of equality and economic policy making based on <b>social</b> <b>concertation</b> toward efficiency and the formation of an encompassing distributional coalition. In contrast, Asian developmental states prefer preserving national autonomy to relying on a formal regional institution to constrain states? national authority because they are more capable of implementing the neoliberal economic transformation in terms of market governability and the formation of encompassing distributional coalitions...|$|E
