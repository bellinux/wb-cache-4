5|$|In The Greek Myths (1955), Robert Graves views Oenopion as his {{perennial}} Year-King, at {{the stage}} where the king pretends to die {{at the end of}} his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the Cyclops, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of Aqhat and Yatpan from Ras Shamra, as well as a conjectural <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia.
