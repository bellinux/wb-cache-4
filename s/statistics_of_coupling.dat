40|$|Expressions {{are derived}} for the {{ensemble}} means and variances of the subsystem energies of built-up systems comprising two subsystems. The approach {{is based on}} the Statistical Energy Analysis of two spring-coupled oscillators and sets <b>of</b> oscillators, or <b>coupled</b> continuous subsystems, described by Mace and Ji [The statistical energy analysis <b>of</b> <b>coupled</b> sets <b>of</b> oscillators, Proceedings of the Royal Society A 1824 (2007) ]. The paper focuses on spring coupling, although similar results hold for more general forms <b>of</b> conservative <b>coupling.</b> Randomness is introduced into the system by assuming that the natural frequency spacings in each subsystem conform to certain statistical distributions. A “coupling coefficient parameter” is introduced which, together with the “coupling strength parameter” defined by Mace and Ji (2007), accounts for the <b>statistics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coupling</b> stiffness. Various approximations and assumptions are made. It is seen that the variance of the excited subsystem depends primarily on the variance of the input power, which in turn depends on the variance of the number of modes of the excited subsystem in the frequency band of excitation and their mode shapes. The variance of the undriven subsystem, on the other hand, depends primarily on the variance <b>of</b> the intermodal <b>coupling</b> coefficients, which in turn depend on the variances of the number of in-band modes of both subsystems and their mode shapes.

The variance of bispectral estimates in the presence of leakage has contributions from individual modes and from triads of phase-coupled modes. Time-domain windowing reduces the leakage.

40|$|In {{development}} and disease, cells move as they exchange signals. One example {{is found in}} vertebrate development, during which the timing of segment formation is set by a ‘segmentation clock’, in which oscillating gene expression is synchronized across a population of cells by Delta-Notch signaling. Delta-Notch signaling requires local cell-cell contact, but in the zebrafish embryonic tailbud, oscillating cells move rapidly, exchanging neighbors. Previous theoretical studies proposed that this relative movement or cell mixing might alter signaling and thereby enhance synchronization. However, it remains unclear whether the mixing timescale in the tissue is in the right range for this effect, because a framework to reliably measure the mixing timescale and compare it with signaling timescale is lacking. Here, we develop such a framework using a quantitative description of cell mixing {{without the need for}} an external reference frame and constructing a physical model of cell movement based on the data. Numerical simulations show that mixing with experimentally observed <b>statistics</b> enhances synchronization <b>of</b> <b>coupled</b> phase oscillators, suggesting that mixing in the tailbud is fast enough to affect the coherence of rhythmic gene expression.

We show that a "symmetrization" procedure akin to antithetic coupling can improve the order of accuracy of the sampling methods, which is illustrated with numerical examples. In the second setting, we develop "stochastic continuation" methods to estimate level sets for <b>statistics</b> <b>of</b> stochastic differential equations {{with respect to their}} parameters.
