We draw on detailed enterprise surveys and interviews with the managers of 373 manufacturing firms in the Prague region. The results suggest a positive correlation between employee training and subcontracting. Subcontracting is also associated with a reduction in variable costs and a price premium on the stock market. The effect of subcontracting on other firms in the same industry is weak.

Within these arrangements, {{the payment of}} advances {{is a form of}} credit interlinking that addresses the isolation of rural-based enterprises from the formal finance sector. This viewpoint motivates specification of a testable hypothesis: advance payments are greater the more remote a rural-based subcontractor is from the urban center. The paper shows that such a hypothesis can be derived from a simple principal-agent model of the subcontracting relation. Moreover, the hypothesis is empirically confirmed by multivariate analysis of data from a case study of garment and metalcraft industries in the Philippines. The finding supports the view that <b>subcontracting</b> <b>arrangements</b> may be an organizational form appropriate to rural industrialization.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of {{applying}} the multi-layer chain subcontracting system on project management performance with reference to Hong Kong construction industry. Multi-layer chain subcontracting system is widely used within construction industry as it is considered advantageous in many aspects such as better efficiency of subcontractors’ operation due to their unique skills. However, the fact of poor quality products in construction practice raises the doubt {{about the effectiveness of}} the chain system. Accordingly, the reasons why the applications of the system contribute to poor project performance are examined. A survey conducted in the Hong Kong construction industry demonstrates that the multi-layer chain subcontracting system, while widely adopted, is largely flawed. Based on the survey results, application of multi-layer chain subcontracting system contributes largely to the poor performance across the all major aspects including quality and time management, cost control, and communication and coordination performance. The association exists between poor project management performance and the increase of the number of layers in the chain of the <b>subcontracting</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The long communication chain because of the increasing layers of subcontractors results in various problems such as communication errors, poor supervision on the bottom-layer contractors. Consequently overruns in cost and time, and abortive and remedial works are common. Recommendations for improving the practice are suggested and explored, including change the practice of the “lowest bid” to an approach which incorporate both price and technical performance, limit the number of subcontracting layers, restrain the use of “supply-and-fix” <b>subcontracting</b> <b>arrangement,</b> and enforce the implementation of government regulations. The findings of this study provide useful references in examining the practice of subcontracting system in other construction industries and identifying the areas where the improvements can be made for gaining the benefits of using the system.

Since only 55,000 1911A1's were produced by US&S, they are highly collectible. The reason for the low production numbers is US&S was the last company awarded a government contract and as requirements were reduced in early 1943, the last contract awarded became the first to be cancelled. As a general rule, US&S produced high quality pistols. With the government-owned machine tooling already in place at US&S, they were offered a <b>subcontract</b> <b>arrangement</b> to produce M1 Carbine components.

40|$|Purpose - To apply Williamson's six {{dimensional}} {{typology of}} asset specificity as {{a theoretical framework}} for appraising the nature of outsourcing activities in hotels. Design/methodology/approach - Interviews with senior managers in large hotels. Findings - Site specificity and brand capital {{appear to be the}} most pertinent dimensions of asset specificity in the sample investigated. Most observations support the transaction cost economics (TCE) prescription that high asset specificity results in insourcing. Research limitations/implications - This study suffers from the normal shortcomings associated with fieldwork based on a limited sample of observations. Rather than attempting to make generalisable assertions, the study provides an exploration of the ways that asset specificity might manifest itself in hotel outsourcing decision making.

25|$|The {{efficiency}} of the TAT contracting process and its bypassing of a formal RFP process is premised on the business model of the DTIC IAC program. Specifically, contractors must compete {{for the opportunity to}} operate an IAC. This is a full open competition, and award is based on the capability of the contractor to perform software-aligned technical areas tasks, as well as to perform the core functions of maintaining software-focused libraries and developing a software center of excellence. When bidding on an IAC, contractors form collaborative teams to ensure the best overall coverage of the domain. Therefore, the contractor operating the DACS has already competed for the right for their team to perform TATs. The DACS contractor manages all TATs, insuring that any scientific and technical information (STI) resulting from the TAT is added to the DACS collection for dissemination in appropriate venues. When the government wishes to acquire the services of someone other than the DACS contractor, it is done as a TAT based on a <b>subcontracting</b> <b>arrangement</b> between the service provider (team member or other) and the DACS contractor. This business model gives the government a great deal of flexibility in working with DACS to acquire the services from the most qualified organizations. This is especially true in scenarios where the technical expertise needed resides within a small group in an academic institution, or a small business.|$|R

40|$|The {{motivation}} behind subcontracting {{relationships in}} the motor vehicle manufacturing The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine internal and external constraints to <b>subcontracting</b> <b>arrangements</b> between large firms and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in Kenya in order to establish the reasons for the gap in those arrangements. The sector was chosen for the study because of the government’s selection of the sector to promote <b>subcontracting</b> <b>arrangements</b> between small and medium enterprises and large firms in Kenya. Secondly, the sector was chosen because of the complexity of the motor vehicle industry with one motor vehicle comprising about 10, 000 component parts, all of which would be difficult for one company to manufacture in-house. The research was mainly qualitative but quantitative data was also used. Content analysis approach was used to analyze the qualitative data and descriptive statistics to analyze the quantitative data. Data was collected from two of the three motor vehicle assembles in Kenya, nine out of thirteen franchise holders and 66 of the 72 component parts suppliers who are mainly small and medium enterprises. The results indicate that the level of subcontracting that takes place in the motor vehicle manufacturing industry is minimal. This is motivated mainly by a desire to remain in the good books of the government. The big enterprises are not willing to buy component parts from local suppliers and especially not local SME suppliers mainly due to the inability of the SMEs to supply quality products to schedule, lack of local suppliers for certain parts, the proliferation of makes and models and competition from imported second hand vehicles from Japan and Europe. The proliferation of makes and models also requires frequent technological changes which both assemblers and SMEs owners find difficult to keep up with. The study recommends that the government should reduce the age of imported second hand vehicles to not more than five years, find a way of compelling the franchise holders and assemblers to buy parts locally and put in place appropriate policies regarding the sector. SMEs should also acquire up to date technology and become more competitive...|$|E

We find that rural poverty in E 1 Salvador remains acute and significantly higher than in urban areas. While the rural poor are mainly agricultural laborers and marginal farmers, some nonfarm activities are also of importance to the poor. In fact, nonfarm activities in E 1 Salvador account for a significant share of rural employment and income for both {{the poor and the}} nonpoor. The poor, on the one hand, are engaged in "last resort" nonfarm activities that are not associated with high levels of labor productivity. The nonpoor, on the other, are engaged in productive nonfarm activities which are likely to present a potent force for upward mobility. Significant correlates of these high-productivity occupations include education, infrastructure, location, and gender. While most of the analysis is at the household level, the data also permit some focus on small-scale rural enterprise activities. It appears that in E 1 Salvador very few rural enterprises report utilizing formal credit in setting up their activities.
