Our object was twofold: to see tropical coast scenery, and to get, if possible, some Guacharo birds (pronounced Huacharo), of whom more hereafter. Our chance of getting them depended on the sea being calm outside the Bocas, as well as inside. The calm inside was no proof of the calm out. Port of Spain is under the lee of the mountains; and the surf might be thundering along the northern shore, tearing out stone after stone from the soft cliffs, and shrouding all the distant points in <b>salt</b> <b>haze,</b> though the gulf along which we were rowing was perfectly smooth, and the shipping and the mangrove scrub and the coco-palms hung double, reflected as in a mirror, not of glass but of mud; and on the swamps of the Caroni the malarious fog hung motionless in long straight lines, waiting for the first blaze of sunrise to sublime it and its invisible poisons into the upper air, {{where it would be}} swept off, harmless, by the trade-wind which rushed along half a mile above our heads.|$|E

According to legend, the lake's {{saltiness}} stems from St Lazarus' request of an old woman for food and drink. She refused, claiming her vines had dried up, to which Lazarus replied: [...] "may your vines be dry and be a salt lake forever more." [...] A more scientific {{explanation is that the}} salt water penetrates the porous rock between the lake and the sea, making the water very salty.|$|R
