In the 1860s, Mormon pioneer LaFayette Mecham built the wagon road, a short cut across the desert, now known as Stoddard Wells Road. Over the next few decades, Victorville boomed as the commercial center of the area with gold refineries, quarries, dance halls and saloons, while Apple Valley remained more pastoral with ranches and apple orchards.|$|E

500|$|... "Telephone" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, Rodney Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Lazonate Franklin and Beyoncé. Musically, the song has been {{described}} as dance-pop. Although constructed as a duet, Beyoncé's first appearance is in the middle verse. She sings her lyrics through a brief interlude, and later backs the chorus {{during the rest of the}} song. The song starts off unassumingly, with Gaga singing in a solemn voice over a harp melody, which changes immediately to a pounding beat. Essentially, Gaga is in a club and her boyfriend keeps calling, but she cannot talk as she was drinking and dancing to her favorite song. The chorus runs as follows: [...] "Stop calling, <b>stop</b> <b>calling,</b> I don't want to talk anymore." [...] "Telephone" [...] consists of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and an epilogue where a voice announces that the telephone line is not reachable at that moment. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals range from the low-note of F3 to the high-note of C5. It is set in the key of F Dorian mode, and has a basic sequence of Fm–A–B–Fm as its chord progression.|$|E

2500|$|According to Consumer Reports, in 2005, National Safety Associates used {{advertising}} featuring Dr. William Sears (a {{distributor of}} Juice Plus products), which implied that Juice Plus Gummies were low in sugar and a nutritional alternative to fruits and vegetables.

2500|$|The {{geographical}} limitations can {{be quite}} strict. [...] "Newcastle Brown Ale" [...] was restricted to being brewed {{in the city of}} Newcastle upon Tyne in England. However, having obtained this protection for their product, the brewery decided in 2004 that it would move across the river Tyne to Gateshead. As Gateshead is technically a separate town—albeit only the width of a river apart—it does not fall within the required geographical restriction. The brewery then applied to the European Union authorities to have the geographical restriction revoked. If the restriction had not been revoked, the brewery would have been forced either to move back to Newcastle, or <b>stop</b> <b>calling</b> its beer [...] "Newcastle" [...] brown ale. Ultimately, the brewery's application to revoke the geographic restriction was approved. Similarly, Stilton cheese can only be produced in the three English counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Nottinghamshire. Stilton village is in the traditional county of Huntingdonshire, now a district of Cambridgeshire, so Stilton cheese cannot be produced in Stilton (although it is unclear whether the cheese was ever produced there. Quenby Hall in Leicestershire claims to be the first producer).|$|E

2500|$|Males can {{intercept}} vocal {{signals that}} were not meant for them in a tactic known as eavesdropping. [...] The Hyla versicolor male increases calling rate and duration once a female is in vicinity. Eavesdroppers will intercept these increased signals and begin to call for the female in a more aggressive manner, which generally leads to escalated conflicts. Eavesdropping also allows male frogs to assess the body size of their competitors. The frequency of vocal signals {{is dependent on the}} mass of the laryngeal apparatus, and a large one will produce lower frequency calls, positively correlated to overall body size. Male frogs will use eavesdropping {{to decide whether or not}} to initiate aggressive conflicts. Male anurans are more likely to attack a frog with higher frequency calls. It can also inform frogs when the competition has become too intense, where it can reduce or <b>stop</b> <b>calling</b> altogether and move to a different location outside of the chorus. In order to save energy they attempt to call females where there is less competition and a better chance to court a female. Once a satellite male hears a change in vocalizations of other males he will begin courtship calling in an attempt to steal a female, with some males now invests more energy into a competitive courtship call which may sway the female’s interest. [...] Satellite males may contribute 20% of sexual reproduction in a populations. as cited by ...|$|E
2500|$|In their {{penultimate}} {{debate on}} August 28 of that year, the two disagreed over {{the actions of}} the Chicago Police Department and the protesters at the ongoing convention. In reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a Viet Cong flag, moderator Howard K. Smith asked whether raising a Nazi flag during the Second World War would have elicited a similar response. Vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit, whereupon Buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views, noting that in the U.S. during the Second World War [...] "some people were pro-Nazi and they were well treated by those who ostracized them—and I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. I know you [...] don't care because you have no sense of identification with—".

[...] Buckley, visibly angered, rose several inches from his seat and replied, [...] "Now listen, you queer, <b>stop</b> <b>calling</b> me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face, and you'll stay plastered." [...] Buckley later apologized in print for having called Vidal a [...] "queer" [...] in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context, but also reiterated his distaste for Vidal as an [...] "evangelist for bisexuality": [...] "The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction, and in his art the desirability of it, is {{not to be confused with}} the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher." [...] The debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary Best of Enemies.|$|E
