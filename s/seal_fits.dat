For this report, three areas of interest are distinguished within the East Anglia Zone: East Anglia THREE Offshore Windfarm (East Anglia THREE); East Anglia FOUR Offshore Windfarm (East Anglia FOUR) and the combined cable corridor for both projects. In the Netherlands, seals have been tracked from two Natura 2000 areas: the Wadden Sea to the north and the Delta region to the south. Approval was sought from current clients of IMARES to incorporate data from seal research they have sponsored. All clients supported sharing of the data. Of 273 harbour <b>seals</b> <b>fitted</b> with trackers in the Netherlands between 1998 and 2013, ten came within 20 km of an East Anglia area of interest and seven of those entered an area of interest.

40|$|This paper investigates a new {{sealing system}} for sliding {{applications}} in pneumatic cylinders based on non-contact sealing. By “reverse ” assembling the common lip seal, {{the back of}} the seal is exposed to the supply pressure and the lip is turned towards the pressure discharge side. When exposed to sealing pressure the lip yields, resulting in reduced effective surface area with consequent less friction and wear, providing an air leakage path the flow rate of which depends on the radial stiffness of the seal. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology for evaluating the performance of a non-conventional seal system design (air lubricated seal). A spring-energised commercial <b>seal</b> <b>fitted</b> to a piston has been tested to measure the air flow rate through it.

The feeds have blind ends linked to an ante-room in the other section, forming a dividing plane between the inflow and outflow.

The insert can be rotated to give the required flow connections between the feeds and the outlet, and block flow movements. The sections can be of the same or different materials of plastics, ceramics or metals. USE - The micro-reactor technology is for use in the fields of ceramics, chemistry, medicine, pharmacology, biology, and genetic technology.

40|$|Determination of {{when and}} where animals feed {{and how much they}} consume is {{fundamental}} to understand their ecology and role in ecosystems. However, the lack of reliable data on feeding habits of wild animals, and particularly in marine endotherms, attests to the difficulty in doing this. A promising recent development proposes using a Hall sensor-magnet System - the inter-mandibular angle sensor (IMASEN) attached to animals' jaws to elucidate feeding events. We conducted trials on captive pinnipeds by feeding IMASEN-equipped animals with prey to examine the utility of this system. Most feeding events were clearly distinguishable from other jaw movements; only small prey items might not be resolved adequately. Based on {{the results of this study}} we examined feeding events from free-ranging Weddell <b>seals</b> <b>fitted</b> with IMASENs and dead-reckoners during December 2003 at Drescher Inlet (Riiser Larsen Ice Shelf, eastern Weddell Sea coast), and present data on prey capture and ingestion in relation to the three-dimensionalmovement patterns of the seals.

There may be many reasons for this – heavier loading than has been anticipated, inadequate or unsuitable lubrication, careless handling, ineffective <b>sealing,</b> or <b>fits</b> that are too tight, with resultant insufficient internal bearing clearance. Each of these factors produces its own particular type of damage and leaves its own special imprint on the bearing.
