In vivid contrast, the resting tension of aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> normal rats is unaffected by manipulation of the calcium concentration of the bathing medium. These findings, {{as well as the}} reduced sensitivity of aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> SH rats to norepinephrine and the observation that aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> SH rats relax at a faster rate in calcium-free medium in comparison with aortic <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> normal rats, are consistent with the hypothesis that vascular smooth muscle membranes from SH rats leak calcium at a rate that is only partially compensated by the calcium pump...|$|R

40|$|The area of {{interest}} is the synthesis and study of properties of new types of hydrogels made <b>from</b> <b>pelt</b> waste, in order to recover waste from tanneries. Leather processing in tanneries results in about 500 - 600 kg of <b>pelt</b> waste <b>from</b> a ton of raw hides. These hydrogels are made using smart processes in order to then be applied in agriculture, for preservation {{of water in the}} soil or for controlled release of fertilizers, pesticides but also for the development of additivated agricultural film biodegradable over time (between 1 month and 6 months). Hydrogels that are based on biopolymers, compared with hydrogels based on synthetic polymers, have the advantage of biodegradability, biocompatibility, and a low level of toxicity. The paper presents the production of biodegradable polymer mixtures obtained from hydrolysis and enrichment of the resulting hydrolysate with phosphorus and potassium. Hydrogels with collagenous structure are tested using a high-performance instrumental analysis system (FT-IR-ATR, UV-VIS-NIR, SEM, EDAX, etc). The paper presents an experimental model for obtaining hydrogels with collagenous structure <b>from</b> <b>pelt</b> waste resulting <b>from</b> the liming process...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were done}} to {{determine}} the influence of gender and the oestrous cycle on rat urinary bladder contractility in response to cholinergic stimulation. Bladder <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> female rats responded to high frequency stimulation with smaller contractile responses than did <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> males, and to low concentrations of carbachol with greater responses. The decreased responsiveness of bladder <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> female rats to electrical field stimulation can be primarily attributed to the rats in the oestrous stage of the oestrous cycle. Bladder <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> female rats in all stages of the oestrous cycle were more sensitive to carbachol than those from males, but there were no differences in sensitivity to electrical field stimulation. The contractile responses of <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> both male and female rats to carbachol were antagonized by muscarinic antagonists with the following rank order of affinity (pA 2) estimates: 4 -DAMP>>pirenzepine>methoctramine, suggesting that the receptor mediating contraction was the M 3 subtype. There were no differences in pA 2 values between bladder <b>strips</b> <b>from</b> male and female rats. The data indicate that responsiveness of bladder strips to electrical field stimulation and carbachol is altered in female rats in the oestrous stage of the oestrous cycle. Furthermore, gender influences the sensitivity of rat bladder to muscarinic stimulation...|$|R
