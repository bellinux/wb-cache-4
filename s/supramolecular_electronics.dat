50|$|<b>Supramolecular</b> <b>electronics</b> is the {{experimental}} field of supramolecular chemistry that bridges {{the gap between}} molecular electronics and bulk plastics {{in the construction of}} electronic circuitry at the nanoscale 1. In <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics,</b> assemblies of pi-conjugated systems on the 5 to 100 nanometer length scale are prepared by molecular self-assembly with the aim to fit these structures between electrodes. With single-molecules as researched in molecular electronics at the 5 nanometer scale this would be impractical. Nanofibers can be prepared from polymers such as polyaniline and polyacetylene 12. Chiral oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)s self-assemble in a controlled fashion into (helical) wires 3. An example of actively researched compounds in this field are certain coronenes.|$|E

One derivative in particular forms carbon nanotubes with interesting electrical properties. [...] The columnar phase in this compound further organises itself into sheets, which ultimately roll up like a carpet to form multi-walled nanotubes with an outer diameter of 20 nanometers and a wall thickness of 3 nanometers. In this geometry, the stacks of coronene disks are aligned with the length of the tube. The nanotubes have sufficient length to fit between two platinum nanogap electrodes produced by scanning probe nanofabrication and are 180 nanometer apart. The nanotubes as such are insulating, but, after one-electron oxidation with nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (...) , they conduct electricity.|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} required for <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics,</b> e. g. nano-sized optoelectronic devices, will be illustrated {{on the basis}} of the programmed self-assembly of -conjugated systems into individual nanosized wires. Using the supramolecular design rules nanowires can be created from almost any polymeric and oligomeric -conjugated system. In the case of oligomers it is even possible to construct individual wires having a uniform diameter of one molecule thickness. The construction of wires on a substrate is possible by self-assembly in solution or during the deposition. The transfer of the supramolecular stacks from solution to a solid support is a very delicate process. A comprehensive knowledge of all intermolecular interactions gives rise to controlled transfer of -conjugated assemblies to specific surfaces. There are a large number of very appealing targets that should be reached before <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics</b> can serve as an attractive alternative in between single molecule electronics and bulk devices. Nevertheless, the combination of exciting scientific results and intriguing technological challenges creates an interesting future for <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics...</b>|$|E
40|$|Conjugated self-assembled {{systems in}} water are of great {{interest}} because of their potential application in biocompatible <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics,</b> but so far their supramolecular chemistry remains almost unexplored. Here we present amphiphilic terthiophenes as a general self-assembling platform {{for the construction of}} conjugated aggregates, providing access to aggregates with different morphologies without changing the basic molecular design. We explored the design parameters of these amphiphilic terthiophenes in detail, leading to the selection and synthesis of in total 8 new amphiphilic oligothiophenes. Their aggregation behaviour was investigated by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and cryo-transmission electron microscopy. Critical micelle concentrations as low as 0. 01 mM were found and different sized aggregates ranging from several nanometres up to 200 nm. The aggregate morphology could also be tuned by changing the substitution pattern of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, leading to different types of aggregates ranging from globular-and elongated micelles to bilayers. Remarkably, aggregation had only little effect on the electronic and spectroscopic properties of the oligothiophenes, which will be of interest for their application in <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics...</b>|$|E

In particular, molecular nanowires formed by self-assembly of π-conjugated molecules attract increasing attention for application in <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics.</b> This review introduces recent topics related to electroactive molecular nanowires. The nanowires are classified into four categories with respect to the electronic states of the constituent molecules: electron donors, acceptors, donor–acceptor pairs and miscellaneous molecules that display interesting electronic properties. Although many challenges still remain for practical use, state-of-the-art 1 D supramolecular nanomaterials have already brought significant advances to both fundamental chemical sciences and technological applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of functional molecular architectures through self-assembly is commonplace in biology, but despite advances 1, 2, 3, {{it is still}} a major challenge to achieve similar complexity in the laboratory. Self-assembled structures that are reproducible and virtually defect free are of interest for applications in three-dimensional cell culture 4, 5, templating 6, biosensing 7 and <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics</b> 8. Here, we report the use of reversible enzyme-catalysed reactions to drive self-assembly. In this approach, the self-assembly of aromatic short peptide derivatives 9, 10 provides a driving force that enables a protease enzyme to produce building blocks in a reversible and spatially confined manner. We demonstrate that this system combines three features: (i) self-correction—fully reversible self-assembly under thermodynamic control; (ii) component-selection—the ability to amplify the most stable molecular self-assembly structures in dynamic combinatorial libraries 11, 12, 13; and (iii) spatiotemporal confinement of nucleation and structure growth. Enzyme-assisted self-assembly therefore provides control in bottom-up fabrication of nanomaterials that could ultimately lead to functional nanostructures with enhanced complexities and fewer defects. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Coupling of peptide {{self-assembly}} to dynamic sequence exchange {{provides a}} useful approach for the discovery of self-assembling materials. In here, we demonstrate the discovery and optimization of aqueous, gel-phase nanostructures based on dynamically exchanging peptide sequences that self-select to maximize charge transfer of n-type semiconducting naphthalenediimide (NDI) -dipeptide bioconjugates with various π-electron-rich donors (dialkoxy/hydroxy/amino-naphthalene or pyrene derivatives). These gel-phase peptide libraries are characterized by spectroscopy (UV–vis and fluorescence), microscopy (TEM), HPLC, and oscillatory rheology and it is found that, of the various peptide sequences explored (tyrosine Y-NDI with tyrosine Y, phenylalanine F, leucine L, valine V, alanine A or glycine G-NH 2), the optimum sequence is tyrosine-phenylalanine in each case; however, both its absolute and relative yield amplification is dictated by {{the properties of the}} donor component, indicating cooperativity of peptide sequence and donor/acceptor pairs in assembly. The methodology provides an in situ discovery tool for nanostructures that enable dynamic interfacing of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics</b> with aqueous (biological) systems.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a concept {{to solve the}} structure of a microcrystalline material in the solid-state at natural abundance without access to distance constraints, using magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with X-ray powder diffraction and DFT calculations. The method is applied to a novel class of materials that form (semi) conductive 1 D wires for <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics</b> and artificial light-harvesting. The zinc chlorins 3 -devinyl- 31 -hydroxymethyl- 132 -demethoxycarbonylpheophorbide a (3 ′, 5 ′-bis-dodecyloxy) benzyl ester zinc complex 1 and 3 -devinyl- 31 -methoxymethyl- 132 -demethoxycarbonylpheophorbide a (3 ′, 5 ′-bis-dodecyloxy) benzyl ester zinc complex 2, self-assemble into extended excitonically coupled chromophore stacks. 1 H- 13 C heteronuclear dipolar correlation MAS NMR experiments provided the 1 H resonance assignment of the chlorin rings that allowed accurate probing of ring currents related to the stacking of macrocycles. DFT ring-current shift calculations revealed that both chlorins self-assemble in antiparallel π-stacks in planar layers in the solid-state. Concomitantly, X-ray powder diffraction measurements for chlorin 2 at 80 °C revealed a 3 D lattice for the mesoscale packing that matches molecular mechanics optimized aggregate models. For chlorin 2 the stacks alternate with a periodicity of 0. 68 nm and a 3 D unit cell with an approximate volume of 6. 28 nm 3 containing 4 molecules, which is consistent with space group P 21221...|$|E
40|$|The precise {{arraying}} {{of functional}} entities in morphologically well-defined shapes {{remains one of}} the key challenges in the processing of organic molecules 1. Among various π-conjugated species, pyrene exhibits a set of unique properties, which make it an attractive compound for the utilization in materials science 2. In this contribution we report on properties of self-assembled structures prepared from amphiphilic pyrene trimers (Py 3) consisting of phosphodiester-linked pyrenes. Depending on the geometry of a pyrene core substitution (1. 6 -, 1. 8 -, or 2. 7 - type, see Scheme), the thermally-controlled self-assembly allows the preparation of supramolecular architectures of different morphologies in a bottom-up approach: two-dimensional (2 D) nanosheets 3 are formed in case of 1. 6 - and 2. 7 -substitution 4 whereas one-dimensional (1 D) fibers are built from 1. 8 - substituted isomers. The morphologies of the assemblies are established by AFM and TEM, and the results are further correlated with spectroscopic and scattering data. Two-dimensional assemblies consist of an inner layer of hydrophobic pyrenes, sandwiched between a net of phosphates. Due to the repulsion of the negative charges, the 2 D assemblies exist mostly as free-standing sheets. An internal alignment of pyrenes leads to strong exciton coupling with an unprecedented observation (simultaneous development of J- and H-bands from two different electronic transitions). Despite the similarity in spectroscopic properties, the structural parameters of the 2 D aggregates drastically depend on the preparation procedure. Under certain conditions extra-large sheets (thickness of 2 nm, aspect ratio area/thickness ~ 107) in aqueous solution are formed 4 B. Finally, one-dimensional assemblies are formed as micrometer-long and nanometer-thick fibers. Both, planar and linear structures are intriguing objects for the creation of conductive nanowires that may find interest for applications in <b>supramolecular</b> <b>electronics...</b>|$|E
