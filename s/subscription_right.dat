50|$|In practice, {{the most}} common form of {{pre-emption}} right is the right of existing shareholders to acquire new shares issued by a company in a rights issue, a usually but not always public offering. In this context, the pre-emptive right is also called <b>subscription</b> <b>right</b> or subscription privilege. This is the right, but not the obligation, of existing shareholders to buy the new shares before they are offered to the public. In this way, existing shareholders can maintain their proportional ownership of the company, preventing stock dilution. In many jurisdictions, subscription rights are automatically provided for by statute, for example the UK, but in other jurisdictions it only arises if provided for under the constitutional documents of the relevant company, for example the US. In such countries shareholder rights are often violated leading to proceedings at the Court of Justice of the European Union.|$|E

The first is a company evaluation. In this aspect {{we will take a}} look only at the dependence of the expert providing the evaluation on major shareholder (chapter 5). Work aims at the second problematic aspect of unwilling transaction - a premium over the valuable consideration for the infringement of right (chapter 2, especially section 2. 4.).

We report evidence of a spread between the old stock price {{and the value of}} new shares obtained through subscription. A framework is developed within which to analyse the explanatory factors involved in this spread in the Spanish Stock Exchange. The empirical evidence suggests that new share prices during the subscription period are influenced by a range of factors, such as difference in the amount of tax to which <b>subscription</b> <b>rights</b> and capital gains are subject, characteristics of the issuer and the issue, norms established between clients and banks and the microstructure of the <b>subscription</b> <b>rights</b> market. ...|$|R

A second part of the study focuses on the fiscal side, trying to find the answer to the question: Are there deferred taxes recognized in equity?

50|$|A {{rights issue}} is a {{dividend}} of <b>subscription</b> <b>rights</b> to buy additional securities in a company made to the company's existing security holders. When the rights are for equity securities, such as shares, in a public company, it is a non-dilutive pro rata way to raise capital. Rights issues are typically sold via a prospectus or prospectus supplement. With the issued rights, existing security-holders have the privilege to buy a specified number of new securities from the issuer at a specified price within a subscription period. In a public company, a rights {{issue is a}} form of public offering (different from most other types of public offering, where shares are issued to the general public).|$|R

Although the price on the stock markets should reflect a new price of $300 (see below), the investor is actually not making any profit nor any loss. In many cases, the stock purchase right (which acts as an option) can be traded at an exchange. In this example, the price of the right would adjust itself to $100 (ideally).|$|R

40|$|Usually the {{dividend}} policy {{is seen as}} a way to approach the distribution of profit on the two classical directions. But {{the dividend}} policy influences the market value of a company, and if those who decide over this problem do not have an ethical behaviour, but pursue to distribute a great part of the profit as dividends under the form of free shares, contributes to the decrease in the current price of the company’s shares. The conclusion drawn from the present study is that the market value of a company will grow only if the distributed dividend is situated on a continuous upward curve. This fact imposes to resort sometimes to accumulated dividends and other times to the reduction of the part from the profit meant for investments in order to complete the dividends so that they are greater than in the previous year. the dividend policy; the company’s market value; the invested profit; the rate of dividend per share; the residual dividends; the accumulated dividends; the free shares; the company’s market image; the <b>subscription</b> <b>rights.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} {{under which}} conditions firms may signal {{the existence of}} good investment projects by the choice of low issuance prices at rights offerings. Fundamentally to the analysis is the assumption of boundedly rational investors who are loss avers and value different components of their total wealth on different mental accounts. A separating equilibrium may be attained by the choice of type-dependent offering prices given “sufficiently ” loss avers investors. In this connection, costs of mimicking “good type ” firms would emerge for “bad type ” firms from the undershooting of an individually critical issuance price from which on the resulting price per share following the offering lies below the reference price of the incumbent shareholders. Because of loss aversion and mental accounting, the loss in utility, felt in doing so, is valued more vigorous than corresponding additional proceedings {{from the sale of}} <b>subscription</b> <b>rights</b> {{as a consequence of the}} imitation of the offering price of “better” firms so that there is indeed separating firm behaviour. As a by-product of the analysis, on average positive announcement effects from rights offerings as well as an explanation for the empirically proven phenomenon of “dividend smoothing ” result.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The primary {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to find whether the <b>subscription</b> <b>rights</b> trade at their fundamental values in Finnish rights offerings. The secondary objectives of the study are to find whether the stock price of the issuing firm correctly adjusts to the de-attachment of the rights on ex-rights day; if there is an announcement date effect on the date of announcement; and how large is the discount to theoretical ex-rights price used in pricing of the offerings. DATA: The data on rights offerings and historical share prices is sourced from Nasdaq OMXH Stock Exchange. The sample of offerings is downloaded with use of Bloomberg Professional. The sample consists of all executed rights offerings in OMX Helsinki and its predecessor Helsinki Stock Exchange during time period 2003 - 2013. The size of the sample is 45 rights offerings. Characteristics of the rights offerings are picked from respective stock exchange announcements. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The study finds that on average the subscription prices trade at 20, 4 percent discount to their fundamental values when measured by daily closing prices. Other findings include the stock prices to underreact to the de-attachment of the rights; the abnormal return on the announcement date to equal - 1, 3 percent; and the discount to theoretical ex-rights price to equal 36, 0 percent.
