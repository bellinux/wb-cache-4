5|$|Construction of {{the system}} began in May 1998.

However, some sections were built using a balanced cantilever design, where <b>spans</b> were first built {{on their own and}} then connected to each other using the span-by-span method. The fact that the Jamaica branch had to be built {{in the middle of the}} Van Wyck Expressway, combined with the varying length and curves of the track <b>spans,</b> caused complications during construction. One lane in each direction was closed during the off-peak hours, causing congestion on the Van Wyck.|$|E

5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} <b>spans</b> extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} <b>spans</b> were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach <b>spans</b> were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter <b>spans</b> formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach <b>spans</b> by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining <b>spans.</b> At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main <b>spans.</b> The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A <b>spanning</b> tree of a {{connected}} graph is a sub graph {{that is a}} tree and connects all the verticestogether. A single graph can have many different <b>spanning</b> trees. We can also assign a weight to each edge, which is a number representing how unfavorable it is, and use this to assign a weight to a <b>spanning</b> tree by computing {{the sum of the}} weights of the edges in that <b>spanning</b> tree. A minimum <b>spanning</b> tree (MST) or minimum weight <b>spanning</b> tree is then a <b>spanning</b> tree with weight {{less than or equal to}} the weight of every other <b>spanning</b> tree. More generally, any undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum <b>spanning</b> forest, which is a union of minimum <b>spanning</b> trees for its components. Our objective is to find minimum cost (weight) <b>spanning</b> tree using the algorithm which is based on the weight matrix of weighted graph...|$|R

The results indicate that it is possible to obtain <b>span</b> differences without finding corresponding pronunciation rate differences.

40|$|International audienceMost {{studies in}} {{individual}} differences {{in the field of}} working memory research use complex <b>span</b> tasks to measure working memory capacity. Various complex <b>span</b> tasks based on different materials have been developed, and these tasks have proven both reliable and valid; several complex <b>span</b> tasks are often combined to provide a domain-general estimate of working memory capacity with even better psychometric properties. The present work sought to address two issues. Firstly, having participants perform several full-length complex <b>span</b> tasks in succession makes for a long and tedious procedure. Secondly, few complex <b>span</b> tasks have been translated and validated in French. We constructed a French working memory task labeled the Composite Complex <b>Span</b> (CCS). The CCS includes shortened versions of three classic complex <b>span</b> tasks: the reading <b>span,</b> symmetry <b>span,</b> and operation <b>span.</b> We assessed the psychometric properties of the CCS, including test-retest reliability and convergent validity, with Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and with an alpha <b>span</b> task; the CCS demonstrated satisfying qualities in a sample of 1, 093 participants. This work provides evidence that shorter versions of classic complex <b>span</b> tasks can yield valid working memory estimates. The materials and normative data for the CCS are also included...|$|R
