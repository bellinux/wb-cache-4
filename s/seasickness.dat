5|$|The two-month {{journey to}} the New World was marked by <b>seasickness</b> and boredom. The ship's captain, Lebourcier, {{intended}} to stop in the West Indies to sell cargo, but Lafayette, fearful of arrest, bought the cargo to avoid docking at the islands. He landed on North Island near Georgetown, South Carolina, on 13 June 1777.|$|E
5|$|Operation Chronicle, the {{landings}} at Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands, was the VII Amphibious Force's first operation, presented {{no great}} difficulty as the islands {{were known to}} be unoccupied. However half the assault troops experienced <b>seasickness,</b> problems were encountered with clearing the sand bar at the entrance to Guasopa Harbor, and Barbey's decision to land at night and withdraw before dawn in order to avoid encountering Japanese aircraft highlighted the inexperience of his crews and deficiencies in their training. Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina dragged on for a fortnight.|$|E
5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin {{spent most of}} that time on land {{investigating}} geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from <b>seasickness,</b> Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected in a calm spell.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} a decrepit yacht, the Granma, on 25 November 1956 Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 revolutionaries armed with 90 rifles, 3 machine guns, around 40 pistols and 2 hand-held anti-tank guns. The 1,200 mile crossing to Cuba was harsh, {{and in the}} overcrowded conditions of the ship, many suffered <b>seasickness,</b> and food supplies ran low. At some points they had to bail water caused by a leak, and at another a man fell overboard, delaying their journey. The plan had been for the crossing to take 5 days, and on the ship's scheduled day of arrival, 30 November, MR-26-7 members under Frank Pais led an armed uprising against government buildings in Santiago, Manzanillo and several other towns. However, the Granmas journey ultimately lasted 7 days, and with Castro and his men unable to provide reinforcements, Pais and his militants dispersed {{after two days of}} intermittent attacks.|$|E
5|$|In Dorchester, {{a damaged}} cargo ship from China washes ashore; {{all of the}} crew members seem to be {{infected}} with squid-like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Boston's Chinatown, only to suffer the same fate {{in the presence of}} a man (Tzi Ma). While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived <b>seasickness,</b> and that another ship is expected in two days. In the lab, Walter (John Noble) posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still-living worms bites Walter, boosting his white blood cell count and making him suddenly feel better.|$|E
5|$|To get to Ottawa, several {{thousand}} miles away, the club {{had to get}} to Whitehorse by overland sleigh, catch a train from there to Skagway, Alaska, then catch a steamer to Vancouver, B.C. and a train from there to Ottawa. On December 18, 1904, several players set out by dog sled and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a 330-mile trek to Whitehorse. At first the team made good progress, but the weather turned warm enough to thaw the roads, forcing the players to walk several hundred miles. The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road. At Whitehorse, the weather turned bad, causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their steamer in Skagway. The next one could not dock for three days due to the ice buildup. The club found the sea journey treacherous, and it caused <b>seasickness</b> amongst the team. When the steamer reached Vancouver, the area was too fogged in to dock, and the steamer docked in Seattle. The team from there caught a train to Vancouver, from which it left on January 6, 1905, arriving in Ottawa on January 11.|$|E
25|$|The SS Bessemer (also {{called the}} Bessemer Saloon) was an {{experimental}} Victorian cross-Channel passenger paddle steamer with a swinging cabin, a concept devised by the engineer and inventor Sir Henry Bessemer, intended to combat <b>seasickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aboard the ship, von Kammacher learns Ingigerd has {{a boyfriend}} {{with her and}} thus he backs down. Shortly after, he is called to treat a young Russian girl with <b>seasickness</b> and they nearly get romantically {{involved}} but class stops this from happening.|$|E
25|$|Reverend Angelo Power, died 9 May 1843. A {{native of}} Ireland and a Roman Catholic priest, {{he was on}} his way from Naples to Rome, when he burst a blood vessel from violent <b>seasickness.</b> His {{memorial}} was erected by the Reverend J.N. Palmer, of St John's College, Oxford, who also arranged the funeral.|$|E
25|$|Castalia {{was built}} in 1874 by the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, Leamouth for the English Channel Steamship Company. Costing about £70,000 to build, she was {{designed}} by a Captain Dicey, who thought {{that she should be}} more stable therefore leading to less <b>seasickness</b> for her passengers. Castalia was launched on 2 June. She was named for Lady Granville, who launched her.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, Lilly Field Hospital 32, {{named in}} Josiah’s honor, was {{equipped}} in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919. Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured {{more than two}} hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and <b>seasickness</b> medications for the D-Day invasion. In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war’s end.|$|E
25|$|On 27 August 1941, U-570 {{spent much}} of the morning submerged. She had been four days at sea and this was to give respite to a crew that was {{suffering}} acutely from <b>seasickness</b> (several had been incapacitated). Earlier that morning, a Lockheed Hudson bomber of 269 Squadron, flown by Sergeant Mitchell and operating from Kaldaðarnes, Iceland, had attacked her. The attack failed when the Hudson's bomb-racks failed to release its depth charges.|$|E
25|$|The Engineer Amphibian Command was {{activated}} on June 10, 1942. It {{was later}} renamed Amphibious Training Command. The command began operating at Camp Edwards, being {{under the command}} of Brigadier General Frank Keating. Amphibious training was conducted at the nearby Camp Candoit and Camp Havedoneit as well as at Martha's Vineyard. The 36th Infantry Division and the 45th Infantry Division were the divisions involved in training. Those divisions later fought in several European campaigns. The first <b>seasickness</b> pill was also tested by the divisions.|$|E
25|$|Frightened, Pi {{constructs}} a small raft out {{of rescue}} flotation devices, tethers {{it to the}} bow of the boat and makes it his place of retirement. He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer, and <b>seasickness</b> as a punishment mechanism, while using a whistle for signals. Soon, Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal, and is eventually able to share the boat with his feline companion, admitting in the end that Richard Parker is the one who helped him survive his ordeal.|$|E
25|$|Bessemer, {{a severe}} <b>seasickness</b> sufferer, devised in 1868 {{the idea of}} a ship whose {{passenger}} cabin - the Saloon - would be suspended on gimbals and kept horizontal mechanically to isolate the occupants from the ship's motion: an idea he patented in December 1869. After successful trials with a model, the levelling achieved by hydraulics controlled by a steersman watching a spirit level, Bessemer set up a limited joint stock company, the Saloon Ship Company, to run steamships between England and France. This gained £250,000 capital, financing the construction of a ship, the SS Bessemer, with the naval constructor Edward James Reed as chief designer.|$|E
25|$|Zachariah – Zachariah is the ship's cook who is cast in {{the role}} of the noble character. Early on, he offers Charlotte his {{friendship}} as well as a small knife for her protection. He cares for Charlotte during her first days of <b>seasickness,</b> and seems to be respected by the crew, although he is at times the butt of their jokes because he is the only black person on board. He tells Charlotte that he left his home in Africa as a teenager, and had been a sailor ever since. He has never lived in America and has never been a slave. At the end of the book, it becomes clear that he does not realize what his social status would be, even as a free man in Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} serialised in the Isle of Man Times and other {{regional}} UK newspapers between June and November 1889. In August 1889 Caine visited Iceland {{for the first}} time. In this, his first trip abroad with his wife, he set sail from Leith on the SS Magnetic via Bergen and the Faroe Islands. On {{the first leg of}} the trip {{he and his wife were}} overcome by <b>seasickness</b> but an onboard doctor curiously prescribed them opium, which successfully cured them. They stayed for two weeks in Iceland, including a visit to the sitting at Þingvellir. During his trip, Caine kept notes on things to add local colour to the Icelandic section of the book. These he generally kept in a disorderly manner, mostly on old envelopes and the backs of letters.|$|E
25|$|In France {{during the}} chaotic {{years of the}} French Revolution and its aftermath, the younger Audubon {{grew up to be}} a {{handsome}} and gregarious man. He played flute and violin, and learned to ride, fence, and dance. A great walker, he loved roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds' eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings. His father planned to make a seaman of his son. At twelve, Audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy. He quickly found out that he was susceptible to <b>seasickness</b> and not fond of mathematics or navigation. After failing the officer's qualification test, Audubon ended his incipient naval career. He was cheerfully back on solid ground and exploring the fields again, focusing on birds.|$|E
25|$|He was not keen on sport, {{but he was}} {{a highly}} {{proficient}} dancer. Fisher employed his dancing skill later in life to charm a number of important ladies. He became interested in dancing in 1877 and insisted that the officers of his ship learn to dance. Fisher cancelled the leave of midshipmen who would not take part. He introduced the practice of junior officers dancing on deck when the band was playing for senior officers' wardroom dinners. This practice spread through the fleet. He broke with the then ball tradition of dancing with a different partner for each dance, instead adopting the scandalous habit of choosing one good dancer as his partner for the evening. His ability to charm all comers of all social classes made up for his sometimes blunt or tactless comments. He suffered from <b>seasickness</b> throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} St. John's College in Annapolis {{with the}} intention of entering West Point, but unable to secure an appointment, he followed his older brother into the Naval Academy in 1907, graduating in June 1911, ranked 58th in merit in a class of 194. In March 1911, he submitted a letter of resignation effective on the date of graduation, listing <b>seasickness</b> as a primary reason, and as a result, the Academy's Permanent Medical Examining Board rejected him for active duty. After two days as an ensign, his resignation was accepted. He applied for commissioning in the United States Army and was appointed a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps on August 17, 1911, and went on active duty September 6 with the 118th Company CAC at Fort Monroe, Virginia. The next year he served in the 17th Company CAC at Fort Washington, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|... "Love and Death" [...] {{was filmed}} {{in an actual}} Stena Line ferry that {{travelled}} from Harwich to the Hook of Holland, Netherlands; Stena allowed the producers to film in the ferry, though the cabins were filmed in a constructed studio set. The two actors present, Hawes and Oyelowo took precautions to avoid <b>seasickness</b> before boarding. After filming on board concluded, both actors had to re-record some of the dialogue that was overshadowed by noises of the waves and engines.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{attended}} Paston Grammar School, North Walsham, {{until he}} was 12 years old, and also attended King Edward VI’s Grammar School in Norwich. [...] His naval career began on 1 January 1771, when he reported to the third-rate [...] as an ordinary seaman and coxswain under his maternal uncle, Captain Maurice Suckling, who commanded the vessel. [...] Shortly after reporting aboard, Nelson was appointed a midshipman and began officer training. Early in his service, Nelson discovered that he suffered from <b>seasickness,</b> a chronic complaint that dogged him {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
500|$|The Mayflower {{departed}} Plymouth, England on September 6, 1620 with 102 {{passengers and}} about 30 crew {{members in the}} small, 106 foot-long ship. [...] The seas were not severe during the first month in the Atlantic but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong north-Atlantic winter gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage. There were many obstacles throughout the trip, including multiple cases of <b>seasickness</b> and the bending and cracking of a main beam of the ship. One death occurred, that of William Button.|$|E
500|$|Despite these preparations, {{very little}} went {{according}} to plan. Ten landing craft were swamped by the rough seas {{before they reached}} the beach, and several others stayed afloat only because their passengers bailed water out with their helmets. <b>Seasickness</b> was prevalent among the troops waiting offshore. On the 16th RCT front, the landing boats passed struggling men in life preservers and on rafts, survivors of the DD tanks which had sunk in the rough sea. Navigation of the landing vehicles was made difficult by the smoke and mist obscuring the landmarks they were to use in guiding themselves in, while a strong current pushed them continually eastward.|$|E
500|$|After {{purchasing}} the decrepit yacht Granma, on November 25, 1956, Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 armed revolutionaries.

500|$|Cao Cao had chained his {{ships from}} stem to stern, {{possibly}} aiming to reduce <b>seasickness</b> in his navy, which comprised mostly northerners {{who were not}} used to living on ships. Observing this, divisional commander Huang Gai sent Cao Cao a letter feigning surrender and prepared a squadron of capital ships described as mengchong doujian (蒙衝鬥艦). The ships had been converted into fire ships by filling them with bundles of kindling, dry reeds, and fatty oil. As Huang Gai's [...] "defecting" [...] squadron approached the midpoint of the river, the sailors applied fire to the ships before taking to small boats. The unmanned fire ships, carried by the southeastern wind, sped towards Cao Cao's fleet and set it ablaze. A large number of men and horses either burned to death or drowned [...]|$|E
500|$|According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs, Gilbert's plot [...] "admirably sparked off Sullivan's genius". Sullivan {{embraces the}} {{nautical}} setting; in [...] "We Sail the Ocean Blue", for example, he [...] "presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty". In the Captain's opening song, [...] "I am the Captain of the Pinafore", {{he admits that}} his gentlemanliness [...] "never... well, hardly ever" [...] gives way to swearing at his men, and although he has experience at sea, he [...] "hardly ever" [...] suffers from <b>seasickness.</b> Sullivan [...] "unerringly found the right musical setting for the key phrase 'What never?'... cunningly sharpened... through the chromatic touch on the bassoon." [...] Audrey Williamson argued that the music of Pinafore is quintessentially English and free of European influences {{throughout most of the}} score, from the [...] "glee" [...] for Ralph, the Boatswain and the Carpenter, to [...] "For He Is an Englishman".|$|E
500|$|The forty-fifth {{departed}} Oran on 4 July 1943, {{with little}} {{attention paid to}} the fact that it was Independence Day. [...] The six-day trip to Sicily was smooth at first, then turned fairly rough, with <b>seasickness</b> prevalent among the troops. The weather calmed as several troop ships rendezvoused near the town of Scoglitti, on the western side of Sicily's south coast. At 2 a.m. on 10 July the landing craft were filled with infantrymen, and as the craft approached the shoreline, the Navy opened up with a volley of preparatory fire. [...] The primary mission of the Forty-fifth was to capture two airfields needed for Allied aircraft. [...] Comiso Airfield, about eleven miles from the shore, was captured in a day and was being used by American planes the next day. It took four days for the division to capture Biscari Airfield, about twelve miles inland.|$|E
500|$|As the {{two planes}} {{approached}} Darwin, word was received that a Japanese air raid was in progress there. The two B-17s therefore flew on to Batchelor Airfield, where they touched down at 09:30. MacArthur awarded Silver Stars to the crews {{of the two}} bombers. Brett's chief of staff, Brigadier General Ralph Royce, was on hand to greet them, and Brett had sent two Australian National Airways DC-3s {{to bring them to}} Melbourne. However, Jean now refused to fly any further, so MacArthur asked for a motorcade to take them to the nearest railway station, which was at Alice Springs, [...] away. Sutherland had received word of an incoming Japanese air raid, and asked Morhouse to intervene. Morhouse told MacArthur that Arthur, who had suffered badly from <b>seasickness</b> and airsickness, was on an intravenous feed, and could not guarantee that he would survive the trip across the desert. MacArthur then agreed to take the planes to Alice Springs. Sutherland had Huff hurry everyone onto the aircraft, which took off as the air raid siren sounded.|$|E
500|$|At Port Clarence, {{just north}} of Nome, 28dogs were taken on board before Karluk sailed north on 27 July. The next day she crossed the Arctic Circle, and almost {{immediately}} encountered rough weather which resulted in flooded cabins and <b>seasickness.</b> However, McKinlay noted that [...] "whatever defects she had, Karluk was proving herself a fine sea-boat." [...] On 31 July they reached Point Hope, where two Inuit hunters, known as [...] "Jerry" [...] and [...] "Jimmy", joined the ship. On 1 August the permanent Arctic ice pack was seen; Bartlett made several attempts to breach the ice, but each time was forced back. On 2 August, about [...] from Point Barrow, Karluk thrust {{her way into the}} ice but was soon trapped, and drifted slowly eastward for three days before reaching open water off Cape Smythe. Meanwhile, Stefansson had left to travel over the ice to Point Barrow. He rejoined the ship at Cape Smythe on 6 August, bringing with him Jack Hadley, a veteran trapper who required passage east. Hadley, a long-time acquaintance of Stefansson's, was entered in the ship's books as carpenter.|$|E
500|$|A third {{attempt was}} made in late July, but was again not {{successful}} due to the mechanical troubles and heavy <b>seasickness</b> the Carlins experienced. The Carlins set out for a fourth time in early August, and progressed further, being sighted several days after their launch by an American destroyer almost [...] off of New York. However, the couple soon lost radio contact, prompting Pan-American Airways to direct their crews to search for their craft. Half-Safe and the Carlins were finally rescued approximately [...] off New York by the oil tanker New Jersey, bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Seven days into the voyage, a propeller bearing had welded itself fast {{due to lack of}} lubrication, leaving the vessel to drift aimlessly for a further ten days without means of steering it or navigating. According to a message Carlin radioed from the tanker to his friends in New York, the couple [...] "drifted and fished", enjoying a [...] "pleasant life, cheaper than Atlantic City". At the time of the couple's rescue, he considered abandoning the entire voyage, but was convinced to continue by the tanker's Norwegian captain, who greeted Carlin with the words: [...] "Hell, you're not going to leave that god-damned Jeep lying around?!" ...|$|E
500|$|Training {{conditions}} {{aboard the}} ship {{were less than}} ideal throughout the voyage. Rough seas for parts of the journey hampered training and contributed to widespread <b>seasickness.</b> Although the long distance runners were able to practice by making multiple circuits of the ship, the sprinters and hurdlers were provided only a [...] cork track—two-thirds {{the length of the}} shortest track event at the games—on which to practice. Javelins were tethered by rope and aimed by their throwers at the sea, and, when thrown, would often come down in unexpected locations. The only facility for swimmers was a canvas saltwater tank set up on the lower deck; the tank split when filled for the first time. Even after it was repaired, the best the swimmers could do was to practice strokes while tied to the corner of the tank with a rope, and divers, with no other facilities available, were allocated just a few minutes a day in the tank. Conditions on the ship contributed to several injuries to athletes. During foggy weather, American decathlete Everett Ellis fell on the slippery deck, suffering a bad sprain, and shot putter Pat McDonald sprained his thumb while tossing a medicine ball on the pitching deck.|$|E
500|$|Of the newcomers, Roderick Carr, a New Zealand-born Royal Air Force pilot, {{was hired}} to fly the expedition's aeroplane, an Avro Baby {{modified}} as a seaplane with an 80-horsepower engine. He had met Shackleton in North Russia, and had recently been serving as Chief of Staff to the Lithuanian Air Force. Due to some missing parts, the aeroplane was not used during the expedition and Carr assisted with the general scientific work. The scientific staff included the Australian biologist Hubert Wilkins, who had Arctic experience, and the Canadian geologist Vibert Douglas, who had initially signed for the aborted Beaufort Sea expedition. The recruits who caught the most public attention were {{two members of the}} Boy Scout movement, Norman Mooney and James Marr. As the result of publicity organised by the Daily Mail newspaper, these two had been selected to join the expedition out of around 1,700Scouts who had applied to go. Mooney, who was from the Orkney Islands, dropped out during the voyage south, leaving the ship at Madeira after suffering chronic <b>seasickness.</b> Marr, an 18-year-old from Aberdeen, remained throughout, winning plaudits from Shackleton and Wild for his application to the tasks at hand. After being put to work in the ship's coal bunkers, according to Wild, Marr [...] "came out of the trial very well, showing an amount of hardihood and endurance that was remarkable".|$|E
500|$|Seabourn Legend was rented for {{six weeks}} at a {{reported}} cost of $38,000 per day; the ship served as the film's primary setting and provided accommodation for the cast and crew. [...] The evacuation sequence {{was among the first}} scenes filmed on the ship, and was shot in Key West, Florida over a two-week period. Approximately 30 hoses and the ship's fire sprinkler system were used to simulate heavy rainfall in the scene. Severe weather conditions from Hurricane Lili delayed production activity on the ship for several days, and caused <b>seasickness</b> among the cast and crew {{for the remainder of the}} production at sea. To make the ship appear faster, all exterior shots were filmed from a moving vehicle. Scenes on the bridge were filmed in a mockup dubbed the [...] "bridge ship", a large-scale reconstruction of the bow and bridge built atop the hull of a cargo ship. Additional ship interiors were filmed at Sony Pictures Studios and Warren Entertainment in Los Angeles County, California. Full-scale replicas of the ship's atrium, cabins, and engine rooms were constructed on sound stages where production took place for over a month. The scene where Alex rescues Drew while the ship is being flooded was filmed by camera operators wearing wet suits inside a sound stage tank, which was constructed with plywood and a hydraulic lift to give the effect that the water level was rising.|$|E
500|$|Half-Safes Australian tour {{began in}} late October 1955 in Perth, where Carlin grew up, and {{included}} {{a tour of}} his old school, Guildford Grammar. The Carlins then went to Adelaide, and subsequently progressed to Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. Half-Safe was returned to Calcutta on a steamship in January 1956. However, Elinore, Carlin's wife, left the trip in Australia, having finally tired of the long travel and the constant <b>seasickness</b> she was experiencing. Carlin continued his journey alone, with the first leg consisting of a sea voyage from Calcutta to Akyab, Burma, across the Bay of Bengal. At Akyab, he was joined by Barry Hanley, another Australian. The two met on Burma's coast in late February 1956, and from there crossed the Arakan Yoma mountain ranges to the Irrawaddy River, where the vehicle was bogged down in mud for two days. After extricating Half-Safe from the mire, the pair progressed to Rangoon, arriving on 11 March. From Burma, Half-Safe was driven overland to Bangkok, Thailand, {{and from there to}} Saigon, on the coast of Indochina. From there, Carlin and Hanley set out to sail from Indochina to Japan, passing through several ports and islands in the South China Sea. Upon his arrival in Hong Kong in early May 1956, Carlin was [...] "mobbed by autograph-seeking girls", having been delayed on his voyage by engine trouble and headwinds in the South China Sea. He arrived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in early June, and from there travelled to Keelung on the northern tip of Taiwan, and Okinawa, part of the American-administered Ryukyu Islands. Carlin and Hanley drove ashore at Kagoshima Prefecture at the southern tip of Japan in July 1956, and from there drove overland to Tokyo. Hanley returned to Australia at this stage, while Carlin rested in Japan, again performing much-needed repairs. An American journalist for The Japan Times, Boyé Lafayette de Mente (originally of Phoenix, Arizona), offered to accompany Carlin on the journey from Japan to Alaska, departing in early 1957 for the first stage of the trip from Tokyo to Wakkanai, Hokkaidō. The pair left Tokyo on 1 May 1957 to great fanfare, cheered off from the Mainichi and Yomiuri Newspaper buildings. The craft sprung a leak while crossing the Tsugaru Strait, separating the southern island of Honshu from Hokkaidō, and collided with submerged rocks near the port of Muroran. They finally reached Wakkanai on 12 June 1957, despite what de Mente later described as Carlin's aggression and [...] "irascible character" [...] during the trip.|$|E
2500|$|Mal de debarquement is rare {{disorder}} of imbalance caused by being {{on board a}} ship. [...] Patients suffering from this condition experience disequilibrium even when they get off the ship. Typically treatments for <b>seasickness</b> are ineffective for this syndrome.|$|E
