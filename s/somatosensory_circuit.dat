40|$|Mapping {{the flow}} of {{activity}} through neocortical microcircuits provides key insights into the underlying circuit architecture. Using a comparative analysis we determined {{the extent to which}} the dynamics of microcircuits in mouse primary somatosensory barrel field (S 1 BF) and auditory (A 1) neocortex generalize. We imaged the simultaneousdynamics of up to 1126 neurons spanningmultiple columns and layers using high-speed multiphoton imaging. The temporal progression and reliability of reactivation of circuit events in both regions suggested commonunderlying cortical design features. Weused circuit activity flow to generate functional connectivitymaps, or graphs, to test the microcircuit hypothesis within a functional framework. S 1 BF and A 1 present a useful test of the postulate as both regions map sensory input anatomically, but each area appears organized according to different design principles. We projected the functional topologies into anatomical space and found benchmarks of organization that had been previously described using physiology andanatomicalmethods, consistentwith a closemappingbetweenanatomyand functional dynamics. By comparinggraphs representing activity flow we found that each region is similarly organized as highlighted by hallmarks of small world, scale free, and hierarchical modular topologies. Models of prototypical functional circuits from each area of cortex were sufficient to recapitulate experimentally observed circuit activity. Convergence to common behavior by these models was accomplished using preferential attachment to scale from an auditory up to a <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuit.</b> These functional data imply that the microcircuit hypothesis be framed as scalable principles of neocortical circuit design...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are known}} to respond to diverse {{stimulus}} modalities. The energy modalities capable of eliciting somatosensory responses traditionally belong to mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic, and photonic domains. Ultrasound (US) applied to the periphery has also been reported to evoke diverse somatosensations. These observations however have been based primarily on subjective reports and lack neurophysiological descriptions. To investigate the effects of peripherally applied US on human <b>somatosensory</b> brain <b>circuit</b> activity we recorded evoked potentials using electroencephalography and conducted {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to fingertip stimulation with pulsed US. We found a pulsed US waveform designed to elicit a mild vibration sensation reliably triggered evoked potentials having distinct waveform morphologies including a large double-peaked vertex potential. Fingertip stimulation with this pulsed US waveform also led to the appearance of BOLD signals in brain regions responsible for somatosensory discrimination including the primary somatosensory cortex and parietal operculum, as well as brain regions involved in hierarchical somatosensory processing, such as the insula, anterior middle cingulate cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. By changing the energy profile of the pulsed US stimulus waveform we observed pulsed US can differentially activate <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuits</b> and alter subjective reports that are concomitant with changes in evoked potential morphology and BOLD response patterns.

To further our understanding of these oscillations, {{it is essential to}} study their occurrence and behavioral modulation in alert, awake animals. Here we show that microstimulation in barrel cortex of alert rats evokes 15 – 18 [*]Hz oscillations that are strongly modulated by motor behavior. In freely whisking rats, we found that the power of the microstimulation-evoked oscillation in the local field potential was inversely correlated to the strength of whisking. This relationship was also present in rats performing a stimulus detection task suggesting that the effect was not due to sleep or drowsiness. Further, we present a computational model of the thalamocortical loop which recreates the observed phenomenon and predicts some of its underlying causes. These findings demonstrate that stimulus-evoked oscillations are strongly influenced by motor modulation of afferent <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{peripheral}} nerve injury on somatosensory processing and pain are highly dependent upon {{the age at which}} the damage occurs. Adult nerve injury rapidly triggers neuropathic pain, but this is not so if the same nerve injury is performed in animals below postnatal day (P) 28, consistent with observations in paediatric patients. However, longitudinal studies show that pain hypersensitivity emerges later in life, when the animal reaches adolescence, an observation that could be of clinical importance. Here we discuss the evidence that the central consequences of nerve damage are critically determined by the status of neuroimmune regulation at different ages. In the first postnatal weeks, when spinal <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuits</b> are undergoing synaptic reorganisation, the ‘default’ neuroimmune response is skewed in an anti-inflammatory direction, suppressing the excitation of dorsal horn neurons and preventing the onset of neuropathic pain. As animals grow up and the central nervous system matures, the neuroimmune profile shifts in a pro-inflammatory direction, unmasking a ‘latent’ pain response to an earlier nerve injury. The data predicts that nerve injury in infancy and childhood could go unnoticed at the time, but emerge as clinically ‘unexplained’ or ‘functional’ pain in adolescence...|$|R
40|$|Poster Presentation: no. 449. 18 /DD 17 Topic: ++G. 04. b. OptogeneticsThe {{somatosensory}} thalamocortical {{system is}} an integral part in processing somatosensory information relayed by the peripheral nervous system. The lemniscal projection in particular is relayed through the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) to the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1). Previous electrophysiological studies stimulating the VPM and the lemniscal fibers in rodents have demonstrated the effect of frequency on the propagation of electrical activity to S 1. However, the effects of stimulation frequency beyond S 1 remain unknown and previous studies were limited by the non-cell-type specific electrical stimulation. Hence, optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) is used to provide whole-brain 4 D coverage and address the issue of non-cell-type-specificity. To enable selective optogenetic control of VPM thalamocortical excitatory neurons, CaMKIIα-channelrhodopsin-encoding virus was injected into the VPM of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Four stimulation frequencies (1, 5, 10 and 20 Hz) were used to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response. Stimulation at all four frequencies resulted in BOLD responses in S 1 and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S 2) that increases spatially as stimulation frequency decreases. Differences in the BOLD profile temporally at S 1 and S 2 were also observed when comparing 5, 10 and 20 Hz to 1 Hz stimulation. Intriguingly, large-scale cortical BOLD responses were detected beyond S 1 and S 2, namely at the visual (VC) and auditory (AC) cortex during 1 Hz stimulation. Intracortical local field potential (LFP) recordings were then performed at S 1 and bilateral VC in different animals guided by the ofMRI results. Recordings showed close correlation to the BOLD cortical responses in terms of their overall temporal characteristics at all stimulation frequencies. LFP latency measurements of evoked responses during 1 Hz stimulation indicated that the response was first evoked in S 1, followed by the ipsilateral VC and lastly the contralateral VC. It implies that such large-scale cortical response has a multi-synaptic basis of activity propagation. These results suggest that despite VPM being a highly specific thalamic relay in the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuit,</b> it is possible that low frequency stimulation, 1 Hz of VPM enables the recruitment of bilateral VC and AC via S 1 ’s long-range intrahemispheric cortical projections and subsequent commissural projections at ipsilateral VC and AC. Altogether, ofMRI has revealed the specificity of frequency in governing thalamocortical activity and highlighted its use in studying mechanisms of large-scale brain circuitry...|$|E

Disturbances {{to the development of the}} somatosensory system have serious consequences for social behaviour and may lead to many neurodevelopmental disorders. In our studies we used three different mouse models of disease. DISC 1 -cc transgenic mouse with transient disruption of the DISC 1 protein signalling was used in the project related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. DISC 1 is a molecule implicated in psychiatric disorders, which was discovered in a large Scottish family whose several members over four generations exhibited schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. In the following projects we focused on the fragile-X-syndrome-related problems. We analysed Fmr 1 KO mouse with a knock-out gene Fmr 1 coding the FMR 1 protein and the BC 1 KO mouse with a knock out gene coding BC 1 non-protein-coding RNA. Fmr 1 KO mouse constitutes the most popular mouse model of fragile X syndrome mimicking many of its phenotypes that occur in humans. In contrast, BC 1 KO mouse was created to study a specific role of this molecule rather than mimic symptoms of the fragile X syndrome. Both the FMR 1 protein and BC 1 non-protein-coding RNA are involved in control of a protein translation process and they are found in similar molecular complexes side by side. In DISC 1 -cc mice we expressed the truncated protein DISC 1 -cc for a controlled period of time at different points during the early postnatal development. Development is shaped by sensory experience, especially during phases known as critical periods. Disruption of experience in the critical period normally produces neurons that lack specificity for sensory experience in adulthood. We found that transient disruption of DISC 1 signalling during a critical period of development produced neurons that lack plasticity in adulthood. Adult plasticity deficits may be associated with cognitive deficits and the delayed onset of psychiatric symptoms in late adolescence. In Fmr 1 KO mice, we focused on analysing somatosensory processing defects that lead to hypersensitivity to touch in fragile X syndrome patients. We showed neuronal mechanisms that appear to underlie hypersensitivity to somatosensory stimuli (whisker deflections) thus causing an altered behaviour observed in Fmr 1 KO mice. In further studies on BC 1 KO mice, we characterized electrophysiological aspects of whisker-stimulation-evoked cortical responses and spontaneous activity of recorded neurons. We used similar recording protocols to the ones optimized by us for previous recordings in Fmr 1 KO mice therefore these experiments might be informative for future studies on specific roles and interactions between the FMR 1 protein and the BC 1 non-protein-coding RNA. Furthermore, our experiments on BC 1 KO mice were a part of a larger project that provides a broader overview of the phenotypes represented in this mouse. To sum up, using the whisker <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuit</b> as a model system we have obtained insight into potential disease mechanism involving sensory processing that could contribute to human brain disorders...|$|E
40|$|Understanding whether another's smile {{reflects}} authentic amusement {{is a key}} {{challenge in}} social life, yet, the neural bases of this ability have been largely unexplored. Here, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with a novel empathic accuracy (EA) task to test whether sensorimotor and mentalizing networks are critical for understanding another's amusement. Participants were presented with dynamic displays of smiles and explicitly requested to infer whether the smiling individual was feeling authentic amusement or not. TMS over sensorimotor regions representing the face (i. e., in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and ventral primary somatosensory cortex (SI)), disrupted the ability to infer amusement authenticity from observed smiles. The same stimulation did not affect performance on a nonsocial task requiring participants to track the smiling expression but not to infer amusement. Neither TMS over prefrontal and temporo-parietal areas supporting mentalizing, nor peripheral control stimulations, affected performance on either task. Thus, motor and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuits</b> for controlling and sensing facial movements are causally essential for inferring amusement from another's smile. These findings highlight the functional relevance of IFG and SI to amusement understanding and suggest that EA abilities may be grounded in sensorimotor networks for moving and feeling the body...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify whether specific athletic training also affects somatosensory Nogo potentials related to the inhibition of movements. The Nogo potentials were recorded at nine cortical electrode positions (Fz, Cz, Pz, F 3, F 4, C 3, C 4, P 3 and P 4) in 12 baseball players (baseball group) and in 12 athletes in sports, such as track and field events and swimming, that do not require response inhibition, such as batting for training or performance (sports group). The Nogo potentials and Go/Nogo reaction times (Go/Nogo RTs) were measured under a somatosensory Go/Nogo paradigm in which subjects were instructed to rapidly push a button in response to stimulus presentation. The Nogo potentials were obtained by subtracting the Go trial from the Nogo trial. The peak Nogo-N 2 was significantly shorter in the baseball group than that in the sports group. In addition, the amplitude of Nogo-N 2 in the frontal area was significantly larger in the baseball group than that in the sports group. There was a significant positive correlation between the latency of Nogo-N 2 and Go/Nogo RT. Moreover, there were significant correlations between the Go/Nogo RT and both the amplitude of Nogo-N 2 and Nogo-P 3 (i. e., amplitude of the Nogo-potentials increases with shorter RT). Specific athletic training regimens may induce neuroplastic alterations in sensorimotor inhibitory processes...|$|R

40|$|The catecholamines {{dopamine}} and noradrenaline {{provide some}} of the major neuromodulatory systems with far-ranging projections in the brain and spinal cord of vertebrates. However, development of these complex systems is only partially understood. Zebrafish provide an excellent model for genetic analysis of neuronal specification and axonal projections in vertebrates. Here, we analyze the ontogeny of the catecholaminergic projections in zebrafish embryos and larvae up to the fifth day of development and establish the basic scaffold of catecholaminergic connectivity. The earliest dopaminergic diencephalospinal projections do not navigate along the zebrafish primary neuron axonal scaffold but establish their own tracts at defined ventrolateral positions. By using genetic tools, we study quantitative and qualitative contributions of noradrenergic and defined dopaminergic groups to the catecholaminergic scaffold. Suppression of Tfap 2 a activity allows us to eliminate noradrenergic contributions, and depletion of Otp activity deletes mammalian A 11 -like Otp-dependent ventral diencephalic dopaminergic groups. This analysis reveals a predominant contribution of Otp-dependent dopaminergic neurons to diencephalospinal as well as hypothalamic catecholaminergic tracts. In contrast, noradrenergic projections make only a minor contribution to hindbrain and spinal catecholaminergic tracts. Furthermore, we can demonstrate that, in zebrafish larvae, ascending catecholaminergic projections to the telencephalon are generated exclusively by Otp-dependent diencephalic dopaminergic neurons as well as by hindbrain noradrenergic groups. Our data reveal the Otp-dependent A 11 -type dopaminergic neurons as the by far most prominent dopaminergic system in larval zebrafish. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that Otp-dependent dopaminergic neurons establish the major modulatory system for somatomotor and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuits</b> in larval fish.

40|$|SummaryA {{fundamental}} issue in cortical processing of sensory information is whether top-down control circuits from higher brain areas to primary sensory areas not only modulate but actively engage in perception. Here, we report {{the identification of}} a neural circuit for top-down control in the mouse <b>somatosensory</b> system. The <b>circuit</b> consisted of a long-range reciprocal projection between M 2 secondary motor cortex and S 1 primary somatosensory cortex. In vivo physiological recordings revealed that sensory stimulation induced sequential S 1 to M 2 followed by M 2 to S 1 neural activity. The top-down projection from M 2 to S 1 initiated dendritic spikes and persistent firing of S 1 layer 5 (L 5) neurons. Optogenetic inhibition of M 2 input to S 1 decreased L 5 firing and the accurate perception of tactile surfaces. These findings demonstrate that recurrent input to sensory areas is essential for accurate perception and provide a physiological model for one type of top-down control circuit...|$|R
40|$|Brain-controlled {{prostheses}} {{have the}} potential {{to improve the quality of}} life of a large number of paralyzed persons by allowing them to control prosthetic limbs simply by thought. An essential requirement for natural use of such neural prostheses is that the user should be provided with somatosensory feedback from the artificial limb. This can be achieved by electrically stimulating small populations of neurons in the cortex; a process known as cortical microstimulation. This dissertation describes the development of novel technologies for experimental neuroscience and their use to explore the neural and perceptual effects of cortical microstimulation in rodents. The first part of this dissertation describes the various tools built to study cortical microstimulation in awake, behaving rodents. Circuits were developed to simultaneously record and stimulate neurons in the cortex; thus paving the way for future research into neural responses to stimulation. Further, electrode coatings based on conductive polymers were explored to allow chronic neural stimulation without causing long term damage to the implanted electrodes or neural tissue. Two technologies were then developed to monitor different aspects of rodent behavior. Wireless accelerometers were built to monitor gross behavior and neural network based algorithms were developed to extract behavioral states from such acceleration data. Rats have poor visual acuity and actively scan their facial vibrissae or whiskers to feel the world around them. To study this whisking behavior, a video based whisker tracking system was developed which tracks the movement of a single whisker in real-time. The second part of this dissertation describes advances in neuroscience enabled by these tools. The neural response to microstimulation was explored in awake, behaving rats and it was found that microstimulation in barrel cortex evokes 15 - 18 Hz oscillations that are strongly modulated by motor behavior. In freely whisking rats, the power of the microstimulation evoked oscillation in the local field potential was inversely correlated to the strength of whisking. This relationship was also present in rats performing a stimulus detection task suggesting that the effect was not due to sleep or drowsiness. Further, a computational model of the thalamocortical loop is presented which recreates the observed phenomenon and predicts some of its underlying causes. These findings demonstrate that stimulus-evoked oscillations are strongly influenced by motor modulation of afferent <b>somatosensory</b> <b>circuits.</b> The perceptual effects of cortical microstimulation were then explored using behavioral studies. Tactile exploration of the environment involves the active movement of external mechanoreceptors and the integration of information across sensory and motor modalities. To explore the encoding of somatosensory feedback in such an active sensing system, a novel behavioral paradigm was introduced which precisely controls cortical microstimulation in real-time based on the movements of the animal. Using a real-time whisker tracking system, microstimulation was delivered in barrel cortex of actively whisking rats when their whisker crossed a software-defined target. Rats learned to rapidly integrate microstimulation cues with their knowledge of whisker position to compute target location along the rostro-caudal axis. This showed that rats can perform sensorimotor integration using electrically delivered stimuli. Moreover, it was discovered that rats trained to respond to cortical microstimulation responded similarly to physical whisker deflection suggesting that microstimulation in barrel cortex induces tactile percepts. This ability to encode tactile percepts in active sensing systems may be critical for providing the sense of touch to future users of motor neuroprostheses...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{behavior}} is mandatory for {{conservation of species}} and mediated by a state of sexual arousal (SA), involving both complex mental processes and bodily reactions. An early neurobehavioral model of SA proposes cognitive, emotional, motivational, and autonomic components. In a comprehensive quantitative meta-analysis on previous neuroimaging findings, we provide here evidence for distinct brain networks underlying psychosexual and physiosexual arousal. Psychosexual (i. e., mental sexual) arousal recruits brain areas crucial for cognitive evaluation, top-down modulation of attention and exteroceptive sensory processing, relevance detection and affective evaluation, as well as regions implicated in the representation of urges and in triggering autonomic processes. In contrast, physiosexual (i. e., physiological sexual) arousal is mediated by regions responsible for regulation and monitoring of initiated autonomic processes and emotions and for <b>somatosensory</b> processing. These <b>circuits</b> are interconnected by subcortical structures (putamen and claustrum) that provide exchange of sensorimotor information and crossmodal processing between and within the networks.

40|$|Understanding how humans {{represent}} others' pain {{is critical}} for understanding pro-social behavior. 'Shared experience' theories propose common brain representations for somatic and vicarious pain, but other evidence suggests that specialized circuits are required to experience others' suffering. Combining functional neuroimaging with multivariate pattern analyses, we identified dissociable patterns that predicted somatic (high versus low: 100 %) and vicarious (high versus low: 100 %) pain intensity in out-of-sample individuals. Critically, each pattern was at chance in predicting the other experience, demonstrating separate modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower limb: 93 % accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in <b>somatosensory</b> versus mentalizing-related <b>circuits</b> for somatic and vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional studies demonstrated {{the generalizability of the}} somatic pain pattern (which was originally developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also demonstrated the replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation.

40|$|Every second {{throughout}} life, cortical circuitry efficiently compresses and interprets huge {{volumes of}} incoming sensory information. This high fidelity sensory processing guides normal brain development and {{is essential for}} animals’ successful interaction with the environment. Low-level sensory perceptual disturbance is nearly ubiquitous in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but despite the potential to offer crucial insight into the abnormal development of higher brain function is poorly understood. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) {{is the most common}} heritable cause of ASD. Previous studies in the Fmr 1 -KO mouse model of FXS report cell-intrinsic, synaptic and local connectivity abnormalities in the neuronal physiology of primary sensory cortices. This suggests that sensory perceptual dysfunction could emerge from interacting circuit-wide pathophysiology to impair neural adaptations that support high fidelity sensory information processing. However, there is little mechanistic consensus about how this might occur. To address this, in this thesis I use brain slice electrophysiology and computer modelling to provide a bottom-up description of how thalamocortical (TC) responses, the principal cortical input for ascending sensory information, are mis-interpreted in the somatosensory Layer 4 (L 4) circuit in Fmr 1 -KOs at a crucial developmental transition to active sensory processing. Recruitment of intracortical L 4 network activity could be atypically evoked by lower frequency thalamic stimulation in Fmr 1 -KO slices. Furthermore, profound alterations to single-cell and network response dynamics were observed, in particular loss of spike timing precision considered critical for sensory circuit performance. These network phenomena were supported by interacting single-cell and local circuitry pathophysiology, including hyperexcitable cortical neurons and temporally distorted feed forward and feedback inhibition. Together, these data demonstrate cortical hypersensitivity to TC inputs and abnormal recruitment of network activity in critical period Fmr 1 -KO <b>somatosensory</b> cortical <b>circuits.</b> The hyperresponsiveness of intracortical circuitry may underlie tactile hyperexcitability and distorted sensory perception in FXS patients. Interestingly, modelling suggests that many of the alterations of synaptic and neuronal function are compensatory, thus minimizing the impact of the genetic lesion. Thus, this study shows {{for the first time that}} circuit level dysfunction emerges in the Fmr 1 -KO mouse from an accumulation of effects at the synaptic and cellular level; however, it also highlights the challenge of understanding which of these changes are pathological and which are compensatory...|$|R
