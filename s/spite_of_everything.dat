25|$|In 1953, the Battle Creek team {{became the}} Muskegon Lassies, {{and by the}} end of the season, it too, folded. Faut came back for her final year in the AAGPBL. Her team was {{weakened}} considerably by the player losses at the end of the previous season, and Faut was worn down from all the dissension. South Bend would finish the season second from last, compiling a 45–65 record. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> that had gone wrong, Faut still turned to post a 17–11 record and produced a league-best 1.51 ERA in 29 games, though league offensive levels were increasing. By her final season, only overhand pitching was allowed, the ball was a lively cork-centered ten inches, and the basepaths were seventy-five feet. More importantly from a pitching perspective, the pitching rubber was moved back to fifty-six feet, thirteen feet farther away than in 1946. At the same time, fences were moved in to allow for more home runs.|$|E

In that year he received the Grand-Croix of the Légion d'honneur, an honour rare for a musician. In 1922 the president of the republic, Alexandre Millerand, led a public tribute to Fauré, a national hommage, described in The Musical Times as [...] "a splendid celebration at the Sorbonne, in which the most illustrious French artists participated, [...] brought him great joy. It was a poignant spectacle, indeed: that of a man present at a concert of his own works and able to hear not a single note.

Subsequently, Hardiman was approached by an executive producer to direct episodes of the upcoming ABC Marvel superhero series, Inhumans which was filmed in the American state <b>of</b> Hawaii. In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> the difference in genre, Hardiman found the experience of filming Inhumans similar to her previous work, noting that both Happy Valley and Z: The Theory <b>of</b> <b>Everything</b> relied more on cinematic style and narrative techniques than verisimilitude.|$|R

In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> that had gone wrong, Faut still turned in a solid season by leading the league in wins (17), strikeouts (153) and ERA (1.51) in 29 games, to win the Triple Crown and Player of the Year honors.

2500|$|Life satisfaction, happiness, healthy {{behavioral}} practices, perceived efficacy, {{and academic}} success and adjustment {{have been associated}} with having high levels of self-esteem (Harter, 1987; Huebner, 1991; Lipschitz-Elhawi & Itzhaky, 2005; Rumberger 1995; Swenson & Prelow, 2005; Yarcheski & Mahon, 1989). However, a common mistake is to think that loving oneself is necessarily equivalent to narcissism, as opposed for example to what Erik Erikson speaks of as [...] "a post-narcissistic love of the ego". [...] A person with a healthy self-esteem accepts and loves himself/herself unconditionally, acknowledging both virtues and faults in the self, and yet, in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything,</b> is able to continue to love her/himself.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{the plans}} {{continued}} and the steel mill was eventually completed in late 1892 on Rose Hill (a full two miles (3km) from the lake's shore).

In <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything,</b> Kirk {{was determined not to}} give up on his namesake town, and Kirkland was finally incorporated in 1905 with a population of approximately 532. A final attempt at a steel mill in Kirkland was planned by James A. Moore in 1906. His company, the Northwestern Iron & Steel Company paid $250,000 in cash for a [...] site but the mill never materialized. This came at the heels of the Pacific Steel Company, incorporated earlier in 1906 by J.F. Duthie, William Calvert and L.S. Cragin. This company soon amounted to nothing.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of {{a general}} council had been upheld by several {{regional}} councils, by the cities of Ghent and Florence, by the University of Oxford and University of Paris, and by some most prominent doctors of the time, for example: Henry of Langenstein ("Epistola pacis", 1379, [...] "Epistola concilii pacis", 1381); Conrad of Gelnhausen ("Epistola Concordiæ", 1380); Jean de Charlier de Gerson (Sermo coram Anglicis); and especially the latter's master, Pierre d'Ailly, the eminent Bishop of Cambrai, who wrote of himself: [...] "A principio schismatis materiam concilii generalis primus … instanter prosequi non timui" [...] (Apologia Concilii Pisani, in Paul Tschackert). Encouraged by such men, by the known dispositions of King Charles VI and of the University of Paris, {{four members of the}} Sacred College of Avignon went to Leghorn where they arranged an interview with those of Rome, and where they were soon joined by others.

2500|$|Mordred, Arthur's illegitimate son, {{comes to}} Camelot to dishonor the King {{and tries to}} gain the throne for himself. Arthur puts him {{in charge of the}} knights’ {{training}} program, not knowing that Mordred is there to destroy the Round Table in revenge against Arthur for abandoning him, and detests the idea of being a Knight ("The Seven Deadly Virtues"). Arthur begins to feel the strain of ruling England, and both he and Guinevere wonder what commoners do without any such responsibilities ("What Do The Simple Folk Do?"). Mordred, meanwhile, has devised a plan to ruin Arthur and his kingdom permanently. He enters an enchanted glade where his aunt, the sorceress Morgan le Fay, dwells in an invisible castle. Morgan has a sweet tooth, and though she likes Arthur, Mordred manages to bribe her with a large supply of sweetmeats, to build one of her invisible walls around Arthur for one night, so that when he goes on his hunting trip the next day, he {{will not be able to}} get back to the castle ("The Persuasion"). [...] Meanwhile, Mordred incites the Knights to remember their former days of fighting and pillaging, and turns them against Arthur, ("Fie On Goodness!"). [...] With Arthur gone, Lancelot, unable to stop himself, visits Guinevere in her chambers, as Mordred fully suspected he would. [...] They kiss passionately ("I Loved You Once in Silence"). However, Lancelot and Guinevere's affair and Mordred's machinations come to a head when Mordred and some of the Knights of the Round Table interrupt, accuse Lancelot of treason, and try to take him prisoner. Lancelot fights them off and escapes, but Guinevere is arrested, tried, found guilty of treason by reason of her infidelity, and sentenced to be burned at the stake ("Guinevere"). At the execution, Arthur watches from a distance as Mordred taunts him for his failures; he is torn between upholding his law and doing his duty as a king, or sparing Guinevere, whom he still loves in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything.</b> At the last moment, Lancelot arrives with an army, rescues Guinevere and takes her off with him to France. But in the process, Lancelot has been forced to kill some of the other knights, leaving the survivors vowing revenge.|$|E
