5|$|During {{her maiden}} speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont {{was the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|E
25|$|When the Official Opposition has {{exhausted}} {{its initial}} three questions, the lead questioners {{of the other}} officially-recognized opposition parties are permitted an initial question and one <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> each, in order of size. Given {{the composition of the}} current 42nd Canadian Parliament, once the Official Opposition, the Conservative Party, is finished, the next question comes from the only other officially-recognized opposition party, the New Democratic Party.|$|E
500|$|Parliamentary time is {{also set}} aside for {{question}} periods in the debating chamber. A [...] "General Question Time" [...] takes place on a Thursday between 11:40a.m. and noon where members can direct questions to {{any member of the}} Scottish Government. At 2:30pm, a 40-minute-long themed [...] "Question Time" [...] takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between noon and 12:30p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister's Question Time takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction. Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions. Such a practice enables a [...] "lead-in" [...] to the questioner, who then uses their <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> to ask the First Minister a question on any issue. The five general questions available to opposition leaders are: ...|$|E

50|$|There is a 45-second {{time limit}} for {{questions}} and a four-minute time limit for answers in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, a questioner may ask an initial <b>question</b> and two <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> {{related to their}} initial question. Each question has a one-minute time limit. Answers to initial questions are limited to three minutes, and answers to <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> are limited to one minute. A senator may also move to 'take note' of a minister's answer after question time, allowing questioners (generally Opposition senators) {{to respond to the}} answers provided by ministers.|$|R
50|$|The Question is {{addressed}} to the portfolio of the Minister receiving the question, and the questioner must ask the question as written. Once a <b>question</b> is asked, <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> can be asked.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of question—Starred and non-starred. Starred Questions are those for which an oral answer is expected. The member is allowed to ask a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question,</b> with the {{permission}} of the Speaker, after the reply is obtained from the Minister concerned. Non-starred questions are those for which a written reply is expected. After the reply has been provided, no <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> can be asked. A notice period is to be given to the minister to reply to a question. However, if a Member seeks to ask a question urgently and cannot wait {{for the duration of the}} notice period, then the member can do so provided it is accepted by the Speaker. Such questions are called supplementary questions.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally {{the first}} {{question}} tabled is on a specific area of policy, not the engagements question. This, though, is quite rare as it would allow the Prime Minister to prepare a response in advance; the non-descript question allows some chance of catching him or her out with an unexpected <b>supplementary</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E

50|$|If {{a member}} desires oral answer, he is {{required}} to indicate the question by putting an asterisk mark (*) before it. The questions are answered in {{the order in which}} they are printed in the list of questions put for the day. Members are restricted to three such questions for any sitting day. The questions are asked in the order listed by the member who requested it. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> can be asked for the purpose of eliciting further information on any matter of fact. The Speaker decides the number of <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> according to the importance of a question.|$|R

50|$|The game {{consisted}} of three celebrities identifying four places around the United Kingdom, {{as well as a}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> set in those locations. The four locations join up to form a giant X on the map. Where the two lines cross, a treasure is (metaphorically) hidden. The panel have to identify the treasure using up to four lines of a riddle gained by answering the supplementary questions correctly. Unlike the UK television programme Treasure Hunt, there is no actual buried treasure and the panel do not have to fetch it, merely identify it.|$|E
5000|$|Backbench MPs {{wishing to}} ask a {{question}} must enter their names on the Order Paper. The names of entrants are then shuffled in a ballot to produce a random order in which they will be called by the Speaker. The Speaker will then call on MPs to put their questions, usually in an alternating fashion: one MP from the government benches is followed by one from the opposition benches. MPs who are not selected may be chosen {{to ask a}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> if they [...] "catch the eye" [...] of the Speaker, which is done by standing and sitting immediately before the prime minister gives an answer.|$|E
5000|$|Questions for oral answer are {{selected}} by ballot {{a few days}} before the question time takes place and published. Ministers therefore have advance warning of the initial questions, but after each question has been answered, the MP in whose name it appears may ask a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> on the same subject area for which no notice is given (unless the MP chooses to do so privately). The Speaker will usually call other MPs to ask further supplementary questions and this will often include Opposition front bench spokespersons. A second ballot enables MPs to put forward their names to ask a topical question for which no notice is required.|$|E

50|$|In New Zealand oral {{questions}} are asked at 2pm on each sitting day. Twelve principal oral {{questions are}} asked, with <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> also given that must {{relate to the}} initial subject matter. The opportunity to ask questions is equally shared amongst {{the members of the}} house, excluding ministers. Urgent Questions, while possible, are uncommon.|$|R
50|$|The Indian Councils Act 1909 officially {{introduced}} {{the method of}} electing members to the Council, but did not provide for direct election of the members. It abolished automatic official (executive) majorities in the Council and gave its members the power to move resolutions upon matters of general public interest and the budget and also to ask <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the House of Lords, {{a half-hour}} is set aside each {{afternoon}} {{at the start of}} the day's proceedings for Lords' oral questions. A peer submits a question in advance, which then appears on the Order Paper for the day's proceedings. The Lord shall say: [...] "My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper". The Minister responsible then answers the question. The Lord is then allowed to ask a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> and other peers ask further questions on the theme of the original put down on the order paper. (For instance, if the question regards immigration, Lords can ask the Minister any question related to immigration during the allowed period).|$|E
50|$|Before {{listing the}} day's engagements, the Prime Minister {{sometimes}} extends condolences or offers congratulations after significant events. During the Iraq War, Tony Blair introduced {{the practice of}} naming any British military personnel {{who had been killed}} in service since the last time he addressed the House. The practice has been continued by Blair's successors as prime minister. After this, the MP may ask a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> about any subject which might occupy the Prime Minister's time. Most MPs table the same engagements question and so after it has been asked for the first time, any other MPs who have tabled the same question are simply called to ask an untabled question, meaning that the Prime Minister will not know what questions will be asked.|$|E
50|$|The First Minister is {{responsible}} to the Scottish Parliament for their actions and {{the actions of the}} overall Scottish Government. MSPs can scrutinise the activities of the First Minister and their Cabinet by tabling written questions or by asking oral questions in the Scottish Parliament. Direct questioning of the First Minister takes place each Thursday at noon, when Parliament is sitting. The 30-minute session enables MSPs to ask questions of the First Minister, on any issue. The leaders of the largest opposition parties have an allocation of questions and are allowed to question the First Minister each week. Opposition leaders normally ask an opening question to the First Minister, relating to their meeting with the Scottish Cabinet, or when they next expect to meet the Prime Minister, and then follow this up by asking a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> on an issue of their choosing.|$|E

Correlations between outcome measures and anchors were calculated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Thresholds were established by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, using multiple anchors.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of a typical Question Period, the Speaker recognizes the Leader of the Opposition to ask the lead question. It is {{possible}} for the question to be asked by a designee of the Leader of the Opposition, yet this Member of Parliament must {{be a member of the}} Official Opposition. Following the answer to the lead question, the lead questioner has two more questions permitted, referred to as <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions.</b> These questions may be asked by the same Member of Parliament to follow up on the answer provided to the lead question, or they may be given to another member of the Official Opposition.|$|R

We examined the relations between depressive symptoms and desire for early death (natural or by euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide) in 142 terminally ill {{patients with}} cancer being cared for by a specialist palliative care team. They completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire and answered four <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> on desire for early death...|$|R

40|$|This {{proposal}} recommends restructuring {{question time}} {{with the aim of}} making it a more effective mechanism for seeking the accountability of the executive government to parliament. This would involve replacing the current system, of one question without notice and one <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> from the questioner, with a system of one primary question on notice and multiple supplementary questions not confined to the questioner, and a stricter requirement for relevance of answers. The proposals are as follows: (1) All primary questions to be placed on a Question Time Notice Paper by 11 am. (2) Up to 6 supplementary questions following each primary question. (3) Up to 2 minutes for an answer to each primary or <b>supplementary</b> <b>question.</b> (4) Answers to be directly relevant to each question. The Senate Procedure Committee is seeking responses to the paper...|$|E

The interview contains two meaningful parts and consists of basic 12 questions. The interview questions are developed to {{capture the essence of}} coaching in organisational context. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> are asked based in the individual experience of the practitioners.

50|$|The {{right to}} ask {{questions}} {{was given to the}} legislators for the first time by the Act of 1892, and to ask <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> in 1909. Any act of the Government can be made the subject of a question. Even though the question is directed to a particular minister, it is his office that is responsible for framing a response. Formally, it is the process of eliciting information from the government. However, the question hour has been used to bring out several administrative lapses.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{refers to}} {{selected}} problems of exploitation {{in the face}} of justice. The analysis is based on the definitions of exploitation contained in the Polish Penal and Civil Codes. The main subject of our interest is the identification of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the recognition of exploitation as being unjust. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>question</b> will refer to a specific type of justice which should be considered in this case. In respect to this we should consider retributive, distributive and social justice. Another important factor in this regard is the accepted theory of value. In the considered subject we will focus on the labour theory of value. The principal problem could be reduced to questions whether the exploitation is ipso facto unjust and how these two phenomena are related to each other...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{network based}} sequence-to-sequence models in an encoder-decoder {{framework}} {{have been successfully}} applied to solve Question Answering (QA) problems, predicting answers from statements and questions. However, almost all previous models have failed to consider detailed context information and unknown states under which systems {{do not have enough}} information to answer given questions. These scenarios with incomplete or ambiguous information are very common in the setting of Interactive Question Answering (IQA). To address this challenge, we develop a novel model, employing context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. We also generate unique IQA datasets to test our model, which will be made publicly available. Employing these attention mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> for additional input depending on different contexts. When available, user's feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer an answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over state-of-the-art conventional QA models.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} ability of a cohort of junior {{hospital}} doctors to interpret ECGs which have immediate clinical relevance and influence subsequent management of patients. METHODS: 57 junior hospital doctors were interviewed and asked to complete a standard questionnaire which included eight ECGs for interpretation and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>question</b> relating to the administration of thrombolytic treatment. Each doctor was assessed over a 48 h period while they performed their daily clinical duties. RESULTS: The major abnormality of anterior myocardial infarction was recognised by almost all doctors. There was difficulty in the interpretation of posterior myocardial infarction and second degree heart block. Most myocardial infarctions would have been given satisfactory thrombolysis, but there was a reluctance to use this treatment in patients with posterior myocardial infarction and left bundle brach block. A few patients without myocardial infarction would have received thrombolytic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There is varying ability among junior hospital doctors in the interpretation of the emergency electrocardiogram. The results are of concern as poor interpretation of the ECG can result in inappropriate management. As a result of {{the findings of this study}} it is proposed to introduce more formal training in the interpretation of clinically relevant ECG abnormalities for junior hospital doctors...|$|E
50|$|The universities, {{district}} board, municipalities, zamindars and {{chambers of}} commerce were empowered to recommend members to provincial councils.

It also relaxed restrictions imposed by the Indian Councils Act 1861, thus allowing the councils to discuss each year's annual financial statement. They could also put questions within certain limits to the government {{on the matter of}} public interest after giving six days' notice, but none of them was given right to ask <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions.</b> Thus it prepared the base of Indian democracy.|$|R

The questionnaire used to assess the respondents’ level of financial literacy closely followed the OECD INFE guidelines to measure financial literacy across countries. It included both a core questionnaire and a set of <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions</b> aimed at investigating issues such as the ability to properly access and use financial information and to plan for retirement, which were considered to be of interest for a better description of the Italian population’s level of financial literacy.|$|R
30|$|Ethnic {{background}} Our {{first step}} was to ensure that all participants were Iranian-American. All were. In order to gain a fuller picture of participants’ backgrounds, we asked a few <b>supplementary</b> <b>questions.</b> These included: “Do you identify with any other ethnic group besides Iranian-American? (e.g., Azerbaijani, Afghani, Bahrani, etc.)?” About half of participants identified with an additional sub-ethnic group (say, for example, Turkish-Iranian). Participants’ generational status was also assessed. We asked, “How many generations has your family been in the USA?” The majority (83  %) was born outside the US and 18  % were born in the USA.|$|R
