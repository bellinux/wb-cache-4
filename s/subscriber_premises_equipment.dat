5000|$|A DSL loop {{extender}} or DSL repeater is {{a device}} that a telephone company can place between <b>subscriber</b> <b>premises</b> <b>equipment</b> and central office interfaces to extend the distance and increase the channel capacity of digital subscriber line (DSL) connections. ADSL repeaters are deployed by rural telephone companies trying to provide rural Internet service to farms and small towns where it is impractical to place the DSLAM closer to the subscriber. Typical distance improvements with a loop extender are shown in the diagram below, with rate in megabits per second and distance in thousands of feet.|$|E

The consumer <b>premises</b> <b>equipment</b> encapsulates the IPv4 packets in an IPv6 wrapper and sends them to a host known as the AFTR element. The AFTR element de-encapsulates the packets and performs network address translation before sending them to the public Internet. The NAT in the AFTR uses the IPv6 address of the client in its NAT mapping table. This means that different clients can use the same private IPv4 addresses, therefore avoiding the need for allocating private IPv4 IP addresses to customers or using multiple NATs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The main {{challenge}} in resource allocation in cogni tive radio based IEEE 802. 22 networks {{is the absence}} of pre defined control channels. Moreover, the fleeting nature of the available spectrum also hinders the communication as the radios must relinquish the acquired channels once the primary users of those channels return. In this paper, we propose a performance metrics based data channel allocation scheme for IEEE 802. 22 networks where the base station allocates interference free channels to the consumer <b>premise</b> <b>equipments</b> using a spectrum map. The base station creates the spectrum map by using the raw spectrum usage data that are shared by a small subset of consumer <b>premise</b> <b>equipments.</b> The usage data are fused at the base station using a modified version of Shepard's interpolation technique. We construct a continuous and differentiable spatial distribution of spectrum usage that the base station consults to estimate the spectrum occupancy vector at any arbitrary location in its cell. Such spectrum usage is then utilized to proactively evaluate some key network and radio performance metrics which in turn help allocating the best candidate channel to a given consumer <b>premise</b> <b>equipment</b> ensuring highest achievable performance.
