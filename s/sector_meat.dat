40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{current situation}} in Russian agricultural and food sector and evaluates forthcoming development. Russia's agricultural production diminished by half {{at the beginning}} of the 1990 s, and since that the production has hardly grown. In fact, Russia is one of the biggest food importers in the world. Particularly in livestock sector the situation is difficult. Number of livestock has not grown according to expectations and production does not satisfy domestic demand. Crop husbandry, by contrast, has export potential, but fluctuations in export volumes have been great. Furthermore, quality of grain has not always met standards. Russia's food industry has grown rapidly in the past few years, even though Russia has not reached self-sufficiency. Foreign investments have improved quality level of Russia's food industry. However, food imports will continue in the next ten years in bulk food products. For example current meat import volumes will remain more or less unchanged. Moreover, import demand of more specialised production inputs will grow. Russian agro food sector, dairy <b>sector,</b> <b>meat</b> production, crop husbandry, food industry, Agribusiness,...|$|E

40|$|TRIOPOL {{studies the}} role of {{domestic}} bioenergy potentials for agriculture, the wider economy and international trade for Austria. In particular, agricultural biomass production can contribute to significant shares of energy provision in Austria. A detailed scenario is developed to explore the opportunities and challenges of enhanced domestic biomass production based on short rotation forestry (SRF) for heat supply which is currently among the most competitive technologies. To that end, TRIOPOL establishes a model linkage between a sectoral supply-model for Austrian agriculture and a national small open economy general equilibrium model. Model results show that a biomass premium of 65 € per ton dry matter is required to support 250, 000 ha of SRF on cropland in Austria by 2020. The thus provided bioheat covers some 33 petajoule (PJ) heat energy demand in Austria; {{taking into account the}} likely rising of energy prices by 2020, this number rises to 47 PJ. Substantial land use changes may also be compensated by increases in land use intensity and as well as changes in imports and exports.

We will investigate if in the last years the integration process has ultimately led to narrow the gap in the economic performances and efficiency of the firms. The choice of meat processing industry is due to the fact that in Hungary theres a remarkable animal production, whereas in the Emilia-Romagna region the meat industry reflects an organizational structure based on the concentration and specialization in agri-food districts. This paper compares the financial-economic performances and the technical efficiency of firms involved in the industry of meat processing in Hungary and in an Italian region, Emilia-Romagna.

The countries or blocks that were chosen are The European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Popular Republic of China (PRC) and Japan. To analyze the <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> exportation potential, four methodological generalizations are developed: the importing {{potential of the}} mentioned countries, the calculus of the evolution in the Revealed Advantage Index of Brazilian exportations and its main competitors, bibliographical research of the main existing trade barriers and the calculus of the Regional Orientation Index. The results concerning the importing potential indicate that the European Union (EU) consists of a very attractive market to Brazilian beef. The results of the calculus of comparative advantages reveal that Brazil has a higher competitivity in <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> and it increasing in the period between 1990 and 2003. When considering the competitors inside each block or country, the European Union shows up as the major competitor. As far as the imposed trade barriers, these come out, in a general way, as extremely high and sometimes representing a blockage. Thus, the Brazilian <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> would be largely improved if these barriers were eliminated.

40|$|Livestock farmers, {{slaughterhouses}} {{and packaging}} actors within the Dutch <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> often don’t comply with {{rules and regulations}} in place, among others, concerning animal welfare and/or animal or public health. Until now, practitioners have mainly focused on highlighting the cases of non-compliance by actors in the <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> taking place under centralized governance, to appeal to these centralized governance actors to take on action and successfully conduct compliance control. In addition, practitioners have mainly focused on compliance control with regard to rules and regulations for regular meat production under centralized governance instead of also scrutinizing compliance control regarding “extra legal” rules and regulations and/or norms or standards for free-range and organic meat production under centralized governance and/or compliance control under self-governance. Therefore, the knowledge gap can be divided in two focus points. Firstly, this research aims to directly analyze what conditions are required for successful compliance control under centralized governance. Secondly, this study aims to explore what conditions lead to successful compliance control, by also taking into account compliance control under centralized governance concerning “extra-legal” rules and regulations and compliance control under self-governance for “extra-legal” norms and standards. Overall, the study answers the following overarching research question: What are the conditions of successful compliance control under centralized governance and self-governance in the Dutch <b>meat</b> <b>sector?</b> Ultimately, recommendations relevant for governance actors of compliance control, what conditions they should emphasize for compliance control under both centralized governance and self-governance to be successful, are formulated. Steps taken to answer this question, in this thesis firstly a theoretical part based on literature review ultimately resulting in a checklist of two overarching conditions of successful compliance control, namely efficiency and professionalism are included. Subsequently, efficiency is composed by the following conditions: -	Empowerment and collaboration; -	Coordination. Whereas, the condition of professionalism is built by: -	Relational and epistemic independency; -	Enforcement; -	Transparency and clarity; -	Expertise and skills. In the thesis each of these aforementioned conditions of efficiency and professionalism will be operationalized. In theory, compliance control under centralized governance seems to put an emphasis on relational and epistemic independency and enforcement, whereas under self-governance empowerment and collaboration and expertise and skills are highlighted. For these theoretical success conditions it is scrutinized to what extent they are comparable with practical implications for successful compliance control in the <b>meat</b> <b>sector.</b> In order to refine the theoretical conditions an embedded comparative case study has been conducted, for which the chicken <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> is chosen as a representative and an interesting case for the <b>meat</b> <b>sector.</b> Two cases representing compliance control under centralized governance are studied; the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) controlling for compliance with regular rules and regulations and the EU Organic Symbol regarding compliance control for “extra-legal” rules and regulations. Also, two cases of compliance control under self-governance have been explored; IKB Kip as well as Beter Leven Kenmerk for compliance control with regard to “extra legal” norms and standards. Differences between the practical implications for compliance control under centralized governance and self-governance {{with regard to the}} theoretical conditions of successful compliance control are minimal. Overall, the cases representing compliance control under centralized governance in the chicken <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> in practice focus more on the theoretical conditions of successful compliance control: relational and epistemic independency. On the other hand, the cases representing compliance control under self-governance in the chicken <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> put a bigger emphasis on the conditions of empowerment and coordination, transparency and clarity and expertise and skills than the cases representing compliance control under centralized governance in the chicken <b>meat</b> <b>sector.</b> No differences are found between the cases representing compliance control under centralized governance and self-governance in the chicken <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> in practice with respect to the theoretical conditions of coordination and enforcement for successful compliance control. Overall, all theoretical conditions are more emphasized in practice under “extra-legal” compliance control – especially under centralized governance – than under compliance control for regular rules and regulations. Principally, empowerment and collaboration and enforcement find more emphasis in practice under compliance control with respect to “extra-legal” rules and regulations and norms and standards. The overall conclusion is that in practice differences are small between the conditions of compliance control under centralized and self-governance mode in the <b>meat</b> <b>sector.</b> Specifically, it was found that self-governance in contrast to centralized governance puts a slightly bigger emphasis on the majority of conditions, namely empowerment and collaboration, transparency and clarity and expertise and skills with regard to successful compliance control. Centralized governance in contrast to self-governance stresses the condition of relational and epistemic independency a little more. In particular, comparing compliance control for regular rules and regulations with “extra-legal” rules and regulations and norms and standards – in practice, the latter puts more emphasis on the theoretical conditions of empowerment and collaboration and enforcement. Based on these findings this study recommends policy makers to particularly enhance their focus on the following conditions to reach successful compliance control under centralized governance (especially with regard to compliance control concerning regular rules and regulations) : •	Empowerment and collaboration •	Enforcement •	Transparency and clarity •	Expertise and skills Also, this study recommends policy makers to increase their focus on the following conditions to reach successful compliance control under self-governance: •	Relational and epistemic independenc...|$|R

30|$|Meat trade {{liberalization}} {{is expected to}} have different impacts on exports and imports. The study addresses the export and import changes under the BAU and different trade agreement scenarios. In the CAM 2030 scenario compared with the BAU 2030 scenario, export increases for most agricultural sectors, such as the grain, vegetables and fruits, sugar, plant-based fibers, milk, wool, vegetable oils and fats, and the dairy product sectors. For imports, the impacts on each agricultural sector are different. For instance, grains, vegetables and fruits, and the vegetable oils and fats sectors are expected to decrease their imports. Compared with the BAU 2030 scenario, imports of rice, wheat, and other grains are likely to decrease by 3, 2.9, and 1.6 %, respectively. Imports of vegetables and fruits are estimated to decrease by 2.4 %, while import of vegetable oils and fats is likely to decline by 1.8 %. The reason {{is similar to that of}} the results for the MTR scenarios. For oilseeds, other crops, and other meat products, both exports and imports are expected to be higher than they are in the BAU 2030 scenario, but exports are estimated to grow faster than imports. For the other <b>meat</b> <b>sectors,</b> including beef animal sectors, other animal <b>sectors,</b> and other <b>meat</b> <b>sectors,</b> the import growth is higher than export growth in the CAM 2030 scenario.

40|$|Consumption of meat is an {{important}} source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and deep decarbonisation of the whole meat production chain is required to be able to meet global climate change (CC) mitigation goals. Emissions happen in different stages of meat production ranging from agricultural input production, feed production, livestock production to slaughtering, meat processing, and retail. An overview of direct emissions from processes in the <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> themselves and indirect emissions from energy consumptions would provide a clearer picture for potential CC impact reduction. This paper explores the total GHG emissions and data availability within the <b>meat</b> <b>sector</b> of the pig, chicken, and cattle meat product system. Through statistical data provided by FAOSTAT and supplementary data from literature, the CC impacts of energy use and process GHG emissions in the pig, chicken and cattle meat life cycle are estimated. Cattle dominates, but pig and chicken meat have a sizable amount of GHG emissions with a relatively high contribution from agricultural inputs and post-farm processes. However, uncertainty and unavailability of data are large for the energy consumption, direct GHG emissions, and product flows of post-farm and agricultural input processes.
