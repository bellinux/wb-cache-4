5000|$|Extremal {{optimization}} (EO) Unlike GAs, which {{work with}} a population of candidate solutions, EO evolves a single solution and makes local modifications to the worst components. This requires that a suitable representation be selected which permits individual solution components to be assigned a quality measure ("fitness"). The governing principle behind this algorithm is that of emergent improvement through selectively removing low-quality components and replacing them with a randomly <b>selected</b> <b>component.</b> This is decidedly at odds with a GA that selects good solutions in an attempt to make better solutions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} is a fine-grained search, and superficially resembles a hill climbing (local search) technique. A more detailed examination reveals some interesting principles, {{which may have}} applicability and even some similarity to broader population-based approaches (evolutionary computation and artificial immune system). The governing principle behind this algorithm is that of improvement through selectively removing low-quality components and replacing them with a randomly <b>selected</b> <b>component.</b> This is obviously at odds with genetic algorithms, the quintessential evolutionary computation algorithm that selects good solutions {{in an attempt to}} make better solutions.|$|E
50|$|In one classic though dated {{example of}} VGR used for {{industrial}} manufacturing, the vision system (camera and software) determines {{the position of}} randomly fed products onto a recycling conveyor. The vision system provides the exact location coordinates of the components to the robot, which are spread out randomly beneath the camera's field of view, enabling the robot arm(s) to position the attached end effector (gripper) to the <b>selected</b> <b>component</b> to pick from the conveyor belt. The conveyor may stop under the camera to allow {{the position of the}} part to be determined, or if the cycle time is sufficient, it is possible to pick a component without stopping the conveyor using a control scheme that tracks the moving component through the vision software, typically by fitting an encoder to the conveyor, and using this feedback signal to update and synchronize the vision and motion control loops.|$|E

40|$|PeerWise is a {{web based}} system where {{students}} are able to write, answer and comment on each others multiple choice questions. It was introduced {{at the start of a}} five week Student <b>Selected</b> <b>Component</b> in head and neck anatomy for the third year medical cohort. It was not compulsory and participation in it did not contribute to the final examination marks. 39 of the total 52 students within the Student <b>Selected</b> <b>Component</b> enrolled with PeerWise and they generated 38 questions, with some students writing several questions and others none. Of those students that had written one or more questions, they scored higher in the final examination than those who did not (p< 0. 0005 for rank in the year, p= 0. 001 for percentage attained in examination). The students who had composed at least one question had improved their final examination mark by approximately. The number of questions answered did not correlate with an improved examination mark (Spearman’s rho = - 0. 043, with percentage attained in examination (p = 0. 763) and 0. 041 with rank in year (p = 0. 773)). This study has shown that the use of PeerWise in a Student <b>Selected</b> <b>Component</b> improves examination performance, but only when the student composes questions, and engages in the question writing process. It could be that a higher cognitive level of engagement with the course material occurs by constructing questions, providing the answers and creating a variety of options (including explanations) results in improved examination performance...|$|E
