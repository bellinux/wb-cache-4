We refer to this technique as <b>Smart</b> <b>Mode.</b> In the following we will detail how <b>Smart</b> <b>Mode</b> takes advantage of FEC and interleaving techniques, in order to improve the Quality of Experience and to reduce the waste of bandwidth in satellite multimedia streaming.

A quantitative analysis of diversity gain demonstrates the benefits of high resolution inherent to wideband space-time radar systems, and a tentative classification of space-time codings is proposed.

40|$|Abstract—The {{realization}} of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) has been fostered by {{the availability of}} low cost and low power CMOS devices. However, the transmission of bulk video data requires adequate bandwidth, which cannot be promised by single path communication on an intrinsically low resourced sensor network. Moreover, the distortion or artifacts in the video data and the adherence to delay threshold adds to the challenge. In this paper, we propose a two stage Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteeing scheme called Prioritized Multipath WMSN (PMW) for transmitting H. 264 encoded video. Multipath selection based on QoS metrics {{is done in the}} first stage, while the second stage further prioritizes the paths for sending H. 264 encoded video frames on the best available path. PMW uses two composite metrics that are comprised of hop-count, path energy, BER, and end-to-end delay.

The objective of the plan is to develop a local culture of Smarter Travel in Limerick communities using best international practice, and thereby achieving behavioural change in travel mode choice. This research looks at hard physical infrastructure and soft community based interventions, to promote lasting travel behaviour change in five pilot zones in Limerick. The literature on Smarter Travel is reviewed. Results from a comprehensive study of six international exemplar Smarter Travel Cities is reported. Current travel modes, using census data, and traveller’s mode choice criteria, using focus groups, in Limerick City are investigated and reported. However, census data only provides information on trips to work, school, and college. Focus groups were employed to investigate beliefs, attitudes, and decision criteria relating to existing travel choices in Limerick and to <b>Smarter</b> Travel <b>modes.</b> The analysis provides a rationale to allow proposals for an appropriate community engagement strategy to be formulated. Quantitative census data demonstrates significant local variation in travel behaviour in the five pilot zones. This same data allows spatial subdivision and grouping according to local travel behaviour. Qualitative focus group data show the factors motivating mode choice also vary significantly. From a travel standpoint target groups should be characterised by socio-economic, age or other status. Therefore, influencing peoples travel behaviour and encouraging change requires not just the implementation of best practice measures, but must be preceded by a nuanced spatial and behavioural research program, incorporating community engagement.

This paper focuses {{on some of those}} areas related to {{home automation}}. The paper draws attention to wireless communications issues on embedded systems.

40|$|Until recently, the {{simultaneous}} detection {{and evaluation of}} multiple Space Transportation System (STS) element compartments for propellant leakage was not possible during the External Tank (ET) pre-pressurization (pre-press) phase of propellant loading; late in the loading sequence (T- 3 min to T- 0). There exist launch commit criteria (LCCS) designed to protect against leaks resulting in flammable mixtures in the intertank during the functional life of the ET; start of propellant loading through ET-Orbiter separation. However thus far, leak protection had relied {{on the premise that}} if a propellant supply system leak were to exist, it would be a leak of fixed area present at the start of propellant loading (dumb leak mode) and such a leak could be detected earlier in the loading sequence than the pre-press phase. No measures had ever been implemented which would protect against leaks potentially developing late in the loading sequence (<b>smart</b> leak <b>mode),</b> The STS community had baselined this situation as an accepted risk their decision supported by exhaustive hardware acceptance criteria and a history of many successful launches. With the recent development of improvements to the hazardous gas detection system (HGDS), an opportunity arose to monitor the intertank compartment for hazardous gas concentrations beyond the T- 3 minute mark. In this timeframe the propellant supply system is pressurized for flight and protection was sought against potential leaks generated by this pressurization process. The challenge at hand was to develop LCCs in this timeframe that were not too conservative to unnecessarily prohibit a launch, yet not too liberal to endanger crew safety and mission success. Since essentially no measurement history existed in this timeframe, the LCCs would have to rely on analysis alone. At NASA's direction, Lockheed Martin Michoud Space Systems (LMMSS) developed requirements that would protect against a smart leak during pre-press. A smart leak protection strategy is noteworthy from an STS main propulsion system (NWS) community perspective. This paper presents the resultant requirements as well as the technical and program issues involved with establishing hazardous gas LCCs for the ET intertank compartment...|$|R
