According to a USGS survey map, the surrounding mountain ranges contain rocks that date back to the Mississippian and Cambrian periods while the surficial deposits on the valley floor are made up mainly of alluvium dating to the Quaternary period. They are also classified as booming sand dunes, one of only about forty worldwide.|$|E
50|$|A {{valley in}} its {{broadest}} geographic sense {{is also known}} as a dale. A valley through which a river runs may also be referred to as a vale. A small, secluded, and often wooded valley is known as a dell or in Scotland as a glen. A wide, flat valley through which a river runs is known in Scotland as a strath. A mountain cove is a small valley, closed at one or both ends, in the central or southern Appalachian Mountains which sometimes results from the erosion of a geologic window. A small valley surrounded by mountains or ridges is sometimes known as a hollow. A deep, narrow valley is known as a cwm (also spelled combe or coombe). Similar geological structures, such as canyons, ravines, gorges, gullies, chines and kloofs, are not usually referred to as valleys. A valley formed by erosion is called an erosional valley; a valley formed by geologic events such as drop faults or the rise of highlands is called a <b>structural</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|E
50|$|Santa Clara Valley {{was created}} by the sudden growth of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Diablo Range during the later Cenozoic era. This was a period of intense {{mountain}} building in California when the folding and thrusting of the Earth's crust, combined with active volcanism, gave shape to the present state of California. Hence, Santa Clara Valley is a <b>structural</b> <b>valley,</b> created by mountain building as opposed to an erosional valley, or a valley which has undergone the wearing away of the Earth's surface by natural agents. The underlying geology of the Santa Cruz Mountains was also formed by the sediment of the ancient seas, where marine shale points to Miocene origin. Today one can still find evidence of this in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where shark's teeth and the remains of maritime life are still found as high as Scotts Valley, a city nestled in the mountains. The highest peak on the Santa Cruz Mountains side of the valley is Loma Prieta at 3,790 feet. The highest peak in the Diablo Range side of the valley is Mount Hamilton, specifically Copernicus Peak at 4,370 feet elevation. This is the highest peak in Santa Clara County.|$|E

5000|$|Simi Valley {{is a city}} {{located in}} the very {{southeast}} corner of Ventura County, bordering the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County, and {{is a part of}} the Greater Los Angeles Area. The City of Simi Valley basically consists of the eponymous valley itself. City of Simi Valley borders the Santa Susana Mountains to the north, the Simi Hills to the east and south, and is adjacent to Thousand Oaks to the southwest and Moorpark to the west. Simi Valley is connected to the nearby San Fernando Valley by the Santa Susana Pass in the extreme east of Simi Valley. Simi Valley is located at 34°16'16" [...] North, 118°44'22" [...] West (34.271078, −118.739428) with an elevation of 700-1,000 ft (210-300 m) above sea level. The syncline Simi Valley is located in the western part of the region called the Transverse Ranges. The valley is surrounded by the Santa Susana Mountains to the north and Simi Hills to the east and south. While the Santa Susana Mountains separate the valley from the Los Padres National Forest in the north, the Simi Hills separate it from Conejo Valley in the south. In the extreme east is Rocky Peak, one of Santa Susana Mountains' highest peaks, which is a dividing line between Ventura County to the west and Los Angeles County to the east. On the other side of the valley, in the extreme west side of Simi Valley is Mount McCoy, which may be most known for its 12 ft. concrete cross that sits at its peak. The physiographical valley is a structural as well as a topographic depression. The Simi Valley, just as neighboring San Fernando Valley, owes its existence and shape to the faulting and folding of the rocks. It is essentially a <b>structural</b> <b>valley</b> and not wholly the work of erosion. It is drained by the Calleguas Creek and also its principal tributary, Conejo Creek. Both of these originate in the Santa Susana Mountains.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Panorama Point Beds {{represent}} a subfacies of the Early to Middle Permian Radok Conglomerate, {{which is the}} oldest known sedimentary unit in the Prince Charles Mountains, MacRobertson Land, East Antarctica. This unit records clastic sedimentation in fresh−water depositional system {{during the early stages}} of development of the Lambert Graben, a major <b>structural</b> <b>valley</b> surrounded by crystalline highlands {{in the southern part of}} Gondwana. It contains common siderite precipitated through early diagenetic processes in the swamp, stagnant water, and stream−flow environments. There are two types of siderite in the Panorama Point Beds: (1) disseminated cement that occurs throughout the sedimentary suc− cession; and (2) concretions that occur at recurrent horizons in fine−grained sediments. The cement is composed of Fe−depleted siderite (less than 90 mol % FeCO 3) with an elevated con− tent of magnesium, and trace and rare earth elements. It has negative 13 CVPDB values (− 4. 5 to − 1. 5 ‰). The concretions are dominated by Fe−rich siderite (more than 90 mol % FeCO 3), with positive 13 CVPDB values (+ 1 to + 8 ‰). There are no noticeable differences in the oxygen (18 OVPDB between − 20 and − 15 ‰) and strontium (87 Sr/ 86 Sr between 0. 7271 and 0. 7281) iso− topic compositions between the siderite types. The cement and concretions developed in the nearsurface to subsurface environment dominated by suboxic and anoxic methanic degrada− tion of organic matter, respectively. The common presence of siderite in the Panorama Point Beds suggests that fresh−water environments of the Lambert Graben were covered by vegeta− tion, starting from the early history of its development in the Early Permian...|$|E

All topographic based valley network parameters indicate an origin by groundwater sapping processes and headward erosion for Nirgal Vallis and confirms former geomorphologic analyses.

Geometric modeling using flexural slip unfolding did balance the cross-section with minor imperfections. Kinematic forward modeling using trishear reproduced a similar overall geometry to the cross-section.

40|$|Beta Regio is {{characterized}} by the existence of rift structures. We compiled new geologic maps of Beta Regio according to Magellan data. There are many large uplifted tesserae on beta upland. These tesserae are partly buried by younger volcanic cover. We can conclude, using these observations, that Beta upland formed mainly due to lithospheric tectonic uplifting and was only partly constructed by volcanism. Theia Mons is the center of the Beta rift system. Many rift belts are distributed radially to Theia Mons. Typical widths of rifts are 40 - 160 km. Rift valleys are structurally represented by crustal grabens or half-grabens. There are symmetrical and asymmetrical rifts. Many rifts have shoulder uplifts up to 0. 5 - 1 km high and 40 - 60 km wide. Preliminary analysis for rift <b>valley</b> <b>structural</b> cross sections lead to the conclusion that rifts originated due to 5 - 10 percent crustal extension. Many rifts traverse Beta upland and spread to the surrounding lowlands. We can assume because of these data that Beta rift system has an active-passive origin.

This <b>structural</b> and topographic <b>valley</b> is bounded by two north- trending, down-to-the-west normal faults: the Paintbrush Canyon fault on the east and the Bow Ridge fault on the west.

A detailed (1 : 6000) surficial geological map has been prepared based on interpretation of new and existing aerial photographs, field mapping, soil pits, and trenches. No evidence was found that would indicate displacement of these surficial deposits along previously unrecognized faults. However, given the low rates of Quaternary faulting and the extensive areas that are covered by late Pleistocene to Holocene deposits south of Sever Wash, Quaternary faulting between known faults cannot be precluded based on surface evidence alone. Middle to late Pleistocene alluvial fan deposits (Unit Q 3) exist at or near the surface throughout Midway Valley. Confidence is increased that the potential for surface fault rupture in Midway Valley can be assessed by excavations that expose the deposits and soils associated with Unit Q 3 or older units (middle Pleistocene or earlier) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Structural {{relief is}} {{exceptionally}} recognisable {{in areas where}} igneous and metamorphic rocks without a Quaternary cover occur, which {{is the case with}} the Kola Peninsula. However, the subject of structural relief has been addressed relatively rarely. Therefore, an attempt was made to estimate the influence of tectonic and lithologic factors on the relief within two test areas, each covering approximately 100 km 2, located on the coast of the Bar-ents Sea (Murmansk Terrane) and the White Sea (Lapland Granulite Belt). The structural relief here is varied, which results from differences in the geo-logical structure. In the former area, depressions and tectonic blocks of varying size and order predominate, while east of Kandalaksha these are flattened hills with asymmetrically inclined slopes (having the character of cuestas). Although lithologically diverse, the test areas share a common feature: the presence of numerous faults and dislocation zones {{that in the case of}} the Barents Sea caused the division of igneous rocks into several blocks of various orders. Most of the relief forms in this area were found to have <b>structural</b> origins, namely <b>valley</b> depressions of various orders, slopes and escarpments, lake basins and seaside cliffs. The structural relief of the Murmansk Terrane is determined by disjunctive structures.

The area studied lies on the northeast flank of the northwest-trending Babyhead anticline, which forms the major <b>structural</b> control. The <b>Valley</b> Spring gneiss was mapped as four phases: felsic gneiss, mafic gneiss, feldspar-quartz-amphibole-pyroxene gneiss, and biotiteamphibole schist. Two meta-diabase dikes were also mapped. The composition of the Valley Spring gneiss, the constancy of its parallel bands, and its conformity and gradation into the metasedimentary Packsaddle schist indicate a parent rock composed primarily of impure sand stone. Preservation of original structures indicates a lack of mobilized constituents during metamorphism. The Valley Spring gneiss belongs to the quartzo-feldspathic mineral assemblage in the staurolite-quartz subfacies of the almandine-amphibolite facies. After metamorphism the area studied was folded and then intruded by granitic material. From middle Precambrian time to the present, the area studied has under gone only cycles of erosion, deposition, and mild uplift except for faulting {{at the end of the}} Paleozoic. The gravity survey indicates a synclinal body of schist trending northwest under the sediments and lying over the Valley Spring gneiss on the northeast flank of the Babyhead anticline. The magnetic survey indicates that the Packsaddle schist does not extend under the sediments to the east, and that mineralization occurred along the llanite dike...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{magnitude}} of mass movements, {{which may be}} expressed by their dimension in terms of area or volume, {{is an important component}} of intensity together with velocity. In the case of slow-moving deep-seated landslides, the expected magnitude is the prevalent parameter for defining intensity when assessed as a spatially distributed variable in a given area. In particular, the frequency–volume statistics of past landslides may be used to understand and predict the {{magnitude of}} new landslides and reactivations. In this paper we study the spatial properties of volume frequency distributions in the Arno river basin (Central Italy, about 9100 km 2). The overall landslide inventory taken into account (around 27, 500 events) shows a power-law scaling of volumes for values greater than a cutoff value of about 2 × 104 m 3. We explore the variability of the power-law exponent in the geographic space by setting up local subsets of the inventory based on neighbourhoods with radii between 5 and 50 km. We found that the power-law exponent α varies according to geographic position and that the exponent itself can be treated as a random space variable with autocorrelation properties both at local and regional scale. We use this finding to devise a simple method to map the magnitude frequency distribution in space and to create maps of exceeding probability of landslide volume for risk analysis. We also study the causes of spatial variation of α by analysing the dependence of power-law properties on geological and geomorphological factors, and we find that <b>structural</b> settings and <b>valley</b> density exert a strong influence on mass movement dimensions...|$|R
40|$|Integration of well-calibrated seismic {{data from}} the Firth of Forth with field and {{subsurface}} data from neighbouring onshore areas provides important {{new insights into the}} structural evolution and petroleum habitat in the Midland Valley of Scotland. The results demonstrate that the NNE–SSW striking Midlothian–Leven Syncline, and its flanking Burntisland and D’Arcy-Cousland anticlines, developed as major growth folds during the Late Palaeozoic under a predominantly dextral strike-slip regime. These syn-sedimentary folds controlled depositional thicknesses, facies and dispersal patterns in Early to Late Carboniferous (Viséan-Westphalian) times. Structural geometries suggest that the folds experienced tightening during Late Carboniferous (Variscan) deformation events before being transected by E-W striking dykes and extensional faulting during the Late Carboniferous (Westphalian D) and Early Permian. Although direct evidence for the basin's post-Permian burial history is no longer present, it can be inferred that the area had at least 1 km of cover prior to Paleogene uplift. The new understanding of the eastern Midland <b>Valley's</b> <b>structural</b> and subsidence history provides the means by which the occurrence of petroleum in the basin can be explained. Burial of Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian) oil-shale source rocks beneath the Midlothian–Leven Syncline now appears to have been the primary driver in the maturation and up-dip migration of waxy crude oil into age-equivalent clastic reservoirs located in the adjacent anticlines, rather than oil generation by direct contact between the source rocks and igneous intrusions. Initial oil charging is thought to have taken place during the Late Carboniferous, was renewed during Mesozoic reburial and appears to continue locally today despite the detrimental effect of significant Early Cenozoic uplift. It is now evident that the basin's limited exploration success has been almost entirely governed by the presence of unbreached palaeostructures lying directly up-dip from an oil kitchen, developed in the core of the Midlothian–Leven Syncline during Late Carboniferous and Mesozoic-Recent burial. ...|$|R

It was part of our contributions into C 1 -formate geologic mapping efforts. The original map is at 1 : 8, 000, 000 scale. The rift structures are typical for Beta Regio on Venus. There are many large uplifted tessera areas on Beta upland. They occupy areas of higher topography. These tessera are partly burried by younger volcanic cover of plain material. These observations show that Beta upland was formed mainly due to lithospheric tectonical uplifting, and only partly was constructed by volcanic activity. A number of rift valleis traverse Beta upland and spread to the surrounding lowlands. The largest rift crosses Beta N to S. Typical width of rifts is 40 to 160 km. Rift valleis in this region are structurally represented by crustal grabens and half-grabens. There are symmetrical and asymmetrical rifts. A {{lot of them have}} shoulder uplifts with the relative high up to 0. 5 - 1 km and width 40 to 60 km. Preliminary analysis of the largest rift <b>valley</b> <b>structural</b> cross-sections leads to the conclusion that it originated due to a 5 - 10 percent crustal extension. The prominent shield volcano - Theia Mons - is located at the center of Beta rift system. It could be considered as the surface manifestation of the upper mantle hot spot. Most of the rift belts are located radially to Theia Mons. The set of these data leads to conclusion that Beta rift system has an 'active-passive' origin.

The area is moderately wet with an annual precipitation of about 37 inches. Residual and transported sediments from different sources, dominantly volcanic, comprise the subsurface lithology. The sedimentary units that were deposited by means of rivers and lakes have filled an original <b>structural</b> and erosional <b>valley</b> in the area. This relatively unconsolidated valley filling is about 900 feet of predominantly lenticular, stratified and cross-bedded lenses of clay, silt, sand, gravel, cobbles and boulders. The topsoil throughout the area has generally similar mechanical characteristics with good drainage. Due to the physical characteristics of the rocks, soils and topography, the area has an open hydraulic system that contains {{a substantial amount of}} usable subsurface water. The wells sampled are relatively shallow and their aquifers receive their main recharge from percolated rainfall water. Most of these aquifers occur within the Troutdale Formation rock unit. The major sources of the dissolved elements in the water are the rock units and the organic material of present or buried soils. These sources, along with mixing of water through subsurface migration, created similar compositions in all the tested aquifers, except nitrates and probably phosphates which show a general minor change from east to west, generally correlative with population density. These major mechanisms, man-made activities and/or analytical errors produced only minor differences in the analyses. No major change was detected which could be related to the minor lithologic differences or of the small changes in soils. Comparison with a few older analyses did not indicate a change with time.

40|$|The primary aim of {{the present}} study was to develop a late Quaternary history of theKangarooRiver: {{something}} which had not been done before. The study examined how the river had responded to climatic fluctuations, why it had responded in a particular way and when these changes had occurred. Five sites were selected at key points along the length of the river. A Global Positioning System (GPS) was used to record precise locations. Surveys were conducted at all sites using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) wherever possible. At alluvial sites, sediment was collected by augering or taking core samples. Collected material was later analysed for grain size using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 and for mineralogy using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Cobble size was measured using the Wolman series. Samples from two sites were also subjected to Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to date past geomorphic events and a charcoal fragment from one of these sites was radio radiocarbon dated. Sedimentary results indicated that each site responded differently to fluctuating energy levels and that the response pattern was dictated by changing <b>structural</b> controls. The <b>valley</b> floor widens and narrows as it flows through harder and softer units, altering the dominant mode of flood plain accretion. Mineralogy of the terrace alluvium reflected the composition of the geological units through which the river has flowed. Five OSL dates were obtained from two alluvial sites and their ages were late Holocene ranging between ~ 3. 5 – 1. 6 ka. The one radiocarbon date was mid Holocene at ~ 5. 9 ka and was thought to have been incorporated in the terrace following fluviatile remobilisation. The absence of Pleistocene sediments like those in adjacent coastal valleys suggests that the combination of a very small catchment size, low channel to floodplain width and high intensity rain events has limited the Kangaroo River’s sedimentary history. Because of the small range of these dates, it was difficult to conclude whether they represented the first deposition immediately following the Holocene Climatic Optimum or whether they were the product of local climatic events...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation {{of surface}} {{faulting}} that may pose a hazard to prospective surface facilities {{is an important}} element of the tectonic studies for the potential Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository in southwestern Nevada. For this purpose, a program of detailed geologic mapping and trenching was done to obtain surface and near-surface geologic data that are essential for determining the location and recency of faults at a prospective surface-facilities site located east of Exile Hill in Midway Valley, near the eastern base of Yucca Mountain. The dominant tectonic features in the Midway Valley area are the north- to northeast-trending, west-dipping normal faults that bound the Midway <b>Valley</b> <b>structural</b> block-the Bow Ridge fault {{on the west side of}} Exile Hill and the Paint-brush Canyon fault on the east side of the valley. Trenching of Quaternary sediments has exposed evidence of displacements, which demonstrate that these block-bounding faults repeatedly ruptured the surface during the middle to late Quaternary. Geologic mapping, subsurface borehole and geophysical data, and the results of trenching activities indicate the presence of north- to northeast-trending faults and northwest-trending faults in Tertiary volcanic rocks beneath alluvial and colluvial sediments near the prospective surface-facilities site. North to northeast-trending faults include the Exile Hill fault along the eastern base of Exile Hill and faults to the east beneath the surficial deposits of Midway Valley. These faults have no geomorphic expression, but two north- to northeast-trending zones of fractures exposed in excavated profiles of middle to late Pleistocene deposits at the prospective surface-facilities site appear to be associated with these faults. Northwest-trending faults include the West Portal and East Portal faults, but no disruption of Quaternary deposits by these faults is evident. The western zone of fractures is associated with the Exile Hill fault. The eastern zone of fractures is within Quaternary alluvial sediments, but no bedrock was encountered in trenches and soil pits in this part of the prospective surface facilities site; thus, the direct association of this zone with one or more bedrock faults is uncertain. No displacement of lithologic contacts and soil horizons could be detected in the fractured Quaternary deposits. The results of these investigations imply the absence of any appreciable late Quaternary faulting activity at the prospective surface-facilities site...|$|R

Connecting the various remote observations to sample data enables a set of new conclusions to be drawn regarding the geological evolution of the <b>valley.</b> <b>Structural</b> considerations and published and recalculated Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 analyses of samples from the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills indicate that the Crisium basin formed about 3. 93 Ga; the Serenitatis basin about 3. 82 Ga; and the Imbrium basin no earlier than 3. 82 Ga and no later than the average of 3. 72 Ga for 33 age dates from samples of the valley's mare basalts. Strong evidence continues to support the conclusion of others (Lucchitta, 1972; Spudis et al., 2011; Fassett et al., 2012) that the Sculptured Hills physiographic unit consists of Imbrium ejecta. Interpretation of M(sup 3) spectral data and Apollo 17 samples indicate that rock units of the Sculptured Hills consist of a largely coherent, Mg-suite pluton. LROC NAC stereo images and Mini-RF data indicate the presence of several exposed pyroclastic fissures across the Sculptured Hills. Rim boulders at Camelot Crater constitute nearly in situ wall rocks of that crater rather than ejecta and provide an opportunity for investigations of remanent magnetic field orientation {{at the time of the}} eruption of late mare basalt lavas in the valley. Paleomagnetic field orientation information also may be obtained relative to melt-breccia contacts in North Massif boulders that suggest original horizontal orientations. LROC images indicate the existence of two temporally separate light mantle avalanche deposits. The origin, potential flow mechanisms, and geology of the youngest avalanche from the South Massif have been clarified. The existence of two distinct light mantle avalanches raises doubt about the association of either light mantle avalanche with secondary impacts related to the Tycho impact event. Alternatively, the Lee-Lincoln thrust fault appears to have triggered the second light mantle avalanche between 70 and 110 Ma. A simple structural analysis shows that this thrust fault dips 20 - 25 degrees to the southwest where it crosses the North Massif and to the west where it crosses the valley floor. Mini-RF data reveal a line of reduced reflections roughly perpendicular to contours on the North Massif about 3 km to the east of the Lee-Lincoln fault. Although this line is possibly an older ancillary fault, LROC NAC stereo images indicate that it may be best explained as a pyroclastic fissure. A debris flow of dark, apparent pyroclastic ash lies below the southeast end of the potential fissure. Finally, young lunar impact glass sample 70019 has been precisely located within LROC NAC images and oriented for the first time using 60 mm (f. l.) sample documentation photographs. Sample 70019 can now be employed in lunar paleomagnetic field orientation studies...|$|R
40|$|The Map Sheet 1 : 50. 000 595 ”Palermo” {{includes}} {{marine and}} land {{areas of the}} topographic map sheet “Palermo”. The map sheet “Palermo” (Palermo Province) covers {{a part of the}} Sicily Fold and Thrust Belt (FTB) which has developed along the plate boundary between Africa and Europe in the Central Mediterranean. The Sicily FTB links the African Maghrebide to the Calabrian arc and Southern Apennines. The FTB and its submerged western and northern extensions are part- ly located between the Sardinia block and the Pelagian-Ionian sector, and partly beneath the central southern Tyrrhenian Sea. In this sector of the Mediterranean area, the main compressional move- ments, after the Paleogene Alpine orogeny, began with the latest Oligocene-Early Miocene counterclockwise rotation of Corsica-Sardinia, believed to represent a volcanic arc, and its collision with the African continental margin. Thrusting oc- curred in connection with the westward subduction of the Adriatic and Ionian lithosphere beneath the Corsica-Sardinia block. Today, a westward subduction is indicated by a North-dipping Benioff zone, as deep as 400 km, west of Calabria and the Apennines, and the related calc- alkaline volcanism in the Eolian Islands. Subduction and thrusting are contempo- raneous with a back arc-type extension in the Tyrrhenian Sea. 186 LAND AREAS geomorphoLogy Three different sectors can be distinguished in Sheet 595 : 1) the Palermo and Bagheria coastal plains, characterized by several poly- cyclic marine terraces organized in different orders; 2) the isolated carbonate reliefs of Monte Pellegrino and Monte Catalfano; 3) the internal Belmonte Mezzagno highlands and the Oreto and Eleuterio river valleys. The geomorphological evolution of the area has been controlled by strong down-cutting and dismantling processes that have produced both the erosion of thick volumes of mainly Tertiary terrigenous deposits and the exhumation of mainly Mesozoic carbonate rocks. Due to tectonic uplifting, these proces- ses are intensely developed on ”soft rocks “(Numidian Flysch clayey deposits), producing large river valleys with slopes affected by water erosion and surficial landslides (valleys of Fiume Oreto, Fiume Eleuterio and Fiume Milicia); they have, however, considerably slowed down along the blocks of more resistant rock (Mesozoic-Tertiary carbonate units), forming the wide Palermo Mountains. At the present-day, relict (planation surfaces and abandoned <b>valleys),</b> <b>structural</b> (fault/fault-line scarps) and karst (sinkholes and polje) forms occur in the highlan- ds. The geomorphological setting of the coastal areas has been influenced more by significant Quaternary extensional tectonics that originated the drowning of the northern sectors of the Sicilian chain in the Tyrrhenian Sea above which the marine deposition was deposited (Marsala synthem). The uplifting, involving also the lowered blocks, has resulted in the progressive retreat of the sea that gave origin to a succession of marine terraces, Ionian-Latest Pleistocene in age, and fi- nally the emersion of the present-day coastal depressions (Palermo and Bagheria plains). During the Upper Pleistocene to Holocene, the uplifting rates reached values generally lower than 0. 1 m/ky. stratIgraphy The carbonate and terrigenous rock facies analysis and stratigraphy led to the recognition of large Paleozoic to Miocene sedimentary bodies pertaining to diffe- rent and separate crustal paleogeographic domains; the former, developed along the African passive continental margin and the adjacent Tethyan ocean. The “Tethyan” successions correspond to the deep clayey carbonate and vol- canoclastic rocks known to have been deposited in the Sicilide Domain. The pas- sive margin rock bodies are shallow water carbonates, deep water carbonates and 187 siliceous carbonates that were deposited in domains, locally known as Panormide, Trapanese and, Imerese. Terrigenous, evaporitic and clastic-carbonate rocks, Miocene to Pleistocene in age, formed during the foredeep evolution of the Sicilian FTB. A detailed stratigraphy of the rock-successions is summarized in the paragraph “Legend of the Palermo Sheet”. Quaternary continental deposits have been mapped as unconformity-bounded stratigraphic units limited by lower and upper unconformities, locally marked by palaeosoils, due to erosion/depositional processes, marine/sub-aerial processes or non-depositional events. Locally, the upper boundaries are the present-day topo- graphic surface. The detection of some unconformities of regional extent allowed us to define several synthems. The Marsala synthem is a Lower Pleistocene body of marine/coastal deposits, with abundant fossils; its lower boundary is a mari- ne erosion surface cutting pre-Quaternary rocks. The Buonfornello-Campofelice synthem is composed of middle Pleistocene marine deposits covering abrasion surfaces above the coastal stepped blocks. The Polisano synthem is made up of aeolian sandstones and sands with intercalations of breccias talus, late Middle Pleistocene in age (OIS 6); its lower boundary is a non-depositional surface at the top of older rocks. Eleuterio and Milicia synthems are made up of Middle-Upper Pleistocene, mainly fluvial, deposits deposited on river terrace surfaces; their lo- wer boundary is a stream erosion surface. The Benincasa synthem includes colluvial Middle-Upper Pleistocene deposits of Qz-sandstones interbedded with stone-line, palaeosoils, Fe-rich layers and no- dular concretions. Its lower boundary is an unconformity above the Buonfornello- Campofelice synthem, the upper one is the base of the Capo Plaia synthem of the present soil. The Barcarello synthem encompasses marine/coastal conglomerates and are- nites, with a rich warm-temperate “Senegal fauna” including Strombus bubonius; it is located on two orders of marine terraces (OISs 5 e and 5 c or 5 a) and laterally passes into welded colluvial deposits whose age is correlated with the OIS 5. The lower boundary of the synthem is a marine abrasion surface, laterally extending to a continental erosion surface; the latter is cutting the Polisano synthem or older rocks. The Raffo Rosso synthem consists of aeolian sandstones and sands, collu- vial or gravitational deposits and thick stratified slope deposits of the last glacial climatic event (OISs 4 - 2); the lower boundary is a non-depositional surface {{at the top of the}} Barcarello synthem or older rocks. The Capo Plaia synthem is made up of coastal to continental deposits of the last glacial climatic event of the end - Holocene age (OISs 2 - 1); its lower boundary is formed by variously origina- ted erosion or non-depositional surfaces; the upper boundary is the topographic surface. 188 struCturaL graIn The Paleozoic to Cenozoic, mainly carbonate sedimentary bodies, developed in different sectors of the African passive continental margin and the adjacent Tethyan ocean and were progressively accreted in a pile of tectonic units and are now exposed to form the Sicilian fold and thrust belt. To define the extension and setting of these bodies versus their internal facies pattern, we individuate them as Structural-Stratigraphic Units (U. S. S.), described as large geological bodies per- taining to original paleogeographic domains from where they were removed and later deformed. These bodies are bounded by clearly mappable tectonic features (faults, thrust, etc.) and each of them is characterized by homogeneous lithologies and similar structural behaviours and settings. The outcropping tectonic edifice, in the “Palermo” Sheet, is composed of se- veral U. S. S., which can be locally subdivided into tectonic units of minor order. These subunits have been mapped on the basis of their tectonic relationships. Some U. S. S. have been identified, starting from the geometrically highest and most internal in the FTB. 1) U. S. S. deriving from the deformation of the Sicilide domain succession: - U. S. S. Tusa-Troina outcropping in the south-eastern sector, overlying the Numidian Flysch deposits. 2) U. S. S. deriving from the deformation of the Imerese domain succession and its overlying numidian flysch basin. The units widely outcrop in the cen- tral and southern sector of the geological sheet where Mesozoic deep water carbonates and their oligo-miocene numidian flysch covers are deformed, with the latter often slightly detached from the carbonate substrate. Among them we distinguished: - U. S. S. Sagana - Belmonte Mezzagno, in the western sector, where we indi- viduated the sub-unit Pizzuta-S. Cristina; - U. S. S. Monte Cane-San Calogero, in the eastern sector, subdivided into a) the subunit Monte Cane-S. Onofrio, overlying b) the subunit Bizolelli; 3) U. S. S. deriving from the deformation of the Panormide Domain. The U. S. S. consists of Meso-Cenozoic shelf to pelagic carbonates and the often detached nu- midian flysch cover, pertaining to the U. S. S. M. Gallo-M. Palmeto, forming the margin of the Panormide Platform. It outcrops only at Monte Pellegrino (subunit Pellegrino). 4) U. S. S. deriving from the deformation of the Trapanese domain. It is recognizable only in the seismic profile crossing the eastern sector where it is overlain by the U. S. S. Sagana - Belmonte Mezzagno. Southwards, it oucrops at Monte Balatelle (U. S. S. Kumeta-Balatelle). 189 Structural evolution The tectonic edifice outcropping and buried beneath the area of the Palermo Sheet is the result of several deformational events that have taken place since the Triassic, deforming complexly the sedimentary successions deposited during the Mesozoic-Pleistocene. After the detachment from their crystalline basement the original sedimentary bodies were progressively accreted in a pile of tectonic units now exposed in the Sicilian chain. Two main events have occurred during the Miocene and Pleistocene time interval. They are respectively characterized by compression and transpression. Contraction originally involved the Tethyan|$|R
