5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} the <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> {{known as}} the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The {{evisceration}} {{of the body and}} the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is the evidence that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.|$|E
500|$|Nerves may be {{compressed}} {{because of}} increased intracranial pressure, a mass effect of an intracerebral haemorrhage, or tumour that presses against the nerves and interferes with the transmission of impulses along the nerve. [...] A loss of functionality of a single cranial nerve may sometimes be the first symptom of an intracranial or <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> cancer.|$|E
500|$|More modern methods involve {{computed}} tomography (CT angiography) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MR angiography). They use smaller amounts of contrast and are not invasive. CT angiography and MR angiography {{are more or less}} equivalent when used to diagnose or exclude vertebral artery dissection. CTA has the advantage of showing certain abnormalities earlier, tends to be available outside office hours, and can be performed rapidly. When MR angiography is used, the best results are achieved in the T1 setting using a protocol known as [...] "fat suppression". Doppler ultrasound is less useful as it provides little information about the part of the artery close to the <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> and in the vertebral foramina, and any abnormality detected on ultrasound would still require confirmation with CT or MRI.|$|E

500|$|The holotype {{specimen}} MOR 485 {{was collected}} by Hostetter and Ray Rogers from the Landslide Butte Field Area about [...] northwest of Cut Bank. In 1995 Sampson {{described it as}} the partial skull of an adult animal including the nasal and supraorbital (region above the eye socket) bosses (roundish protuberances instead of horns), and the parietal bones. Additionally, MOR 485 preserves some bones of the skull rear and sides, which in 2009 were listed by Tracy L. Ford as a right squamosal bone, the left squamosal, both maxillae, both lacrimal bones, both quadrate bones, both palatine bones, the braincase and the basioccipital bone. In 2015, Leonardo Maiorino reported {{that as part of}} the same specimen a fragmentary lower jaw has been catalogued as MOR 485-7-12-87-4. A right squamosal bone from another adult individual was recovered from the same Canyon Bone Bed site as MOR 485 (and catalogued under the same number), but only reported in 2010. Two other specimens were collected on the Black Tail Creek, [...] to the south of Cut Bank and referred to Achelousaurus by Sampson in 1995. Specimen MOR 591 is a partial skull and an about 60% complete skeleton of a sub-adult specimen that includes the vertebral column, pelvis, sacrum and a femur. It also includes lower jaws, catalogued as MOR 591-7-15-89-1. Both skull and lower jaws are nearly complete, only lacking the braincase and occipital region. MOR 591 is smaller than the holotype with a <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> length of about [...] Specimen MOR 571 includes a partial skull and lower jaws with associated ribs and vertebrae of an adult. The skull only consists of the parietals, and the lower jaws are limited to their upper rear bones, the surangulars and articulars. A fifth specimen is MOR 456.1, a subadult. None of the specimens were of an advanced individual age. According to Andrew McDonald and colleagues, the Achelousaurus finds represented single individuals, not bone beds.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} otitis externa, MOE requires oral or intravenous antibiotics for cure. Pseudomonas is {{the most}} common offending pathogen. [...] Diabetes control is also an essential part of treatment. [...] When MOE goes unrecognized and untreated, the infection continues to smolder and over weeks or months can spread deeper into the head and involve the bones of the <b>skull</b> <b>base,</b> constituting <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> osteomyelitis (SBO). Multiple cranial nerve palsies can result, including the facial nerve (causing facial palsy), the recurrent laryngeal nerve (causing vocal cord paralysis) , and the cochlear nerve (causing deafness). The infecting organism is almost always pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it can instead be fungal (aspergillus or mucor). MOE and SBO are not amenable to surgery, but exploratory surgery may facilitate the culture of unusual organism(s) that are not responding to empirically used anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (ciprofloxacin being the drug of choice). [...] The usual surgical finding is diffuse cellulitis without localized abscess formation. [...] SBO can extend into the petrous apex of the temporal bone or more inferiorly into {{the opposite side of the}} <b>skull</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As the <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> is {{progressively}} involved, {{the adjacent}} exiting cranial nerves and their branches, especially {{the facial nerve}} and the vagus nerve, may be affected, resulting in facial paralysis and hoarseness, respectively. If both of the recurrent laryngeal nerves are paralyzed, shortness of breath may develop and necessitate tracheotomy. Profound deafness can occur, usually later in the disease course due to relative resistance of the inner ear structures. [...] Gallium scans are sometimes used to document {{the extent of the}} infection but are not essential to disease management. <b>Skull</b> <b>base</b> osteomyelitis is a chronic disease that can require months of IV antibiotic treatment, tends to recur, and has a significant mortality rate.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Skull</b> <b>based</b> neurosurgical cases {{often require}} {{some degree of}} head {{rotation}} during patient positioning to facilitate operative exposure. Extreme head rotation may lead to occlusion of submandibular gland secretions and impaired venous return from the neck, rarely leading to submandibular gland inflammation. Methods: An uncomplicated translabyrinthine resection of a vestibular schwannoma was undertaken. Results: Severe submandibular gland inflammation and impaired venous return opposite the site of translabyrinthine vestibular schwannoma resection occurred in the post-operative period. This led to upper brachial plexopathy and Horner syndrome. Conclusions: We present the first known cases of submandibular gland inflammation and hemorrhage resulting in brachial plexopathy and Horner syndrome opposite the site of tumor resection. This case {{underscores the importance of}} adequate and safe patient positioning in <b>skull</b> <b>based</b> neurosurgical procedures...|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{written record}} of what was probably a meningioma is from the 1600s, when Felix Plater (1536–1614) of the University of Basel performed an autopsy on Sir Caspar Bonecurtius. Surgery for removal of meningiomas was first attempted in the sixteenth century, but the first known successful surgery for removal of a meningioma of the convexity (parasagittal) was performed in 1770 by Anoine Luis. The first documented successful removal of a <b>skull</b> <b>base</b> meningioma was performed in 1835 by Zanobi Pecchioli, Professor of Surgery at the [...] University of Siena.

2500|$|A {{skeletal}} {{survey is}} useful to confirm the diagnosis of achondroplasia. The skull is large, with a narrow foramen magnum, and relatively small <b>skull</b> <b>base.</b> The vertebral bodies are short and flattened with relatively large intervertebral disk height, and there is congenitally narrowed spinal canal. The iliac wings are small and squared, with a narrow sciatic notch and horizontal acetabular roof. The tubular bones are short and thick with metaphyseal cupping and flaring and irregular growth plates. Fibular overgrowth is present. The hand is broad with short metacarpals and phalanges, and a trident configuration. The ribs are short with cupped anterior ends. If the radiographic features are not classic, {{a search for a}} different diagnosis should be entertained. Because of the extremely deformed bone structure, people with achondroplasia are often [...] "double jointed".|$|E
