30|$|A well-designed {{reflector}} {{surface with}} high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> in electromagnetic performance is of practical {{significance to the}} space application of cable mesh reflector antennas. As for space requirements, circular polarizations are widely used in spaceborne antennas, which usually lead to a beam shift for offset reflectors and influence the <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy.</b> A two-step structural design procedure is proposed to overcome the beam squint phenomenon for high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> design of circularly polarized offset cable mesh reflectors. A simple structural optimal design and an integrated structural electromagnetic optimization are combined to alleviate the beam squint effect of circular polarizations. It is implemented by cable pretension design and adjustment to shape the offset cable mesh surface. Besides, {{in order to increase}} the efficiency of integrated optimization, an update Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) Hessian matrix is employed in the optimization iteration with sequential quadratic programming. A circularly polarized offset cable mesh reflector is utilized to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present a two-step {{structural}} design technology for circularly polarized offset cable mesh reflectors with high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The two-step pretension design combines a simple structural design and an integrated structural electromagnetic optimization. With this technology, high electromagnetic performance especially high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> can be achieved in the antenna structural design. This technology not only can compensate the beam squint angle of circular polarizations, but also can produce a well-designed cable mesh reflector with on-focus feeds. Comparing with the compensation methods proposed by electromagnetism designers, the limited weakness of aforementioned methods can be overcame.|$|R

30|$|In the {{following}} structural design, {{in order to}} obtain a circularly polarized cable mesh reflector with high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy,</b> the predesigned nodes are firstly assumed in the nominal undistorted state. As mentioned before, there exists a beam squint phenomenon for this offset antenna. Then, with the integrated structural electromagnetic optimization, the beam squint phenomenon will be compensated.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the implementation from Step 3 to Step 5 belongs to the structural pretension design, and the procedure from Step 6 to Step 10 is a typical integrated structural electromagnetic optimization design. With this two-step structural design, an offset cable mesh reflector with high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> under circular polarization will be obtained.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the simple}} formula which {{accurately}} predicts the squint angle in circularly polarized offset reflectors was proposed by ADATIA and RUDGE [7], the beam squint phenomenon and its compensation method have attracted many authors’ interests. A squint compensation method by properly tilting the feed {{to make the}} interpreted angle between the incident beam and the radiated beam zero is a natural choice for symmetrical reflectors with off-focus feeds [8]. A squint free approach for symmetrical dual reflector antennas is also proposed by properly choosing geometrical parameters [9]. Furthermore, XU and RAHMAT-SAMII [2] summarized the beam squint compensation methods, and proposed a compensation technology by optimally displacing circularly polarized feeds in the perpendicular plane to obtain high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy.</b> However, these methods in Refs. [2, 7 – 9] are presented from the simple electromagnetic disciplinary, and they are just practical for undistorted reflectors in the nominal state for preliminary design. In actual engineering, space reflectors including cable mesh antennas are easily susceptible to surface distortion under thermal load and other impacts, which enlarge the beam squint angle and seriously affect the <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Simply displacing and tilting the antenna feed cannot thoroughly compensate the distorted electromagnetic performance in actual engineering. Another consideration {{should be taken into}} account is that feed remains on focus with a satisfactory reflector surface is preferred due to the limited size in satellites. How to produce a cable mesh reflector with high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> in electromagnetic performance is an urgent problem for space applications.|$|R
30|$|In recent years, the {{stringent}} {{requirements on}} large space reflectors become demanding for high electromagnetic performance [1]. As for space applications, circular polarizations are usually used in spaceborne antennas. With circularly polarized feeds, {{there exists a}} beam squint phenomenon in offset reflector antennas [2]. The squint angle, which is manifested by a small beam shift of the radiation pattern in the plane perpendicular to the principal offset plane, can significantly affect the <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy.</b> As {{one of the most}} widely used space antennas, cable mesh reflector antenna has attracted much attention due to its advantages of large diameter, light weight, and reasonable cost [3]. Similarly with the smooth solid reflectors, the beam squint phenomenon can also be observed in offset cable mesh reflector antennas with reflecting mesh leakage [4, 5]. The beam squint angle should be taken into account for space applications such as satellite communications, deep-space telemetry, and radio astronomy [2], which concentrate more on <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy.</b> With the stringent requirements on space reflector antennas, the compensation technology to overcome the antenna pattern degradation including beam squint to achieve high <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> becomes more demanding [6].|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of air turbulence on femtosecond laser filamentation is studied experimentally and numerically for laser powers {{of a few}} critical powers. Air turbulence {{in the path of}} the beam prior to filamentation induces a large pointing and formation instability attributed to an increase of the self-focusing distance and higher modulational instability in the presence of turbulence. By contrast, previously formed filaments are robust both in terms of <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> and survival when crossing turbulent air...|$|R
30|$|As for {{structural}} design of cable mesh reflectors, pretension design of cable nets {{is an important}} process to obtain the required reflector surface. Recently, there are several methods which investigate the form-finding analysis for cable mesh reflectors, such as the method presented by TANAKA, et al [10], optimal design method of initial surface in Ref. [11], simple technique in Ref. [12], numerical form-finding method proposed by MORTEROLLE, et al [13] to ensure uniform tension, form-finding analysis with PZT actuators [14] and pretension design under multi-uncertainty [15]. These methods aim to design a surface profile with minimum or zero root-mean-square (rms) error to ensure its surface accuracy. Although the reflector shape can be obtained with high surface accuracy by these methods, its <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> cannot be easily guaranteed, even for circularly polarized feeds. Thus, there rises a problem that {{is it possible to}} provide a pretension structural design considering electromagnetic performance to obtain high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> for circularly polarized feeds? The integrated structural electromagnetic design concept [16, 17] inspires us with a combined procedure, which makes a pretension design from multidisciplinary viewpoint of structure and electromagnetism.|$|R
30|$|This {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. Section  2 {{of this study}} outlines the procedure of the two-step structural design technology. In this technology, an update Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) Hessian matrix is employed {{to increase the efficiency}} of optimization iteration. In section  3, a circularly polarized offset cable mesh reflector is utilized to show the feasibility and effectiveness of this procedure with an on-focus feed to achieve high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> in electromagnetic performance. The major achievements are summarized in section  4.|$|R
30|$|From the application, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that a well-designed cable mesh reflector with high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> in electromagnetic performance is obtained by a two-step structural design. This beam squint free technology is accomplished by structural design to shape surface with a uniform phase distribution in the aperture plane, and the linear phase shift caused on the polarized components of the incident field is thus reduced. This procedure benefits the radiation pattern with no need to displace feed position and orientation.|$|R
30|$|Compared {{with the}} {{previous}} compensation methods, this technology can not only compensate the beam squint angle with an on-focus circular polarized feed, but also provide a well-designed surface with high <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> considering actual engineering. The mentioned pretension structural design can also be improved with considering electromagnetic performance. A statement should be addressed that the drawback of this method is that the procedure cannot handle both two circular polarizations simultaneously, {{which is also the}} drawback of other previous compensation methods.|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} and continuous tracking of fast-flying distant {{objects such as}} rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM) or UAVs requires sensitive tracking systems of high precision with accuracies in the sub-μrad range and high actuating frequencies in the kHz range. These requirements arise from the omnipresent air turbulences which determine the pointing stability and consequently result into a reduced power density at the target object. Additionally mechanical vibrations decrease the <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> further more.

40|$|A {{worldwide}} {{growing interest}} in fast and secure data communications pushes technology development along two lines. While fast communications can be realized using laser communications in fiber and free-space, inherently secure communications can be achieved using quantum key distribution (QKD). By combining both technologies in a single device, many synergies can be exploited, therefore reducing size, weight and power of future systems. In recent experiments we demonstrated quantum communications over large distances {{as well as between}} an aircraft and a ground station which proved the feasibility of QKD between moving partners. Satellites thus may be used as trusted nodes in combination with QKD receiver stations on ground, thereby enabling fast and secure communications on a global scale. We discuss the previous experiment with emphasis on necessary developments to be done and corresponding ongoing research work of German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Ludwig Maximilians University Munich (LMU). DLR is performing research on satellite and ground terminals for the high-rate laser communication component, which are enabling technologies for the QKD link. We describe the concept and hardware of three generations of OSIRIS (Optical High Speed Infrared Link System) laser communication terminals for low Earth orbiting satellites. The first type applies laser <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> solely based on classical satellite control, the second uses an optical feedback to the satellite bus and the third, currently being in design phase, comprises of a special coarse pointing assembly to control beam direction independent of satellite orientation. Ongoing work also targets optical terminals for CubeSats. A further increase of <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>accuracy</b> can be achieved with a fine pointing assembly. Two ground stations will be available for future testing, an advanced stationary ground station and a transportable ground station. In parallel the LMU QKD source size will be reduced by more than an order of magnitude thereby simplifying its integration into future free-space optical communication links with CubeSats. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
