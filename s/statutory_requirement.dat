If he/she had been suspended before, he/she will only be allowed to accumulate less than 12 demerit points in a period of 12 months. It is a driving licence scheme where those foreigners who have their licence suspended will have their licences affected, as this is from other countries.

40|$|In Hong Kong, <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements</b> {{applicable}} to building services maintenance activities {{appear in a}} wide variety of ordinances and regulations, which can be confusing and may be misinterpreted or overlooked. This paper reviews the key <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements,</b> common problems with complying with the requirements, and the potential liabilities consequent upon non-compliance. To help focus the analysis, the <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements</b> were categorised with reference to the involved compliance procedures, and a process model was devised to represent the procedures under each category. Attention of individuals and firms responsible for maintenance work is drawn to their liability for damages that could arise due to negligent acts to show that maintenance work shall be conducted not simply to satisfy <b>statutory</b> <b>requirements,</b> but far beyond.

As a {{percentage}} of personal income, it was at 3.8%—above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement</b> to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses {{at the end of}} each fiscal year, however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.|$|E

In Singapore, {{there is also no}} general <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement</b> for decision-makers to provide reasons.

They are overseen by the Historic Preservation Commission (HPC), a body of seven residents appointed by the village manager.

The HPC considers applications for landmark status, and develops overall preservation strategies for the village, but does not consider applications for individual properties.|$|E

25|$|While the u-value ceased {{being the}} sole {{consideration}} in 2006, u-value limits {{similar to those}} in the 2002 regulations still apply, but are no longer sufficient by themselves. The DER, and TER (Target Emission rate) calculated through either the UK Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP rating), 2005 edition, or the newer SBEM (*Simplified Building Energy Model) which is aimed at non-dwellings, became the only acceptable calculation methods. Several commercial energy modeling software packages have now also been verified as producing acceptable evidence by the BRE Global & UK Government. Calculations using previous versions of SAP had been an optional way of demonstrating compliance since 1991(?). They are now a <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement</b> (B. Reg.17C et al.) for all building regulations applications, involving new dwelling/buildings and large extensions to existing non-domestic buildings.|$|E
25|$|Socrates antagonises {{the court}} by proposing, {{rather than a}} penalty, a reward — {{perpetual}} maintenance at public expense. He notes that the vote of judgement against him was close; thirty votes more in his favour would have acquitted him. In that vein, Socrates then engages in dark humour, suggesting that Meletus narrowly escaped a great fine for not meeting the <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement</b> of receiving one-fifth of the votes of the assembled judges in favour of his accusations against Socrates. In that way, Socrates published the financial consequence for Meletus to consider as plaintiff in a lawsuit — because the Athenian legal system discouraged frivolous lawsuits by imposing a financially onerous fine upon the plaintiff, if the vote of the judges was less than one-fifth {{of the number of}} judges required by the type of lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|About 1900 {{there was}} a high {{incidence}} of scrotal cancer detected in former mule spinners. It was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles when running threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture since the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement</b> to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.|$|E

25|$|The Bristol Unit has {{suffered}} {{along with the}} rest of the BBC from recent staff cuts. Yet it remains confident in the belief that the BBC will maintain it, in spite of the vagaries of fashion, because the Corporation believes that such programmes deserve a place in the schedules of any broadcaster with pretensions of providing a Public Service. In due course, similar specialist Units were also established in London, in order to produce programmes on archaeology and history, on the arts, on music and on science. They too, at one time, had their successes. But they have not survived as well as the Unit in Bristol. The <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement</b> that a certain percentage of programmes must come from independent producers has reduced in-house production and the Units necessarily shrank proportionately in size. As they dwindled, so the critical mass of their production expertise has diminished. The continuity of their archives has been broken, they have lost the close touch they once had worldwide with their subjects and they are no longer regarded internationally as the centres of innovation and expertise that they once were.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} EPA first {{established}} these standards in 2001, the nuclear industry, several environmental and public interest groups, and the State of Nevada challenged the standards in court. In July 2004, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found {{in favor of}} the Agency on all counts except one: the 10,000 year regulatory time frame. The court ruled that EPA’s 10,000-year compliance period for isolation of radioactive waste was not consistent with National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommendations and was too short. The NAS report had recommended standards be set for the time of peak risk, which might approach a period of one million years. By limiting the compliance time to 10,000 years, EPA did not respect a <b>statutory</b> <b>requirement</b> that it develop [...] standards consistent with NAS recommendations.|$|E
