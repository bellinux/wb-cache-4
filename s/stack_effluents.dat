Prominent examples of such environmental contamination episodes are the Love Canal, into which ton quantities of chlorinated organic compounds containing substantial concentrations of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) were deposited; numerous sites in the State of Missouri which were contaminated by the dumping of chlorinated organic wastes containing various PCDDs and possibly PCDFs, and PCBs; and the environs of a 2, 4 -D/ 2, 4, 5 -T manufacturing plant site in Arkansas, which were contaminated with PCDDs. Environmental assessments of such sites have revealed extensive contamination of soils, waterways, fish and other biological species with these toxic compounds, which in turn could lead to human exposures.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{atmospheric}} {{trace element}} abundances associated with several {{major sources of}} air pollution in Western Oregon, such as the paper industry, the metallurgical processing industry, the plywood industry and agricultural field burning have been measured by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Air samples were collected directly from industrial stacks and during the field burning season using high volume air samplers, tape samplers and a cascade impactor. Nuclepore filter paper and Handiwrap were used as collection media for air particulates. The results show {{that some of the}} trace elements are highly correlated with a particular source of pollution, e. the high concentration of Zr, Hf, Ta, As, Cl, and Br associated with the metallurgical processing company; Na, Cl, Br, Cu, V, Co, Cr and Hg with the paper company; Na, K, Cl, Cr, Cu, Br and Hg with the plywood company and Ti, Na, Al, K, and Fe with agricultural field burning. Of all these characteristic elements, only Zr, Hf, Ta and As could be used as "natural occurring" tracers for tracing the dispersal pattern of <b>stack</b> <b>effluent</b> from a particular source. The concentrations of potentially toxic elements such as Hg, A. s, Se, and V emitted from these sources into the atmosphere were found to be too low to cause any health hazard in the area concerned. The atmospheric trace element abundances in Albany (an industrial area) and in Corvallis (a rural area) were also measured. Abnormally high trace element concentrations were found in the Albany area. Most of the trace element concentrations are highly correlated to the industries in the area. The rural air in Corvallis, on the other hand, shows very low trace element concentrations and may serve as an indication of the "continental background" contribution to atmospheric abundance. An artificial activable tracer technique using some of the rareearth elements (Dy, Sm, La, and Ce) was also developed to monitor <b>stack</b> <b>effluent.</b> These tracers were used in testing the generalized Gaussian plume model (Gifford, 1962) and Hewson's trapping plume model (Hewson, 1958) applied to describe the dispersal pattern of <b>stack</b> <b>effluent</b> in the Albany area. These models were found to work quite well under atmospheric stabilities types D, C, and B (Pasquill's classification, 1962) and not to work well under very turbulent conditions (atmospheric stability type A. or above). These meteorological models along with the techniques of multiple regression analysis were applied to predict the emission rates of the <b>stack</b> <b>effluent</b> involving multiple sources of air pollution in the Albany area.

40|$|The {{detection}} of elemental mercury (Hg 0) within industrial processes {{is extremely important}} {{as it is the}} first major step in ensuring the efficient operation of implemented mercury removal technologies. In this study, a 131 MHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line sensor with gold electrodes was tested towards Hg 0 vapor (24 to 365 ppbv) with/without the presence of ammonia (NHppb 3) and humidity (Hppb 2 O), as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as acetaldehyde (MeCHO), ethylmercaptan (EM), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), which are all common interfering gas species that co-exist in many industrial applications requiring mercury monitoring. The developed sensor exhibited a detection limit of 0. 7 ppbv and 4. 85 ppbv at 35 and 55 °C, respectively. Furthermore, a repeatability of 97 % and selectivity of 92 % in the presence of contaminants gases was exhibited by the sensor at the chosen operating temperature of 55 °C. The response magnitude of the developed SAW sensor towards different concentrations of Hg 0 vapor fitted well with the Langmuir extension isotherm (otherwise known as loading ratio correlation (LRC)) which is in agreement with our basic finite element method (FEM) work where an LRC isotherm was observed for a simplified model of the SAW sensor responding to different Hg contents deposited on the Au based electrodes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 AT-cut {{piezoelectric}} quartz crystals coated with low vapor pressure materials are evaluated as digital transducers in completely digital detection systems for monitoring gas streams. Mathematical relations describing the detectors are developed and tested. Specific application {{is made to}} monitoring gaseous sulfur compounds commonly found in <b>stack</b> <b>effluents</b> of pulp mills. It is shown that detectors formed by coating such crystals with a liquid capable of dissolving the gas of interest exhibit reversible characteristics with subsecond response times. Furthermore, if the sorbate-sorbent interactions are physical the detector exhibits linear response to varying concentrations of sorbate over the entire working range. Curvilinear plots are obtained if there are stronger interactions between the sorbate-sorbent pair. In the extreme case where there is chemical reaction between the two, the detector becomes irreversible, exhibits slow response characteristics, becomes integrating in nature, {{and can be used}} as specific detector with very high sensitivity. Instrumentation for actuation and measurement of crystal frequencies and for interfacing such detectors to digital computers are developed and evaluated. It is shown that the above-mentioned functions can be performed satisfactorily with inexpensive instrumentation designed around readily available integrated circuits. A partition detector exhibiting reversible response characteristics is applied to on-line data acquisition from a gas chromatograph employing a large general-purpose, time-sharing computer and a remote terminal. Employment of simple, inexpensive interfacing along with the presently available computational facilities on the Campus, permit implementation of a completely automatic data acquisition system. This approach, {{as an alternative to the}} use of small dedicated digital computers, is worthy of serious consideration. Behavior of the partition detector as applied to gas chromatography is described mathematically. It is shown that such a detector is sensitive to carrier gas flow rates and therefore is a concentration detector rather than a mass flow type. Furthermore, since this detector is sensitive to partition coefficient of the sorbate gas it can be used for confirming identity of components suspected of belonging to a known homologous series...|$|E

40|$|Variations {{in marine}} {{stratocumulus}} cloud microphysics during FIRE IFO 1987 are observed and analyzed {{through the use}} of NOAA- 9 / 10 AVHRR satellite data and aircraft in-cloud measurements. The relationships between channel 3 reflectance and cloud microphysical properties are examined through model reflectances based on Mie theory and the delta-Eddington approximation, and reveal a channel 3 reflectance dependence on cloud droplet size distribution. Satellite observations show significant regions of continental influence over the ocean through higher channel 3 reflectances resulting from the injection of continental aerosols and the associated modification of cloud droplet characteristics. Channel 3 reflectance gradients across individual cloud elements correspond to radially varying cloud droplet size distributions within the elements. Various mesoscale and microscale features such as ship <b>stack</b> <b>effluent</b> tracks and pollution sources are observed in the data. Correlations between reflectance values and aircraft measurements illustrate the potential of estimating cloud droplet size distribution and marine atmospheric boundary layer aerosol composition and concentration through use of satellite data.

Thus it is subject of the present experiments to observe the spatial distribution of the particle number density in the stack section of interest in order to optimize the positioning of the sampling area.

The present paper deals with a non intrusive optical two dimensional field measurement technique that can determine the spatial distribution of particles, from this the concentration of particles of the measurement plane can be concluded. The concentration of particles must be low enough to allow isolated particles to be distinguished on a single image. In comparison with local measurements using probes this kind of measurement has the advantage of not disturbing the flow and of delivering a spatial information. This is how the effects of changing parameters can be made out. Parameters like this might be different in measurements utilizing probes without being recognize...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the current status of the {{development}} of the Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) Facility at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Designated a National User Facility by the US DOE, the primary mission of STAR is to provide laboratory infrastructure to study tritium science and technology issues associated with the development of safe and environmentally friendly fusion energy. Both tritium and non-tritium fusion safety research is pursued along three key thrust areas: (1) plasma-material interactions of plasma-facing component (PFC) materials exposed to energetic tritium and deuterium ions, (2) fusion safety concerns related to PFC material chemical reactivity and dust/debris generation, activation product mobilization, and tritium behavior in fusion systems, and (3) molten salts and fusion liquids for tritium breeder and coolant applications. STAR comprises a multi-room complex with operations segregated to permit both tritium and non-tritium activities in separately ventilated rooms. Tritium inventory in STAR is limited to 15, 000 Ci to maintain its classification as a Radiological Facility. Experiments with tritium are typically conducted in glovebox environments. Key components of the tritium infrastructure have been installed and tested. This includes the following subsystems: (1) a tritium Storage and Assay System (SAS) that uses two 50 -g depleted uranium beds for tritium storage and PVT/beta-scintillation analyses for tritium accountability measurements, (2) a Tritium Cleanup System (TCS) that uses catalytic oxidation and molecular sieve water absorption to remove tritiated species from glovebox atmosphere gases and gaseous effluents from experiment and process systems, and (3) tritium monitoring instrumentation for room air, glovebox atmosphere and <b>stack</b> <b>effluent</b> tritium concentration measurements.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of gaseous emissions from cyclotron sites during {{the production of}} positron emitters for use in nuclear imaging is a public safety issue, and operators are required to measure any such emissions accurately. Despite the fact that <b>stack</b> <b>effluent</b> monitor instrumentation has been available for several years, a suitable calibration facility does not exist. Traceability to a primary standard is essential if such measurements are to be accurate. This project focused {{on the development of}} a primary standard based on a system already established at NPL for the standardisation of beta-emitters such as 85 Kr and 133 xe. Previous standardisations of beta+-emitters have been carried out using liquid or solid sources. Unlike the previously mentioned standardisation methods for positron emitters (which have been carried out using liquid or solid sources), a primary standard for positron emitters in gas has been developed, which can be used to calibrate the instrumentation used at PET/cyclotron sites. 11 C was chosen as the radionuclide to be standardised, 18 F, 15 O and 13 N could not be used because of experimental factors. To provide an active gas sample suitable for counting and to provide a comparison with an existing standard based on measurement of a liquid, a method has been developed for conversion of sodium bicarbonate to carbon dioxide with subsequent drying and trapping of the gas. A sample of 11 C liberated in this way was measured by internal gas proportional counting using a system of three counters. This document describes the standardisation of 11 C by gas counting and the comparison of the primary standardisation results with an independent measurement of a sample of the same sodium bicarbonate solution that was used to generate the active gas. The independent measurement was carried out using a secondary standard ion chamber. The experimental determination of counting losses in internal gas proportional counting was difficult. Some of the losses for standardizing 11 C, 13 N, 15 O 18 F have been calculated using the PENELOPE Monte Carlo Code.

The best process performance was obtained from a 5 -step (bed) stripping PSA cycle with a light reflux step and a heavy reflux step (with the heavy reflux gas obtained from the low pressure purge step), with a CO{sub 2 } purity of 78. 9 %, a CO{sub 2 } recovery of 57. 4 %, and a throughput of 11. 5 L STP/hr/kg. This performance improved substantially when the CO{sub 2 }-HTlc adsorption and desorption mass transfer coefficients (uncertain quantities at this time) were increased by factors of five, with a CO{sub 2 } purity of 90. 3 %, a CO{sub 2 } recovery of 73. 6 %, and a throughput of 34. 6 L STP/hr/kg. Overall, this preliminary study disclosed the importance of cycle configuration through the heavy and dual reflux concepts, and the importance of knowing well defined mass transfer coefficients to the performance of a high temperature PSA process for CO{sub 2 } capture and concentration from flue and stack gases using an HTlc adsorbent.
