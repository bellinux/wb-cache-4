60|$|There was but {{a single}} chamber within, with a <b>straight</b> <b>ladder</b> in the corner, leading through a square hole in the ceiling to the {{sleeping}} chamber under the roof. Three or four chairs and stools were scattered over the earthen floor, and at the side a deal table with the broad brown milk basins upon it. Green blotches upon the wall and a sinking in of {{one side of the}} cottage showed the effect of its damp, marsh-girt position.|$|E
50|$|Like its Leyland and AEC rivals, the Freeline had a high, <b>straight</b> <b>ladder</b> frame, made of {{substantial}} steel channel section, with an optional rear drop-frame extension for luggage boots on coaches, or standee platforms for urban buses.|$|E

6000|$|From his {{position}} {{behind the screen}} {{he did not see}} the approaching figure of Mr. Stonehouse, and was astonished when he saw his head rise above the edge of the tank as he climbed the <b>straight</b> Jacob's <b>ladder</b> behind the wheelhouse.

60|$|They then {{followed}} in the direction taken by Paula, Charlotte entering the carriage. When Power and De Stancy had ascended about fifty yards the former looked back, and dropped off from the pursuit, {{to return to the}} easy route, giving his companion a parting hint concerning Paula. Whereupon De Stancy went on alone. He soon saw Paula above him in the path, which ascended skyward <b>straight</b> as Jacob's <b>Ladder,</b> but was so overhung by the brushwood as to be quite shut out from the sun. When he reached her side she was moving easily upward, apparently enjoying the seclusion which the place afforded.|$|R
40|$|We {{sought to}} {{identify}} the incidence, injury patterns, and financial burden of ladder fall injuries to provide a reference for reinforcing guidelines on the prevention of such injuries. We enrolled the patients who were injured in a ladder-related fall and required intensive care between April 2012 and March 2014 at Okayama University Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Okayama City: 9 patients injured in 7 stepladder falls and 2 <b>straight</b> <b>ladder</b> falls. The median patient age was 69 years, and 8 were males. Six falls occurred in non-occupational settings. Head injuries predominated, and the injury severity score ranged from 2 to 35 (mean＝ 21 ± 12). At the time of discharge from the intensive care unit, one patient had died and 5 patients had some neurological disabilities. The case fatality rate was 11 %. The total cost of care during the review period was ￥ 16, 705, 794, with a mean cost of ￥ 1, 856, 199 per patient. Ladder fall injuries {{are associated with a}} high rate of neurological sequelae and pose a financial burden on the health insurance system. A prevention education campaign targeting at older-aged males in non-occupational settings may be a worthwhile health service investment in this community...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} brief notes on an ancient problem: the ellipsograph of Archimedes. It was gener-alized {{in the seventeenth}} century using geometric techniques, and problems of this kind provide very interesting puzzles in later school or early university problem solving courses, e. g. [3]. These mecha-nisms are of direct relevance to contemporary mechanical engineers. The mathematical treatment we provide here, albeit in outline form only, is to alert readers {{to the power of the}} polynomial Gröbner Bases techniques for providing explicit solutions to problems which appear intractable. This is a late twentieth century technique which combines the pure mathematics of rings and groups with the power of computer algebra. Imagine a cat sitting in the middle of a <b>straight</b> <b>ladder</b> which stands on horizontal ground while resting against a vertical wall. If the end of the (thin) ladder GW slides down the wall at W then the (point sized) cat C 0 follows a circular path. It is straightforward to show that if the cat moves to any other point on the ladder, eg C 1, then it follows an elliptical path. Now imagine the ladder is extended to pass through either the wall or ground, eg C 2. Should the cat move to the end of the ladder it would still move in an ellipse, and this configuration gives rise to the well-known ellipsograph (i. e. a draftsman’s tool for drawing an ellipse) referred to as the trammel of Archimedes. See the illustration below. b...|$|E
5000|$|The ladder {{itself is}} capable of being {{converted}} into several heights and configurations from a single ladder. Configurations include a <b>straight</b> or extension <b>ladder,</b> an A-frame ladder, a staircase ladder (an uneven A-frame for use on stairs), a 90° ladder, and {{both sides of a}} scaffolding trestle achieved through a triple locking hinge. Each of the ladder positions has three heights in one ladder. The ladder can achieve as many as 24 position/height permutations. The ladder folds to a smaller size for storage. The ladder also has [...] "tip-n-glide" [...] wheels to facilitate movement and positioning.|$|R
5000|$|Instead, {{a common}} feature in Life without Death {{patterns}} {{is the presence}} of ladders, patterns that grow in a <b>straight</b> line. A <b>ladder</b> will grow forever unless it runs into some other part of the pattern and is blocked or unless some more quickly-growing pattern overtakes it. The most common ladder pattern is shown in the figure; every twelve steps, the same shape appears {{at the tip of the}} ladder, four cells farther from the starting position of the ladder. [...] The speed of the ladder's growth is therefore four cells per twelve steps, or, in Life notation, 4c/12 = c/3; here c represents one unit of distance per time step. Another common pattern (called a [...] "parasitic shoot" [...] by Gravner and Griffeath) advances twice as quickly, at speed 2c/3, along the side of a ladder, eventually blocking the ladder and causing a chaotic explosion.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} quantum {{transport of}} electrons, phase solitons, etc. through mesoscopic networks of zero-dimensional quantum dots. <b>Straight</b> and circular <b>ladders</b> are chosen as networks with each coupled with three semi-infinite leads (with one incoming {{and the other}} two outgoing). Two transmission probabilities (TPs) {{as a function of the}} incident energy ϵ show a transition from anti-phase aperiodic to degenerate periodic spectra at the critical energy ϵ_c which is determined by a bifurcation point of the bulk energy dispersions. TPs of the circular ladder depend only on the parity of the winding number. Introduction of a single missing bond (MB) or missing step doubles the period of the periodic spectra at ϵ>ϵ_c. Shift of the MB by lattice constant results in a striking switching effect at ϵ<ϵ_c. In the presence of the electric-field induced spin-orbit interaction (SOI), an obvious spin filtering occurs against the spin-unpolarized injection. Against the spin-polarized injection, on the other hand, the spin transport shows spin-flip (magnetization reversal) oscillations with respect to SOI. We also show a role of soliton in the context of its transport through the ladder networks. Comment: 10 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
