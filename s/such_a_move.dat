5|$|In 2004, Middle Temple {{proposed}} {{selling the}} Molyneux globes, valued at over £1million, {{to create a}} scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority against <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move.</b> There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this failure, the Belgians were asked to fall back to the Yser river and protect the Allied left flank and rear areas. The King's aide, General Overstraten said that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> could not be made and {{would lead to the}} Belgian Army disintegrating. Another plan for further offensives was suggested. The French requested the Belgians withdraw to the Leie and the British to the French frontier between Maulde and Halluin, the Belgians were then to extend their front to free further parts of the BEF for the attack. The French 1st Army would relieve two more divisions on the right flank. Leopold was reluctant to undertake <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> because it would abandon all but a small portion of Belgium. The Belgian Army was exhausted and it was an enormous technical task that would take too long to complete.|$|E

5|$|Hunt's skill on {{the field}} and {{positive}} influence on other team members led to his emergence, early in 2007, as a future candidate for the Broncos captaincy. Broncos chief executive Bruno Cullen stated that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> would have his and the Broncos management's full support. Current captain Lockyer also gave his support to Hunt being the next captain, saying that he has the respect of fellow players and the necessary leadership qualities.|$|E
5|$|Lucullus was {{astonished}} upon hearing {{this in the}} year 70, {{and he began to}} prepare for an immediate invasion of Armenia. Although he had no mandate from the Senate to authorize <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move,</b> he attempted to justify his invasion by distinguishing as his enemy king Tigranes and not his subjects. In the summer of 69, he marched his troops across Cappodocia and the Euphrates river and entered the Armenian province of Tsop'k', where Tigranocerta was located.|$|E

5|$|On 2 January 2015, Hibernians of the Maltese Premier League, {{through their}} English {{vice-president}} Stephen Vaughan, {{announced that they}} had offered Evans a contract {{up to the end}} of the season. The British Ministry of Justice said that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> would not be possible as Evans was a convicted sex offender on licence and, as such, barred from working abroad. Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, warned Hibernians that hiring Evans could affect the whole country's reputation, while Justice Minister Owen Bonnici stated that Evans had a right to return to his profession after being released from prison.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} {{propose that the}} Founding Fathers never {{intended}} for District residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> would destroy {{the notion of a}} separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians were unwilling to stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
50|$|The Holy See made {{efforts in}} 2007 to create formal {{ties with the}} PRC.

5|$|The Hong Kong Institute of Planners, the {{majority}} of whose members work in government departments, had backed the in-situ preservation of the pier. There was uproar in May 2008 when it made an apparent U-turn in a position paper submitted to the government backing the relocation to a waterfront location, based on a sparsely attended meeting. It then submitted a revised paper presenting {{that a majority of}} its members supported <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> as a conclusion prior to the completion of a survey. A former vice-president of the institute questioned how the institute had become allies of the government.|$|E
5|$|The UNPROFOR {{operations}} {{staff in}} Sector West developed several defensive plans, assigning top {{priority to the}} plan codenamed Operation Backstop. It envisaged an active defence against the HV, assuming that the attack's main axis would be the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. CANBAT 1 (supported by General Zabala) thought the HV would attack Sector West to control the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, and the UN would not object to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move.</b> Any Croatian attack in the area was likely to employ substantially larger forces than those earmarked for Operation Backstop.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} senate {{that he planned to}} leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> would have left both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E

5|$|Although Johnson {{had focused}} the {{majority}} of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that he would no longer campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he might run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move.</b> In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E
5|$|Auchinleck, now Commander-in-Chief, India, {{strongly}} opposed <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> preferring {{to retain the}} division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived 81st (West Africa) Division {{could be used in}} its place. Despite his arguments {{and the end of the}} division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied Ramree Island, he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate. On 6September, the division began reorganising for long-range penetration. It had been estimated that 10 percent of the men would be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.|$|E
5|$|Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who {{had taken}} over command from Gamelin, were still {{determined}} to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated their intentions to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened {{what remained of the}} Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> would have overstretched them. Without consulting the French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions to plug the gap and abandon any offensive operations further south.|$|E

D'Ávila became embroiled in the factional politics of the town, taking the part of Diego Díaz de Herrera.

Fischer also assured the local authorities of the RSK that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> would prevent renewed fighting in the area. The result of Fischer's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement. The agreement, signed in Daruvar on 18 February, encompassed the reconstruction of water and electrical power supply networks, the reopening of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway section in Sector West for non-commercial traffic, the facilitation of the Novska–Nova Gradiška railway, the repair of telecommunication lines, {{the establishment of a}} joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West, the return of all refugees to their homes, the access to property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line, and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation.|$|E
5|$|General General Bernard Montgomery (commanding {{the ground}} forces in Normandy), wanted {{an attack on}} the eastern flank of the front to capture Falaise, {{intending}} that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>move</b> would precipitate a general German collapse. The First Canadian Army (Lieutenant General Harry Crerar), held this part of the Allied front. It consisted of the British I Corps, responsible for the extreme eastern flank of the Allied lines and II Canadian Corps (Lieutenant General Guy Simonds) south of Caen. The II Canadian Corps, which was to launch Operation Totalize consisted of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, 1st Polish Armoured Division, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and the British 33rd Armoured Brigade.|$|E
