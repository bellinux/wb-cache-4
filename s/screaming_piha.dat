50|$|The rose-collared piha (Lipaugus streptophorus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Cotingidae. It is found in humid forests growing in the tepui {{highlands}} in south-eastern Venezuela, western Guyana and far northern Brazil. Only the male has the rosy collar for which this species is named. The female resembles the <b>screaming</b> <b>piha,</b> but has a cinnamon vent.|$|E
50|$|The <b>screaming</b> <b>piha</b> (Lipaugus vociferans) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the family Cotingidae. It is found in humid forests in the Amazon and tropical parts of the Mata Atlântica in South America. It is adapting well to human settlement areas like gardens and parks. It {{is considered to be}} of least concern by BirdLife International.|$|E
50|$|In cotinga species {{where only}} the females {{care for the}} eggs and young, the males have {{striking}} courtship displays, often grouped together in leks. Such sexual selection results in the males of these species, including the Guianan cock-of-the-rock, being brightly coloured, or decorated with plumes or wattles, like the umbrellabirds, with their umbrella-like crest and long throat wattles. Other lekking cotingids like the bellbirds and <b>screaming</b> <b>piha,</b> have distinctive and far-carrying calls. In such canopy-dwelling genera as Carpodectes, Cotinga, and Xipholena, males gather high in a single tree or in adjacent trees, but male cocks-of-the-rock, as befits their more terrestrial lives, give their elaborate displays in leks on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adult male}} rose-collared piha has the upper parts dark grey and the underparts {{slightly}} paler grey, {{especially on the}} belly. Round the neck is a conspicuous broad magenta collar {{and there is a}} similar patch of colour round the vent. The female is similar to the male but lacks the magenta collar, and the area around the vent is rusty-brown. This bird grows to a length of about 22.5 cm. The male is unlikely to be confused with any other species, but the female could be confused with the female <b>screaming</b> <b>piha</b> (Lipaugus vociferans), but that species is a uniform grey and lacks the rufous area round the vent. The call is also very different, the rose-collared piha male occasionally emitting a loud, sharp [...] "skreeéyr".|$|E
50|$|Kanashen {{houses the}} {{headwaters}} of the Essequibo River, Guyana’s principal water source, and encompasses the southern portion of its watershed, which drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. The main mountains are the Wassarai, Yahore, Komoa and Kaiawakua, with elevations up to about 1200 metres above sea level. Except for its flora, the biology of the Kanashen district is relatively unstudied. Botanically, the area has many species found only in the area and is covered by four general vegetation types, which have remained almost completely intact. The main vegetation types are tall evergreen highland forest and tall/medium evergreen lower montane forest. There are also small areas of tall evergreen flooded riparian forest and lowland shrub savanna. Species such as Manyokinaballi (Geissospermum spp.) and Kakaralli (Eschweilera) are the most common of the 192 species recorded. The area also contains important fauna such as giant river otters (Pteronura brasiliensis), the cock of the rock (Rupicola rupicola), the giant harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and other animals that support the livelihood of the Wais-Wais. Three globally threatened species inhabit the COCA: the Giant Armadillo (Priodontes maximus), one of the Harlequin Toads (Atelopus spumarius) and the Brazilian Tapir (tapirus terrestris). The Giant Anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), jaguars (Panthera onca), labba (Agouti paca), peccary (Tayassu spp.) and forest deer (Mazama spp.) are also known to occur in the area. Results of community-based bird surveys at three sites recorded 117 species, approximately 16% {{of the total number of}} species recorded in Guyana. This number was increased by an additional 100 species identified during a rapid biological assessment study. Some of the birds present in the COCA are the <b>Screaming</b> <b>Piha</b> (Lipaugus vociferans), White-tailed Trogon (Trogon viridis), Painted Parakeet (Pyrrhura picta), Golden-headed Manakin (Pipra erythrocephala), several species of parrots and macaw including the Scarlet (Ara macao), Red Shouldered (Diopsittaca nobilis) and Blue and Yellow (Ara ararauna) Macaws, and species of antbirds (Thamnophilidae) and toucans (Ramphastidae).|$|E
40|$|One long-standing ornithological {{paradigm}} {{holds that}} song learning in oscine songbirds has a cultural component, whereas suboscine songbirds inherit songs genetically. Recent studies reveal that suboscine song {{may be more}} variable and complex than previously realized. Several suboscine species show marked individual variation in their songs-variation that {{may play a role}} in individual recognition and neighbor-stranger discrimination-and a few suboscine species show indications of song learning. We investigated individual variation in the vocalizations of a suboscine passerine, the <b>Screaming</b> <b>Piha</b> (Lipaugus vociferans), from recordings of 26 males at four lek sites along the Tambopata River in Peru. Male <b>Screaming</b> <b>Piha</b> songs consist of quiet introductory syllables followed by two explosively loud syllables that sound like an emphatic pee haw. We used three complementary methods to examine variation in song characteristics. Spectrogram cross-correlation revealed significant consistency within individual males and variability among males. Analysis of fine structural characteristics revealed that all measured song features were significantly less variable within individuals than among individuals. Canonical discriminant analysis based on these 13 song features correctly classified 93. 2...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcoustic {{monitoring}} {{has proved}} to be an efficient approach to monitor wildlife, notably in environments with limited visibility, such as tropical rainforests. Today, recording equipment allows acoustic data to be gathered in remote areas at wide spatial and temporal scales. The resulting datasets are large and the use of automated processing systems to extract relevant information can greatly facilitate their analysis. Here, we have developed signal processing techniques to reveal the spatio-temporal dynamics of an emblematic bird voice of the neotropical forest: the song of the <b>Screaming</b> <b>Piha</b> (Lipaugus vociferans). Using recordings made in a French Guianan lowland forest, with an array of 24 microphones in a three dimensional space, we implemented a detection system based on spectrogram cross-correlation to trace the vocalisations of L. vociferans. We tuned the detection system based on the percentage area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, finding a maximum of 95. 88 %. To strictly minimise false positives, we set the operating point to have 34. 9 % true positives and 0 % false positives. We detected a total of 12, 735 songs attributed to the study bird during 25 study days. We found that spatial patterns of lower activity corresponded to a zone having smaller trees and more tree gaps — a known liana forest patch — suggesting that <b>Screaming</b> <b>Piha</b> birds tend to avoid non-mature primary forests. The sampling sites near the creeks had more detections than the sites further away, suggesting that the lek mating arenas might be distributed strategically to be near to a source of water. We also found a marked temporal pattern. The lek was active during the whole day, from sunrise to sunset, with two peaks of activity shifted by more than 2 h from the dawn and dusk chorus. The approach described here can be tested using other conspicuous and stereotyped sounds that occur within a heterogeneous and noisy background. To decipher the complex interacting sounds of the tropical forest, these focal studies on specific acoustic elements should be complemented with community or soundscape analysis, to demonstrate the human impact on the ecosystem and to provide guidelines for natural resource management...|$|E
