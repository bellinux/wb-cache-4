40|$|Experimental {{analysis}} of the stresses and strains in a glass fibre polymer composite double butt <b>strap</b> <b>joint</b> using digital image correlation (DIC) is described in the paper. Initially the strain fields through {{the thickness of the}} joint are derived from DIC measurements, capturing the effect of the initiation and development of cracks in the joint up to failure. It is demonstrated that the relatively small strains developed in the through-thickness direction are critical in the development of damage in the joint at the geometric discontinuity between the adherends. An experimental methodology is established to perform DIC at the mesoscopic scale, enabling accurate, high spatial resolution {{analysis of}} the small through-thickness strains around the discontinuity. The DIC enables the strains to be evaluated, their development monitored and hence establish their contribution to the failure process. To determine the full-field stresses in the joint experimentally derived materials properties are used.

40|$|Abstract. The {{degradation}} and failure of protective coatings (paints and sealants) {{is a key}} element influencing the service life of aircraft. Such degradation is influenced by the response of coatings to environmental factors such as high temperatures and exposure to ultraviolet radiation, as well as chemical factors. However, the effect of loading and load history on coating durability has received little attention, despite clearly being a factor in determining failure sites (such as joints) and the rate of degradation. This paper describes the key characteristics of coatings at aircraft joints, {{and the nature of the}} strains experienced by coatings in locations influenced by in-service loads. It is first step in assessing the complex strain history at joint strain concentration locations as part of developing a prognostic capability for the service life of aircraft coatings.

The model helps to select a patch material (i. e., elastic modulus of the material) and the patch thickness in order to reduce the Strain Energy Release Rate (SERR) at the crack tip. In other words, in order to achieve the desired SERR using the single-side patch, the analytical model can be utilized to find a proper patch material and patch dimensions for the given cracked plate if the plate modulus and thickness as well as the crack size are known. The model is based on the axial and bending stresses of the single-side <b>strap</b> <b>joint,</b> and those stresses are related to the SERR at the crack tip of a plate with a single-side patch repair.

The other twelve specimens were tested under fatigue loading with load ratios ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 6 (defined as {{the ratio of the}} maximum load in the fatigue test to the average static bond strength of control specimens). After a certain number of fatigue cycles, five specimens failed during fatigue loading and the other seven specimens survived. For specimens failed during fatigue loading, a linear logarithm relationship between the fatigue life and load ratio was achieved.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{interfacial}} stresses at {{the free}} edges of adherends {{are responsible for}} the debonding failure of adhesively bonded joints (ABJs). In this paper, a general stress-function variational method is formulated to determinate the interfacial shear and normal (peeling) stresses in ABJs in high accuracy. By extending authors’ prior work in stress analysis of bonded joints (Wu and Jenson, 2011), all the planar stress components in the adherends and adhesive layer of an ABJ are expressed in terms of four unknown interfacial stress functions, which are introduced at the upper and lower surfaces of the adhesive layer. A set of governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the four interfacial stress functions is obtained via minimizing the complimentary strain energy of the ABJ, which is further solved by using eigenfunctions. The obtained semi-analytic stress field can satisfy all the traction boundary conditions (BCs) of the ABJ, especially the stress continuity across the bonding lines and the shear-free condition at the ends of adherends and adhesive layer. As an example, the stress field in an adhesively single-sided <b>strap</b> <b>joint</b> is determined by the present method, whose numerical accuracy and reliability are validated by finite element method (FEM) and compared to existing models in the literature. Parameter studies are performed to examine the dependencies of the interfacial stresses of the exemplified ABJ upon the geometries, moduli and temperature change of the adherends and adhesive layer, respectively. The present method is applicable for scaling analysis of joint strength, optimal design of ABJs, etc...|$|E

40|$|Thermoelastic Stress Analysis (TSA) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) {{are used}} to examine the stress and strain {{distributions}} around the geometric discontinuity in a composite double butt <b>strap</b> <b>joint</b> (DBSJ). A well-known major limitation in conducting analysis using TSA is that it provides a metric that is only related to the sum of the principal stresses and cannot provide the component stresses/strains. The stress metric is related to the thermoelastic response by a combination of material properties known as the thermoelastic constant (coefficient of thermal expansion divided by density and specific heat). The thermoelastic constant is usually obtained by a calibration process. For calibration purposes when using orthotropic materials it is necessary to obtain the thermoelastic constant in the principal material directions, as the principal stress directions for a general structure are unknown. Often it is assumed that the principal stress directions are coincident with the principal material directions. Clearly, this assumption is not valid in complex stress systems and therefore a means of obtaining the thermoelastic constants in the principal stress directions is required. Such a region is that in the neighbourhood of the discontinuities in a bonded lap joint. A methodology is presented which employs a point wise manipulation of the thermoelastic constants from the material directions to the principal stress directions using full field DIC strain data obtained from the neighbourhood of the discontinuity. A comparison of stress metrics generated from the TSA and DIC data is conducted to provide an independent experimental validation of the 2 D DIC analysis. The accuracy of a 2 D plane strain finite element model representing the joint is assessed against the two experimental data sets. Excellent agreement is found between the experimental and numerical results apart from in the adhesive layer; the adhesive is the only component of the joint where the material properties were not obtained experimentally.

40|$|Originated in 1940 s, fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composites {{are generally}} characterized by combining high strength and high stiffness fibres with relatively weaker matrices. The extraordinary properties of FRP composites of lightweight, high strength-toweight ratio corrosion resistance, potentially high overall durability and tailorability {{enable them to}} be used in areas where the conventional materials might be restricted. Approximately forty years ago, the concept of using bonded FRP composites as a means to maintain aging metallic aircraft was instituted in Australia. And this technique was promoted by research pioneers like Dr. Alan Baker, Dr. Francis Rose, Dr. Rhys Jones and Dr. L. J. Hart-Smith, etc. However, the retrofitting applications of FRP composite in civil infrastructures were much delayed until late 1980 s, when the use of FRP composites for retrofitting concrete structures was initiated in Swinzerland by Urs Meier {{and his colleagues at the}} Swiss Federal Laboratories for Material Testing and Research (EMPA). Nowadays, the use of FRP for retrofitting of concrete structures is becoming more widely accepted in practice. Since last decade, the experiences in USA, the UK, Japan and Switzerland have showed great potential for FRP {{to be used in}} the retrofitting of steel structures. One of the most promising applications is to restore or improve the fatigue performance of steel members by externally attached FRP composites. The carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) seems to perform better in fatigue strengthening with higher elastic modulus comparing to other FRP composites, like glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) or aramid fibre reinforced polymer (AFRP). In the previous studies on the fatigue retrofitting of steel structures, the elastic moduli of adopted CFRP composites are generally lower than 300 GPa. In addition, most CFRP composites were thinner than the corresponding steel adherents, resulting in a relatively lower CFRP stiffness. Therefore, the further improvement in the fatigue performance of retrofitted steel structures relies on the increase of either the elastic modulus or the thickness of CFRP composite. Fortunately, with the development of the FRP manufacturing industry, the mechanical properties of CFRP composites have gained considerable improvement. Unidirectional CFRP sheet with a modulus of 640 GPa and pultruded CFRP plate with a modulus of 460 GPa are now commercially available. The researchers in Civil Engineering Department of Monash University in Melbourne have conducted extensive research on the retrofitting of steel members using the CFRP sheets with a modulus of 640 GPa. The high modulus CFRP sheet shows great potential in improving the fatigue performance of cracked steel members. Comparing to CFRP sheeting system, CFRP plate of 460 GPa has other benefits for fatigue retrofitting like larger thickness, more convenient installation and better quality control. However, there has been no report on its fatigue retrofitting applications in steel structures. In this thesis, the CFRP plate with a modulus of 460 GPa is named ultra high modulus (UHM) CFRP plate. The issues regarding fatigue strengthening of cracked steel members using this UHM CFRP plates are investigated, including (1) the bond behaviour between this UHM CFRP plate and steel under static loading and fatigue loading conditions; (2) fatigue behaviour of non-welded cracked steel plates with UHM CFRP plate strengthening and (3) fatigue behaviour of welded cracked steel connections with UHM CFRP plate strengthening. Experimental, numerical and analytical approaches have been resorted. The first part of the thesis presents the static bond behaviour between this UHM CFRP plate and steel. A series of tests was conducted on the CFRP-steel double strap joints. Experimental results, including bond strength, effective bond length, failure modes, stress and strain distribution along the bond line were reported. Theoretical models were proposed for the prediction of bond strength and effective bond length of CFRP-steel double <b>strap</b> <b>joint.</b> Finite element models were built to simulate the tests. It was found that the failure mode of double <b>strap</b> <b>joint</b> was dependent on the adhesive properties. CFRP delamination and CFRP rupture were observed for specimens with Araldite 420 adhesive, whereas specimens with Sikadur 30 only experienced CFRP delamination. The effective bond lengths of Araldite and Sikadur specimens were 100 ~ 120 mm and 70 ~ 100 mm respectively. The proposed theoretical and finite element models agreed well with the experimental results. The second step of the research is to understand the effect of fatigue loading on the bond between UHM CFRP plate and steel. Similar CFRP-steel double strap joints were prepared and tested under fatigue loading. These joints were tensioned to failure after enduring a pre-set number of fatigue cycles at various load ratios and then compared with those joints subjected to static tension alone. It was found that the same failure mode of CFRP delamination was observed from visual inspection for all specimens. Unexpectedly, limited effects of fatigue loading on the bond between CFRP and steel were identified. Microscopic investigation was conducted and the failure mechanism was explained by a “fatigue damage zone” concept. The third part of the PhD study is to investigate the effectiveness of the UHM CFRP plate on preventing fatigue crack propagation and extending the fatigue life of cracked steel plates. Steel plates with through thickness centre crack were repaired with UHM CFRP plates with various strengthening configurations. The effects of CFRP bond length, bond width, and bond locations were investigated. The experimental results showed that the fatigue crack propagation was largely delayed by the CFRP strengthening. The fatigue life was increased up to 7 times more than un-strengthened steel plates. Finally, it was recommended that it be better to attaché CFRP as close to the crack as possible, so that better strengthening effect can be achieved. Following the experimental study, fracture mechanics was introduced to analyse the stress intensity factor (SIF) of cracked steel plate considering the CFRP reinforcement. A simplified mode I SIF formula was proposed for CFRP strengthened steel plates, which provided a method for quick assessment of CFRP strengthening efficiencies. Finally, a series of fatigue tests were conducted on welded steel joints with CFRP strengthening. The experimental results were compared with those of non-welded CFRP strengthened steel plates. The effects of welding and stress concentration due to the weld attachment on CFRP strengthening effectiveness were investigated. It was found that the strengthening efficiency of UHM CFRP plate was largely decreased due to the welding and attachment. The experimental results suggested that it be better to attaché CFRP on the welding side as close to the crack as possible to achieve longer fatigue life. Based on the experimental, numerical and theoretical studies, recommendations were provided for the application of fatigue strengthening techniques using this UHM CFRP plate. Future research in the fatigue behaviour of composites reinforced steel structures was also identified...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the last}} three decades, many studies have proven the {{effective}} use of CFRP composites in strengthening and retrofitting steel structures. However, {{one of the main}} restrictions to more widespread use of CFRP in strengthening and rehabilitating steel structures has been the uncertainty in the durability of steel /CFRP adhesively-bonded systems. This is especially true when such systems are exposed to outdoor environments. The data reporting this issue in the literature is currently limited and thus a systematic investigation of the effects of outdoor environments are required. The outdoor environments mainly include temperature, moisture and ultraviolet. Temperature is a detrimental factor to the adhesive layer between steel and CFRP because it may reach the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive, leading to a rapid reduction in the bond strength. Moisture, as another aspect of the durability, by diffusion through the adhesive or transport along the oxide/adhesive interface or absorption through the porous adherend, can penetrate to the interfaces between the adhesive and the steel adherend. Once moisture has penetrated into the steel /CFRP systems, degradation can occur due to two types of degradation: the degradation of the adhesive itself, and the degradation of the adhesive/adherend interface. In terms of ultraviolet, although the Earth’s atmosphere filters out most of the total solar radiation, 6 % of the total solar radiant flux is ultraviolet radiation and is able to reach the Earth’s surface. Ultraviolet radiation has a wavelength between 290 and 400 nm, and the energy created by these wavelengths can dissociate the molecule bonds in iv most polymers, leading to the degradation of polymeric materials. The degradation may range from mere surface discoloration to extensive loss of mechanical properties. It should be also mentioned that combining these degrading factors together with loading may cause a significant degradation in mechanical properties of steel /CFRP systems. Double strap joints were chosen to investigate the performance of steel/CFRP composite systems subjected to environmental effects. When a double <b>strap</b> <b>joint</b> is tensioned, the strain in the carbon fibres must develop directly from the bond between the metal and the fibre. In this way, the fundamental behaviour of the metal-fibre bond, including the maximum strength and the effective bond length, can be investigated under static load. In the present research, the first aim was to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on the mechanical characteristics of steel /CFRP double strap joints. It was found that due to elevated temperatures, the joint failure mode changed from cohesion to CFRP and adhesive interface debonding. Effective bond length was found to rapidly increase. Finally, joint strength and stiffness significantly decreased with temperature especially when temperature reached above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive. Based on the ultimate load prediction model developed by Hart-Smith for double lap joints and kinetic modeling of the mechanical degradation of the adhesive, a mechanism-based model is proposed to describe the change of effective bond length, stiffness and strength degradation for steel/CFRP double strap joints at elevated temperatures. In the next part of the research, time factor was taken into account. By applying different load levels, the time-to-failure of the joints was monitored and analyzed. It was found that when temperature was close to or higher than Tg, the joint failure was time dependent. Based on the proposed temperature and time-dependent material property models, the time dependence failure time of steel /CFRP double strap joints was well described. Next, the effects of long term exposure to UV and associated temperatures were investigated. It was shown that UV exposure does not influence the tensile strength of CFRP composites. The tensile strength of the adhesive reduced slightly while modulus showed significant increase after long term exposure. Although the tensile modulus of adhesive exposed to only thermal environment also increased, it is considerably less than that induced by UV exposure. The UV exposure also led to a decrease in joint strength but an increase in stiffness, caused by the temperature effect rather than the UV rays. The next stage of the research investigated the effects of sea water and moisture. It was shown that sea water appeared to reduce the joint strength and stiffness both by 20 % after 1 year of exposure, and the joints exposed to combinations of temperature and humidity in the environmental chamber showed little decrease in joint strength and stiffness after 1000 h of exposure. A model was developed to predict the strength and stiffness degradation of the joints in sea-water and the results compared well with the experimental results. Finally, the effects of sustained load and curing were examined. Itwas found that the effects of sustained load were significant which could catastrophically cause joint failure when it was combined with cyclic temperature and humidity. Elevated curing of the steel /CFRP bonded joint helped to improve the mechanical performance of the joints at elevated temperatures and increased the time-to-failure of the joints. Partial safety factors proposed in design guidelines for FRP composites under environmental effects were used to evaluate the experimental results obtained, suggesting a very critical degradation of joint mechanical properties due to the environmental effects investigated in this study...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{carbon fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) {{have been growing}} in popularity for external strengthening and repairing of deteriorated steel structures. On one hand, compared to traditional strengthening methods such as welding and bolting, CFRP has shown significant advantages such as light weight, high strength, and corrosion resistance. Furthermore, the application process for CFRP is very simple, quick and requires minimal labour. On the other hand, due to the high strength properties of steel and CFRP, failure {{is most likely to}} occur at the bond interface. Therefore, it is vital to study the bond behaviour and the failure mechanism of CFRP strengthened steel structures as well as the factors that play crucial roles in the bond quality. These factors including the material properties, the surface treatment prior bonding or the bond length must be studied before applying in a real structure. The current research program studied the bond behaviour of double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> which were formed by using CFRP to connect two steel plates. Experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of various material properties, bond lengths and surface roughness levels on the bond quality and the failure modes. It was found that there existed an effective bond length for CFRP-to-steel structures; once it was exceeded no improvement in the load carrying capacity could be obtained. This effective bond length varied with material properties, especially the steel grade. It was also found that variations of surface roughness level between 0. 73 μm and 7. 75 μm had no significant effect on the ultimate loading capacity of the specimens. However, the CFRP and the adhesive types played very important roles in the bond strength and the failure modes. Experiments were also conducted to study the fatigue behaviour of double <b>strap</b> <b>joints.</b> These joints were prepared by using strand CFRP with and without primer resin. After the curing process the joints were subject to fatigue tensile loading until failure. The fatigue lives and failure modes were recorded. Results showed that the fatigue lives of the double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> prepared with strand CFRP were comparable to those of specimens strengthened with CFRP plates and other high modulus CFRP sheets. However, a reduction in fatigue life was observed for the samples with primer resin. A cohesion zone finite element model was established to simulate the bond behaviour and to investigate some factors that could affect the load carrying capacity of the joints such as the steel grade. The results obtained from the model were compared with the experimental data in order to verify the cohesion zone model. The results showed an agreement between the experiments and numerical analysis. The cohesion zone was proved to be suitable for predicting the ultimate load of the joints as well as the stress transfer from CFRP-to-steel. It was found that the steel grade had a significant effect on the bond capacity and the effective bond length...|$|R

To clarify the tendency of brassieres to deform, by using the circular stamping method, circular areas of two sample frames were studied as test subjects took up six different postures. The following results were obtained. 1) In sample 1, the areas at the <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> and close {{to the center of the}} back expanded, regardless of the posture. In sample 2, the area of each circle expanded or shrank when a change in posture deformed the skin; and close to the center of the back, the area only became larger regardless of the posture, which is similar to the effect seen in sample 1. Since a brassiere is subject to a remarkable amount of fatigue at the <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> and the center of the back, the fatigue may be attributable to frame configuration factors, including the method used to attach the strap and the small width of the frame close to the center of the back. 2) Anteflexion enlarged the area remarkably at the lower part of a frame. This posture may be a factor that greatly increases frame fatigue. 3) Elevation of the right or left arm showed a tendency to enlarge the area on the elevated side and reduce the area on the opposite side. A sideways rotation showed a tendency to reduce the size of the area on the side of rotation and increase it on the opposite side. However, the distribution of areal changes as a subject moved from a normal standing posture to every one of the other postures did not match the fatigue distribution. These postures therefore have almost no effect on the fatigue distribution...|$|R

40|$|Steel /CFRP double-strap joints adhesive-bonded by epoxy {{were tested}} in tension under {{different}} temperatures ranging between 20 &# 0176;C and 60 &# 0176;C. Effective bond length was experimentally determined at 20 &# 0176;C first. Specimens, varied with the effective, half and twice the effective bond length and with one or three carbon fibre layers, were examined under the specified temperature range. It {{was found that the}} ultimate load and the joint stiffness of all specimens decreased significantly at temperatures near to Tg. Based on the kinetic modeling of glass transition of adhesive, a mechanism-based model was proposed to describe the strength and stiffness degradation of steel/CFRP double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> at elevated temperatures, and the modeling results were validated by the corresponding experimental measurements. In addition, it demonstrated that the effec-tive bond length is increased with temperature...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} effect of surface roughness of different adherend material on adhesive bond strength was carried out. The adherend material used was aluminium AA 6061 and wood in the form of sheet, and the adhesive was an epoxy resin. Different surface roughness obtained by mechanical abrasion using an emery paper and sand paper for aluminium and wood adherend samples respectively. Single <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> were tested at room temperature. Results showed that there is clear dependency observed in between the adhesive bond strength and surface roughness of both wood and aluminium adherend joints. Optimum surface roughness values were obtained in the range of Ra =  1.68  ±  0.14  µm and Ra =  1.64  ±  0.2  µm for the aluminium and wood adherend joints respectively. Surface roughness along with the adhered material parameters should be considered during design stage of adhesively bonded joints.|$|R
40|$|A fast FRP {{strengthening}} {{technique for}} steel structures that employs FRP prepregs (including {{two types of}} CFRP prepregs with different elastic moduli and a GFRP prepreg) and film adhesive is presented. Depending on the curing temperature, with this technique, the entire strengthening process may take only a few hours. The tensile test results of double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> composed of FRP prepregs, film adhesive and two steel plates are presented first. The results indicate that a strong bond can be achieved between FRP and steel. The performance of steel beams strengthened using the technique is also examined for confirmation {{of the effectiveness of}} this technique. Furthermore, the effect of vibratory loads, intended for simulating traffic loads on bridges during the curing period of FRP prepregs and film adhesive, on the behavior of strengthened steel beams is also studied. The presented test results clearly show that this new technique is an attractive and effective method for the rapid strengthening of steel structures.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the failure {{behavior}} of retrofitted steel structures was studied experimentally and theoretically with steel/carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> (DSJs) under quasi-static tensile loading. A series of DSJs with different bonding lengths are also considered and examined to experimentally assess the effective bond length. To predict the failure load {{values of the}} tested specimens, a new stress-based method, namely the point stress (PS) method is proposed. Although some theoretical predictive modelling for the strength between steel/CFRP joints under various loading conditions has been presented, in this work by using the new proposed approach, one can calculate rapidly and conveniently the failure loads of the steel/CFRP specimens. Furthermore, to assess {{the validity of the}} new proposed method, further experimental data on steel/CFRP DSJs available in the open literature are predicted using the PS method. Finally, it was found that a good agreement exists between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions based on the PS method...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{numerical}} simulation of both CFRP/steel double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> with 1 and 3 CFRP layers per side at quasi-static and three dynamic tensile loading speeds of 3. 35, 4. 43 and 5 m/s. Simulations are implemented using both the implicit and explicit codes respectively using non-linear finite element (FE) package ABAQUS. In these analyses, failures of both CFRP sheet and adhesive are considered and a cohesive element is utilised {{to model the}} interface. The developed FE models for both types of joints were validated by comparing their quasi-static and dynamic findings with those obtained from previous experimental program. This comparison includes four different variables such as the ultimate joint strength, effective bond length, failure pattern and strain distribution along the bond length. It was found that FE models proved {{to be able to}} predict all these parameters for both quasi-static and dynamic analyses and their prediction matched well with test results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the mechanical performance of steel/CFRP double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to harsh environments. Seventy-five joint specimens {{were exposed to}} various conditions, including (1) simulated sea-water at 20 °C and 50 °C up to 1 year in a temperature-controlled sea-water tank, (2) constant and (3) cyclic temperatures {{with a high level}} of relative humidity (RH) up to 1000 h in an environmental chamber. Tensile tests were undertaken to determine the mechanical properties of the unexposed and exposed specimens. Significant reductions in joint strength and stiffness were found for the specimens exposed to simulated sea-water after 1 year of exposure, while the specimens exposed to combinations of temperature and humidity in the environmental chamber showed little decrease in joint strength and stiffness after 1000 h of exposure. A model was developed to predict the strength and stiffness degradation of the joints in sea-water and the results compared well with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on static bond behaviour between CFRP and steel. However, very limited research is available on the effect of fatigue loading on the bond behaviour between CFRP and steel. This paper attempts to fill the knowledge gap in this area. A series of static and fatigue tests on UHM (ultra high modulus) CFRP plate and steel plate double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> were conducted. Five specimens were tensioned to failure under static loading as control specimens. The other 12 specimens were tested under fatigue loading with load ratios ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 6 (defined as the ratio of the maximum fatigue load to the average static bond strength of control specimens). After going through pre-set number of fatigue cycles, the specimens were tensioned to failure under static loading. The failure modes, residual bond strength and residual bond stiffness of such specimens were compared with those of control specimens, to facilitate the investigation of the effect of fatigue loading on the bond behaviour. Microscopic investigation was also performed to reveal the underlying failure mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the environmentally assisted {{degradation of the}} bond between steel and carbon fiber–reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites through analysis of the mechanical performance of loaded and unloaded steel/CFRP double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> exposed to various harsh environments such as elevated temperatures, seawater, cyclic temperature and humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It was found that both joint stiffness and strength significantly decreased by up to 80 % when tested at elevated temperatures near {{to or greater than}} Tg of the adhesive used. The mechanical properties reduced by about 20 % when exposed to seawater for up to 1 year. Although no significant reduction in stiffness and strength were found when the unloaded joints were exposed to cyclic temperature between 20 and 50 °C with the added presence of humidity, the loaded joints catastrophically failed during the exposure, showing that the combination of load, temperature, and moisture was the most critical scenario. In addition, UV exposure also led to a decrease in strength but an increase in stiffness for the unloaded joints, caused by the postcuring with the heat supplied by the UV rays...|$|R
40|$|Degradation of {{structural}} adhesives at elevated temperatures makes the time-dependent behaviour of adhesively-bonded steel/CFRP joints {{a critical issue}} for safety considerations of CFRP strengthened steel structures. This paper reports the examination of specimens at different load levels (i. e. 80 %, 50 %, and 20 % of their ultimate load measured at room temperature) and constant temperatures from 35 °C to 50 °C (i. e. temperatures below and above the glass transition temperature Tg, 42 °C of the adhesive). Furthermore, a scenario of cyclic thermal loading between 20 °C and 50 °C was included to represent more realistic exposure. Joint time-dependent behaviour was demonstrated by the stiffness and strength degradation {{as a function of}} not only temperature but also time. At the same temperature level close to or above Tg, a higher load level corresponded to a shorter time-to-failure. In addition, up to 47 % of strength recovery was found for the specimens subjected to cyclic temperatures compared with those under constant 50 °C which failed at the same load level. Based on the proposed temperature and time-dependent material property models, the time-dependent failure time of steel/CFRP double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> was well described and validated by the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{application}} of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite {{materials in the}} strengthening of existing reinforced concrete structures has gained widespread attention, but the retrofitting of metallic buildings and bridges with CFRP {{is still in its}} early stages. In real life, these structures are possibly subjected to dry and hot climate. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the bond behavior between CFRP and steel at different temperatures. To examine the bond between CFRP and steel under hot climate, a total of twenty-one double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> divided into 7 groups were tested to failure at constant temperatures from 27 °C to 120 °C in this paper. The results showed that the joint failure mode changed from debonding along between steel and adhesive interface failure to debonding along between CFRP and adhesive interface failure as the temperature increased beyond the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive. The load carrying capacity decreased significantly at temperatures approaching or exceeding Tg. The interfacial fracture energy showed a similar degradation trend. Analytical models of the ultimate bearing capacity, interfacial fracture energy, and bond-slip relationship of CFRP-steel interface at elevated temperatures were presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} curing conditions {{on the performance of}} steel/CFRP double <b>strap</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to combined loading, cyclic temperature and humidity. A series of joints, cured respectively at an elevated temperature (120 degrees C) and room temperature (about 23 degrees C) were exposed to different combined environmental and loading conditions. It was found that curing at an elevated temperature had no effects on the joint ultimate strength tested at room temperature. However, at 50 degrees C, the joints cured at 120 degrees C showed almost no strength reduction, in comparison to those cured at room temperature with a 50 % strength reduction. Curing at elevated temperature also helped to improve the time-to-failure of joints: joints cured at room temperature failed within less than 2 h when exposed to the environmental conditions, while joints cured at 120 degrees C could survive up to 270 h, dependent on the applied load levels. Partial safety factors proposed in design guidelines for FRP composites under environmental effects were used to evaluate the experimental results obtained, suggesting a very critical degradation of joint mechanical properties due to the environmental effects investigated in this study...|$|R
