It was composed of six major-generals--Greene, Stirling, St. Clair, Lafayette, R. Howe, and Steuben; and eight brigadiers--Parsons, Jas. Clinton, Knox, Glover, Paterson, Hand, Huntingdon, and Stark.

50|$|Modern {{theatrical}} systems use optical {{representations of}} digitally encoded multi-channel sound.

50|$|Inside the STM were {{a series}} of gears that caused the drums to rotate and index {{independently}} to new messages (there were up to twenty four messages on a drum, twelve each in two groups), new hours and new minutes.

5000|$|Optical sound {{constitutes}} the recording and reading of amplitude {{based on the}} amount of light that is projected through a soundtrack area on a film using an illuminating light or laser and a photocell or photodiode. As the photocell picks up the light in varying intensities, the electricity produced is intensified by an amplifier, which in turn powers a loudspeaker, where the electrical impulses are turned into air vibrations and thus, sound waves. In 16 mm, this optical soundtrack is a single mono track placed {{on the right side of}} the projected image, and the <b>sound</b> <b>head</b> is 26 frames after the gate. In 35 mm, this can be mono or stereo, on the left side of the projected image, with the <b>sound</b> <b>head</b> 21 frames after the gate [...]|$|E

Several hours of depth charging accomplished nothing, but while running the patterns, the ship struck an underwater object (possibly a U-boat) destroying the ship's sonar soundhead.

50|$|While {{working at}} the Disney studio, Stalling invented a tick system which helped {{synchronize}} music to visuals. This system was a forerunner to the click track, a method which would become a standard process used in both live-action and animated films. An early example of a click track {{was used in the}} production of The Skeleton Dance (1929). The method used in this film involved a reel of unexposed film with holes punched out to make clicks and pops when run on the <b>sound</b> <b>head.</b> According to Neil Strauss, this version of the click track is credited to sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald.|$|E

50|$|The Case Research Lab {{then set}} about to perfect {{the system of}} sound film they had {{provided}} DeForest, now that DeForest was {{no longer able to}} inhibit their development of this new technology. One of the first things Case did was to change the location of the <b>sound</b> <b>head</b> on a sound-film projector from being above the picture head (as had been the Phonofilm standard) to below the picture head. According to Sponable, there were three reasons for this change: to accommodate a large flywheel in the soundhead, to simplify the design of the printer (which printed the picture and soundtrack in two separate passes) and to prevent films made to the Phonofilm standard being played on Case equipment. Case chose a separation of 20 frames between the sound and the picture frame to which it relates, this standard was adopted by all subsequent sound-on-film systems and still applies to this day.|$|E
50|$|Dolby Digital data {{is printed}} in the spaces between the {{perforations}} on the soundtrack side of the film, 26 frames before the picture. Release prints with Dolby Digital always include an analog Dolby Stereo soundtrack with Dolby SR noise reduction, thus these prints are known as Dolby SR-D prints. Dolby Digital produces 6 discrete channels. In a variant called SR-D EX, {{the left and right}} surround channels can be dematrixed into left, right, and back surround, using a matrix system similar to Dolby Pro Logic. The audio data in a Dolby Digital track is compressed in the 16-bit AC-3 compression scheme at a ratio of about 12:1. The images between each perforation are read by a CCD located either above the projector or in the regular analog <b>sound</b> <b>head</b> below the film gate, a digital delay within the processor allowing correct lip-sync to be achieved regardless of the position of the reader relative to the picture gate. The information is then decoded, decompressed and converted to analog; this can happen either in a separate Dolby Digital processor that feeds signals to the cinema sound processor, or digital decoding can be built into the cinema processor.One disadvantage of this system is if the digital printing is not entirely within the space between the sprocket holes;if the track was off a bit on either the top or the bottom,the sound track would be unplayable,and a replacement reel would have to be ordered.|$|E
5000|$|Film stock {{consists}} of transparent celluloid, acetate, or polyester base coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate {{was the first}} type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the film format for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as 35 mm prints.Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked cameras and projectors; though 1000 frames per minute (16‚Öî frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown). When sound film {{was introduced in the}} late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the <b>sound</b> <b>head.</b> 24 frames per second were chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality. Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras - allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design - allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large [...] "blimps" [...] to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated filmstocks and lenses, allowing directors to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.|$|E
