5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside the window to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells {{her that he had}} seen Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} {{being considered}} for the position included National League president Ford Frick, Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 {{to vote for a}} new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E
25|$|After {{the attack}} was over, Richards, who was trained as a medical doctor, went back to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> besides himself had survived, and he found Taylor lying on the floor. Richards dragged Taylor into the prison cell (they had not been held in the cell, but in the guard's room across the hallway). Richards dragged Taylor under some of the straw {{mattress}} {{to put pressure on}} his wounds and slow the bleeding and then went to get help. Both Richards and Taylor survived. Taylor eventually became the third president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Richards had escaped all harm except for a bullet grazing his ear.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, recruiters use large job boards, niche job boards, as well {{as social}} and {{business}} networking to locate these individuals. The immediate goal of Internet recruiting is to find individuals that a recruiter or company can present to hiring managers for the purpose of employment. Quite often, Internet recruiters have very short-term goals when it comes to recruiting online. The general catalyst that sparks this process is when a new job requisite comes in (called a REQ). The recruiter scans his or her database to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone's</b> resumes match the requirements. If not, they proceed to search on the Internet.|$|R

[...] He is highly ambitious, saying: [...] "I won't be happy until I'm up there, receiving the Nobel Prize."

500|$|The {{music video}} starts with Usher waking up inside an empty nightclub. He {{calls out to}} <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> is there and sees Hilson, whom he follows into {{a room full of}} people dancing as a disc jockey starts playing music. Usher chases Hilson around the club, who at times mysteriously vanishes. The two dance intimately {{throughout}} the video at the club's bar, dance floor and lounge. Its choreography was likened to Janet Jackson's [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] routine. The video concludes with the club burning down and Usher waking up in a valley. The storyline is continued in the [...] "Moving Mountains" [...] clip. During the video Usher is shown using a Sony Ericsson W350i Walkman, as part of Usher's endorsement of the company.|$|E
500|$|One of Paul's main storylines {{culminated in}} him having his leg amputated after an accident. The storyline has {{received}} some criticism as Paul was shown on different occasions not limping with his false leg. Dennis explained {{during an interview}} how the production team helped ensure to make his limp appear more effectively, stating [...] "They made me a splint which actually makes me sort of limp, but keeps my foot rigid {{so it looks like}} I actually do have a non-moving piece. One time I did change my leg, as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> noticed." [...] Dennis revealed in May 2011, that he wears a brace on his leg as remembering which leg to limp on was becoming a [...] "little distracting." ...|$|E

50|$|After {{everything}} {{is said and}} done, I'm almost glad Dead Silence happened, because it gave me an extreme, coal-face lesson in what not to do. It was like learning to swim by leaping off Niagara Falls. I only write scripts on spec now, which means that I write them in my own time without getting paid and then take them {{out into the world}} to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone's</b> interested. Never again will I enter the arranged marriage of selling a pitch. I have also become very gun-shy about working with studios. In the world of independent film, what you write ends up on screen. Plus, they don't have the money to bring in script doctors! Works fine for me. Who knows, maybe one day I will work with a studio again...|$|R
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with the 1989 abolition of pledging, ΖΒΤ National instituted the S.B.R.V. (Semi-Annual Brotherhood Review Vote). All ΖΒΤ chapters twice a year (once a semester) have a vote to <b>see</b> who, <b>if</b> <b>anyone,</b> should be removed from membership within a chapter. The ballots are counted {{by the president and}} an executive member of his choice. The criteria for voting during the SBRV are the Chapter Standards, which all chapters must make known to their membership. If a brother receives a simple majority of Nay votes, he is expelled from the fraternity.|$|R
500|$|The vocal {{tracks were}} taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991. This {{was the first}} time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was {{involved}} in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, [...] "We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top." [...] On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: [...] "Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung".|$|E

2500|$|Smart {{phones and}} social {{networking}} services {{enable us to}} stay connected continuously with people around us or far away from us, which however is sometimes the root of our anxiety in social life. The eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> shared new things are typical [...] "symptoms" [...] of this anxiety called FoMO. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and life satisfaction.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "We ducked behind a ticket counter but I stood up and watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting." [...] Lastly he said [...] "He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket.

2500|$|StankDawg lurked in {{the shadows}} of the hacking world for many years {{throughout}} college under many different pseudonyms. [...] In 1997 he popped his head out into the public and began becoming more active on IRC and many smaller hacking forums. [...] He saw some people who he thought were insanely brilliant individuals who seemed to have the same mindset and positive attitude towards hacking that he did so he decided to approach a couple of them to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> would be interested in forming a group and working together. [...] There was always a huge emphasis not only on technical competence and variety, but also on strength of character and integrity. [...] The team was a mix of hackers, programmers, phone phreakers, security professionals, and artists. [...] They had experience in multiple programming languages and operating systems.

2500|$|Facing {{the housing}} scandals, as the {{chairperson}} of the Housing Authority, Wong vowed to grasp the opportunity to reform the bureaucratic and corrupted Housing Department. However, she quickly became the target to be blamed by the public opinions. Many civil groups representing residents of the public housing estates reproached Wong for being incompetent to supervise the housing constructions and they demanded her and the Director of Housing, Tony Miller to step down. In June 2000, Secretary for Housing, Dominic S. W. Wong appointed Director of Intellectual Property, Stephen R. Selby {{as the chairman of}} the Investigation Panel on Staff Discipline in the Yuen Chau Kok and Tin Chung Court Incidents to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> was derelict in the whole scandal. Apart from the pressure from the government, Democratic Party's legislator Fred Li moved a motion of no confidence on both Rosanna Wong and Tony Miller in the Legislative Council on 9 June. Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa later paid a special visit to the Legislative Council on 23 June and addressed to the Council Meeting. He hoped the legislators to vote against the motion of no confidence, claiming that if [...] "both of them leave one after another, an administrative and legal vacuum would be created at the top level of the Government".|$|E
5000|$|Hurlbut {{left the}} Pennsylvania {{homestead}} and went West {{to spend a}} short time in Eaton County, Michigan, but soon returned East to study law at Lodi, in Seneca County, New York, where he opened a law office and married Catherine Chandler in 1840. In 1842 he began studying law with David Wilmot in Towanda, Pennsylvania., and {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1847. He lost his home to foreclosure, so in 1848 he moved his family to Mason, Ingham County, Michigan. There he practiced law, was Postmaster, District Attorney, and judge advocate for the Michigan Militia. In April, 1850 he began an immigration to California, stopping in Milwaukee and then in Waukesha where his brother James and family were living. While visiting his brother he visited Oconomowoc and said, [...] "That settled me. I thought it the most enchanting spot I had ever <b>seen.</b> <b>If</b> <b>anyone</b> could make a living there I could, I thought, and there I made my home and the California trip was abandoned." [...] He began practicing law and was appointed attorney for the Milwaukee and Watertown Plankroad Company. It was in 1854 that his community position and influence gave him voice to call for a convention and name the Republican Party in the Madison, Wisconsin, in July, 1854.|$|R

Late in the evening, getting a bit desperate, he tries to tattoo Lydia to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone's</b> face shows up. While he is waiting, Becky reports in to him on her progress with pushing Claire and isolating her in an effort to bring her into the family. Finally, the ink settles and (although it is not revealed on screen, it is implied that) Sylar's face appears. As Sylar (in his amnesiac state) runs from the police, he stumbles upon the entrance to the [...] "Sullivan Bros. Carnival" [...] where Samuel is holding out his arm welcoming him into the family.

The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually.

He then retraced his steps and was just crossing the threshold when he saw something at his feet sparkling in the moonlight. He picked it up, and discovered it to be a gold watch shining with precious stones. He gazed up and down the street to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> there was <b>anyone</b> about to whom it might belong, but there was not a creature visible. So he put it in his sash, by the side of a silver watch which he had bought from the Jew that morning.|$|R

The Princess helps to pick thistles which cannot bear to hurt so gentle of hands as hers.

The Princess tells her that she is in a similar situation. It turns out that the beautiful girl is the witch’s daughter, Anemone, who is in love with the Princess’ brother, Hyacinth.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{episode is}} {{approximately}} 25 minutes long. Most {{of the stories}} are centered on Clandestino doing or plotting something that will either destroy Bluffoonia's last forest or otherwise disrupt the Bluffers' lives, and the Bluffers' attempts to thwart him. Some of the stories are centered on the Bluffers' plans to steal Clandestino's [...] "Secret of Getting It All" [...] so they {{can use it to}} remove him from power. This secret, which plays a major part in most episodes, is never successfully stolen or even revealed throughout the series. The closest of it seen is the door to the secret, locked and vaulted with chains, a skull and stylish lights around its frame. Only Clandestino is allowed to <b>see</b> it, and <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> tries and dares, even by his servants, are to be killed. That's why he always carries to keys to the locks of the door. In the final episode of the entire series, whilst digging his courtyard with his machines for minerals, ended up disrupting the moat, thus causing the entire castle to be flooded, and the lower parts sunk, taking the secret with it, despite his futile attempts of rescuing it.|$|R
