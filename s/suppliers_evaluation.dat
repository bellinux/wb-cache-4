40|$|Rapidly {{changing}} business environment, increasing and fluctuating customer demand, {{the recent}} development and employment of technology are crucial reasons {{for companies to}} strive for better quality, shorter lead time and lower costs. The <b>supplier</b> <b>evaluation</b> and selection process is an increasingly important activity in the supply chain {{in order to enhance}} the company’s competitiveness by reducing the costs and simultaneously maintaining the same quality of products. The focus of this thesis is on the <b>supplier</b> <b>evaluation</b> and selection process for public procurement in Swedish electricity industry. Specifically, the work combines the literature and the empirical findings gathered from the case company Växjö Energy (VEAB) to develop a <b>supplier</b> <b>evaluation</b> and selection process for the public procurement in Swedish electricity industry. It was concluded that the <b>supplier</b> <b>evaluation</b> and selection process for public procurement has basically four steps. The steps are 1. Identifying the needs and the sourcing method; 2.

40|$|Abstract: The coal <b>suppliers</b> <b>evaluation</b> and {{selection}} is significant for thermal power plants {{to reduce the}} cost of power generation and enhance market competitiveness. After analyzing the limitations of the existing multiple criteria decision methods, a method for coal suppliers selection is developed by integrating analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and preference ranking organization methods for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE). In the process of actual evaluation, satisfaction of alternatives is the same but index value of various alternatives is different. In order to solve this problem the paper puts forward a data preprocessing method. AHP is used to analyze the structure of coal supplier selection and determine weights for evaluation criteria, and PROMETHEE is used for final raking. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{critical}} {{supply management}} problem {{is how to}} increase supply chain performance. Traditionally, <b>supplier</b> <b>evaluations</b> generated a score {{that may or may}} not have led to corrective actions. This presentation introduces a <b>supplier</b> <b>evaluation</b> and process improvement program (SE&PIP) that can weld a supply chain into a cohesive, competitive, and cost effective strategic system that maximizes value.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} years the {{relationships}} between industrial companies have dramatically evolved, the objective being {{the improvement of the}} internal management of each of the partner companies and of their global performance in meeting the requirements of the customers. The control of the relationship between partner companies concerns all the actions they develop together to achieve their common objectives and to react at the right time to any failure of one of the partners. A negotiation between the partners is thus required, and this approach involves the management and organization of each partner’s production. The client companies will have to optimize at the same time both their production and their relationships with their suppliers. The suppliers will have to position themselves in reply to the calls for proposals emitted by client companies and demonstrate their capacity to support these companies while using their own assets. This paper aims at improving the control of the customer - supplier relationship by proposing an organization of all the partners called &# 34;self organized logistic network&# 34;. In this network, each supplier can evaluate his performance using a multicriteria decision aid method. The objective of the <b>suppliers</b> <b>evaluation</b> process is threefold to select the reliable supplier who delivers low-cost products or services that meet the customers’ requirements, to ensure that the suppliers with whom the company operates are reliable and satisfy the needs of the client company in terms of quality, quantity, delivery times, etc, and also to dynamically monitor the relationship between the supplier and the customer...|$|E

40|$|Supplier Development (SD) {{includes}} efforts {{undertaken by}} firms {{to improve their}} suppliers’ capabilities and performance. It has {{emerged as one of}} the leading business practices in the past few years. Development of supplier’s quality is an important part of these programs. Supplier Quality Development Programs (SQDPs) are strategic quality development activities for increasing quality, reliability and efficiency of <b>suppliers.</b> <b>Evaluation</b> and selection of appropriate SQDPs to improve quality of supply chain is target of most companies, but results of these evaluations cannot be validated without ensuring credibility of a set of criteria. These criteria are factors that ensure success of SQD activities and used for ranking these efforts. In this thesis, we propose a multi-criteria framework for Supplier Quality Development integrating DMAIC principles. In the Define phase, we identify criteria for SQD using systematic review of literature and industrial practices. In the Measure phase, we conduct a survey study with supply chain quality experts to measure the importance of SQD criteria. In the Analyze phase, we classify the SQD criteria into three groups using Kano’s model by analyzing them from the perspective of fulfilling basic needs, performance needs, and delighters/exciters. To examine the relationship between various SQD criteria, we apply Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique. In the improve phase, we apply the selected criteria to evaluate various Supplier Quality Development Programs using Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) technique called TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and select the best one. In the control phase, we suggest audits for ensuring the criteria used for evaluation are up-to-date with the latest practices. The strength of the proposed work is a comprehensive investigation of SQD criteria using knowledge from quality experts, literature review and industrial practice and suggestion of a practical multi-criteria analysis framework for evaluation and selection of appropriate SQDPs. ...|$|E

Due the growing legislation related with food safety and due to the consumers growing needs the food industry is implementing systems to control food safety hazards, using, most of the times, the certification of their quality management and safety systems. The implementation of the ISO 22000 : 2005 Food safety management systems – Requirements for any organization in the food chain is based in interactive communication, in HACCP principles and in prerequisite programs. As a result the products are safe to the consumer when prepared and consumed according to their intended use. Although there are other references, unlike the others, ISO 22000 does not include an exhaustive list of good practices. In the case of ISO 22000 the good practices are defined by the organization. Among the several advantages of ISO 22000 : 2005 implementation, it can be mention the resources optimization, the improvement in documentation, a more efficient hazards control in food safety, the application focused in final results and the international recognition and trust created among the other actors in the food chain as a result of its ability to identify and control food safety hazards This paper is about the implementation of ISO 22000 : 2005 in Kilom, SA and its main purpose was to describe some phases with the focus on the prerequisite programs of suppliers and raw materials control, drinking water control, monitoring and measuring equipments control, validate the food safety control measures and hazard analysis of raw materials.. To validate food safety control measures, analyzes were done to the maintenance of temperature during the transport, to the elimination of microbial load in the heat treatments and to products cooling time after their processing. After the <b>suppliers</b> <b>evaluation</b> it can be concluded that 89 % of suppliers are reasonable and only 19 % can be classified as good. Regarding the monitoring of drinking water it was verified that the system is under control and only presents deviations when a breakdown occurs. The control of the monitoring and measuring equipments showed that each device is according to legal and internal requirements. Validate food safety control measures reveals that they fulfill their function of controlling the inherent danger. Finally the analysis to raw materials dangers allowed defining the control measures for each raw material. It was verified that the biological and physical dangers are controlled inside the unity, but the chemical and allergens dangers are controlled only by the selection and evaluation of the suppliers.
