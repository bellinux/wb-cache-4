Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of <b>Smart</b> <b>House,</b> however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize {{when it comes to this}} set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do it for you, that doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E

40|$|Various {{definitions}} of <b>smart</b> <b>houses</b> may exist {{but they have}} a common characteristic; through linking various modules components, electric appliances, technologies and sensors, <b>smart</b> <b>houses</b> aim to offer an innovative integrated solution to provide a level of smartness that has not existed in traditional <b>houses.</b> In <b>smart</b> <b>houses,</b> since various components, technologies and products have to be linked, standards become a critically important issue. At present, in Japan, Europe and the USA, 3 de jure standards related to <b>smart</b> <b>houses</b> exist, ECHONET-Lite, KNX and SEP. In this paper, an analysis is made of the technology and standardization strategies regarding ECHONETin Japan and a comparison is made with KNX. Eleven interviews with the main actors related to the ECHONET-Lite consortium and KNX were conducted. Three research questions were set; What are the technology strategy related concerns of the main actors related to ECHONET? What are the issues related to the diffusion of <b>smart</b> <b>houses?</b> What are the underlying strengths, weaknesses of ECHONET compared with KNX? The analyses showed that the strategies of the various actors towards the diffusion of <b>smart</b> <b>houses</b> were different, based on their different perspectives, visions and competences. A comparison between Japan with the European case highlighted the different standardization strategies and areas of focus. The main bottlenecks towards the diffusion of <b>smart</b> <b>houses</b> were identified.

40|$|The {{recent decades}} have {{witnessed}} the widespread manifestation of intelligent building design development around the world. Meanwhile, the concept of <b>smart</b> <b>housing</b> as one of the main issues of intelligent building design development has stimulated various architects and designers to make use of it for the sake of sustainable housing. However, this study represents a gap in <b>smart</b> <b>housing</b> design owing to the lack of a deep consideration on cultural values of users for ensuring the socio-cultural sustainability as one of the objectives of sustainable <b>smart</b> <b>housing</b> designs. Accordingly, the study puts forward the concept of local-smart-housing through utilization of appropriate vernacular architectural features and cultural values of vernacular settlements in <b>smart</b> <b>housing</b> design in order to reinforce the sociocultural sustainability. Meanwhile, this study is limited to the Malay context in order to identify the vernacular features of Malay vernacular settlement’s functional spaces for utilization in <b>smart</b> <b>housing</b> design to make them culturally responsive. Correspondingly, this study proposes the concept of local-smart-housing based on the incorporation of intelligent building design and utilization of vernacular features for enhancing {{the quality of life for}} users...|$|R

There are many different sensors, actuators and other devices which can be accessed through internet and are able to send, receive and process data. Today we can realize many different IoT scenarios on the field of <b>smart</b> <b>houses,</b> cities, factories, etc. but we face with different challenges when implementing such systems. One of these challenges is connecting different things of internet of things between each other. Devices use different communication protocols and standards therefore devices that we buy can't connect and communicate with each other.

40|$|Summary. Treating homes, {{offices and}} {{commercial}} buildings as intelligently networked collaborations {{can contribute to}} enhancing the efficient use of energy. When <b>smart</b> <b>houses</b> are able to communicate, interact and negotiate with both customers and energy devices in the local grid, the energy consumption can be better adapted to the available energy supply, especially when the proportion of variable renewable generation is high. Several efforts focus on integrating the <b>smart</b> <b>houses</b> and the emerging smart grids. We consider that a highly heterogeneous infrastructure will be in place and no one-size-fits-all solution will prevail. Therefore, we present here our efforts focusing not only on designing a framework that will enable the gluing of various approaches via a service-enabled architecture, but also discuss on the trials of these.
