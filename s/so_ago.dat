The Akha believed that only animals could give birth {{to more than one}} offspring and therefore considered twins as beasts. Up until about 20 years or <b>so</b> <b>ago,</b> they would have been killed immediately. According to Laos locals, the practice is still common although the government is trying to discourage it.

In contrast, solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive. Such applications include solar lamps, water pumps, parking meters, emergency telephones, trash compactors, temporary traffic signs, charging stations, and remote guard posts and signals.|$|E
