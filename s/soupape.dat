40|$|Un code numérique de {{simulation}} des distributions équipées de poussoirs hydrauliques a été développé. Le code est basé sur trois sous-modèles couplés : mécanique, hydraulique et physique. Le premier étudie la distribution comme un assemblage masses ressorts, le deuxième étudie le poussoir comme un organe hydraulique à part entière et le dernier permet d'étudier l'aération de l'huile et en particulier les phénomènes de dissolution. Une validation expérimentale a été menée sur un banc culasse alimenté par une huile mélangée à de l'air en proportions mesurées. L'instrumentation permettait de mesurer l'accélération de la tête de <b>soupape,</b> son déplacement au voisinage du siège et la force entre poussoir et <b>soupape.</b> Cette validation a montré que la simulation reflétait bien la réalité, notamment {{en ce qui concerne}} les effets de l'aération. A {{model of}} valvetrain {{equipped with a}} direct acting hydraulic lash adjuster (HLA) is presented. As it is the cause of many problems, a possible aeration is taken into account. The main model is made of three submodels: 1. The first one is a mechanical one with masses, springs and dampers and needs the cam laws and the pressure of the chamber of the HLA as data. 2. The second submodel is an hydraulic one. It studies the HLA chamber through the check valve flows, the leakage flow and the mechanical strains on the chamber oil. This submodel gives the chamber pressure to the first submodel. 3. The third submodel is a physical one and evaluates the instantaneous amount of air present in the chamber oil. It takes into account the arrival of new bubbles through the check valve and the mass exchanges (diffusion, dissolution) between the bubbles and the oil bulk. This amount of air has a direct influence on the chamber pressure calculation made in the second submodel. Experimental validation of the model was conducted on an engine head. This engine head was feeded by an oil circuit in which the aeration could be controlled. Air was injected under pressure and oil aeration was measured in the HLA oil supply by an original sensor, the SMAC. Three sensors were placed in the valvetrain: 1. Acceleration on the valve head 2. Proximity on the valve seat 3. Force between valve and HLAThe model correctly predicted measurements on the valve train. The mechanical modelling and the experiments show and explain the problems of valvetrains when air is present in the HLA. The hydraulic modelling allows {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of the HLA and especially of the check valve. The physical modelling and the experiments prove that the aeration in the HLA chamber is not only influenced by the aeration in the circuit and indicated some ways of controlling aeration...|$|E
40|$|L'objectif du projet GSM Moteur de Synthèse à Allumage Commandéest de concevoir un moteur fonctionnant en mélange pauvre à la fois dépollué et économe. La première phase analyse finement sur moteur monocylindre les {{interactions}} entre l'aérodynamique et la combustion qui déterminent l'aptitude au fonctionnement en mélange pauvre ou dilué. La procédure employée présente la particularité d'associer des outils complémentaires tels que code de calcul tridimensionnel, diagnostics optiques (anémométrie laser et ombroscopie) et mesures classiques sur banc monocylindre. La modélisation tridimensionnelle est utilisée comme moyen efficace de sélection et de prédiction de l'aérodynamique interne. Les paramètres les plus influents sur la stabilité de l'initiation de la combustion sont la direction et l'intensité de la vitesse au point d'allumage et le niveau de turbulence. Le meilleur compromis favorable au fonctionnement en mélange pauvre est constitué par une culasse possédant une chambre de combustion en toit avec une seule <b>soupape</b> d'admission. Son aérodynamique interne est caractérisée par la combinaison d'un mouvement de rotation d'axe vertical (swirl) avec un tourbillon d'axe horizontal balayant l'arête du toit (tumble). Son niveau de turbulence est ajusté de manière à accroître la vitesse de combustion en limitant les instabilités cycle-à-cycle. La deuxième phase est consacrée à la transposition de cette solution sur un moteur multicylindre. Les principales difficultés rencontrées sont liées aux disparités de comportement entre cylindres accentuées par le fonctionnement en mélange pauvre. Seul un contrôle individuel des paramètres de combustion de chaque cylindre (avance, injection, richesse) associé à un écartement d'électrodes de bougie accru {{permet de}} re-trouver des résultats proches de ceux acquis sur monocylindre. Dans ces conditions, les limites pauvres se situent à des richesses comprises entre 0, 60 et 0, 70 suivant la charge et le régime. La diminution des émissions d'oxydes d'azote qui en résulte atteint en moyenne sur des points représentatifs du cycle ECE 15 74 % par rapport au fonctionnement à la stoechiométrie. Enfin, des essais avec recyclage des gaz d'échappement ont démontré le potentiel de la solution optimisée d'un point de vue aérodynamique à tout mode de fonctionnement en mélange dilué. The constraints {{that must be}} accounted for inbuilding a new engine are increasing. It is necessary to contend with user demands for performance, while improving efficiency, limiting pollutant emissions and reducing knock sensitivity. Given the number of parameters {{to be taken into}} account, the response to these demands would require large investments in time and resources if conventional development methods (which usually follow an empirical approach) were applied. The purpose of this research supported by Groupement Scientifique Moteur (GSM) was to design a lean-burn sparkignition engine with the object of reducing pollutant emissions and fuel consumption. We try to develop a promising new approach that follows a scientific methodology based in particular on the use of predictive computer codes. The objective of this project is to design an engine that runs on a lean or possibly dilute mixture that will meet European pollution regulations. This lean-burn solution, combined with oxidation catalysis, is considered as an alternative to threeway catalysis, which imposes operation at stoichiometry. The original configuration is a 4 -valve engine. One of the advantages this engine offers is great flexibility in changing the inlet conditions. This provides a way of optimizing internal fluid motion, which {{turns out to be a}} determining factor in the ability to operate with a lean or dilute mixture. The operation of an engine with a lean or dilute mixture results in substantially reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, virtually eliminating carbon dioxide (CO) emissions, and in lower specific fuel consumption. On the other hand, unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) emissions generally increase, which implies the use of an oxidation catalyst if the antipollution standards become too severe. The first phase was to analyze the interactions between fluid dynamics and combustion, which determine the capability of this engine to run with a lean or dilute mixture. The methodology relies on complementary means :(a) Three-dimensional computer code (KIVA). (b) Optical diagnostics (Laser Doppler Velocimetry). (c) Single-cylinder engine equipped with conventional measurement systems. Three dimensional modeling is used to predict and to optimize fluid motion in the cylinder for different intake configurations. The most important parameters influencing the stability of initial combustion are found to be the direction and magnitude of the mean velocity at the spark location, and the turbulence level. We should note that this flow field optimization is also applicable for operation with any dilute mixture (diluted by exhaust gases for example). The question of the minimization of the cyclic variability remains. The most favorable configuration for lean-burn operation was a pent-roof combustion chamber with a single operating intake valve. Fluid motion in this engine is characterized by the combination of a swirling and a tumbling motion and can be described as an inclined tumble. This motion leads to a flow at the spark plug location directed along the edge of the cylinder head. Moreover, the turbulence level is optimal for a high burning rate and low cycleto-cycle instability. The second phase was to apply this solution to a multicylinder system. The main difficulties came from the variability between cylinders, which was amplified during lean-burn operation. Each cylinder must be independently controlled (spark timing, sequential injection, fuel-air ratio, etc.). Moreover, an increased spark gap is needed in order to reproduce the performance (i. e. efficiency) obtained with the single-cylinder. For these conditions, the minimum fuelair equivalence ratio is between 0. 60 and 0. 70, depending on the engine load and speed. Nitrogen oxide emissions are then reduced from about 74 % on the average (compared with stoichiometric emissions) at several selected running conditions representative of the ECE 15 cycle. Finally, the optimized solution was proven to be capable of accommodating any dilute mixture. This was demonstrated via tests using exhaust gases for dilution...|$|E
5000|$|When Panhard {{presented}} their 1931 line-up at the Paris Motor Show in October 1930, their last two four cylinder models had been withdrawn, {{along with the}} 10CV 6-cylider Type X59. [...] Instead they concentrated on their [...] "S-series" [...] cars, designated [...] "Panhard CS" [...] and [...] "Panhard DS" [...] according to engine size, and introduced a year earlier. [...] Publicity of the time indicated the [...] "S" [...] stood for [...] "Voitures surbaissées" [...] (cars having an [...] "underslung" [...] chassis,) but, clearly captivated {{by the power of}} alliteration, added that [...] "S" [...] also indicated cars that were [...] "...souples, supérieures, stables, spacieuses, silencieuses, sans <b>soupapes</b> (ie using valveless cylinders)...". [...] Four of the five Panhards exhibited featured increasingly lavish and pricey 6-cylinder engined cars, their engine sizes ranging from 2.35-litres to 3.5-litres.

5000|$|The Renault 19 16S hot hatch (16V in some countries), {{added to}} the lineup {{in the autumn of}} 1990, was the only Renault 19 with 16-valve engine. It had a {{distinctive}} air inlet on the bonnet, a rear spoiler, 15 inch [...] "Speedline" [...] alloy wheels, side skirts, twin headlamps, Recaro bucket seats with optional leather trim, 4-in-1 exhaust manifold and ABS braking system with optional trip computer, aircon and electric sunroof. The [...] "S" [...] is for <b>Soupapes,</b> French for valves. It was praised for its excellent handling and rev-happy F7P engine which along with the advanced Renix ECU made it faster and more fuel efficient compared to most competitors. The braking system was uprated to include 259 mm vented discs on the front and 237 mm discs on the rear as well as an uprated lower suspension setup and front strut bar. Phase 1 editions benefited from unique front and rear bumpers with front indicators relocated into the bumpers to allow for the twin headlamps, while the Phase 2 retained the original bumpers found throughout the range but added colour-coded tops, rubber inserts, and a discreet lower splitter.|$|R
40|$|In 1997, Lia Aminuddin, {{head of the}} Salamullah {{community}} and former presenter of a TV programme about floral arrangement, announced that she had received a revelation : Jibril (the archangel Gabriel in the Koran) was speaking to her, relaying God's messages. Although her following has been limited, its impact has been amplified by modern internet techniques. She was put on trial in 2006 together with the group's Muslim intellectual, Abdul Rahman, whom she considers to be the reincarnation of Muhammad and also the Imam Mahdi, so says the revelation. This paper analyzes Lia's teachings and the group's religious and political actions in their context. Salamullah, later named Eden, cannot be dissociated from the Archipelago's history, neither from influence of the large Reformist organization Muhammadiyah, nor from the post-Soeharto transition, with its ruptures and shocks, following 32 years of political immobilism. Salamullah may have started as a Sufi-like movement, with its magical curing practices, but it {{has evolved into a}} messianic group highly concerned with the nation's future. Just as small messianic movements were often "safety valves" (<b>soupapes)</b> to Dutch oppression in the 19 th and early 20 th century, Salamullah/ Eden seems to function as a "safety valve" in view of a rigidification of religious norms, which have translated into religionrelated violence in Indonesia {{at the dawn of the}} 21 th century.
