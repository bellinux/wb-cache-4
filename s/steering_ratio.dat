5|$|The <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio}} between the {{theoretical}} turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip {{is greater than the}} rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
25|$|Major {{criticisms of}} the GTO {{continued}} to center on its slow <b>steering</b> (<b>ratio</b> of 17.5:1, four turns lock-to-lock) and subpar brakes. Car Life was satisfied with the metallic brakes on its GTO, but Motor Trend and Road Test found the four-wheel drum brakes with organic linings to be alarmingly inadequate in high-speed driving.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{domestic}} market received the Type V edition starting in mid-2000.

40|$|In {{order to}} study tracked vehicle {{adopting}} different steering mechanism, we use <b>steering</b> power <b>ratio</b> to evaluate its performance. The influencing factors of <b>steering</b> power <b>ratio</b> have been theoretically studied. And we designed the experimental prototype to test. We find that <b>steering</b> power <b>ratio</b> {{is related to}} vehicle parameters, resistance coefficient, turning radius, skid ratio, slip <b>ratio</b> and <b>steering</b> coefficient not only, but also it is related to soil parameters (including soil cohesion, internal friction angle of soil and shear modulus of soil). On the condition that vehicle parameters and resistance coefficient are determined, the soil shear tests were carried out, which acquired that the average moisture content of soil is 16. 85 %，soil cohesion is 14. 071 Kpa, internal friction angle of soil is 17. 93 °, and shear modulus of soil is 0. 00027 m.

2500|$|Mechanical {{revisions}} for 1962 were extensive. The {{electrical system}} was extensively upgraded, {{with a new}} gear-reduction starter, new alternator, more fuses, and printed circuit boards rather than individual wires for the instrument cluster. Carburetors were improved again, the manual transmission gearshift was moved from the floor to the steering column, there were new 45°-shear engine mounts replacing the previous vertical-shear items, exhaust systems were made of more corrosion-resistant (aluminized) materials, and axle ratios were altered for better fuel economy. Manual <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> was changed from 20:1 to 24:1, and both power and manual steering gearboxes were new, the latter now housed in aluminum rather than iron.

2500|$|Don Yenko, who {{had been}} racing Corvettes, could not compete {{successfully}} against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene; he therefore decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit {{into any of the}} SCCA categories, Yenko had to modify four-carburetor Corsas into [...] "sports cars" [...] by removing the back seat; in the process he introduced various performance improvements. As the SCCA required 100 cars to be manufactured to homologate the model for production racing, Yenko completed 100 Stingers in one month in 1965.

50|$|A higher <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>ratio</b> {{means that}} the steering wheel is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the steering wheel. A lower <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> {{means that the}} steering wheel is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the steering wheel. Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher <b>steering</b> <b>ratio,</b> which will make the steering wheel easier to turn. If a truck had a low <b>steering</b> <b>ratio,</b> it would be very hard to turn the steering wheel. In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder to turn.|$|E

50|$|The <b>{{steering}}</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio}} of the number of degrees of turn of the steering wheel to the number of degrees the wheel(s) turn as a result. In motorcycles, delta tricycles and bicycles, the <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> is always 1:1, because the steering wheel is fixed to the front wheel. A <b>steering</b> <b>ratio</b> of x:y means that a turn of the steering wheel x degree(s) causes the wheel(s) to turn y degree(s). In most passenger cars, the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1.

50|$|A {{mechanical}} linkage between {{the steering wheel}} and the steering gear is retained in EPAS. In the event of component failure or power failure that causes a failure to provide assistance, the {{mechanical linkage}} serves as a back-up.

Depending on the driving situation, driving skill and strength of the driver, steering assist loss may or may not lead to a crash. The difficulty of steering with inoperative power steering is compounded by the choice of <b>steering</b> <b>ratios</b> in assisted <b>steering</b> gears vs. fully manual.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{considers}} the steering {{characteristics of a}} four-row tracked vehicle crawling on extremely cohesive soft soil, where each side is composed of two parallel tracks.
