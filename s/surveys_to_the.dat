5000|$|In a {{landmark}} case, the Supreme Court ruled in Gibbons v.

This ruling {{in large part}} ended considerable divisiveness regarding transportation improvements between those supporting Federalism versus States rights advocates. Shortly thereafter (April, 1824), the General Survey Act authorized the president to have surveys made of routes for roads and canals [...] "of national importance, in a commercial or military point of view, or necessary for the transportation of public mail." [...] The President assigned responsibility for the <b>surveys</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Corps of Engineers.

5000|$|In 1824, {{however, the}} Supreme Court ruled in Gibbons v. Ogden that federal {{authority}} covered interstate commerce including riverine navigation.

The second act, passed a month later, appropriated $75,000 to improve navigation on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers by removing sandbars, snags, and other obstacles. Subsequently, the act was amended to include other rivers such as the Missouri. This work, too, was given to the Corps of Engineers—the only formally trained body of engineers in the new republic and, as part of the nation's small army, available to serve the wishes of Congress and the executive branch.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{appearance}} of the History in 1964 occasioned many reviews. The Times Literary Supplement review (anonymous but by J. P. Carswell) described the books as [...] "magnificent", but some reviewers were animated by their own feuds with Namier and felt that the books had been limited by their determination to profile MPs individually rather than collectively. A. J. P. Taylor was the most quoted critic, writing in The Observer that the books were not a history but undigested raw material for one, and {{that many of the}} MPs profiled were of no importance in their own day. The 1715-1754 section was praised by J. C. D. Clark, who wrote of [...] "Cruickshanks' pioneering work on the Tories" [...] that demonstrated that the Tory party survived well into the eighteenth century and was heavily involved in Jacobitism. The introductory <b>surveys</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1558-1603 and 1660-1690 sections were criticised for being too brief. However, the more recent publications of 1790-1820, 1386-1421 and 1690-1715 (which have been longer) have been widely praised.|$|E
5000|$|Twichell became {{involved}} in Amarillo civic affairs. He was a Methodist and backed prohibition, having once hosted an appearance in Amarillo by Carrie Nation, known for her physical attacks on saloons. Perhaps {{using some of the}} normal school training, he taught from 1895 to 1897 at the forerunner to the community college now known as Amarillo College, where he not only launched the school band but in 1901 organized the Amarillo Concert Band. [...] Subsequent cadastral surveyors retracing his lines found them highly accurate. His survey records, composed of many field books, working sketches, some 200 finished maps, field notes, and about 50,000 pages of correspondence, were purchased by six major oil companies a short time before Twichell's death and were long maintained in a private depository in Midland. On September 29, 2010, Chevron, Atlantic Richfield, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil, which held the remaining Twichell papers, donated the <b>surveys</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office of General Land Commissioner Jerry E. Patterson. Altogether Twichell laid out more than forty towns and surveyed in 165 of the 254 Texas counties. Patterson reflected on Twichell's long-term significance to Texas history and development. Twichell surveyed the developing areas along the Texas and New Mexico boundary, marked lands giving rise to the XIT Ranch, helped to build railroads, developed the funding mechanism for part of the costs of public education, and provided for the abundant exploration of petroleum and natural gas. His survey also extended into Arizona. In 1901, Twichell was called upon to survey the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont in southeastern Texas. His surveying brought him into contact with such figures as the legenday justice of the peace, Roy Bean of Langtry, Texas, as well as author O. Henry, cattleman Charles Goodnight, and the Comanche chief Quanah Parker. He trained the Lubbock surveyor Sylvan Sanders. Twichell surveyed 15 million total acres, having averaged twenty miles in a typical day. He derived much satisfaction from his work because it created a constant demand for mental activity and allowed him the benefits of new experience and travel. Only one mistake was found in Twichell's work, and that was made by an associate.|$|E
