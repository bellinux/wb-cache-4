25|$|From January 1978 {{until the}} early 1990s Genie moved {{through a series of}} at least four {{additional}} foster homes and institutions, some of which subjected her to extreme physical abuse and harassment. Shurley saw her at her 27th birthday party, in 1984, and again two years later, and in an interview years later he said that both times she was very depressed and uncommunicative. In 1992, Curtiss told Russ Rymer that the only two updates she had heard on Genie indicated <b>she</b> <b>barely</b> spoke and was depressed and withdrawn. When Rymer published a two-part magazine article on Genie in The New Yorker in April of that year he wrote that she lived in an institution and only saw her mother one weekend every month, as did the first edition of his 1993 book, entitled Genie: A Scientific Tragedy. The afterword of the 1994 edition of Rymer's book on Genie, written in November 1993, detailed conversations he had with Genie's mother—who had since gone blind again due to glaucoma—just before and after the publication of his magazine articles. At that time she told him that Genie had recently moved into a more supportive foster home which permitted regular visits, and said that Genie was happy and, although hard to understand, was significantly more verbal.|$|E

500|$|By early 1970, Nixon {{had decided}} he wanted Romney removed from his position. Nixon, who hated to fire people and was, as Ehrlichman later described, [...] "notoriously inadept" [...] at it, instead hatched a plot to get Romney {{to run in the}} 1970 U.S. Senate race in Michigan. Instead, Romney {{proposed}} that his wife Lenore run, and she received the backing of some state Republicans. [...] There was also resistance to her candidacy and an initial suspicion that it was just a stalking horse for keeping his options open. <b>She</b> <b>barely</b> survived a primary against a conservative opponent, then lost badly in the general election to incumbent Democrat Philip A.

500|$|In late 1915, Howe {{traveled}} back to Massachusetts {{to court}} Alice Worcester, {{daughter of the}} head of the company he had worked for in the summer at MIT. After some surprise at the attention from a man <b>she</b> <b>barely</b> knew, Worcester eventually accepted him, and the two were married in mid-1916. The same year, he resigned from government service to go into business with partners as C. D. Howe and Company, whose major business was initially the construction of grain elevators. [...] Both the company headquarters and the marital home were in Port Arthur. Howe's first contract was to build a grain elevator in Port Arthur. In December 1916, a massive storm destroyed the half-built elevator, wiping out Howe's assets. Had his bank not come to his assistance with additional funds, he would have been ruined. When Howe turned over the completed elevator to the owner, the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association, he was asked how badly he had done on the contract, and stated, [...] "I lost my shirt."

Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the fact that you can have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E

500|$|Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) {{is little}} more than a face in a photo and a name that has {{inspired}} many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam. Referred to as a [...] "vapid moll" [...] by one reviewer, <b>she</b> <b>barely</b> makes an impression in the first portion of the film, but after the blue box is opened and she is portrayed by Laura Elena Harring, she becomes a full person who symbolizes [...] "betrayal, humiliation and abandonment", and is the object of Diane's frustration. Diane is a sharp contrast to Camilla, who is more voluptuous than ever, and who appears to have [...] "sucked the life out of Diane". Immediately after telling Diane that she drives her wild, Camilla tells her they must end their affair. On a film set where Adam is directing Camilla, he orders the set cleared, except for Diane—at Camilla's request—where Adam shows another actor just how to kiss Camilla correctly. Instead of punishing Camilla for such public humiliation, as is suggested by Diane's conversation with the bungling hit man, one critic views Rita as the vulnerable representation of Diane's desire for Camilla.|$|E
500|$|The opera {{begins in}} the key of F, and {{switches}} to G at {{the inception of the}} grove scene in Act 1. Act 2 starts in E minor and ends in G. The final act begins and ends in B minor. According to Hicks the dominant character musically, except in Act 3 in which <b>she</b> <b>barely</b> sings, is Armida. Her entry cavatina [...] "Furie terribili" [...] gives, says Hicks, [...] "an immediate impression of fiery passion", an energy and intensity demonstrated in her Act 2 [...] "Ah crudel", and in her later vengeance aria which is the occasion of Handel's harpsichord cadenzas. Armida's Act 3 duet with Argante was the last duet with bass part that Handel wrote for 30 years. Of the other set pieces, Dean and Knapp highlight Rinaldo's [...] "Cara sposa" [...] as an example of Handel's growing confidence with aria forms. [...] "Or la tromba" [...] is praised for the brilliance of its orchestration: 4 trumpets, drums, strings & oboes—the only aria Handel ever wrote for this combination. The melody for Almirena's [...] "Lascia ch'io pianga" [...] began its life as an Asian dance in Almira before appearing as an aria in the oratorio Il trionfo. From this simple tune and plain accompaniment Handel achieves an [...] "intensely moving effect" [...] in this, the best-known of all the arias.|$|E

Leigh Alexander in an article for GameSetWatch noted that while characters such as Samus Aran served as [...] "bastions of dignity", characters such as Ivy filled {{an important role in}} video games too, stating [...] "t looks like Ivy’s back is set to snap – but she’s a game character; she’ll be fine.

[...] The Escapist noted that the character's behavior and sex appeal defined the character rather than serving as an extraneous aspect, stating [...] "Ivy's oversexed dominatrix demeanor perfectly compliments her confident, punishing move set." [...] UGO.com repeated the sentiment, noting in their [...] "Top 11 Girls of Gaming" [...] article [...] "Soul Calibur's mega-bombastic whip-wielding hottie isn't the only babe in the game, or even the best-endowed...but her combination of sultry moves and revealing outfits shoots her up the charts." [...] In an examination of feminist viewpoints regarding women in gaming, comedian and writer Liana Kerzner cited Ivy as an example of misperception of an empowered female character, noting that when compared to characters such as Wonder Woman the latter was considered a positive character for being [...] "empowered" [...] despite sharing similar exposing outfits and physical builds. She further went on to state that the character was interesting for having [...] "to fight her own flawed battle with no help from anyone", and that women passionate about gaming had more in common with the character: [...] "aggressive, intimidating, combative, and scrabbling through life by sheer will, armed with homemade weapons".|$|E
