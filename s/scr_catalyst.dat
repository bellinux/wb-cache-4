During this past quarter, it was discovered that long periods (12 - 24 hours) are required to equilibrate the catalysts in the system. In addition, after the system has been equilibrated, operational changes to temperature, gas concentration, or flow rate shifts the equilibrium, and steady-state must be reestablished, which can require as much as twelve additional hours per condition change. In the last quarter of testing, it was shown that the inclusion of ammonia had a strong effect on the oxidation of mercury by <b>SCR</b> <b>catalysts,</b> both in the short-term (a transitional period of elemental and oxidized mercury off gassing) and the long-term (less steady-state mercury oxidation). All experiments so far have focused on testing the catalysts in a simulated Powder River Basin (PRB) flue-gas environment, which contains lower sulfur and chlorine than produced by other coals.

50|$|SCR {{systems are}} {{sensitive}} to contamination and plugging resulting from normal operation or abnormal events. Many SCRs are given a finite life due to known amounts of contaminants in the untreated gas. The large majority of catalyst on the market is of porous construction. A clay planting pot {{is a good example}} of what <b>SCR</b> <b>catalyst</b> feels like. This porosity is what gives the catalyst the high surface area essential for reduction of NOx. However, the pores are easily plugged by a variety of compounds present in combustion/fuel gas. Some examples of plugging contaminates are: fine particulate, ammonia sulfur compounds, ammonium bisulfate (ABS) and silicon compounds. Many of these contaminants can be removed while the unit is on line, for example by sootblowers. The unit can also be cleaned during a turnaround or by raising the exhaust temperature. Of more concern to SCR performance is poisons, which will destroy the chemistry of the catalyst and render the SCR ineffective at NOx reduction or cause unwanted oxidation of ammonia (forming more NOx). Some of these poisons include: halogens, alkaline metals, arsenic, phosphorus, antimony, chrome, copper.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the catalytic behaviour in the storage/reduction of NOx of single Ptâ€“Ba/Al 2 O 3 LNT and FeZSM- 5 SCR systems and of combined LNT + SCR configurations is analyzed and compared in this work under clean conditions (i. e. in the absence of CO 2 and H 2 O in the feed stream). By working under dilute conditions (i. e. with low reductant concentrations) and with an inert purge between the lean and the rich phases, nearly ideal isothermal conditions could be attained and the chemical pathways operating in the each step of the NSR cycle could be analyzed for the investigated catalysts configurations. It is found that when the <b>SCR</b> <b>catalyst</b> is placed downstream the NSR catalyst bed (double-bed configuration), ammonia released from the LNT sample during the rich phase is stored on the <b>SCR</b> <b>catalyst</b> placed downstreamand is then converted to N 2 in the subsequent lean phase according to the occurrence of a SCR reaction. This has a benefit on both the NOx removal efficiency and the N 2 selectivity. If the zeolite <b>SCR</b> <b>catalyst</b> is mixed with the LNT sample (physical mixture), during the rich phase the <b>SCR</b> <b>catalyst</b> traps ammonia which being intermediate in N 2 formation leads to a decrease in the evolution of nitrogen at the reactor outlet.

40|$|A {{gasoline}} {{direct injected}} engine operating under lean conditions {{can offer a}} reduction in fuel consumption and a reduction of CO 2 emissions but meanwhile suffer from high levels of tailpipe NOx emissions. A new way of reducing NOx emissions in a lean burn gasoline engine is by using an ordinary three way catalyst (TWC) together with a selective catalytic reduction (<b>SCR)</b> <b>catalyst,</b> a passive SCR concept. The basic idea of this concept is that ammonia could be formed over the TWC by operating the engine rich during short amounts of time. The produced ammonia can then be stored in the <b>SCR</b> <b>catalyst</b> further down the exhaust system. When the engine switches into lean operation the stored ammonia is then used to reduce the engine out NOx emissions over the <b>SCR</b> <b>catalyst.</b> The purpose of this master thesis was to investigate if the passive SCR concept is a possible exhaust aftertreatment system to reduce tailpipe NOx emissions for gasoline lean burn engines. This project was performed in an engine test cell at Chalmers University of Technology and was carried out experimentally.

Ammonia was formed over the TWC by operating rich. It was noticed that lambda, engine load and rich cycle duration affected the amount of ammonia formed at steady state conditions.

The stated objective of this project in the Statement of Objectives included testing duct-injection catalysts, catalyst-sorbent hybrids, and coated low-pressure-drop screens. Several different types of catalysts were considered for duct injection, including different forms of iron and carbon. Duct-injection catalysts {{would have to be}} inexpensive catalysts, as they would not be recycled. Iron and calcium had been shown to catalyze mercury oxidation in published bench-scale tests. However, as determined from results of an on-going EPRI/EPA project at Southern Research, while iron and calcium did catalyze mercury oxidation, the activity of these catalysts was orders of magnitude below that of carbon and had little impact in the short residence times available for duct-injected catalysts or catalyst-sorbent hybrids. In fact, the only catalyst found to be effective enough for duct injection was carbon, which is also used to capture mercury and remove it from the flue gas. It was discovered that carbon itself is an effective catalyst-sorbent hybrid. Bench-scale carbon-catalyst tests were conducted, to obtain kinetic rates of mercury adsorption (a key step in the catalytic oxidation of mercury by carbon) for different forms of carbon. All carbon types investigated behaved in a similar manner with respect to mercury sorption, including the effect of temperature and chlorine concentration. Activated carbon was more effective at adsorbing mercury than carbon black and unburned carbon (UBC), because their internal surface area of activated carbon was greater. Catalyst coating of low-pressure-drop screens was of particular interest as this project was being developed. However, it was discovered that URS was already heavily involved in the pursuit of this same technology, being funded by DOE, and reporting significant success. Hence, testing of <b>SCR</b> <b>catalysts</b> became a major focus of the project. Three different commercial <b>SCR</b> <b>catalysts</b> were examined for their ability to oxidize mercury in simulated flue-gas. Similar performance was observed from each of the three commercial catalysts, both in terms of mercury oxidation and SO{sub 3 } generation. Ammonia injection hindered mercury oxidation at low HCl concentrations (i. e., {approx} 2 ppmv), yet had little impact on mercury oxidation at higher HCl concentrations. On the other hand, SO{sub 2 } oxidation was significantly reduced by the presence of ammonia at both low and high concentrations of HCl...|$|R
