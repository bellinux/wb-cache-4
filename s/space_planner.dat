40|$|We propose two {{new methods}} for {{performing}} local path search {{directly in the}} image space of a camera sensor. The first technique utilizes a high-resolution local image space subsystem to determine the farthest point along a global Cartesian path that can be reached along an unobstructed heading, thereby short-cutting {{as much of the}} global path as possible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first image space planning technique that is both suitable for navigation in unstructured environments and does not use a graph-search algorithm in the image space subsystem. The second technique that we propose improves the local image space subsystem of a hierarchical image/Cartesian <b>space</b> <b>planner</b> by determining when it is safe to translate at full speed. Both techniques are implemented on an autonomous robot and experimentally evaluated against a hierarchical top-down Cartesian planner and a previously proposed hierarchical image/Cartesian <b>space</b> <b>planner.</b> Each system is tested three times on three different course layouts. The first proposed method performs comparably to existing systems when evaluated on the criteria of path length and total runtime.

40|$|We {{present a}} plan {{representation}} and a generalized algorithm template, called UCP, for unifying the classical plan-space and state-space planning approaches {{within a single}} framework. UCP models planning {{as a process of}} refining a partial plan. The plan-space and state-space planning approaches are cast as complementary refinement strategies operating on the same partial plan representation. UCP has the freedom to arbitrarily and opportunistically interleave plan-space and state-space refinements within a single planning episode. This allows it reap the benefits of both state-space and plan-space planning approaches. We discuss the coverage, completeness and systematicity of UCP. We also present some preliminary empirical results that demonstrate the utility of combining state-space and plan-space approaches. 1 Introduction Domain independent classical planning techniques fall into two broad categories [...] state <b>space</b> <b>planners</b> which search in the space of states, and plan <b>space</b> <b>planners</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Planning under {{uncertainty}} {{is a key}} requirement for physical systems due to the noisy nature of actuators and sensors. Using a belief space approach, planning solutions tend to generate actions that result in information seeking behavior which reduce state uncertainty. While recent work has dealt with planning for Gaussian beliefs, for many cases, a multi-modal belief is a more accurate representation of the underlying belief. This is particularly true in environments with information symmetry that cause uncertain data associations which naturally lead to a multi-modal hypothesis on the state. Thus, a planner cannot simply base actions on the most-likely state. We propose an algorithm that uses a Receding Horizon Planning approach to plan actions that sequentially disambiguate the multi-modal belief to a uni-modal Gaussian and achieve tight localization on the true state, called a Multi-Modal Motion Planner (M 3 P). By combining a Gaussian sampling-based belief <b>space</b> <b>planner</b> with M 3 P, and introducing a switching behavior in the planner and belief representation, we present a holistic end-to-end solution for the belief space planning problem.

Recent advancements have given rise to robots that are able to interpret natural language manipulation and navigation commands, but these methods require a prior map of the robot’s environment. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework that enables robots to successfully follow natural language route directions without any previous knowledge of the environment. The algorithm utilizes spatial and semantic information that the human conveys through the command to learn a distribution over the metric and semantic properties of spatially extended environments. Our method uses this distribution in place of the latent world model and interprets the natural language instruction as a distribution over the intended behavior. A novel belief <b>space</b> <b>planner</b> reasons directly over the map and behavior distributions to solve for a policy using imitation learning.

40|$|Description logic {{knowledge}} bases traditionally {{contain a}} set of axioms (Tbox) describing background knowledge. DL reasoners generally handle axioms by using the lazy unfolding technique, which reduces the nondeterminism introduced by axioms. Axiom absorption is an optimization technique that rewrites axioms into the unfoldable part of the Tbox suitable for lazy unfolding. Absorptions are generally employed in DL reasoners in a mostly uniform way regardless {{of the characteristics of}} an input knowledge base. Though there exist a number of absorptions, their overall effectiveness remains to be improved, especially when a large quantity of complex axioms are present in the knowledge bases, which is well beyond the capability of any single absorption technique. To ameliorate absorption techniques, this thesis presents a framework applying AI planning to axiom absorption. In this framework, a state <b>space</b> <b>planner</b> is used to encode state-of-the-art absorption techniques. Some designed heuristics concerning the characteristics of an input KB are utilized for the cost estimation during planning. The planner first applies appropriate absorptions to axioms, then it produces a solution with a minimized cost. Such a solution automatically organizes absorptions in a certain sequence to maximize the number of axioms for absorptions. Compared to a predetermined or fixed order of applying absorption techniques, the proposed framework benefits from the advantages to consider more absorption alternatives, which tends to be more flexible and effective...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} robust dynamic walking {{controller}} {{consisting of a}} dynamic locomotion planner, a reinforcement learning process for robustness, and a novel whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC). Previous approaches specify either the position or the timing of steps, however, the proposed locomotion planner simultaneously computes both of these parameters as locomotion outputs. Our locomotion strategy relies on devising a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for robust walking. The learned policy generates multi step walking patterns, and the process is quick enough to be suitable for real-time controls. For learning, we devise an RL strategy that uses a phase <b>space</b> <b>planner</b> (PSP) and a linear inverted pendulum model to make the problem tractable and very fast. Then, the learned policy is used to provide goal-based commands to the WBLC, which calculates the torque commands to be executed in full-humanoid robots. The WBLC combines multiple prioritized tasks and calculates the associated reaction forces based on practical inequality constraints. The novel formulation includes efficient calculation of the time derivatives of various Jacobians. This provides high-fidelity dynamic control of fast motions. More specifically, we compute the time derivative of the Jacobian for various tasks and the Jacobian of the centroidal momentum task by utilizing Lie group operators and operational space dynamics respectively. The integration of RL-PSP and the WBLC provides highly robust, versatile, and practical locomotion including steering while walking and handling push disturbances of up to 520 N during an interval of 0. 1 sec.

40|$|The Graphplan {{algorithm}} {{for generating}} optimal make-span plans containing parallel sets of actions {{remains one of}} the most effective ways to generate such plans. However, despite enhancements on a range of fronts, the approach is currently dominated in terms of speed, by state space planners that employ distance-based heuristics to quickly generate serial plans. We report on a family of strategies that employ available memory to construct a search trace so as to learn from various aspects of Graphplan’s iterative search episodes in order to expedite search in subsequent episodes. The planning approaches can be partitioned into two classes according to the type and extent of search experience captured in the trace. The planners using the more aggressive tracing method are able to avoid much of Graphplan’s redundant search effort, while planners in the second class trade off this aspect in favor of a much higher degree of freedom than Graphplan in traversing the space of ‘states ’ generated during regression search on the planning graph. The tactic favored by the second approach, exploiting the search trace to transform the depthfirst, IDA * nature of Graphplan’s search into an iterative state space view, is shown to be the more powerful. We demonstrate that distance-based, state space heuristics can be adapted to informed traversal of the search trace used by the second class of planners and develop an augmentation of these heuristics targeted specifically at planning graph search. Guided by such a heuristic, the step-optimal version of planner in this class clearly dominates even a highly enhanced version of Graphplan. By adopting beam search on the search trace we then show that virtually optimal parallel plans can be generated at speeds quite competitive with a state-of-the-art heuristic state <b>space</b> <b>planner.</b> ...|$|E

Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic directed exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed estimates and associated data structures. MIPS has shown distinguished performance {{in the last two}} international planning competitions. In the last event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to include numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective functions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS {{has proven to be a}} general system; in each track and every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state <b>space</b> <b>planner,</b> with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization...|$|E
