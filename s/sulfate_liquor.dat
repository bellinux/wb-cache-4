40|$|AbstractThe {{gibbsite}} bearing shale {{occurrence in}} the Paleozoic sedimentary sequence of SW Sinai, Egypt, {{was found to}} be associated with several metal values. From <b>sulfate</b> <b>liquor</b> prepared by proper leaching, the recovery of these metal values has been studied. Alumina was first separated in the form of potash alum followed by Cu-selective extraction by hydroxyoxime LIX- 973 N solvent. Then U recovery using an anionic exchange resin Amberlite IRA- 400 was achieved. For the associated heavy metal Zn, it was subsequently extracted using di- 2 -ethylhexyl phosphoric acid. The relevant factors affecting the extraction process were adequately studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{possibility}} {{of using the}} waste frying oil (WFO) as an extractant for uranium from its <b>sulfate</b> <b>liquor</b> has been studied. Several experiments were conducted to determine the relevant factors affecting both the extraction and stripping of the uranium from a synthetic solution. At the optimum conditions, {{it was found that}} the maximum uranium uptake would attain 54  mg/g at a solution pH of 3. 5. Kinetic characteristics of the loading process have been found to satisfactorily fitting to the pseudo-ﬁrst-order equation. The obtained optimum conditions have also been applied to investigate the potentiality of the working WFO for the recovery of uranium from the actual sulfate leach liquor of El-Sela ore material (South Eastern Desert of Egypt) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractExtraction of {{tantalum}} and niobium from <b>sulfate</b> leach <b>liquor</b> {{of south}} Gabal El-A’urf polymineralized ore material {{was carried out}} by using octanol. The latter was contacted with the <b>sulfate</b> leach <b>liquor</b> prepared after fusing the highly mineralized ore sample with potassium bisulphate in a weight ratio of 1 / 3 at 650 °C for 3 h. From the McCabe–Thiele diagram, it is proposed that three extraction stages are sufficient to extract most of the Ta and Nb contents efficiently at the optimum extraction conditions of 100 % octanol, and A/O ratio of 1 / 1. A highly pure product of Ta was achieved by keeping the pH of the leach liquor at 2. 0 with contact time of 15 min. With respect to Nb, pH of 0. 7 and contact time of 5 min were sufficient to extract most of the Nb contents efficiently. Finally, a technical flowsheet was constructed...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} laboratory investigations {{with the}} objective of developing an alternative process for recovering cobalt and copper from complex sulfide concentrates. Processes currently used depend largely upon precipitation techniques to remove impurities and recover cobalt from <b>sulfate</b> <b>liquors</b> prepared by oxidative pressure leaching of the sulfide concentrates.

40|$|This {{experimental}} work presents the optimization results of obtaining a high indium concentration solution and minimum iron poisoning by solvent extraction with D 2 EHPA solubilized in isoparaffin and exxsol. The variables {{studied in the}} extraction step were D 2 EHPA concentration, acidity of the aqueous phase and time of contact between phases. Different hydrochloric and sulfuric acid concentrations were studied for the stripping step. The optimum experimental conditions resulted in a solution with 99 % indium extraction and less than 4 % iron. The construction of a McCabe-Thiele diagram indicated two theoretical countercurrent stages for indium extraction and at least six stages for indium stripping. Finally, the influence of associated metals found in typical <b>sulfate</b> leach <b>liquors</b> from zinc plants was studied. Under the experimental conditions for maximum indium extraction, 96 % indium extraction was obtained, iron extraction was about 4 % and no Ga, Cu and Zn were co-extracted...|$|R
40|$|Indium can be {{recovered}} by treating residues, flue dusts, slags, and metallic intermediates in zinc smelting. This paper investigates the adsorption characteristics of indium and iron on an iminodiacetic acid chelating resin, Amberlite®IRC 748 (Rohm and Haas Co. -USA). High concentrations of iron are always {{present in the}} aqueous feed solution of indium recovery. In addition, the chemical behaviour of iron in adsorptive systems {{is similar to that}} of indium. The metal concentrations in the aqueous solution were based on typical indium <b>sulfate</b> leach <b>liquor</b> obtained from zinc hydrometallurgical processing in a Brazilian plant. The ionic adsorption experiments were carried out by the continuous column method. Amberlite®IRC 748 resin had a high affinity for indium under acidic conditions. Indium ions adsorbed onto the polymeric resin were eluted with a 0. 5 mol/dm³ sulphuric acid solution passed through the resin bed in the column. 99. 5 % pure indium sulfate aqueous solution was obtained using the iminodiacetic acid chelating resin Amberlite®IRC 748...|$|R
40|$|The kinetic, {{equilibrium}} and thermodynamic {{characteristics of}} U(VI) recovery by the strong base {{anion exchange resin}} Ambersep 920 U SO 4 from Gabal Gattar <b>sulfate</b> leach <b>liquor</b> have been determined. Batch sorption experiments {{are performed to evaluate}} the optimum conditions at pH 2, 200  mg resin dose for 120  min contact time at room temperature. The maximum sorption capacity reaches to 58  mg/g at 298  K. The kinetics data are well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model at different uranium concentrations. The experimental results obtained at various temperatures showed that the adsorption pattern on the studied resin has followed Langmuir isotherm model. The evaluation of thermodynamic parameters (free energy change ΔG, enthalpy change ΔS, entropy change ΔH, activation energy Ea and sticking probability S*) indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous in nature, endothermic, randomness and chemisorptions. Uranium(VI) can be completely desorbed from the loaded resin using 0. 5  M HNO 3 solution. Finally, the optimized factors have been carried out for uranium(VI) recovery from G.

40|$|Black liquor {{contains}} {{high concentrations}} of sodium carbonate and sodium <b>sulfate.</b> In black <b>liquor</b> concentrators, these salts begin to crystallize and {{have the potential to}} rapidly form scales on the surfaces of heat exchangers. The highest potential for scaling is when a supersaturated liquor begins to nucleate, which occurs when no crystals are available in the bulk. A mitigation strategy used in some mills is to recirculate thick liquor, which increases the bulk crystal concentration. However, a more efficient solution would be to separate bulk crystals and add them selectively to mitigate scaling directly. This study investigated the separation of bulk crystal from black liquor using a hydrocyclone. Separation was shown to be possible and was proven for a dry solids content of up to 65 %, which corresponded to a viscosity of 20 mPa·s at 120 °C. The two most important parameters relating to separation were viscosity and flow velocity. The cyclone Reynolds number encompasses both of these parameters and can be used to estimate the degree of separation. An implementation strategy for bulk crystal recirculation has also been developed and discussed. The recirculation of bulk crystals is most beneficial when operating close to critical solids and when reseeding crystals after cleaning...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{molecular}} sieves (CMS) and zeolites {{are widely used}} as microporous sieving solids for gas and liquid separations. However, due to hydrophobicity, better thermal stability, and neutrality in both acidic and alkaline media, CMSs have definite advantages over zeolites. In the present work. an effort {{has been made to}} develop suitable process conditions for synthesizing CMSs from the locally available bituminous coal. The coal was crushed, milled. and agglomerated with <b>sulfate</b> pulp waste <b>liquor</b> (SPWL) or coal-tar pitch (CTP) as the binders, and then carbonized in nitrogen atmosphere at 800 -degrees-C for about 60 minutes. In order to narrow down the pore mouth sizes. acetylene and benzene were each cracked separately at 800 -degrees-C to facilitate the deposition of coke on the char. Acetylene and benzene were cracked for 3 to 10 minutes, and 10 to 30 minutes. respectively. Acetylene cracked samples did not show good separation, probably because of over-coking in deeper locations. In contrast. benzene cracked samples were found to be highly suitable for CO 2 -CH 4 separation. The best result (i. e., uptake ratio of 39. 9) was obtained for feed benzene entrainment in N 2 of 1. 27 x 10 (- 4) g/ml, cracking time of 30 minutes, and this ratio was more than 10 times that of non-cocked sample. CMS samples produced using, SPWL as binder showed poor O 2 /N 2 uptake ratios throughout (1 to 1. 5), whereas samples with CTP as binder showed far more encouraging results, the best uptake ratio being 5. 5 for benzene-nitrogen feed stream containing 3. 508 x 10 (- 4) g/ml benzene and 5 minutes cracking time. This ratio is about 5. 5 times more than that of uncoked sample...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{shortage}} of fossil fuels the use of lignin as a renewable resource is of great global importance. In this work two representative spent liquors from the two dominant processes in the paper and pulp industry were examined. First sum parameters (e. g. content of lignin and carbohydrates) and inorganic components of the liquors were analyzed. Because of large amounts of inorganic compounds in <b>sulfate</b> spent <b>liquor</b> and high sugar content in sulfite spent liquor lignin degradation products were isolated by well-known methods. The development of analytical methods was performed by lignin model compounds. In addition to commercially available monomeric substances several dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric compounds with lignin typical linkages were synthesized. Due to {{the large number of}} lignin degradation products in spent liquors a GCxGC-(TOF) MS method was developed. With this method monomeric and dimeric lignin model compounds can be analyzed. Even after derivatization trimeric and tetrameric substance cannot be recognized. The optimized method was applied to the examination of the isolated lignin degradation products. It was confirmed that spent liquors are complex mixtures of many compounds which even cannot be separated by comprehensive gas chromatography. So a fractionation of the degradation products via a successive soxhlet-extraction method using different solvents became necessary. After the fractionation some monomers were identified by GCxGC-(TOF) -MS. Afterwards a liquid chromatography method for the identification of high molecular compounds was developed. The developed and optimized HPLC-method shows signals in the DAD-chromatogram. With a mass spectrometric detection no signals were available. Therefore a mass spectrometric analysis method with direct injection using model substances was developed and transferred to the real samples. The mass spectrometric method enables a qualification of many substances. Using a high-resolution mass spectrometer it is possible to determine the molecular formula by detecting masses with a precision of ± 0. 02 Da. According to the molecular formula double-bound-equivalents were calculated. In particular MS/MS experiments could obtain information about the number of methoxygroups and the presence of ß-O- 4 ´-linkages and sulfonic acid groups. According to this method several proposals for the structures of 35 monomers in isolated lignosulphonates were evaluated. Eleven monomeric structures include sulfonic acid groups. Additionally eight C-C-linked dimers were identified. Furthermore masses of trimers, tetramers and pentamers were detected. In kraft lignin, isolated from the sulphate liquor, 27 monomers and 21 dimers were identified. In addition, high molecular weight substances with masses up to 680 Da were determined in this liquor. MS/MS experiments have shown that there are no ß-O- 4 '- linkages in the identified compounds. Up to now the masses of detected trimers, tetramers and pentamers were only postulated in literature. So these exact masses were discovered for the first time. Various determined substances, for example long-chain aromatic structures or condensation products, do not originate from wood and can only be formed during the pulping process. All identified substances have a uniform basic structure. Therefore the use of the uniform lignin degradation products seems reasonable. For example unification could be performed by hydrogenation. The received substances could serve as renewable raw materials for other chemical products...|$|R
