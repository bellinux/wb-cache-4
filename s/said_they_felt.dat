However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E

5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

The majority of survey-takers, 89.2%, said they had a physiological reaction when they discovered their partner’s deviance, such as crying, yelling or some other sort of outburst. Out of the people who snapped on their cheating partners, 72.9% said they considered their reaction to be negative (Johnson, 2017).|$|E
25|$|According to a 2010 survey, {{awareness}} of the reforms varies widely within the Moroccan population, with younger, urban, and educated women {{far more likely to}} have heard of the law and have some familiarity with its provisions than women in rural areas, those with less education, and older women. Of Moroccans who have heard of the new Mudawana, 85% of women and 59% of men support the reforms. Most men who oppose the reforms believe the law negatively impacts them, gives greater weight to their spouses' demands, and view it as contrary to their religious beliefs. Women's dissatisfaction with the Mudawana, however, reflects a belief that it is not implemented widely and successfully enough to address the problems of women's rights. Two-thirds of Moroccan women surveyed <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> the new Mudawana had improved women's status in Morocco, and 50% of men agreed.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{found that students}} {{at one of the}} first Building Schools for the Future (BSF) schools to open in England <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> safer and enjoyed going to school more because of their new surroundings. Vandalism, graffiti, littering, and bullying were all thought to be much less of a problem in the new school which students described as ‘inspirational’, ‘colourful’, ‘motivational’, ‘stimulating’ and ‘comfortable’. The numbers of students who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> now planned to stay on in the sixth form or go to college rose from 64 per cent to 77 per cent after the new buildings opened. The ‘before’ and ‘after’ survey of around 200 students at the brand-new Bristol Brunel Academy, which opened in September 2007, suggests a strong association between the move to new surroundings and students’ outlooks regarding their experience of school and their expectations for the future. Among the most significant findings from the study, funded by Partnerships for Schools, the proportions of students: who <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> safe at school most or all of the time increased from 57 to 87 per cent who <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> proud of their school increased from 43 to 77 per cent who <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> enjoyed going to school increased from 50 to 61 per cent who perceived that vandalism was at least ‘a bit of a problem’ in their school decreased from 84 per cent of respondents to 33 per cent who perceived that bullying was a big problem decreased from 39 per cent of students in the ‘before’ survey, to 16 per cent in the ‘after’ surve...|$|R

25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
25|$|Since March 2007, JTS has {{accepted}} openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual students into their rabbinical and cantorial programs (the Seminary's other three schools upheld such non-discrimination policies {{prior to this}} date). A survey conducted prior to the decision indicated that 58% of the rabbinical student body supported this change. The school issued a press release announcing the new admission policy, without taking a stance on same-sex unions. JTS marked {{the first anniversary of}} the change with a special program. Some students who opposed the change in admission policy <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> excluded from the day's program because it did not sufficiently recognize the pluralism in the student body. In April 2011, JTS held a Yom Iyyun, or day of learning, about LGBTQ issues, and their intersection with Judaism. Joy Ladin, a transgender woman who teaches English at Yeshiva University, gave a talk about her life. Other programs included creating welcoming communities, and inclusive prayer, among others. It was sponsored in part by Keshet, the Jewish social action group that works to see queer individuals included in all sectors of Jewish life.|$|E

The album relies on hypnotic, cold atmosphere and showcases influences from Norwegian folk music, which led some to label Antestor as Viking metal. Unlike previously, around this time the band themselves <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> uncertain whether a Christian band can play black metal, because the movement was still strongly associated with Satanism.

2500|$|Another {{study found}} that it was not {{uncommon}} for adolescent girls in relationships to report <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> little desire to engage in sexual activity when they were in relationships. However, many girls engaged in sexual activity even if they did not desire it, in order to avoid what they think might place strains on their relationships. The researcher states that this may be because of society's pressure on girls to be [...] "good girls"; the pressure to be [...] "good" [...] may make adolescent girls think they are not supposed to feel desire like boys do. Even when girls <b>said</b> <b>they</b> did feel sexual desire, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>they</b> were not supposed to, and often tried to cover up their feelings. This {{is an example of how}} societal expectations about gender can impact adolescent sexual functioning.|$|R

500|$|Gandhi {{tried to}} test and prove to himself his brahmacharya, {{less than a}} year before his {{assassination}} in January 1948. In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it would be wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath. He began his experiments by publicly asking in February for volunteer women. He progressed from first letting different volunteers to sleep in the same room but different beds, then later in the same bed but clothed, and finally sleeping naked. Gandhi kept the bedroom doors open all night during these experiments. According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by Muslims in the run up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18-year-old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their [...] "purity", for which she readily accepted. None of the women who participated in the brahmachari experiments of Gandhi indicated that they had sex or that Gandhi behaved in any sexual way. Those who went public <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> they were sleeping with their ageing mother.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda {{presented}} the EV-Cub concept vehicle, an electric motorcycle patterned after the venerable Super Cub, featuring two-wheel drive {{by means of}} electric motors mounted in the hubs {{of each of the}} wheels. Honda <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> keeping the 1958 layout for their 21st century concept bike made sense because, [...] "the human body has not changed in the past 50 years," [...] and, [...] "the size, shape and position of all the Super Cub parts had a kind of necessity to them, and that the design of the Super Cub was very rational and rider-centric." [...] The additional space created by the absence of the engine {{in the center of the}} frame and the lack of a gas tank created room for underseat helmet storage, typical of a scooter. Integrated with the new electric motorcycle was an interactive communications system, to let riders converse while riding. Several other companies, including Christini, KTM, Öhlins, and Yamaha have done development on two-wheel drive motorcycles, and have found that the addition of power to the front as well as the rear wheel aids in stability, particularly in corners and in the hands of novice riders. At the time Honda hinted that they would bring the EV-Cub to market in 2010. In a 2016 speech, Honda's President and CEO Takahiro Hachigo said they planned to release the EV Cub in Japan in about two years, followed later in other ASEAN markets.|$|E
