5|$|According to Paul D. Colford, {{a former}} writer for Long Island Newsday, Howard Stern listened to tapes of Steve and Garry sent from Chicago {{by a friend}} of the chief {{engineer}} at WCCC Hartford. Colford claims Stern eventually developed his on-air <b>style</b> <b>as</b> a result of these tapes. Later, Stern was hired at WWWW Detroit (which Dahl had left when he moved to Chicago).|$|E
5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash <b>style</b> <b>as</b> their previous album, Beneath the Remains, {{it was clear that}} the Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E

5|$|As the Great Depression wore on, Art Deco {{emerged as}} a popular {{building}} <b>style,</b> <b>as</b> evidenced by the Post Office building downtown. Art Deco consisted of streamlined concrete faced appearance with smooth stone or metal, with terracotta, and trimming consisting of glass and colored tiles.|$|E
5|$|Danish country vicarages {{from this}} period tended {{to be built in}} the same <b>style</b> <b>as</b> farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} Funen. The house itself is a thatched half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses.|$|E
5|$|His {{progression}} {{with the}} senior side often saw him compared to teammate Cristiano Ronaldo {{due to the}} similarities in their <b>style</b> <b>as</b> well as Jesé's technical ability, close control, pace and dribbling abilities. Jesé welcomed the comparison to Ronaldo and in a 2013 interview with Marca named the Portuguese legend as his favourite player, ahead of the Brazilian duo of Ronaldo and Ronaldinho.|$|E

5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} the surreal scenery and strange {{human and animal}} characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing <b>style</b> <b>as</b> fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic <b>style</b> <b>as</b> early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).|$|E
5|$|Media {{sources have}} {{characterized}} /pol/ as predominantly racist and sexist, {{with many of}} its posts taking an explicitly neo-Nazi bent. The Southern Poverty Law Center regards /pol/'s rhetorical <b>style</b> <b>as</b> widely emulated by white supremacist websites such as The Daily Stormer; the Stormers editor, Andrew Anglin, concurred.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{increased}} {{the status of}} the sarangi to that of a modern concert solo instrument, made it known outside of India, and was the first sarangi player with international success, an example later followed by Sultan Khan. Narayan's simplified fingering technique allows for glide (meend) and affected the modern sarangi concert <b>style,</b> <b>as</b> aspects of his playing and tone creation were taken up by sarangi players from Narayan's recordings.|$|E

5|$|Näslund's prime {{coincided with}} the {{contributing}} performances of his linemates Bertuzzi and Morrison. His finesse and goal-scoring abilities were complemented by Morrison's playmaking and Bertuzzi's strength and aggression as a power forward. They were known for playing a fast and entertaining <b>style.</b> <b>As</b> a result, head coach Marc Crawford implemented a highly offensive coaching strategy.|$|E
5|$|Partners in Time was {{critically}} acclaimed by the media, gaining an aggregate score of 86 from Metacritic.

5|$|Sasaki {{described}} her fighting <b>style</b> <b>as</b> revolving around her dual weapons, comparing her to previous series character Cervantes {{but with the}} combination of her spear and short sword weapons allowing for both long distance and close-quarters combat. Control of her weapons is mapped to different inputs from the player's controller, allowing the attacks to be combined and create different horizontal and vertical strikes. However, as a result at long range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} portrayed a {{different}} persona of Madonna, rather than her film character {{for which it}} was released. Like the song, it incorporated Hispanic culture and portrayed her dressed in Spanish <b>style</b> <b>as</b> a young lady in search of a treasure. Madonna has performed the song on her Who's That Girl World Tour (1987) and on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016). The song has been covered by many artists and has appeared in compilations and tribute albums.|$|E

5|$|With {{the third}} album The Forsaken the band {{developed}} {{more in the}} direction of a more technical <b>style,</b> <b>as</b> it is apparent on the style of The Return of the Black Death. The band's musical development resulted in that The Forsaken includes several guitar solos. Also the quality of production compared to The Return of the Black Death improved. Through the introduction of the two ex-members of Vaakevandring, the style became more melodic and atmospheric.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} {{shared the same}} mockumentary <b>style</b> <b>as</b> The Office, Daniels and Schur sought to {{establish}} a slightly different tone in the camerawork of the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. For example, the documentary-style interviews with characters sometimes feature two separate angles on the same person, with footage of the two different angles intercut into a single scene for the final episode. This distinguishing technique was inspired by The Five Obstructions, a 2003 documentary by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, which Daniels watched {{at the suggestion of}} actor Paul Schneider. The pilot episode also makes use of the jump cut technique more often than in The Office. In one example from the pilot episode, a scene repeatedly jumps cuts to several brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project.|$|E
