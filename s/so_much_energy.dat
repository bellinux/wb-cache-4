5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy,</b> other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
5|$|After {{the female}} lays the egg, the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for the egg to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators {{in the first six months}} of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one egg a year, as it takes <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> to produce the massive egg.|$|E

25|$|The last {{communication}} with the rover was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010) {{and there is a}} strong possibility the rover’s batteries lost <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> at some point that the mission clock stopped. In previous winters the rover was able to park on a Sun-facing slope and keep its internal temperature above −40°C, but since the rover was stuck on flat ground it is estimated that its internal temperature dropped to −55°C. If Spirit had survived these conditions and there had been a cleaning event, there was a possibility that with the southern summer solstice in March 2011, solar energy would increase to a level that would wake up the rover.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford {{were the}} first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a {{particle}} accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. This allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions, and determined that the deuterium-deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions, peaking at about 100,000electronvolts (100keV). This would be the energy of particles heated to thousands of millions of kelvins, but because the reaction releases <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy,</b> only a small proportion of particles need to be at this level to keep the reaction going. Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics suggest this would be true at much lower temperatures; in 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated the reaction would be self-sustaining at about 50,000,000 K.|$|E

25|$|Since Thutmose III had devoted <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> to {{expanding}} Karnak, Amenhotep's {{building projects}} were largely focused on enlarging smaller temples all over Egypt. In the Delta, his father's Overseer of Works, Minmose, is attested from an inscription at Tura as overseeing construction of more temples. In upper Egypt, small shrines are attested at Medamud, el-Tod, and Armant. Karnak, despite not receiving the attention given it by his father, also was not totally neglected. He commissioned a column {{to stand in}} the courtyard between the fourth and fifth pylons commemorating the reception of tribute from Mitanni. In Nubia, Amenhotep built at Qasr Ibrim and Semna, and ordered the decoration of the Temple at Kalabsha. However, his most famous Nubian temple was at Amada. Thutmose III had begun constructing a temple which, technically, was dedicated to Horus there, although the presence of Re-Harakhti and Amun-Re is easily observed. Amenhotep completed it and put in it the record of his year 3 campaign on a stele, which was until 1942 the source of most information about Amenhotep's wars.|$|E
25|$|The theory {{suggests}} that an anaerobic cell probably ingested an aerobic bacterium but failed to digest it. The aerobic bacterium flourished within the cell because the cell's cytoplasm was abundant in half-digested food molecules. The bacterium digested these molecules with oxygen and gained great amounts of energy. Because the bacterium had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy,</b> it probably leaked some of it as adenosine triphosphate into the cell's cytoplasm. This benefited the anaerobic cell because it was now able to breathe aerobically, which means more potential for energy gain. Eventually, the aerobic bacterium could no longer live independently from the cell, and it, therefore, became a mitochondrion. The origin of the chloroplast {{is very similar to}} that of the mitochondrion. A cell must have captured a photosynthetic cyanobacterium and failed to digest it. The cyanobacterium thrived in the cell and eventually evolved into the first chloroplast. Other eukaryotic organelles may have also evolved through endosymbiosis; it has been proposed that cilia, flagella, centrioles, and microtubules may have originated from a symbiosis between a Spirochaete bacterium and an early eukaryotic cell, but this is not widely accepted among biologists.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{they invest}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>energy</b> in their territories, beavers are {{intolerant}} of intruders and the holder {{of the territory}} {{is more likely to}} escalate an aggressive encounter. These encounters are often violent. To avoid such situations, a beaver marks its territory with as many scent mounds as possible, signaling to intruders that the territory holder has enough energy to maintain its territory and is thus able to put up a good defense. As such, territories with more scent mounts are avoided more often than ones with fewer mounts. Scent marking increases in August during the dispersal of yearlings, in an attempt to prevent them from intruding on territories. Beavers also exhibit a behavior known as the [...] "dear enemy effect". A territory-holding beaver will investigate and become familiar with the scents of its neighbors.
