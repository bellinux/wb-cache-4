The pilot column tested combinations of 6, 4 and 2 stainless steel (ss) porous <b>spargers,</b> and filter cloth and jetting sparger; the lab column used a single ss porous sparger. Long term tests on the pilot column were also done to evaluate maintenance issues. Trends from the water/Dowfroth tests were used to predict results using pulp. Six ss <b>spargers</b> outperformed the other <b>spargers</b> in all cases. The performance of the lab column sparger matched 4 <b>spargers,</b> with the filter cloth performing marginally better than the jetting sparger or 2 <b>spargers.</b> Gas holdup (Eg) and bubble surface area flux (Sb) gave good correlation with ink removal with all <b>spargers</b> failing within a narrow range.

40|$|Rigid <b>spargers</b> {{are enjoying}} renewed {{interest}} in some flotation column applications such as de-inking of recycled paper and de-oiling of water. Sparger selection depends on the physical characteristics of the porous material, the liquid/slurry properties, and {{the dimensions of the}} column. There is no generally accepted method to select <b>spargers</b> for a given flotation column duty. A methodology for selecting stainless steel rigid <b>spargers</b> is proposed. The methodology is based on a target bubble size (db), gas holdup (epsilong), or bubble surface flux (Sb). It combines two models: one for bubble formation at the sparger proposed by Kumar and Kuloor which relates bubble size to sparger characteristics, and drift flux analysis which relates mean bubble size, gas holdup, and gas rate. Prediction of bubble size by the Kumar and Kuloor model requires a knowledge of an equivalent pore diameter (De) of the sparger. A procedure to estimate De by fitting the predicted and measured epsilong - Jg relationships is developed. Comparison of bubble size measured photographically with that estimated from drift flux analysis, and predicted by the Kumar and Kuloor model shows acceptable agreement between the measured, estimated and predicted values. By combining db predicted with drift flux analysis, and allowing for column dimensions, both the gas holdup and the bubble surface flux were predicted. A maximum in sparger surface area was found above which the gas holdup and the bubble surface flux do not increase. <b>Spargers</b> were characterized according to their permeability (k), by applying the Darcy law. Sparger homogeneity was established from this permeability measurement. A relationship between De and k was derived.

Today, it is recognized that the flotation deinking process {{is one of the}} most important processes in waste paper recycling. This is demonstrated by the numerous variety of industrial flotation cell technologies currently available. Column flotation, developed in the mineral processing industry, is proposed as an alternative to other flotation technologies due to its low capital costs and improved separation performance. The flotation column requires an air sparging device to produce bubbles. Previous experimentation has shown that columns run with internal porous <b>spargers</b> initially produced excellent ink recoveries and low organic losses but eventually the sparging system plugged and performance deteriorated. In this work, an air sparging technique, based on a static inline pipe mixer was compared to a porous sparger.
