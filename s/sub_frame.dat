5000|$|... 1974 Citroën CX: The car {{was one of}} {{the most}} modern of its time, {{combining}} Citroën's unique hydro-pneumatic integral self-leveling suspension and speed-adjustable DIRAVI power steering (first introduced on the Citroën SM). The suspension was attached to <b>sub</b> <b>frames</b> that were fitted to the body through flexible mountings, to improve even more the ride quality and to reduce road noise. The British magazine Car described the sensation of driving a CX as hovering over road irregularities, much like a ship traversing above the ocean floor.|$|R
50|$|The CX suspension’s {{ability to}} soak up large {{undulations}} and yet damp out rough surfaces was extraordinary, with a consistent ride quality, empty, or fully laden. The suspension was attached to <b>sub</b> <b>frames</b> that were fitted to the body through flexible mountings, to improve even more the ride quality and to reduce road noise. The British magazine Car described the sensation of driving a CX as hovering over road irregularities, much like a ship traversing above the ocean floor. This suspension was used under license by Rolls-Royce on the Silver Shadow. The Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 was not built under license, but copied the Hydropneumatic suspension principles after the less effective Mercedes-Benz 600 Air suspension installation.|$|R
50|$|Weight and {{strength}} were key {{factors in the}} design of the featherbed frame for the Norton racing team's Manx. 16- Gauge Reynolds 531, a high-tensile manganese-molybdenum steel alloy, was used as it allowed the frame tubes to be made thinner for the same strength, as well as making for a more responsive frame. All the joints were Sifbronze welded, - a relatively low-temperature flame-braze - except for the <b>sub</b> <b>frame</b> which was initially bolted-on but welded in later versions.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} version used {{upper and lower}} square-section steel frames, clad with glass fibre panels and large flat glass windows. On most models sliding side windows acted as doors. It used {{the front and rear}} sub frames and mechanical components from the British Leyland Mini, Metro or BMC1100/1300. The Hustler came in four and six wheel versions: the six wheel version used two Mini rear <b>sub</b> <b>frame</b> assemblies. The style was very much off-road/utility in the rectilinear idiom of the Lagonda and Bulldog.|$|E
50|$|Overall {{handling}} of the R1 was improved through changes to frame and suspension. A new <b>sub</b> <b>frame</b> was designed for the 2009 R1, cast from magnesium giving lower weight aiding mass centralisation. The rear shock absorber on the 2009 offers variable speed damping, {{as well as an}} easy to tweak pre-load via a screw adjustment. The rear shock now connects underneath the swing arm through a different linkage; a change from previous years' models. To improve overall handling and safety, Yamaha included an electronic steering damper.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of general purpose computers is increasing rapidly, {{and now they}} are capable of running video processing applications. However, on general purpose operating systems, real-time video processing is still difficult because {{there is no guarantee that}} enough CPU resources can surely be provided. A pseudo real-time video processing library RaVioli has been proposed for solving this issue. RaVioli conceals two resolutions, frame rate and number of pixels, from programmers and provides a dynamic and transparent resolution adjustability. Using RaVioli, pseudo real-time video processing can be achieved easily, but output precision may be roughened for reducing processing load. To prevent this situation, this paper proposes a method for automatically dividing whole video <b>frame</b> into several <b>sub</b> <b>frames,</b> or tiles, and changing the resolutions of each tile individually. We have implemented the method on RaVioli and have made some evaluations with a sample program. The result shows that the proposed method can keep the resolution of video frames higher than traditional RaVioli...|$|R
3000|$|... [*]=[*] 5.8 GHz. The {{motivation}} of this uplink frequency is not triggered by standardisation; furthermore, it is a trade-off between CMOS transit frequency and hence a {{low power consumption}} of the active front end. Since a carrier-based pulse radio is considered in the tag, a centre frequency within an available ISM band is feasible. A pulse-position modulation is used, where four <b>sub</b> <b>frames</b> and one guard frame form one symbol frame (4 -PPM). The transmitted data sequence consists of 16 symbols, which are repeated until the capacitor reaches a minimum level of charge. In the design, the data rate was calculated to be 117 Mbit/s and the nominal symbol rate is 58 Msym/s. The supply voltage of the UWB front end is 1.5 V, controlled by a low-dropout (LDO) regulator placed before the UWB front end. The available power Pout[*]provided by the single-ended amplifier to the OCA monopole was simulated using Cadence software to be - 1.3 dBm. The simulated antenna impedance is connected in Cadence to the front end, and the peak output power of a continuous wave delivered by the front end is determined. In the following measurements, the pulse mode is analysed, hence the available power has to be corrected with the duty cycle of the pulse signal. Therefore, in pulse mode, with a pulse width of wlow[*]=[*] 0.78 ns and a duty cycle of D[*]=[*] 4.5 %, the available power fed to the OCA is Pout[*]=[*]- 28.2 dBm.|$|R
50|$|The metal {{slide guide}} rails are {{designed}} to be as long as possible to promote stability, by reducing torsion and flexing of the grip frame, during firing and a close fit between the slide and grip frame for plenty direct mechanical interaction between the slide and grip frame. Furthermore, the rails being part of the <b>frame</b> <b>sub</b> assembly that bears all internals, it is easier to assemble the mechanism for manufacturing or disassemble for maintenance and replacement.|$|R
50|$|The {{substantial}} chassis has semi elliptic {{leaf springs}} and rigid axles front and rear. The engine, with fixed cylinder head and bore of 95 mm and stroke of 140 mm, drives {{the rear wheels}} via a multi-plate clutch and four speed transmission separated from the engine. The engine, clutch and transmission are mounted on a <b>sub</b> <b>frame.</b> There are no brakes on the front wheels but the car has a transmission brake immediately behind the gearbox operated by the foot pedal. The rear wheel brakes are operated by hand lever inside the car.|$|E
50|$|A {{major change}} was the {{implementation}} of all alloy multi-link rear suspension attached to an alloy <b>sub</b> <b>frame,</b> a completely new design derived from the project 989, a four-door sedan which never went into production. The system later continued in the 993's successor, type 996, and required the widening of the rear wheel arches, which gave better stability. The new suspension improved handling, making it more direct, more stable, and helping to reduce tendency to oversteer if the throttle was lifted during hard cornering, a trait of earlier 911s. It also reduced interior noise and improved ride quality.|$|E
5000|$|All Chryslers (as well {{as large}} Plymouth and Dodges) were now built on an all-new C-body unibody {{platform}} which featured a bolt-on, rubber-isolated front <b>sub</b> <b>frame.</b> Elwood Engel designed the '65 New Yorker (and all Chrysler models) with styling cues from his 1961 Lincoln Continental — square side view with chrome trim {{along the top}} edges of the fenders. The options were: a 413 CID V8, dual pipe exhaust and power options (A/C, windows, antenna and steering). The engine itself put out [...] and was phased out for the 440 Firepower next model year. The styling began to share some visual similarities with the premium luxury sedan Imperial which received an all-new appearance in 1964.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{intended}} to house a peal of eight bells. The frame was installed in circa 1909 along with just one bell. The bell and frame were made by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough, the frame is a two-tier H <b>frame</b> with <b>sub</b> A <b>frames</b> on top. The bell that Taylors cast was the Tenor bell and weighed 21-1-8 Cwt and was tuned to the note of E. In 1999 the church at Newchurch became redundant and the six bells in it were put up for sale, the then vicar Paul Skillings put in a successful bid. The bells went back to Taylors for refurbishment and two new trebles were cast to take the peal up to an eight; one bell was donated by local football club Burton Albion F.C. whose ground is in the parish.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the unsteady non-linear behavior of the controllable solid propellant rocket motor (CSRM) consequent to rapid and relevant nozzle operation is presented. The study includes a development of a non-linear unsteady combustion model able to handle relevant and rapid chamber pressure changes typical of CSRMs. The CSRM nonlinear unsteady model is implemented according to a main solver - sub models architecture and uses different time scales. The formulation of the combustion gas mass flow rate is developed considering the propellant density, the unsteady combustion, the regression of the combustion surface and the outflow through the variable nozzle. The grain surface involved in the combustion is obtained by a regression model of the chamber walls, in reliance on the unsteady burning rate, on the initial grain geometry and integrates the history of performed nozzle operations. The CSRM is described by a system of differential equations that is reduced in sub systems and solved numerically in the main solver <b>sub</b> model <b>frame...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} {{finite element models}} and subsequent sensitivity and reliability analyses to evaluate the probability of disproportionate collapse of a twelve-storey case study Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) building, following extreme loading events such as earthquakes. As an initial damage, the methodology mimics event - independent scenarios that include a sudden removal of a vertical loadbearing element. This investigation emphasises on the rotational stiffness (k) of the joints by considering nonlinear dynamic analyses of the structure at global, component and connection levels. The rotational stiffness demand required to prevent disproportionate collapse is checked against the supply {{at all levels of}} structural idealisation. A sensitivity analysis at the <b>sub</b> - <b>frame</b> level shows that an improved structural detailing, to carry tie forces between structural members, as well as adequate thickness of structural elements, are important to prevent disproportionate collapse. The reliability analysis of the optimised structural model proves that the required k value, to develop resistance mechanisms, is too large to be practically achieved by means of common CLT joint detailing, which is provided by angle brackets and screws. As a result, connection detailing and size of members of the case study building need to be re-evaluated in order to avoid disproportionate collapse in the twelve-storey CLT building...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ugandan law prohibits {{abortion}} {{under all}} circumstances except {{where there is}} a risk for the woman's life. However, {{it has been estimated that}} over 250 000 illegal abortions are being performed in the country yearly. Many of these abortions are carried out under unsafe conditions, being one of the most common reasons behind the nearly 5000 maternal deaths per year in Uganda. Little research has been conducted in relation to societal views on abortion within the Ugandan society. This study aims to analyze the discourse on abortion as expressed in the two main daily Ugandan newspapers. Method: The conceptual content of 59 articles on abortion between years 2006 - 2012, from the two main daily English-speaking newspapers in Uganda, was studied using principles from critical discourse analysis. Results: A religious discourse and a human rights discourse, together with medical and legal <b>sub</b> discourses <b>frame</b> the subject of abortion in Uganda, with consequences for who is portrayed as a victim and who is to blame for abortions taking place. It shows the strong presence of the Catholic Church within the medial debate on abortion. The results also demonstrate the absence of medial statements related to abortion made by political stakeholders. Conclusions: The Catholic Church has a strong position within the Ugandan society and their stance on abortion tends to have great influence on the way other actors and their activities are presented within the media, as well as how stakeholders choose to convey their message, or choose not to publicly debate the issue in question at all. To decrease the number of maternal deaths, we highlight the need for a more inclusive and varied debate that problematizes the current situation, especially from a gender perspective...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{present a}} {{methodology}} for treebank- or parser-based acquisition of lexical resources, in particular <b>sub</b> categorisation <b>frames.</b> The method uses an automatic Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) f-structure annotation algorithm (Cahill et al., 2002 a, 2004 a; Burke et al., 2004 b) {{and has been}} applied to the Penn-II and Penn-III treebanks (Marcus et al., 1994) with a total of about 1. 3 million words as well as to (a subset of) the British National Corpus (Bernard, 2002) with about 90 million words. I extract abstract syntactic function-based subcategorisation frames (LFG semantic forms), traditional CFG category-based subcategorisation frames as well as mixed function/category-based frames, with or without preposition information for obliques and particle information for subcategorised particles. The approach distinguishes between active and passive frames, and reflects the effects of long-distance dependencies (LDDs) in the source d ata structures. Frames are associated with conditional probabilities, facilitating the optimisation of the extracted lexicon for quality or coverage through filtering. In contrast to many other approaches, subcategorisation frame types are not predefined but acquired from the source data. I carried out large-scale evaluations of the complete set of forms extracted against the COMLEX and OALD resources. To my knowledge, this is the largest and most complete evaluation of subcategorisation frames for English. The parser-based system is also evaluated against Korhonen (2002) with a statistically significant improvement over the previous best score. The automatic annotation methodology, as well as the grammar and lexicon extraction techniques for English have been successfully migrated to Spanish, German and Chinese treebanks despite typological differences and variations in treebank encoding. I believe that this approach provides an attractive and efficient multilingual grammar and lexicon development paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Cartoon series such as “The Simpsons” and “South Park” have {{improved}} significantly {{through the use}} of computerised animation and enhancement. This has been most evident in the speed of production and the realism of the representation of character portrayal and settings, but has also intensified the impact of the modal and compositional functions of meaning - making in TV cartoons. In the first episode of “South Park” Trey Parker and Matt Stone used construction paper and stop - motion animation, requiring months to produce a somewhat simple - minded story with schematic characterisation, limited facial movement, no crowd scenes and shadows of crepe paper models frequently obtrusive. The quirky characters, both children and adults, the strong sense of community and the self-referentiality of the narrative, which have become trade - marks of the series, were all there in embryo, however. By the time of the episode ”Free Hat” in Season 6 digital techniques had not only speeded up the production process, but had led to richer characterisation, realistic facial expression, authentic speech – except where cartoon schematics were preserved for humour [...] , individuality within crowd scenes and graded colour and shading. Most pointedly, it allowed the realistic depiction of recognisable public figures like the talk - show host Ted Koppel and the film directors George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Frances Ford Coppola, who are attacked by the children of South Park for digitally remastering their best - known films, thereby losing, purportedly, their artistic integrity. In addition to lampooning (verbally, visually and musically) these directors for succumbing to the “Fascist” efficiency of computer animation, Parker and Stone (by now regularly using advanced CGI techniques themselves) represent themselves in a live action insert as “humane” in their remastered version of Episode 1 of “South Park”. As always with this series, intertextuality, parody and self-referentiality serve a modal function, bonding viewers with the absurd but honest politics of the child protagonists. Play with <b>sub</b> - <b>frames</b> and destruction of the space between screen and audience exploits the compositional potential of the digitalised audio - visual medium and enriches with purely visual jokes the humour of the story-line...|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the E-Type, Jaguar management wanted to investigate the possibility of building a car more {{in the spirit of the}} D-Type racer from which elements of the E-Type's styling and design were derived. One car was built to test the concept designed as a coupé. Unlike the steel production E-Types, the LDC used lightweight aluminium. Malcolm Sayer retained the original tub with lighter outer panels riveted and glued to it. The front steel <b>sub</b> <b>frame</b> remained intact, the windshield was given a more pronounced slope, and the rear hatch was welded shut. Rear brake cooling ducts appeared next to the rear windows, and the interior trim was discarded, with only insulation around the transmission tunnel. With the exception of the windscreen, all cockpit glass was perspex. A tuned version of Jaguar's 3.8-litre engine with a wide-angle cylinder head design tested on the D-Type racers was used.|$|E
50|$|A {{completely}} new {{appearance in the}} front and rear including engine hood, trunk lid, bumpers, lights, and fenders.This vehicle has a tri-chamber type structure (just like the Peugeot 206). It is made from drawn steel sheet which ranges in thickness from 0.7 mm to 2.5 mm, depending on its function. High elastic strength steel sheets are used for components that are subjected to particularly high levels of stress, such as the front structural member supports or the <b>sub</b> <b>frame.</b> This enables both greater strength and a weight reduction of around 50% to be achieved over conventional sheets which would have to be more than twice as thick to withstand the same stresses. One of the most important points at Iran Khodro Industrial Group whilst the specification for a new vehicle was being drawn up is safety. It includes active and passive safety. The first one utilizes mechanical components and vehicle dynamics to push the accident threshold as far back as possible. The second complements the first and seeks to reduce the consequences of the accident by using as many options as possible. The Runna can claim to be a vehicle which can measure up to the safety features that one has a right to expect from a modern product.|$|E
40|$|A {{private network}} of 133 GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) {{permanent}} sites, named ItalPoS (Italian Positioning Service) and covering quite uniformly the entire Italian territory, was established since April 2006 by the Italian Division of Leica Geosystems S. p. A. This network involves also several GPS {{stations of the}} INGV (Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology) RING (Real-time Integrated National Gps) network and GPS stations from other public and private administrations. The purpose of ItalPoS network is mainly the GNSS data distribution in terms of real time corrections and RINEX (Receiver INdependent EXchange) files for the post-processing. In order to compute and distribute to private and scientific users a set of adjusted coordinates of the ItalPoS network in the IGS 05 and ETRF 89 -ETRF 2000 (European Terrestrial Reference Frame) reference frames, a dataset of RINEX of 133 GPS permanent sites was created and processed, using the distributed sessions approach, by means of Gamit/Globk 10. 3 GPS data processor, using also some SOPAC (Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center) and EUREF (Reference <b>Frame</b> <b>Sub</b> Commission for Europe) solutions to improve the reference frame definition and the internal constraint. All the strategies adopted to estimate coordinates and velocities of the ItalPoS Network in IGS 05 will be described together with the investigated approaches to provide coordinates in ETRF 89 -ETRF 2000 reference frames: in this case both Helmert and Boucher-Altamimi transformations were taken into account, the whole Italian territory was divided into three parts in order to optimize transformation residuals.

This study was conducted to investigate ways in which principals implement state-wide policy on teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional learning at the school level in New South Wales (NSW) public schools. The major question in this study was: What is the principal 2 ̆ 7 s role in teacher professional learning and its relationship with the Professional Learning Policy? Three <b>sub</b> questions <b>framed</b> the study were: Firstly, how do principals implement the state-wide policy on teacher professional learning? Secondly, what kinds of capabilities do principals need for the implementation of the Professional Learning Policy at the school level? Thirdly, what constraints do principals face in the implementation of the Professional Learning Policy? The focus of the research was principals, teachers, and all members of the school Professional Learning Teams in three public primary schools, in the Wollongong area of NSW. Case study methodology was applied in investigating the principal 2 ̆ 7 s leadership and management approaches, policy requirements, and characteristics of teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional learning. The research utilised a mixed quantitative and qualitative descriptive research design, employing the questionnaire as its primary data-gathering instrument, semi-structured interviews, and document review. An analysis of these data identified areas where the principals implemented Professional Learning Policy in the schools. The findings indicated that both the principals and teachers had welcomed the implementation of the state-wide Professional Learning Policy and even in the initial phases of implementing the policy gave considerable thought to planning and other management practices. The findings also indicate that collaboration between the principal and staff was essential for implementation of the policy. Clearly, the principal as leader of the school Professional Learning Team has the central role in leading and managing teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional learning and the important functions of this role are planning; encouraging teachers to participate; implementation of programs; and evaluation of programs. This study indicates that there are interactive relationships among these roles and that the principal 2 ̆ 7 s attention to one role without concern for the others can result in unsuccessful and ineffective professional learning programs. The results of this study provide information on leadership and management practices in teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional learning that can lead to better outcomes for teachers and ultimately the students they teach. Additionally, the author makes recommendations on policy implementation; principal 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities; constraints; and further research on teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional learning...|$|R
