5|$|Levels {{become more}} complex as the player progresses, {{introducing}} different mechanics and {{new types of}} enemies. Each enemy type {{is dressed in a}} unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their movement patterns. Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a <b>specific</b> <b>route.</b> Later stages may require the player to collect keys located on the board and unlock doors that block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board to another and allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain potted plants, the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player walk past an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable objects that are used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a <b>specific</b> <b>route,</b> the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E

40|$|Part 5 : Modelling and OptimizationInternational audienceWe {{consider}} the real-time routing of driverless vehicles in an on-demand transit transportation system with time window. Because fast dispatching decisions are required, decentralized decisions system are generally {{used in these}} contexts. For that purpose, we introduce a new multi agent-based simulation model where intelligent vehicle agents determine their <b>specific</b> <b>routes</b> and which transportation requests to serve. They interact with passengers, who strive for minimum waiting time. Our approach offers several advantages: it is fast, {{make it easy for}} vehicles to determine their <b>specific</b> <b>routes</b> and needs little information for vehicles. We propose also a specific algorithm for the independent vehicles’agent in order to determine their <b>specific</b> <b>routes.</b> Preliminaries computational tests of our multi-agent model and our developed algorithm prove that our approach is very promising...|$|R

25|$|Of the {{two main}} routes that Wallace could use to move his men to the front, he chose the Shunpike road, the more direct route to reach Sherman's {{division}} near Shiloh Church. The day before the battle, Wallace {{wrote a letter to}} a fellow officer, W. H. L. Wallace, stating his intention to do so. Lew Wallace and his staff maintained after the battle that Grant's order did not specify Pittsburg Landing as their destination or indicated a <b>specific</b> <b>route.</b> However, Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had ordered Wallace to take the route nearest to the river to reach Pittsburg Landing. Historians are divided, with some stating that Wallace's explanation is the most logical.|$|E
500|$|While {{the general}} {{negotiation}} {{with other countries}} and the <b>specific</b> <b>route</b> were handled by the Organising Committee for the Games, the detailed organisation was delegated to a subgroup led by F.W. Collins. Due to cost implications, the extensive route conducted by the 1936 Games was ruled out. Instead, the simplest route from Olympia to London was to be used, going by sea to Italy and then run through Switzerland and France. The route was modified only when Luxembourg and Belgium both requested that the torch travel their territories.

50|$|Traplining {{can also}} be an {{indication}} of the levels of spatial cognition of species that use the technique. For example, traplining in bumblebees is an indication that bumblebees have spatial reference memory, or spatial memory, that is used to create <b>specific</b> <b>routes</b> in short term foraging. The ability to remember <b>specific</b> <b>routes</b> long-term cuts down foraging and flying time, consequently conserving energy. This theory has been tested, showing that bumblebees can remember the shortest route to the reward, even when the original path has been changed or obstructed. Additionally, bees cut down {{the amount of time spent}} revisiting sites with little or no nutritive reward. Bees with access to only short-term memory forage inefficiently.|$|R
500|$|The last {{section is}} a {{proposed}} [...] section from Lysaker to Skøyen; the latter not being modified {{as part of}} the extension, since it was upgraded in 1999. The government has not set a date to start construction, but it will not be until at least 2020, since other projects will be prioritised over this section. No <b>specific</b> <b>route</b> has been finalised, and the project has been proposed to either run parallel to the current Drammen Line, or by placing all four tracks through a new tunnel. The former has been preferred by the Rail Administration, while the latter—which would cost NOK 1billion more—has been preferred by the municipality. There are no intermediate commuter stations between Skøyen and Lysaker, so there is little regularity or speed potential to gain from the construction, since the Oslo Tunnel from Skøyen to Oslo Central Station will still remain a bottleneck with only two tracks. Advocates have claimed that there is no gain from building this section without building two additional tracks {{all the way to the}} central station.|$|E

2500|$|A topological map is a {{very general}} type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the {{interest}} of clarity of communicating <b>specific</b> <b>route</b> or relational information. Beck's London Underground map is an iconic example. Though the most widely used map of [...] "The Tube," [...] it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the River Thames, letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space. Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfils its purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Nelson's {{antelope}} squirrels are cautious when {{emerging from}} their burrows. They have a <b>specific</b> <b>route</b> that they follow when foraging for food. [...] If danger seems near, they will {{run into a}} burrow along their foraging route to get to safety. They move quickly and do not spend much time in one place. [...] They are particular about what they choose to eat and very rarely even waste time to pick up food they are not interested in. There are other features {{in addition to their}} quick movements that help keep them from danger. [...] They whitish color of the underside of their tail can be seen when they run. [...] The squirrels will curl their tail forward over their back and flick and twitch it back and forth as it runs. [...] This movement can present the illusion of thistledown fluttering in the wind, which could be ignored by any potential predators.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart now {{sought to}} take a useful role in the {{campaign}} and perhaps, according to some historians, to redeem his reputation and to secure the glory of another ride around the Union Army. On June 22, Lee gave Stuart discretionary orders for his movement to Pennsylvania with the important point being: [...] "If you find that he [...] is moving northward, and that two brigades can guard the Blue Ridge {{and take care of}} your rear, you can move with the other three into Maryland, and take position on General Ewell's right." [...] Lee wrote to Stuart again on June 23 in an apparent effort to clarify his orders as follows: [...] "You will, however, be able to judge whether you can pass around their Army without hindrance, doing them all the damage you can, and cross the river east of the mountains. In either case, after crossing the river, you must move on and feel the right of Ewell's troops." [...] Lee's orders did not give Stuart a <b>specific</b> <b>route</b> to follow. Confederate Colonel Edward Porter Alexander, chief of artillery of Longstreet's corps, stated [...] "Stuart made to Lee a very unwise proposition, which Lee more unwisely entertained." ...|$|E

2500|$|The writers {{also used}} the {{decision}} statistics from previous episodes to develop the direction of future ones. Gary Whitta, the writer of the fourth episode, specifically reviewed all the statistics from the previous three episodes to determine the general development of the episode's story. One example involved the death of Duck in the third episode. In that episode, the player must choose to either kill Duck for Kenny, or have Kenny do it himself. In the fourth episode, Whitta wrote a scene where Kenny finds a similar-looking boy, who has starved to death in an attic and come back as a walker. Again, the player is faced with the choice of whether to kill the boy themselves or have Kenny do it. They also included a third choice, in which the player would simply walk away, leaving the boy as a walker trapped in the attic, but this decision would harshly affect the disposition of the others characters towards Lee. By the first act of episode 5, there were 32 variations due to past player choices {{that they had to}} write towards. The number of possible scenarios were considered necessary to make the game feel [...] "organic" [...] to the individual player, making the player feel like they weaved their own story within the game instead of just taking a <b>specific</b> <b>route</b> through the choices.|$|E
