60|$|It was {{inevitable}} that she and the bishop should meet and talk occasionally in the cathedral precincts, and it {{was inevitable}} that he should contrast the flexibility of her rapid and very responsive mind with a certain defensiveness, a <b>stoniness,</b> in the intellectual bearing of Lady Ella.|$|E
60|$|In {{this remote}} {{part of the}} country no one interfered; the Crees, whose {{presence}} maddened him, were afraid to approach, and only Prometesky sustained the hopes of the two Eustaces by his conviction that this was not permanent insanity, but a passing effect of the injury; and they weathered that dreadful time till the frantic fits ceased, and there was only the dull, silent, <b>stoniness</b> of look and manner, lasting on after his health had entirely returned, and he had begun mechanically to attend to the farm and stock, and give orders to the men.|$|E

The girl herself was in a happy, tuneful mood, and met him with such simplicity, threw such a light of sweetness over his soul, that Septimius almost forgot all the wild cares of the day, and walked by her side with a quiet fulness of pleasure that was new to him. She reconciled him, in some secret way, to life as it was, to imperfection, to decay; without any help from her intellect, but through the influence of her character, she seemed, not to solve, but to smooth away, problems that troubled him; merely by being, by womanhood, by simplicity, she interpreted God's ways to him; she softened the <b>stoniness</b> that was gathering about his heart.

6000|$|In we roll, into Orosei, a dilapidated, sun-smitten, god-forsaken {{little town}} {{not far from}} the sea. We descend in piazza. There is a great, false baroque façade to a church, up a {{wavering}} vast mass of steps: and at the side a wonderful jumble of roundnesses with a jumble of round tiled roofs, peaked in the centre. It must have been some sort of convent. But it is eminently what they call a [...] "painter's bit"--that pallid, big baroque face, {{at the top of the}} slow incline, and the very curious dark building at the side of it, with its several dark-tiled round roofs, like pointed hats, at varying altitudes. The whole space has a strange Spanish look, neglected, arid, yet with a bigness and a dilapidated dignity and a <b>stoniness</b> which carry one back to the Middle Ages, when life was violent and Orosei was no doubt a port and a considerable place. Probably it had bishops.|$|E
60|$|The Sphynx relapsed into <b>stoniness,</b> and the Herr Professor {{guided the}} hands, which trembled a little, to the {{interior}} of the mummy, whence they drew out a basket, labelled (wonderful to relate) 'Val,' and containing--oh! such treasures, a blue egg full of needlework implements, a new book, an Indian ivory case, a skipping-rope, a shuttlecock, and other delights past description. The exhibition of them was only beginning when the Professor called for Primrose, who was too much frightened to come alone, and therefore was permitted to be brought by Mrs. Halfpenny. The Sphynx was particularly amiable on this occasion, and only asked 'When Primroses came?' and as the little one, in her shy fright did not reply, nurse did so, with, 'Come, missie, can't you find a word to tell that mamma's Primrose came in spring.' This was allowed to pass, and Mrs. Halfpenny bore off her child, clutching a doll's cradle, stuffed with pretty things, and for herself a bundle wrapped up in a shawl from Sir Jasper himself.|$|E
6000|$|The {{rooms were}} visibly {{restored}} in every {{point where they}} could have needed restoration, {{but they were not}} ruthlessly or too insistently restored. There was even an antique chair, but when our guide was put on his honor as to whether {{it was one of the}} original chairs he answered, [...] "Well, if people wanted a chair!" [...] He was a rather charmingly quaint, humorous person, with that queer conscience, and he did not pretend to be moved by the hard inexorable <b>stoniness</b> of the place which had been a queen's prison for many years. One must not judge it too severely, though: bowers and prisons of that day looked much alike, and Mary Stuart may have felt this a bower, and only hated it because she could not get out of it, or anyhow break the relentless hold of that Earl and Countess of Shrewsbury whose captive guest she was, though she never ceased trying. We went up on the wide flat roof, of lead or stone, whither her feet must have so often heavily climbed, and looked out over the lovely landscape which she must have abhorred; and the wind that blew over it, in late August, was very cold; far colder than the air of the prison, or the bower, below.|$|E
60|$|Hence it is said, 'The {{preparations}} of {{the heart}} in man, &c., is from the Lord.' And again, 'God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me' (Job 23:16). The heart, as it is by nature hard, stupid, and impenetrable, so it remains, and so will remain, until God, as was said, bruiseth it with his hammer, and melts it with his fire. The stony nature of it is therefore said {{to be taken away}} of God. 'I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you,' saith he, 'an heart of flesh' (Eze 36:26). I will take away the stony heart, or the <b>stoniness,</b> or the hardness of your heart, and I will give you a heart of flesh; that is, I will make your heart sensible, soft, wieldable, governable, and penitent. Sometimes he bids men rend their hearts, not because they can, but to convince them rather, that though it must be so, they cannot do it; so he bids them make themselves a new heart, and a new spirit, for the same purpose also; for if God doth not rend it, it remains unrent; if God makes it not new, it abides an old one still.|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} resort, then, it is mainly on mud {{that the life}} of {{humanity}} in all countries bases itself. Every great plain is the alluvial deposit of a great river, ultimately derived from a great mountain chain. The substance consists {{as a rule of}} the débris of torrents, which is often infertile, owing to its <b>stoniness</b> and its purely mineral character; but wherever it has lain long enough to be covered by earth-worms with a deep black layer of vegetable mould, there the resulting soil shows the surprising fruitfulness one gets (for example) in Lombardy, where twelve crops a year are sometimes taken from the meadows. Everywhere and always the amount and depth of the mud is the measure of possible fertility; and even where, as in the Great American Desert, want of water converts alluvial plains into arid stretches of sand-waste, the wilderness can be made to blossom like the rose in a very few years by artificial irrigation. The diversion of the Arkansas River has spread plenty over a vast sage scrub; the finest crops in the world are now raised over a tract of country which was once the terror of the traveller across the wild west of America.|$|E
60|$|Be {{that as it}} might, Richard Digby {{was well}} {{contented}} with his sepulchral cave. So dearly did he love this congenial spot, that, instead of going a few paces to the bubbling spring for water, he allayed his thirst with {{now and then a}} drop of moisture from the roof, which, had it fallen anywhere but on his tongue, would have been congealed into a pebble. For a man predisposed to <b>stoniness</b> of the heart, this surely was unwholesome liquor. But there he dwelt, for three days more eating herbs and roots, drinking his own destruction, sleeping, as it were, in a tomb, and awaking to the solitude of death, yet esteeming this horrible mode of life as hardly inferior to celestial bliss. Perhaps superior; for, above the sky, there would be angels to disturb him. At the close of the third day, he sat in the portal of his mansion, reading the Bible aloud, because no other ear could profit by it, and reading it amiss, because the rays of the setting sun did not penetrate the dismal depth of shadow round about him, nor fall upon the sacred page. Suddenly, however, a faint gleam of light was thrown over the volume, and, raising his eyes, Richard Digby saw that a young woman stood before the mouth of the cave, and that the sunbeams bathed her white garment, which thus seemed to possess a radiance of its own.|$|E

50|$|Deep Gypsisols located {{close to}} water {{resources}} can be planted {{to a wide}} range of crops. Yields are severely depressed where a petrogypsic horizon occurs at shallow depth. Nutrient imbalance, <b>stoniness,</b> and uneven subsidence of the land surface upon dissolution of gypsum in percolating (irrigation) water are further limitations. Irrigation canals must be lined to prevent the canal walls from caving in. Large areas of Gypsisols are in use for low volume grazing.|$|E

50|$|Carved out of {{an ancient}} floodplain, the small terrace upon which Chetwynd is {{situated}} lies in the northern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Once used as a grazing spot by nomadic Aboriginals, the terrace was farmed by settlers until it was developed into a town. Two types of soil - namely, the Widmark and Centurion Series - comprise the terrace's surface. The Widmark Series - a moderately well-drained degraded loamy, woody, silty, and clay-like soil - lies north of Highway 97. Meanwhile, the Centurion Series - which lies south of the highway - is a poorly drained soil with a dark-brown peaty surface material consisting of decomposed leaves and mosses. These soils, also limited by topography and <b>stoniness,</b> are generally used for forage and pasture.|$|E
50|$|The core Tug Hill region {{encompasses}} 150,000 {{acres of}} unbroken, generally second-growth, northern hardwood forest, and is drained by a {{vast network of}} streams. Important rivers and streams whose headwaters are located within the Tug Hill region include the Mohawk River, Deer River, Salmon River, Mad River, Sandy Creek, and {{the east and west}} branches of Fish Creek. Despite the presence of numerous streams, many of the soils in the regions' core are poorly drained. Almost all the soils have some combination of factors which render them unsuitable for agriculture, including shallow depth, <b>stoniness,</b> rough topography, poor or excessive drainage, strong acidity and/or low fertility. Agricultural activity is largely absent from the Tug Hill's core, and is concentrated mainly in the outlying northern and western portions of the region, where soils are better drained and more fertile.|$|E

5000|$|Land {{that is not}} arable, in {{the sense}} of lacking {{capability}} or suitability for cultivation for crop production, has one or more limitations e.g. lack of sufficient fresh water for irrigation, <b>stoniness,</b> steepness, adverse climate, excessive wetness with impracticality of drainage, excessive salts, among others. [...] Although such limitations may preclude cultivation, and some will in some cases preclude any agricultural use, large areas unsuitable for cultivation are agriculturally productive. For example, US NRCS statistics indicate that about 59 percent of US non-federal pasture and unforested rangeland is unsuitable for cultivation, yet such land has value for grazing of livestock. [...] In British Columbia, Canada, 41 percent of the provincial Agricultural Land Reserve area is unsuitable for production of cultivated crops, but is suitable for uncultivated production of forage usable by grazing livestock.

50|$|Washinee ‘Smiling Water’ and Washining ‘Laughing Water’ are romanticized, made-up {{meanings}} for {{the twin}} equal lakes; no Amerindian {{would think of}} places in that way. On consulting John C. Huden’s Indian place names of New England, NY, 1962, Museum of the American Indian—Heye Foundation, one can find the following entry, p. 271:Washining Litchfield County, Conn. Mahican, ‘mountain country’ or perhaps a corruption of Ossining, ‘stony land’. Variant, Washee. Washinee.There are some problems here. The first element Wash- seems similar to Massachusett wadchu ‘mountain, hill’, but the medial element -in- can’t be explained, and the final element -ing {{would seem to be}} clear enough as ‘at the place of’, but that last would imply a Delaware (Munsee, Unami) word and not Mahican, which used -uk (like /uck/ in English). So let’s bypass Huden’s first idea, but Delaware “Ossining” (‘stone-at’) matches extremely well Washining. Is there a lot of <b>stoniness</b> around those twin lakes? However, Mahican ‘stone’ is assen (+ -uk), but Munsee Delaware would be asúnung ‘stone-at’ (u as the a in sofa). Munsee has wáasiingw ‘pickerel’, but that medial -in- in the lake names is not accounted for.For a try at the etymology see Masthay’s book Schmick’s Mahican dictionary, 1991, on page 92, where there is the surprisingly similar wãhs’nanè, waásnanè with a preaspirated s (not sh, but h+s, which gives a breathiness to the word), and it means ‘Make it bright’ (an imperative; German Mache es helle), and Schmick shows wãhs’nanégan ‘light, brightness’ (‘candle, candlelight, lamp, torch’?) with the Algonquian abstract final for nouns -egan; thus probably pronounced /WANHS-nuh-NEE-gunn/. Perhaps that sounds like variable Washining. This is just about as good as it can get for an etymology.|$|E

30|$|Soil {{bulk density}} was {{determined}} by drying sieved soil at 105 °C and dividing the soil dry mass by the volume of soil cores, as recommended by Throop et al. (2012). <b>Stoniness</b> was assessed visually, by at least two persons, from the soil pit excavation. For each sampling depth range, stones (larger than the core diameter) that were removed by excavation were replaced in the pit to estimate pit volume (in %) that was occupied by stones. In each plot and for each depth, C stocks and nutrient stocks were calculated by multiplying soil C and nutrient concentrations with soil mass, with respect to soil bulk density and <b>stoniness.</b>|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{it should}} be {{mentioned}} that the particularly high variation in stone volume observed between poplar and herbaceous buffers at some sites (Magog and St-Isidore-de-Clifton) (Table  1) adds {{a great deal of}} variability to our soil C stock estimations. Small agricultural streams of southern Québec have often been straightened and dredged (Beaulieu 2001) and, as observed by the landowner of the St-Isidore-de-Clifton site, stones lying {{in the bottom of the}} stream have often been piled on stream banks (A. Doyon, pers. comm.). Soil <b>stoniness</b> at some sites also greatly complicates soil sampling. However, although costly and time consuming, <b>stoniness</b> estimations for stony soils is essential to increasing soil C estimate precision, because bulk density measurements with a soil corer alone will lead to overestimations (Andraski 1991; Vincent and Chadwick 1994; Throop et al. 2012).|$|E
