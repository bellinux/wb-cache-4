25|$|The present {{landscape}} {{shows the}} piecemeal {{nature of the}} mining. Although the lead industry began to decline in the late 17th century, it revived in the mid 19th century when tips were re-worked. Its mining history {{has given rise to}} street names such as Hind Pits Lane, Hollow Road, and Comrade Avenue. The old mines have also meant that the soil is heavily contaminated by heavy metals such as cadmium. This was investigated in 1979. Concentrations of cadmium, lead and zinc in local crops were higher than would normally be expected. Copper concentrations were normal, and the results for mercury showed that mercury translocation from soil to crops was very low. Dietary copper intakes at Shipham were a little lower than national average intakes. Four participants in the duplicate diet study, or 6% of the <b>study</b> <b>population,</b> had cadmium intakes higher than 0.4mg per week.|$|E
25|$|Some strong positives {{that have}} been {{identified}} in studies of military brat populations are a high occurrence of very resilient personalities, exceptional social skills, a high level of multicultural or international awareness, proficiency in foreign languages, and a statistically very strong affinity for careers that entail service to others. Studies show that ex-military kids end up pursuing service-related careers in very high numbers: military service, teaching, counseling, police, nursing and foreign service work being highly represented in military brat career statistics (in comparison to statistics on non-military brat patterns of employment choices). Mary Edwards Wertsch also identified a pattern (for those military brats who do not choose military service) of work that is more independent (self-employment / avoidance of direct subservience to authority figures) and along those lines also favoring creative and artistic professions that offer more independence. She also reported that for those military brats who did choose military service there was a tendency to go through a phase of bucking or testing authority during military service, or a pattern of resenting authority, represented in her <b>study</b> <b>population.</b> However, military brats who become soldiers also tend to do well overall in the profession.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, a large, {{comprehensive}} genome-wide linkage {{study of}} male sexual orientation {{was conducted by}} several independent groups of researchers.

The second study by Rice et al. in 1999 studied 52 pairs of Canadian gay brothers and found no statistically significant linkage in alleles and haplotypes. Consequently, they concluded against the possibility of any gene in the Xq28 region having a large genetic influence on male sexual orientation (though they could not rule out the possibility of a gene in this region having a small influence). Rice et al. also asserted that their results do not exclude the possibility of finding male homosexuality genes elsewhere in the genome. Hamer criticized the study for not selecting families for their <b>study</b> <b>population</b> based on maternal transmission as selecting only families that show an excess of maternal gay relatives is necessary to detect the Xq28 linkage. A meta-analysis of all [...] data available at that time (i.e., Hamer et al. (1993), Hu et al. (1995), Rice et al. (1999), and the unpublished 1998 study by Sanders et al.) indicated that Xq28 has a significant but not exclusive role in male sexual orientation.|$|E
