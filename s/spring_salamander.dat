Texas species within the genus Eurycea inhabit springs, springruns, and water-bearing karst formations of the Edwards Aquifer (Chippindale, 1993). These salamanders are aquatic and neotenic, meaning they retain a larval, gill-breathing morphology throughout their lives.

When attacked, it turns its tail towards the predator and emits a sticky, noxious mucus. It may bite {{the head of a}} snake or twine its tail round its head. Another defensive strategy is the autotomisation of its tail, which may leave the predator a tasty morsel while the salamander flees.|$|E

50|$|Desmognathus organi {{undergoes}} direct {{development to}} bypass the aquatic larval stage. This is a unique trait of D. organi and the other small Desmognathus species D. wrighti and D. aeneus, allowing them {{to be the most}} terrestrial species of the genus. Most Desmognathus species rely on a water source to lay their eggs and mature in the water for the first stage of their lives, but by hatching as small adult salamanders, D. organi can survive in wooded areas away from streams. D. organi have been reported climbing trees as high as 2 meters off the ground, and this is believed to be a method for catching prey or escaping predation. Males reach reproductive maturity by 3.5 yrs old, and females mature by 4.5. Mating occurs in fall and spring, and involves the males biting on to the female's tail to initiate the mating process. In a typical Plethodontidae mating behaviour, the pair will then walk in a line with the female straddling the male's tail and the male will then deposit a spermatophore on the ground and guide the female to it so she may pick it up with her cloaca. This is how they achieve internal fertilization, and the female will lay a clutch averaging 3-10 eggs in a seepage area or wherever she can find moist ground and stay nearby to protect them. Finding a moist place to lay the eggs is only necessary so the eggs do not dry out, as once the eggs hatch the hatchlings will not live in water. D. organi can be found mostly on the forest floor under moss, leaf litter, fallen logs, or small stones. It has been observed that they seem to prefer smaller covers of woody debris rather larger covers, such as big rocks.D. organi will overwinter in clusters underground in seepage areas, often communally. In 1959, James Organ uncovered as many as 649 individuals from a single nesting/hibernating site in a seep. During spring through fall, D. organi will be mostly active at night and when it rains, and will hunt small invertebrates such as mites, moths, small beetles, and spiders. Predators of D. organi may include the <b>spring</b> <b>salamander</b> (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus), larger Desmognathus species such as the blackbellied salamander (D. quadromaculatus), small snakes like the ringneck (Diadophis punctatus), carabid beetles, and birds.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} city-dwelling humans {{currently}} exceeds {{half of the}} world’s population {{and is expected to}} increase in the future (Meyer et al. 2005; Barrett and Price 2014); however, urban development significantly alters the surrounding ecological community. Urbanization increases the amount of impervious surfaces on the landscape, fragments or destroys habitats, produces pollutants and nutrient contaminants, promotes the introduction and invasion of non-native species, increases disease transmission, and alters biotic communities (Allan 2004; Bar-Massada et al. 2014). The manifestation of urbanization in stream ecosystems is a number of consistent symptoms collectively known as urban stream syndrome (Walsh et al. 2005; Hamer and McDonnell 2008). Urban streams typically have flashier hydrographs, increased sediment and pollutant loads, and altered channel morphology and stability (Walsh et al. 2005; Hamer and McDonnell 2008). These ecosystem changes reduce biotic richness, leaving a predominance of tolerant, generalist species in urban streams (Walsh et al. 2005; Hamer and McDonnell 2008). Urbanization currently threatens {{more than one-third of the}} world’s known amphibian species (Hamer and McDonnell 2008). Urban development has been linked to reduced amphibian species richness, declines in individual species occurrence and abundance, loss of genetic diversity and population isolation, and altered biotic communities and interactions (Hamer and McDonnell 2008; Barrett and Price 2014). Moreover, salamanders make up a considerable portion of the vertebrate biomass in forest and wetland ecosystems (Burton and Liken 1975; Hamer and McDonnell 2008; Barrett and Price 2014). Thus, severe declines or extirpation of salamander populations will have a substantial influence on nutrient cycling and trophic interactions in the riparian ecosystem (Barrett and Price 2014). In southern New England, reforestation has occurred since the 1850 ’s along with the establishment of low-density residential communities beginning in the 1920 ’s (Foster 1992). Reforestation plateaued by the mid- 1970 ’s with forest conversion to residential land use resulting in forest loss during the last 20 - 30 years in southern New England (Jeon et al. 2014). Today, exurban development, defined as human housing density of 6 - 25 houses per square kilometer (Hansen et al. 2015), dominates the landscape (Foster 1992; Jeon et al. 2014). Despite exurban development being the fastest growing form of land use in the United States since the 1950 ’s (Hansen et al. 2005), the range of ecological effects that occur within exurban development are not well understood (Bar-Massada et al. 2014). In southern New England, we are just now beginning to understand how wildlife populations persist over multiple decades in this landscape of second growth forest intermixed with exurban development. Addressing the challenges of urban stream syndrome and amphibian declines will require a basic understanding of species-specific amphibian ecology, identification of multi-scale and interactive drivers of population declines, and a multi-scale approach to management (Hamer and McDonnell 2008; Barrett and Price 2014; Semlitsch et al. 2017). Preventing salamander population declines within exurban development requires identifying what features of an exurban landscape influence population dynamics. Thus, I examined the influence of multi-scale drivers on stream salamander occupancy, abundance, and reproduction in the exurban landscape of eastern Connecticut. Moreover, my thesis addresses a recent call for research that examines species-specific responses to urbanization, focuses on gradients of housing development, and highlights the potential legacy effects associated with housing development (Hamer and McDonnell 2008; Barrett and Price 2014). Connecticut is home to three species of stream-dwelling salamander species. The northern <b>spring</b> <b>salamander,</b> Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, is restricted to a few known locations and thus not included here.
