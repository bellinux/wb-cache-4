The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-pattée and two <b>strawberry</b> <b>leaves.</b> A fourth style, including four crosses-pattée and four <b>strawberry</b> <b>leaves,</b> {{is used for the}} children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns.

The Duke was alive to the feeling that as the girl was {{certainly}} his niece and as she {{was not to be}} regarded as a thoroughly bad girl, some assistance was due to her from the family.

40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} hydrodistilled oils of the leaves of Psidium guajava L. (guava leaf) and Psidium cattleianum Sabine (strawberry guava) was determined by GC/MS analysis to identify their chemotypes. Moreover, in vitro antimicrobial activity of these volatile oils against selected bacteria, yeast, and mycelia fungi was studied. The yield of the volatile oil hydrodistilled from the leaves of P. guajava L. and P. cattleianum Sabine was 1. 6 and 2. 69 g/kg on fresh weight basis, respectively. Limonene was the major identified hydrocarbon in P. guava leaves’ oil (54. 70 %), whereas, 1, 8 -cineole was the major identified oxygenated monoterpenoid (32. 14 %) in common guava leaves. The foliar oil of P. cattleianum was predominated by the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon; β-caryophyllene representing 28. 83 % of the total oil make-up. The antibacterial activity of guava leaf oil was more pronounced against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than that of <b>strawberry</b> guava <b>leaves,</b> while P. cattleianum showed a higher activity against ess. The MIC of the volatile oil of the leaves of P. guajava against S. aureus was 6. 75 μg/ml, while that of P. cattleianum exhibited MIC value of 13. 01 μg/ml against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Results demonstrated that the volatile oil of both Psidium species showed different chemotypes. Moreover, the volatile oils of guava and <b>strawberry</b> guava <b>leaves</b> might be good candidates as antimicrobial agents...|$|R

40|$|This study set out {{to compare}} plant {{function}} and performance of strawberry clover to that of white clover. To test this, the two species were exposed to drought for 4 weeks under controlled environmental conditions. Water stress reduced the size and dry matter of white clover leaves by more than 50 %, whereas <b>strawberry</b> clover <b>leaves</b> remained unaffected. White clover photosynthesis decreased by nearly 50 % under drought, accompanied by a reduction in leaf water status (water potential) {{by more than one}} third. In contrast, strawberry clover maintained a higher water status, photosynthesis and transpiration rate under drought than white clover. In addition, we observed drought-induced reductions in white clover leaf quality, including lower nitrogen levels. We conclude that strawberry clover displays drought resistance in a number of key leaf parameters. The findings suggest value in testing strawberry clover as a complement or alternative to white clover in droughtprone pasture environments...|$|R

40|$|An {{amplicon}} metagenomic approach {{based on}} the ITS 2 region of fungal rDNA was used to identify the composition of fungal communities associated with different <b>strawberry</b> organs (<b>leaves,</b> flowers, immature and mature fruits), grown on a farm using management practices that entailed the routine use of various chemical pesticides.

Strawberry plants supported a high diversity of microbial organisms, but two genera, Botrytis and Cladosporium, were the most abundant, representing 70 - 99 % of the relative abundance (RA) of all detected sequences. According to alpha and beta diversity analyses, strawberry organs displayed significantly different fungal communities with leaves having the most diverse fungal community, followed by flowers, and fruit. The interruption of chemical treatments for one month resulted in a significant modification {{in the structure of}} the fungal community of leaves and flowers while immature and mature fruit were not significantly affected.

40|$|Physical {{exclusion}} {{shows some}} {{potential as a}} novel root weevil control strategy, but barriers to root weevil immigration may also exclude beneficial insects, such as ground beetles. A field study was undertaken in 1997 {{to assess the impact}} of two physical barriers—portable plastic trenches and aluminum fences with Teflon tape—on root weevil and ground beetle immigration into plots of strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa (Duchesne). Barypeithes pellucidus (Boheman) and Nemocestes incomptus (Horn), each comprised 43 % of the root weevils caught at the site. Most (86 %) of the ground beetles caught in control plots were longer than 1 cm, the width of the gap in the portable trench top. Trenches excluded 75 and 63 % of B. pellucidus and N. incomptus, respectively, without significantly reducing immigration of large (< 1 cm) ground beetles. Fences excluded 65, 84, and 99 % of B. pellucidus, N. incomptus, and large ground beetles, respectively. Adding diatomaceous earth to trenches did not increase their efficacy, and fences without Teflon tape excluded ground beetles but not root weevils. The reduction in the population of root weevils and other strawberry pests caused by the use of barriers reduced damage to <b>strawberry</b> plant <b>leaves</b> and increased <b>strawberry</b> plant survival relative to unprotected control plots. Advantages and disadvantages of these physical control tools are discussed with a view to creating superior tools for root weevil exclusion, compatible with an integrated pest management approach.

40|$|Three Mediterranean shrubs, Phillyrea latifolia L. (phillyrea), Arbutus unedo L. (strawberry tree), and Laurus nobilis L. (laurel), differing {{in their}} {{morphological}} and ecological response to water shortage, were exposed for 90 days to 0 or 110 ppb of ozone (O 3), 5 h each day. This yielded an accumulated exposure over of a threshold of 40 ppb (AOT 40) of 31. 5 ppm h over the 3 months experiment. These species showed differing responses to O 3 : laurel and phillyrea developed foliar chlorotic mottles on the adaxial surface of <b>leaves,</b> whereas <b>strawberry</b> tree <b>leaves</b> showed reddish interveinal stipple-like necrotic lesions. In all cases, however, foliar injury did not exceed 8 % of the sampled leaf area. At {{the end of}} the exposure period, O 3 -induced stomatal limitation caused significant decreases of net photosynthesis in strawberry tree and laurel, but not in phillyrea. The relative water content of the leaves was significantly decreased by O 3, especially in laurel and strawberry tree, suggesting the occurrence of drought stress. Electrical conductivity of leachates from foliar discs increased in response to the treatment, much more strongly in laurel and in strawberry tree than in phillyrea, suggesting an O 3 -dependent alteration of the membrane retention capacity. At {{the end of the}} experimental period, the activity of superoxide dismutase and the content of reduced glutathione, but not that of reduced ascorbate, were significantly increased in the ozonated <b>leaves</b> of <b>strawberry</b> tree and phillyrea, but not in laurel.
