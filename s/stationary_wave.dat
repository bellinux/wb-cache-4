40|$|This study {{examines}} mutual interactions between <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> and ice sheets using a dry atmospheric primitive-equation model coupled to a three-dimensional thermomechanical ice-sheet model. The {{emphasis is on}} how non-linear interactions between thermal and topographical forcing of the <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> influence the ice-sheet evolution by changing the ablation. Simulations are conducted in which a small ice cap, on an idealised Northern Hemisphere continent, evolves to an equilibrium continental-scale ice sheet. In the absence of <b>stationary</b> <b>waves,</b> the equilibrium ice sheet arrives at symmetric shape with a zonal equatorward margin. In isolation, the topographically induced <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> have essentially {{no impact on the}} equilibrium features of the ice sheet. The reason is that the temperature anomalies are located far from the equatorward ice margin. When forcing due to thermal cooling is added to the topographical forcing, thermally induced perturbation winds amplify the topographically induced stationary-wave response, which that serves to increase both the equatorward extent and the volume of the ice sheet. Roughly, a 10 % increase in the ice volume is reported here. Hence, the present study suggests that the topographically induced stationary-wave response can be substantially enhanced by the high albedo of ice sheets...|$|R

50|$|The {{technology}} {{works by}} probing an optical <b>stationary</b> <b>wave,</b> or {{the sum of}} the standing waves in the case of polychromatic light, created by a light to be analyzed. In a SWIFTS linear configuration (true Lippman configuration), the <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> is created by a single-mode waveguide ended by a fixed mirror. The <b>stationary</b> <b>wave</b> is regularly sampled on one side of a waveguide using nano-scattering dots. These dots are located in the evanescent field. These nanodots are characterized by an optical index difference with the medium in which the evanescent field is located. The light is then scattered around an axis perpendicular to the waveguide. For each dot, this scattered light is detected by a pixel aligned with this axis. The intensity detected is therefore proportional to the intensity inside the waveguide at the exact location of the dot. This results in a linear image of the interferogram. No moving parts are used. A mathematical function known as a Lippmann transform, similar to a Fourier transform, is then applied to this linear image and gives the spectrum of the light.|$|E

Instead, we suggest that quasistationary waves generated by the central Asian mountains may strongly affect North Pacific storminess by changing the year-to-year variability of westerly winds over the eastern Eurasian continent. Observational analyses indicate that the midwinter suppression of North Pacific storminess does not occur every year. Some years experience stronger and more meridionally confined zonal winds over the western North Pacific, leading to stronger midwinter suppression (Harnik and Chang 2004; Nakamura and Sampe 2002) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{steady-state}} primitive equations {{model is}} used to study the structure of <b>stationary</b> planetary <b>waves</b> in the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere. The zonal mean circulation is specified using observed January mean data, as is the wave structure at the lower boundary of 100 hPa. Experiments are performed using data from four years, 1982 - 84 and 1986. Numerical solutions are found for the structures of zonal wavenumbers 1 to 3 throughout the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere. In one series of experiments, a linear model is employed, with forcing only by <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> at the lower boundary. This model reproduces the gross features of the stratospheric <b>stationary</b> <b>waves,</b> but the wave amplitudes are much less than those observed in nature. In a second series of experiments, the January means of the transient vorticity and heat flux divergences are calculated using observed data, and applied as an additional forcing term in the model, along with the lower boundary forcing. The model yields significantly larger wave amplitudes, closer to those observed in nature, when forcing by transients is included. In a third series of experiments, a model which includes the nonlinear interactions among the <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> is employed, with forcing only by the waves at the lower boundary.

40|$|A local quasi-geostrophic {{energetics}} analysis {{indicates that}} within the jet core, low-frequency (LF) eddies behave baroclinically {{essentially the same as}} high-frequency (HF) eddies. They both have a westward tilting vertical structure and both grow baroclinically by transporting heat poleward and by converting eddy potential energy to kinetic energy. However, the difference in the horizontal orientations of HF and LF eddies has several important implications to their amplitude and peak locations, as well as their interaction with <b>stationary</b> <b>waves.</b> The barotropic decay of meridionally elongated HF eddies tends to terminate the growth of HF eddies beyond the jet exit region. The barotropic growth of the zonally elongated LF eddies not only ensure a continuous growth of LF eddies in the jet exit region, but also results in a new baroclinic growth of LF eddies farther downstream due to the presence of the west–east temperature contrast associated with <b>stationary</b> <b>waves.</b> The continuous growth of LF eddies due to both barotropic and baroclinic processes in the jet exit region is consistent with the facts that LF eddies reach maximum variability farther downstream of the two major jet streams and that the LF variability is much stronger than HF eddies. The results of energetics analysis are confirmed by the feedback analysis, showing that HF eddies, being dominated by meridional orientations, mainly act to maintain (damp) <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> by locally enhancing (reducing) north–south gradient of the height (temperature) field near the jet core regions. The zonally elongated LF eddies, on the other hand, act to primarily reduce the zonal gradient associated with <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> both barotropically and baroclinically. 1...|$|R

40|$|Geomorphological {{evidence}} of glaciations {{exist for the}} Last Glacial Maximum (about 20 kyr ago). At this time, both North America and Eurasia were covered by extensive ice sheets which are both absent today. However, the temporal and spatial evolution of the ice sheets from the previous interglacial up to the fully-glaciated conditions at LGM is still unresolved and remains a vexing question in climate dynamics. The evolution of ice sheets is essentially controlled by the prevailing climate conditions. On glacial time-scales, the climate is shaped the by the orbital variations of the Earth, but also by internal feedbacks within the climate system. In particular, the ice sheets themselves {{have the potential to}} change the climate within they evolve. This thesis focuses on the interactions between ice sheets and the time-mean atmospheric circulation (<b>stationary</b> <b>waves).</b> It is studied how the <b>stationary</b> <b>waves,</b> which are forced by the ice-sheet topography, influence ice-sheet evolution through changing the near-surface air temperature. In this thesis, it is shown that the degree of linearity of the atmospheric response controls to what extent the <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> can reorganise the structure of ice sheet. Provided that the response is linear, the <b>stationary</b> <b>waves</b> constitute a leading-order feedback, which serves to increase the volume and deform the shape of ice sheets. If the stationary-wave response to ice-sheet topography is nonlinear in character, the impact on the ice-sheet evolution tends to be weak. However, it is further shown that the amplitude of the nonlinear topographical response, and hence its effect on the ice-sheet evolution, can be significantly enhanced if thermal cooling over the ice sheets is taken into account.
