40|$|A {{thermomechanical}} {{model to}} describe the mechanisms of <b>polishing</b> pad <b>scratching</b> in chemical–mechanical planarization (CMP) has been formulated and investigated. CMP is a necessary process in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication to planarize wafers with nanoscale features after patterned layer deposition. Polishing pad asperities can produce microscale scratches on the wafer surface during CMP, reducing IC manufacturing yields. The constructed thermomechanical model accounts for stresses of the pad and wafer contact and also provides the means to track input energy dissipation during CMP. Tracking energy dissipation offers information about processes that may influence scratch production. This knowledge ultimately produces a greater physical understanding of CMP {{for the prevention of}} pad <b>scratching.</b> <b>Polishing</b> pad stress relaxation experiments demonstrate the importance of viscoelastic and plastic strain energy dissipation with its effects on the wafer stress field. Scratch producing ability of the polishing pad is found to decrease with use in CMP, with slurry soaking and increasing polishing time. Mechanical behavior of the polishing pad is demonstrated to differ when in compression and in tension. Compressibility of the pad material is shown to be significant in stress modeling through experimental measurement of polishing pad volume change. Differential scanning calorimetry of used polishing pad samples revealed energy dissipation into the polishing pad surface with increasing polishing time of CMP. Energy dissipation processes influence pad scratching in CMP. Analytical wafer stress field modeling unveils that the scratching ability of a polishing pad decreases when it is less stiff or has a smoother surface...|$|R

50|$|Another mode of {{passivation}} involves polishing. Mechanical polishing removes many surface impurities {{and crystal}} structure breaks that may promote corrosion.

40|$|International audienceWe {{demonstrate}} in {{this paper}} the influence of surface finish on the ageing kinetics of biomedical grade zirconia. The critical influence of polishing has been systematically investigated by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The stress state around <b>polishing</b> <b>scratches</b> gives rise to preferential transformation in the zone of the induced scratches and consequently to accelerated ageing. The influence of residual stresses is analyzed semi-quantitatively by preparing samples with various surface finish, thus with various stress states. Rough polishing produces a compressive surface stress layer beneficial for the ageing resistance, while smooth polishing produces preferential transformation nucleation around scratches. When a thermal treatment of 2 h at 1200 °C is applied to relax the residual stresses, all the surfaces states exhibit the same sensitivity to ageing. These results demonstrate that roughness alone cannot be used for ensuring a long-term stability. The variation of ageing sensitivity is indeed related indirectly to the surface roughness via the induced surface stress state. The current ISO standards {{are not able to}} take these effects into account. Indeed, great variations in ageing kinetics were observed for samples with different surface states, although all well below the ISO requirements...|$|R

This work is devoted to the {{relationship}} between external plasma parameters and substrate topography, and pPS coating morphology, which is investigated by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Stainless steel, gold and glass surfaces are used as substrates. It is clearly demonstrated that the film morphology can be controlled by adjustment of RF input power, pressure. The analysis performed further reveals that the pPS film's characteristics strongly depend on the substrate topography and its electrical potential during the discharge. Finally, the plasma duration also strongly influences the morphology of the films. The morphologies obtained include smooth films without any specific feature, worm-like structures, particles (nanometer- and micrometer-sized) associated along preferential directions and randomly distributed particles (micrometer-sized). The intrinsic topography of the substrate influences the film structure in the case of thin films (thickness lower than about 100 nm).

Bones accumulated on the floodplain through attritional mortality and are preserved unweathered except for surface <b>polish,</b> <b>scratches,</b> and mottling characteristic of bioturbation during rapid burial in fine-grained sediment. Fossil-bearing sites cluster stratigraphically in laterally extensive horizons between thicker less fossil-rich intervals of similar fluvial strata.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} solid scientific understanding of the creation and characteristics of surface fractures formed during the grinding and polishing of brittle materials, specifically glass. In this study, we have experimentally characterized the morphology, number density, and depth distribution of various surface cracks as a function of various grinding and polishing processes (blanchard, fixed abrasive grinding, loose abrasive, pitch polishing and pad polishing). Also, the effects of load, abrasive particle (size, distribution, foreign particles, geometry, velocity), and lap material (pitch, pad) were examined. The resulting data were evaluated in terms of indentation fracture mechanics and tribological interactions (science of interacting surfaces) leading to several models to explain crack distribution behavior of ground surfaces and to explain the characteristics of <b>scratches</b> formed during <b>polishing.</b> This project has greatly advanced the scientific knowledge of microscopic mechanical damage occurring during grinding and polishing and has been of general interest. This knowledge-base has also enabled the design and optimization of surface finishing processes to create optical surfaces with far superior laser damage resistance. There are five major areas of scientific progress {{as a result of this}} LDRD. They are listed in Figure 1 and described briefly in this summary below. The details of this work are summarized through a number of published manuscripts which are included this LDRD Final Report. In the first area of grinding, we developed a technique to quantitatively and statistically measure the depth distribution of surface fractures (i. e., subsurface damage) in fused silica as function of various grinding processes using mixtures of various abrasive particles size distributions. The observed crack distributions were explained using a model that extended known, single brittle indentation models to an ensemble of loaded, sliding particles. The model illustrates the importance of the particle size distribution of the abrasive and its influence on the resulting crack distribution. The results of these studies are summarized in references 1 - 7. In the second area of polishing, we conducted a series of experiments showing the influence of rogue particles (i. e., particles in the polishing slurry that are larger than base particles) on the creation of <b>scratches</b> on <b>polished</b> surfaces. <b>Scratches</b> can be thought of a as a specific type of sub-surface damage. The characteristics (width, length, type of fractures, concentration) were explained in terms of the rogue particle size, the rogue particle material, and the viscoelastic properties of the lap. The results of these studies are summarized in references 6 - 7. In the third area of etching, we conducted experiments aimed at understanding the effect of HF:NH{sub 4 }F acid etching on surface fractures on fused silica. Etching can be used as a method: (a) to expose sub-surface mechanical damage, (b) to study the morphology of specific mechanical damage occurring by indentation, and (c) to convert a ground surface containing a high concentration of sub-surface mechanical damage into surface roughness. Supporting models have been developed to describe in detail the effect of etching on the morphology and evolution of surface cracks. The results of these studies are summarized in references 8 - 9. In the fourth area of scratch forensics or scratch fractography, a set of new scratch forensic rule-of-thumbs were developed in order to aid the optical fabricator and process engineer to interpret the cause of scratches and digs on surfaces. The details of how these rules were developed are described in each of the references included in this summary (1 - 9). Figure 2 provides as a summary of some of the more commonly used rules-of-thumbs that have been developed in this study.

40|$|Copper single {{crystals}} {{were grown}} in a modified Czochralski system. The "grown-in" dislocations and those introduced through selective <b>scratching</b> of the <b>polished</b> (111) surfaces were observed using Berg-Barrett X-ray topography and Borrmann transmission topographic methods. Several {{aspects of the}} dislocation images may be understood {{on the basis of}} pure dynamical or kinematical theories of X-ray diffraction. Some observations, however, support the theory that both dynamical and kinematic effects must be considered to properly describe the experimental results. Stereo depth measurements of the dislocation images were taken under four sets of X-ray geometries. The minimum range of depths observed, approximately 1. 0 to 2. 0 ?m from the surface, was obtained for both methods of Berg-Barrett stereo topography. The Borrmann transmission topographs provided an image depth range of approximately 3. 0 ?m from the exit surface to 270 ?m from the exit surface. This latter value is equivalent to the crystal thickness, to the accuracy of the present data. Comparison of reflection (Berg-Barrett) and transmission (Borrmann) topographs of the same crystal showed that no image of an individual dislocation on one topograph had a corresponding image on the second topograph. An attempt to mark the surface of the crystal by vapor depositing gold dot "absorbers" on the surface was not completely satisfactory due to a shadowing effect in Berg-Barrett topography. The apparent epitaxial growth of the gold dots on the (111) copper surface and the corresponding strain field in the crystal around the dots provided a reference surface for transmission topography, although the true surface was marked only in the asymmetric stereo topographs. Computer simulation using finite element analysis is proposed to solve the problems of X-ray image formation...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} new image-analysis {{techniques}} that, {{for the first}} time, provide a practical {{solution to the problem}} of fully automated counting of fission tracks in natural minerals, a long-desired goal in fission-track dating. Specific challenges to be overcome have been the discrimination of fission tracks from non-track defects, <b>polishing</b> <b>scratches,</b> etc.; resolving multiple track overlaps; and reliable identification of small tracks amongst a similarly sized background of surface defects, fluid inclusions, etc. Most previous attempts at automated image analysis have failed in one or more of these tasks. The central component of our system is called ‘coincidence mapping’ and utilizes two images of the same tracks obtained in transmitted and reflected light. The complementary nature of the information in these two images allows a powerful discrimination of true fission tracks from most non-track features. The much smaller average track size in the reflected light image allows the resolution of most track overlaps apparent in transmitted light. The discrimination is achieved by segmenting the two images using a custom-developed thresholding routine and extracting the coincidence of features in the two binary images. The analysis is computationally efficient and takes only a few seconds to complete the processing of images that may contain up to many hundreds of tracks. Preliminary indications are that error rates are about the same as, or better than, those achieved by a human operator using normal counting conditions in transmitted light. The performance is even better at high track densities (&# 62; 107 cm– 2) giving the potential for measuring track densities up to an order of magnitude greater than a human operator can count. Automated counting should significantly increase the speed and consistency of analysis and improve data quality in fission-track dating through better counting statistics, increased objectivity and measurement of additional track description parameters that are not currently determined...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I report on {{studies of the}} {{magnetization}} reversal process in ultrathin films of Fe/Cu(100) grown at 80 K. In {{the vicinity of the}} spin-reorientation transition, magnetization reversal was found to take place via formation of stripe domains with submicron stripe width. Imaging of such stripe-domain patterns requires high-resolution magnetic microscopy that can be operated in external magnetic fields. The present studies were performed by a scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) operated in situ at variable temperature, and in the presence of external magnetic fields. The SNOM is the first to be operated in ultrahigh vacuum. Magnetic domain contrast arises from the magneto-optical Kerr effect, which is measured by a Sagnac interferometer. Such interferometer is exclusively sensitive to non-reciprocal phase shifts between right and left circularly polarized light beams. It ignores all other kinds of polarization changes that often lead to artifacts in magneto-optical SNOM. The Sagnac interferometer also provides a total-intensity signal which can be used for the tip-to-sample distance control. The lateral resolution of the instrument is 300 nm (at a wavelength of 670 nm), and the magneto-optical sensitivity amounts to 350 &# 956;rad, which is sufficient to image domain stripes of a few monolayers thick films. The observed stripe widths are in good agreement with theoretical predictions connecting stripe width and saturation field. By applying external magnetic fields, the transformation of the stripe-domain pattern could be studied. It occurs in a non-continuous growth process, governed by pinning of domain walls to local inhomogeneities of film and substrate, e. g. <b>polishing</b> <b>scratches.</b> Based on the experimental results, I propose a model of the magnetization-reveral process via nucleation and growth of stripe domains. It explains the shape of the corresponding magnetization curves measured by the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) as well as previous Kerr-microscopy results...|$|R
40|$|In the {{fabrication}} of ultra-large-scale integrated (ULSI) semiconductor devices, the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process is extensively employed. During the CMP process, undesirable scratches are produced on Cu interconnects {{both by the}} abrasive particles in the slurry and by the softer pad asperities. In {{order to meet the}} stringent demands of precision <b>polishing,</b> <b>scratching</b> must be mitigated or eliminated. This thesis presents scratching models by analytical contact mechanics, finite element analysis, and statistical methods. First, scratching due to hard, abrasive particles was modeled and expressions for the maximum and minimum scratch width and depth were determined. Second, scratching of a hard surface by a softer body, specifically the scratching of a Cu coating by a soft pad asperity, was modeled. It was first assumed that the asperity deforms linear elastically up to the onset of yielding. A Hertzian pressure distribution in contact with a coating, with and without friction, was modeled to determine the maximum contact pressure that can induce yielding in the coating. It was then assumed that the pad asperity deforms fully-plastically. A uniform pressure distribution in contact with a coating, with and without friction, was modeled to determine the maximum contact pressure required to induce yielding in the coating. The maximum pressure was then related to the pad asperity hardness for both contact pressure distributions. Finally, statistical asperity contact models were developed to relate the pad asperity radius of curvature to the type of asperity deformation, i. e. elastic at the onset of yielding or fully-plastic. As a result of these models, expressions that relate Cu coating scratching to the ratio of pad-to-coating hardness, coefficient of friction, and pad asperity radius of curvature were developed. The scratching by pad asperity models were validated by performing single and multi-asperity sliding experiments. The effects of pad hardness, pad asperity radius of curvature, and coefficient of friction were related to the frequency and severity of scratching. by Thor Eusner. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{growth of}} TiN on {{cemented}} carbide, deposited by {{chemical vapour deposition}} (CVD), was studied. Today TiN {{is used as a}} seeding layer between the cemented carbide and the following layer. Previous experiments have shown that the coverage is uneven on the cemented carbide surface showing pits with a different growth than {{the main part of the}} surface. These pits most likely occur on some of the WC surfaces. Therefore the growth and orientation relation between the two phases were examined. Cemented carbide specimens were deposited with TiN under two different pressures and with different deposition time to give a layer as thick as the seeding layer used in the production and one about ten times thicker to study growth after the whole surface had been covered. Two pre-treatments where used on the specimens; one which were polishing with diamond and the other where the specimens were boiled in acid to remove the binder phase and expose the WC surfaces. The specimens were studied using XRD and a SEM equipped with EDS and EBSD detectors. The pictures taken with SEM showed that initial growth occurred at grain boundaries and <b>polishing</b> <b>scratches.</b> It also showed that growth occurred on all surfaces, which were confirmed by EDS. Both processes showed about the same appearance in the thinner layers but very different appearance in the thicker. This was confirmed by XRD were the thinner layers showed about the same result while the thicker ones differ from one another. Thus further growth is dependent on the parameters of the CVD process and not the surface beneath. EBSD showed an orientation relation between TiN and WC crystals in both processes. The process at lower pressure gave much finer grains which were difficult to index with EBSD, giving results in only three points. The process at higher pressure gave coarser grains which were more easily indexed. The relations WC{ 0001 }-TiN{ 110 }, giving WC{ 101 ̅ 0 }-TiN{ 100 }, and WC{ 0001 }-TiN{ 111 }, giving WC{ 101 ̅ 0 }-TiN{ 211 }, could be seen in more than one point. These results are consistent with previous studies of the growth of TiC on WC. This comparison between TiC and TiN makes it possible to draw the conclusion that also Ti(C,N) should behave the same. It also shows an orientation relation that is consistent no matter what WC plane is on the surface. The poor growth and the pits depend on the growth orientation of TiN on each specific WC surface...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} a number of aspects {{governing}} the transformation of gibbsite, via intermediate phases, to #alpha#-alumina. These aspects include the size and morphology of the gibbsite grains, the influence of additions of foreign elements, the effect of a mechanical treatment of the gibbsite prior to calcination, and combinations of these factors. The materials were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and surface area measurements. For some of the calcined materials an attempt was made to sinter the powders to a dense body to investigate if any of the treatments during calcination had an effect on this process. The literature review covers the current state of understanding of the production of bulk alumina powder by the Bayer process and the phase changes seen on calcination of precursors to the stable #alpha#-alumina phase. A detailed description of the phase changes is given and the various routes and conditions necessary for the transformations to occur are considered. The transformations are examined in relation to the morphology of the crystals and the variables controlling the phase transformation route are discussed. Calcination in air showed that the size of the gibbsite grain governs the calcination route taken to reach oc-alumina. The standard gibbsites used in this work show a mixed calcination sequence transforming both via the boehmite phase, followed by the #gamma#, #delta# and #theta# phases, and via the #chi# and #kappa# phases. The formation of boehmite is attributed to retention of water vapour within the grain. Differences in morphology of the starting materials showed that for the range of materials seen, the morphology of the grain is less important than its size. The super fine material confirmed that a small grain size transforms via the non-boehmite route only, with the other gibbsites taking intermediate routes as for the standard gibbsites. Of the additions made prior to calcination, aluminium fluoride was found to reduce the transformation temperature to #alpha#-alumina by approximately 300 deg. C. Other additions had little effect on the transformation temperature although a reduction in grain size was seen with aluminium chloride. It was found that good mixing of the alumina fluoride was essential to obtain reliable and reproducible results. This is due to the small amounts of additive that are needed and the sensitivity of the process to concentration variations. Mineralisation of a range of gibbsites showed that the presence of sodium in the starting material was crucial in reducing the calcination temperature. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} sodium and fluoride react to form a liquid phase. The presence of a liquid phase increases the mobility of the aluminium and oxygen atoms resulting in a reduction of the transformation temperature. Fluoride additions to the gibbsites with different morphologies showed that the presence of sodium was the governing factor in reduction of the transformation temperature. Milling of the starting materials showed that there was a small reduction in the transformation temperature between some of the phases. The energy involved in milling leads to activation of the gibbsite. This activation takes the form of a reduction in the grain size and in a reduction of the crystallinity seen in the XRD pattern. Fluoride additions during the calcination of sapphire with a standard gibbsite powder showed preferential grain growth. It was possible to initiate growth of small plate-like crystals on the polished surface of a piece of sapphire parallel to the basal plane. Crystal growth was also seen in <b>scratches</b> on a <b>polished</b> surface perpendicular to the basal plane.

40|$|The Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) experiment, an {{instrument}} suite to be flown on Mars Surveyor 2001, {{will include a}} tool for doing simple mineralogical scratch and streak tests on particles from the Martian regolith. The Abrasion Tool will be applied to particles that adhere themselves to highly polished substrates of various hardnesses. Granular soil components will be subjected to a compressive force of about 3 N using a leaf spring. The spring will be applied with a paraffin actuator capable of a 0. 76 mm throw to achieve a maximum displacement of about 7. 5 mm {{at the tip of}} the tool. The pressure per grain will be dependent on the grain size, the number of grains that adhere to the substrate and the number of grains in compression. The pressure per particle is expected to be on the order of 100 MPa - 1 GPa. The MECA sample wheel containing the substrates will be rotated after the particles are placed in compression to produce scratches or pits. A primary goal of the Abrasion Tool is to identify quartz (Mohs' hardness = 7) using substrates of varying hardnesses. Quartz is considered hazardous to future human explorers of Mars because it can cause silicosis of the lungs if it is of respirable size. It is also hazardous to machinery, structures, and space suits because of its ability to abrade and scratch surfaces. Since large quantities of minerals harder than quartz are not expected, any <b>scratches</b> produced on <b>polished</b> quartz substrates might be reasonably attributed to quartz particles, although there may be minerals such as impact metamorphic diamond in the soils. Careful calibration of the tool will be necessary to ensure that grains are not overloaded; for example, a steel ball pressed into glass will produce a Hertzian fracture, even though it is softer than glass. Other minerals, such as magnetite (Mohs' hardness = 6. 5) have been shown to scratch glass ceramics such as Zerodur (Mohs' hardness = 6. 5). Thus, minerals can be differentiated: note that regardless of the mineral species, if any particle is harder than 6. 5 it will certainly be an interesting discovery for both planetary geology and human exploration concerns. The scratches will be identified using the 6 X optical microscope and profiled with the atomic force microscope included in the MECA instrument suite. Analysis of the scratch morphology will yield evidence concerning the shape of the particle responsible for producing each scratch. For example, angular grains should leave vertical cracks with microconchoidal lateral chipping, while rounded grains might leave chatter marks, or nested partial Hertzian cracks. Particle shape can thus be inferred from these indentation modes, as well as material hardness. In addition, particle size information may also be available if pits caused by rolling particles can be identified. Converse to scratching, the minerals may be crushed at their contact points, and be smeared onto the target substrates to leave what geologists refer to as "streaks". These are cold-welded trails of mineral material that have structure and color indicative of mineral composition. The AFM will determine the morphology of these streaks, while the microscope will ascertain the color. On the harder substrates, we might expect streaking to dominate; on the softer substrates, scratching may dominate. Progressions of material interactions across the substrate selection will be a valuable source of data for mineral discrimination. It should also be noted that many minerals have coatings (such as iron oxides), and these will have to be differentiated from the host mineral grains; laboratory tests will establish the effects of such coatings on the scratch results. Finally, we note that the microscope will provide corroborative data regarding likely mineral species by grain shapes, fracture patterns, surface textures, color, and UV fluorescence reactions.
