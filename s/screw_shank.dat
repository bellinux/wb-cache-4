40|$|Titanium {{prostheses}} are artificial components {{used during}} cranioplasty, {{which can be}} made with the Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF). To repair the craniofacial defects, the implant must be fixed to the skull, so an adequate anchoring system is necessary. Because there are no specific guidelines regarding this system, the aim {{of this study was to}} present a methodology for the identification of the optimal <b>screw</b> <b>shank</b> diameter and the overlap length, considering different damage areas and accidental external loads. In this method, a numerical model for structural analysis, a statistical approach and a metamodeling technique were coupled. The results demonstrate that this methodology can be used as a decision support tool in the titanium prostheses design, ensuring the best anchorage...|$|E
40|$|The {{roofing nail}} is an {{important}} and often a limiting factor in successfully using metal building sheets. This study has been directed toward {{an analysis of the}} problems involved and the comparative performance of typical special nails offered commercially for fastening building sheets. All nails used for fastening steel sheets exposed to the weather should have a protective coating such as galvanizing, and a head which will exclude moisture from the hole made by the nail. The tendency of nails to 2 ̆ 2 creep 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 or move outward without any apparent cause, thus necessitating renailing, has been a troublesome problem. No definite conclusions have been reached regarding the causes of this phenomenon, but some suggestions are offered for its remedy. Forces exerted by the wind and by the expansion and contraction of the metal due to changes in temperature may have some influence in loosening the nail. Creeping of nails from asphalt roofing and from boxes, however, shows that internal forces are probably of major importance. These may be the minute changes in dimension and character of the wood as it absorbs or gives up moisture. <b>Screw</b> <b>shank</b> nails probably creep less than plain shank nails, and it appears that ring shank nails will not creep. Many failures have been the result of using poor nailing girts or of carelessness {{on the part of the}} workman in failing to hit the girt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{load bearing}} steel deck {{is used in}} {{insulated}} metal deck roofing system for industrial buildings with low-pitched roof areas. The steel sheeting sections are manufactured with cold forming from thin steel strip and {{are attached to the}} underlying purlins or more commonly straight to the steel trusses by self-drilling or self-tapping screws. The behavior of sheeting connections is important in fire especially when the sheeting is in catenary action and tensile forces are devel-oped at supports where the screw connectors are located. A 3 D finite element model is created using ABAQUS software to simulate the single lap screw connections connecting thinner sheet (0. 8 mm) to thicker sheet (10 mm) under static shear at both room and high temperatures. This model considers the material nonlinearity, large deformation and contact behav-ior. The connection model is analyzed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure. The analysis reveals that the failure modes of the connection for both room and elevated temperatures are bearing failure of the thinner sheet. The load bearing capacity of the connections depends on the friction between the washer and the thinner sheet, the direct bearing of the <b>screw</b> <b>shank</b> against the thinner sheet and the postbuckling resistance of thinner sheet. Degradation of material at ele-vated temperature further reduces the strength and stiffness of the connections. This connection model can be taken as a component model in the analysis of the behavior of steel sheeting system in fire, which is highly non-linear so as to save the computing time...|$|E

30|$|The {{structural}} glulam members fabricated with rapid-grown Japanese cedar plantation timber {{were constructed}} into a beam–girder structure with self-tapping screws to evaluate characteristic strength {{properties of the}} connection {{for the purpose of}} wood-framed construction application. It is suggested that self-tapping screws with 10  mm diameter showed better joint performance in maximum load capacity and dissipated energy than did 8  mm screw connections. Self-tapping screws with fully threaded shanks showed better initial stiffness on the joint than did half-threaded screw connections, but also showed less ductility. Further, both fully threaded and double-threaded sections also provided the joint with higher maximum load and better dissipated energy than did connections using <b>screws</b> with half-threaded <b>shank.</b> The nailing approach of using self-tapping screws is a key to influencing the structural performance of a joint. The results indicated that toe-nailing approach is superior to the face-nailing approach in the maximum load capacity, initial stiffness, and dissipated energy of a beam–girder connection. A self-tapping screw connection with derived allowable loading capacity for Japanese cedar glulam structure could compete as a viable bolt connection for use in wood-framed construction.|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{stimulus}} evoked electromyography (EMG) {{is commonly}} used to confirm the accuracy of pedicle screw placement. There are no studies to differentiate between solid screws and hollow screws to the electrical resistance of pedicle screws. We speculate that the electrical resistance of the solid and hollow pedicle screws may be different and then a potential source of error with stimulus-evoked EMG may happen. Materials and Methods: Resistance measurements were obtained from 12 pedicle screw varieties (6 screws of each manufacturer) across the <b>screw</b> <b>shank</b> based on known constant current and measured voltage. The voltage was measured 5 times at each site. Results: Resistance of all solid screws ranged from 0. 084 Omega to 0. 151 Omega (mean = 0. 118 +/- 0. 024 Omega) and hollow screws ranged from 0. 148 Omega to 0. 402 Omega (mean = 0. 285 +/- 0. 081 Omega). There {{was a significant difference}} of resistance between the solid screws and hollow screws (P < 0. 05). The screw with the largest diameter no matter solid screws or hollow screws had lower resistance than screws with other diameters. No matter in solid screws group or hollow screws group, there were significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the 5. 0 mm screws and 6. 0 mm screws, 6. 0 mm screws and 7. 0 mm screws, 5. 0 mm screws and 7. 0 mm screws, 4. 5 mm screws and 5. 5 mm screws, 5. 5 mm screws and 6. 5 mm screws, 4. 5 mm screws and 6. 5 mm screws. The resistance of hollow screws was much larger than the solid screws in the same diameter group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Hollow pedicle screws have the potential for high electrical resistance compared to the solid pedicle screws and therefore may affect the EMG response during stimulus-evoked EMG testing in pedicle screw fixation especially in minimally invasive percutaneous pedical screw fixation surgery.

40|$|C 1 – 2 {{polyaxial}} screw-rod fixation is {{a relatively}} new technique. While recognizing the potential for inadvertent vertebral artery injury, there have been few reports in the literature outlining all the possible complications. Aim {{of this study is to}} review all cases of C 1 lateral mass screws insertion with emphasis on the evaluation of potential structures at risk during the procedure. We retrospectively reviewed all patients in our unit who had C 1 lateral mass screw insertion over a 2 -year period. The C 1 lateral mass screw was inserted as part of an atlantoaxial stabilization or incorporated into a modular occiput/subaxial construct. Outcome measures included clinical and radiological parameters. Clinical indicators included age, gender, neurologic status, surgical indication and the number of levels stabilized. Intraoperative complications including blood loss, vertebral artery injury or dural tears were recorded. Postoperative pain distribution and neurological deficit were recorded. Radiological indicators included postoperative plain radiographs to assess sagittal alignment and to check for screw malposition or construct failure. A total of 18 lateral mass screws were implanted in 9 patients. There were three male and six female patients who had C 1 lateral mass screw insertion in this unit. Two patients had atlantoaxial stabilization for C 2 fracture. There were four patients with rheumatoid arthritis whose C 1 lateral mass screws were inserted as part of an occipitocervical or subaxial cervical stabilization. There was no vertebral artery injury, no cerebrospinal fluid leak and minimal blood loss in all patients. Three patients developed postoperative occipital neuralgia. This neuralgia was transient, in one of the patients having settled at 6 -week follow-up. In the other two patients the neuralgia was unresolved at time of latest follow-up but was adequately controlled with appropriate pain management. Postoperatively no patient had radiographic evidence of construct failure and all demonstrated excellent sagittal alignment. It has been reported that the absence of threads on the upper portion of the long <b>shank</b> <b>screw</b> may protect against neural irritation. However, insertion of the C 1 lateral mass screw necessitates careful caudal retraction of the C 2 dorsal root ganglion. The insertion point for the C 1 lateral mass screw is at the junction of the C 1 posterior arch and the midpoint of the posterior inferior part of the C 1 lateral mass. Two patients in our series suffered occipital neuralgia post-insertion of C 1 lateral mass screws. This highlights the potential for damage to the C 2 nerve root during C 1 lateral mass screw placement...|$|R
