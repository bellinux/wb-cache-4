5000|$|A <b>swing</b> <b>saw</b> is also {{sometimes}} called a cut-off trim saw in a mill for cutting right {{angle to the}} direction of the wood grain. A <b>swing</b> <b>saw</b> is a very dangerous tool, even with a blade guard. Early models were driven by a belt, usually made of leather, that was powered by a water mill or later a steam engine. Today the power source is an electric motor or a gas engine ...|$|E
50|$|A {{pendulum}} saw or <b>swing</b> <b>saw</b> is a mechanically powered circular saw with the blade mounted {{so it can}} swing into the material.|$|E
50|$|Ice cutting {{is still}} in use today for ice and snow {{sculpture}} events. A <b>swing</b> <b>saw</b> is used to get ice out of a river for the Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival each year. A <b>swing</b> <b>saw</b> {{is also used to}} cut ice out from the frozen surface of the Songhua River, China. Many ice sculptures are made from the ice harvested this way. In some countries at high latitudes, even ice hotels and ice palaces are made.|$|E
50|$|In February 2008, Aguilar won {{his first}} European Tour event at the Astro Indonesia Open. He birdied the final hole while the {{erstwhile}} leader Jeev Milkha Singh bogeyed for a two shot <b>swing</b> that <b>saw</b> the Chilean win by one stroke.|$|R

50|$|In 1946, the CPR and {{the provincial}} Ministry of Transportation {{came to an}} {{agreement}} that saw the bridge modified to permit road vehicle traffic in addition to rail traffic. As a result, operation of the <b>swing</b> span <b>saw</b> the span left in the closed position to permit both rail and road vehicle traffic to cross, although a CPR employee was stationed at the bridge to open the swing span should it be required for marine traffic.|$|R
60|$|And thereat {{he rolled}} over on his side and was off to sleep. Joe envied him. About {{three in the morning}} he heard French Pete crawl up for'ard and rummage around {{in the eyes of the}} boat. Joe looked on curiously, and by the dim light of the wildly <b>swinging</b> sea-lamp <b>saw</b> him drag out two spare coils of line. These he took up on deck, and Joe knew he was bending them on to the hawsers to make them still longer.|$|R
50|$|Kerber had a {{successful}} summer hard-court <b>swing</b> which <b>saw</b> her reach the semifinals at Montreal, win a silver medal at the Olympics, and reach the final at Cincinnati. At the US Open, despite facing pressure to overtake Williams for the #1 player in the world, Kerber reached the semifinals without dropping a set. When Karolína Plíšková beat Williams in the semifinals, Kerber was guaranteed to become the World No. 1 after the tournament. She consolidated her new position by beating Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals and Plíšková in a three-set final.|$|R
50|$|The 2006 {{election}} saw {{her personal}} vote evaporate, {{and with the}} statewide Australian Labor Party (ALP) <b>swing,</b> <b>saw</b> her successor Liberal Party candidate Mark Osterstock suffer a swing of 12.5 per cent, giving the seat to the ALP on a margin of 6.8 per cent.|$|E
50|$|Despite a {{national}} swing to the Tories in the 1959 General Election, {{there was a}} swing to Labour in Scotland, and four Conservative held seats fell to Labour (Ayrshire Central, Glasgow Craigton, Glasgow Scotstoun and Lanark). The pro-Labour <b>swing</b> <b>saw</b> the Conservative majority in Glasgow Woodside cut in half.|$|E
50|$|When Adam {{arrives at}} Victor and Elizabeth's luxurious home, he {{encounters}} them. At first Adam attacks Victor, but Elizabeth calms him down, and they show Adam his true origins. Adam is angry {{to learn that}} he {{was created by the}} Frankensteins and that Victor was already attempting to replace him. Victor knocks down Adam as he is distracted and then attempts to decapitate him with a saw. When Elizabeth tries to stop Victor, he <b>swings</b> a <b>saw</b> and accidentally slices her neck open. Victor flees and Elizabeth quickly bleeds to death.|$|R
6000|$|We broke away, {{and he was}} tottering and groggy. He {{staggered}} {{away and}} started to whirl the <b>swing.</b> I <b>saw</b> it coming. I made believe I didn't and started after him in a rush. Biff! It caught me on the jaw, and I went down. I was young and strong. I could eat punishment. I could have got up the first second. But I lay there and let them count me out. And making believe I was still dazed, I let them carry me to my corner and work to bring me to. [Pause.] ...|$|R
60|$|He {{drank and}} then held his glass slackly poised while he mused. Kit, who was nearest the arch, turned and glanced out. He saw the {{reflected}} light quiver across the trampled sand and the dusty {{green of the}} limp palmettos. Then, below the latter, there was a pale-yellow flash and the president's glass fell with a tinkle. A pistol-shot rang out and Kit, <b>swinging</b> round, <b>saw</b> that a flake of plaster had dropped on the table. There was some dust on Alvarez' brown face and on his clothes, but he looked unmoved.|$|R
50|$|A 2.86% <b>swing</b> towards Labour <b>saw</b> Dr. Maloney elected, and {{the seat}} of Melbourne was held by the ALP until 2010. Following his defeat, McEacharn {{abandoned}} not only politics but Australia, leaving the country in 1905 and moving to Wigtownshire in Scotland, where he purchased the ancestral home of the Earl of Galloway.|$|R
25|$|Lancashire Lightning won the toss at Lord's and put Middlesex Crusaders in. This {{looked the}} right {{decision}} as Lancashire's seam and <b>swing</b> bowling attack <b>saw</b> Middlesex fall to 6 for 3, and then 37 for 6. The Crusaders were then rescued by James Dalrymple, who took 81 off 82 balls {{to take them to}} 210 for 9 in their 45 overs.|$|R
50|$|In the {{previous}} election, held on 5 May 2005, the Labour Party won a majority with 36 out of 67 seats. The Conservative Party were second with 26 seats, and the Liberal Democrats had five. Following the 2005 election, {{there were three}} by-elections, which all <b>saw</b> <b>swings</b> against Labour. The Conservatives gained Hucknall and the Liberal Democrats Sutton-in-Ashfield North from Labour, and the Labour party's majority in Mansfield East was reduced by nearly two thirds.|$|R
50|$|Malcolm Fraser {{had been}} {{commissioned}} as caretaker prime minister following {{the dismissal of}} Gough Whitlam's three-year-old Labor government by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, on 11 November 1975. The same day, Fraser advised the calling of the election, in accordance with Kerr's stipulated conditions (see 1975 Australian constitutional crisis). The Coalition of Fraser's Liberal Party of Australia and Doug Anthony's National Country Party secured government in its own right, winning the largest majority government in Australian history. Although Fraser had {{no need for the}} support of the National Country Party, the Coalition was retained. Labor suffered a 30-seat <b>swing</b> and <b>saw</b> its House of Representatives numbers cut almost in half, to 36 seats—fewer than it had when Whitlam became leader {{in the aftermath of the}} Coalition landslide nearly 10 years earlier, in the 1966 election.|$|R
50|$|Tasker was an {{unsuccessful}} Conservative candidate at the 1923 general election, when {{he failed to}} be elected at Bethnal Green North East. Another election was held in 1924, and Tasker stood again, this time at Islington East. In a three-cornered contest, Tasker defeated the sitting Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), Arthur Comyns Carr. Five years later he was defeated when a <b>swing</b> to Labour <b>saw</b> Ethel Bentham, one of his opponents in 1924, take the seat.|$|R

I wanted to explain that if the ball went over the hedges in my front yard, it was only a ground rule double.

50|$|Each Labor {{period of}} {{government}} {{since the end}} of the Playmander had at least one comprehensive win, allowing often-Liberal seats to be won by Labor candidates who then built up incumbency and personal popularity. Examples in 2014 were Mawson, Newland and Light, and additionally in 2010, Bright and Hartley - all gained at the 2006 election landslide. Mawson in fact swung toward Labor in 2010 and 2014 despite the statewide trend. The bellwether seat of Colton was retained by Labor. Furthermore, all but two of the nine Liberal-held metropolitan seats <b>saw</b> <b>swings</b> against the Liberals.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{traces the}} {{formation}} and evolution of the Who, and includes details of their appearance at Woodstock in 1969 and their storied trashing of hotels. Townshend calls Roger Daltrey [...] "the unquestionable leader" [...] of the band. He says he started smashing his guitars {{at the end of}} performances after he accidentally pushed one through a club ceiling in 1964 and damaged it. His [...] "windmill" [...] style of striking guitar chords was adopted from Keith Richards, who Townshend says he once <b>saw</b> <b>swinging</b> his arm to warm-up before going on stage.|$|R
60|$|It smelled sour and musty, {{and by the}} {{dim light}} of the <b>swinging</b> sea-lamp I <b>saw</b> every bit of {{available}} wall-space hung deep with sea-boots, oilskins, and garments, clean and dirty, of various sorts. These swung back and forth with every roll of the vessel, giving rise to a brushing sound, as of trees against a roof or wall. Somewhere a boot thumped loudly and at irregular intervals against the wall; and, though it was a mild night on the sea, there was a continual chorus of the creaking timbers and bulkheads and of abysmal noises beneath the flooring.|$|R
60|$|Then the half-covered {{frame of}} the church caught Kermode's eye. Something was wrong with it. The {{skeleton}} tower looked out of the perpendicular; and on his second glance its inclination seemed to have increased. The snow, however, was clogging {{the front of his}} sled and he set to work to scrape it off. While he was thus engaged there was a sharp, ripping sound, and then a heavy crash, and <b>swinging</b> around he <b>saw</b> that the tower had collapsed. Where it had stood lay a pile of broken timber, and planks and beams were strewn about the snow.|$|R
5000|$|Post-Election Swing State Poll: This 2012 poll {{surveyed}} {{voters in}} Colorado, Ohio, Virginia and Iowa - [...] "swing states" [...] {{that had a}} more critical role in deciding the presidential election result - {{to determine how much}} energy issues influenced voters about their candidate choices. The polls were conducted the day after the 2012 presidential election, and they confirm that energy {{played a role in the}} votes of those who were surveyed. [...] "In Colorado, 66% of voters said energy impacted their votes. The other polled <b>swing</b> states <b>saw</b> similarly high numbers with 60% of Virginians affirming energy as impactful, 58% of Iowans, and 57% of Ohioans." [...] Those who did vote with energy issues in mind ranked natural gas, solar and wind as energy sources they would like to see expanded in their home states. Furthermore, as reported by North American Wind Power, [...] "majorities in all four states support continued government investment in clean energy (Iowa: 77%, Virginia: 76%, Ohio: 75%, Colorado: 72%) and requirements for utilities to increase the use of renewable energy (Iowa: 76%, Colorado: 70%, Virginia: 69%, Ohio: 67%)." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{area covered}} by this seat and its {{immediate}} predecessor Crosby was historically a strong {{area for the}} Conservatives. However, since Labour gained that seat in the 1997 election, they have held it with fairly comfortable margins for 20 years. In 2015, an 8.1% <b>swing</b> to Labour <b>saw</b> them take the area with their biggest ever majority of 11,846 votes (24.2%), {{in accordance with the}} significant swing to Labour in Merseyside compared to 2010; this margin was surpassed in 2017, as Labour won more than 60% of the vote in the seat and a majority of over 30% for the first time. This suggests that since 2010, Sefton Central has changed from a key marginal between the major parties to a Labour safe seat.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the election, {{major news}} {{organizations}} were conflicted about whether Pennsylvania was leaning Democratic or {{too close to}} call. Donald Trumps appeal to Rust Belt workers, combined with the traditional Republican support coming from rural areas of the state, overtook the urban vote. Areas such as Luzerne County <b>saw</b> <b>swings</b> of up to 12%, making him the first Republican candidate for president to carry Pennsylvania since George H. W. Bush in 1988. Additionally, {{this was the first}} time since 1948 that the Democratic candidate performed worse in Pennsylvania than in the nation at large; in fact it was the first time since 1948 in which the Democratic candidate who ultimately led in the nationwide popular vote failed to carry Pennsylvania.|$|R
5|$|Lindwall {{began his}} celebrated opening {{partnership}} with Miller during the 1946–47 season which {{saw the first}} Ashes series against England. Lindwall brought up his maiden Test century in the Second Test and was the leading wicket-taker as Australia established its ascendancy in the post-war era. He topped the bowling the following season against India and then led the Australian attack during its celebrated Invincibles tour of England. He took 86 wickets for the tour, including 27 in the Tests, the most by any bowler. He was at his best in the Fifth Test at The Oval, when England were skittled for only 52, taking 6/20 as the hosts were unable to cope with his high-pace <b>swing.</b> Lindwall's efforts <b>saw</b> him named {{as one of the}} five Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|R
50|$|Near about 1475 A.D. King Purusottam Dev ruled Kalinga. Once {{on a trip}} to South India he chanced upon Princess Padmavati of Kanchi and {{proposed}} marriage. The proposal was accepted and the minister of the king of Kanchi traveled to Puri to finalise the arrangements. The Rath Yatra was in full <b>swing</b> and he <b>saw</b> the king sweeping the chariots of the deities. Marriage to a sweeper was unacceptable and hence the marriage was called off. Insulted, the King of Puri declared war on Kanchi. He was defeated in the first war. He prayed to Lord Jagannath and it is believed that he was directed to appoint one Govinda Bhanja as his Senapati or General of his army. Bhanja was in fact the son of the king of Keonjhar and was staying in Puri because of differences with his father.|$|R
50|$|Purdue {{lost in a}} blowout, 50-7. The scoring {{began with}} an 11-yard pass to Teldrick Morgan from Perry Hills, on the ensuing point after attempt, Maryland ran a <b>swinging</b> gate and <b>saw</b> a matchup that they liked {{completing}} the 2-point conversion with Caleb Rowe's pass to Kenneth Goins. Maryland added to its lead on a 62-yard run by Lorenzo Harrison III, an 8-yard run by Ty Johnson and an 11-yard Hills run to make the score 29-0 in favor of Maryland at half-time. Maryland's lead grew larger with another touchdown pass to Morgan from Hills in the third quarter. Purdue cut into Maryland's lead with a 4-yard Cole Herdman touchdown from David Blough. Maryland closed out the scoring with two fourth-quarter touchdowns on a 48-yard run by Johnson and a Jake Funk 9-yard touchdown reception from Tyrrell Pigrome.|$|R
60|$|In {{front was}} a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead {{on either side of}} the road, and the Maybury Inn with its <b>swinging</b> sign. I <b>saw</b> the doctor's cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head to look at the {{hillside}} I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke already extended far away to the east and west--to the Byfleet pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with people running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles. Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range of their Heat-Ray.|$|R
60|$|It was on Sunday {{week in the}} evening, when he {{was lying}} in the orchard {{listening}} to a blackbird and composing a love poem, that he heard the gate <b>swing</b> to, and <b>saw</b> the girl come running among the trees, with the red-cheeked, stolid Joe in swift pursuit. About twenty yards away the chase ended, and the two stood fronting each other, not noticing the stranger in the grass--the boy pressing on, the girl fending him off. Ashurst could see her face, angry, disturbed; and the youth's--who {{would have thought that}} red-faced yokel could look so distraught! And painfully affected by that sight, he jumped up. They saw him then. Megan dropped her hands, and shrank behind a tree trunk; the boy gave an angry grunt, rushed at the bank, scrambled over and vanished. Ashurst went slowly up to her. She was standing quite still, biting her lip-very pretty, with her fine, dark hair blown loose about her face, and her eyes cast down.|$|R
2500|$|As {{with many}} new popular musical styles, swing met with some {{resistance}} {{because of its}} improvisation, tempo, occasionally risqué lyrics, and frenetic dancing. [...] Audiences used to traditional [...] "sweet" [...] arrangements, such as those offered by Guy Lombardo, Sammy Kaye, Kay Kyser and Shep Fields, were {{taken aback by the}} rambunctiousness of swing music. [...] Swing was sometimes regarded as light entertainment, more of an industry to sell records to the masses than a form of art, among fans of both jazz and [...] "serious" [...] music. Some jazz critics such as Hugues Panassié held the polyphonic improvisation of New Orleans jazz to be the pure form of jazz, with swing a form corrupted by regimentation and commercialism. [...] Panassié was also an advocate of the theory that jazz was a primal expression of the black American experience and that white musicians, or black musicians who became interested in more sophisticated musical ideas, were generally incapable of expressing its core values. [...] In his 1941 autobiography, W. C. Handy wrote that [...] "prominent white orchestra leaders, concert singers and others are making commercial use of Negro music in its various phases. That's why they introduced [...] "swing" [...] which is not a musical form" [...] (no comment on Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Duke Ellington, or Count Basie). [...] The Dixieland revival started in the late 1930s as a self-conscious re-creation of New Orleans jazz in reaction against the orchestrated style of big band swing. [...] Some <b>swing</b> bandleaders <b>saw</b> opportunities in the Dixieland revival. Tommy Dorsey's Clambake Seven and Bob Crosby's Bobcats were examples of Dixieland ensembles within big swing bands.|$|R
