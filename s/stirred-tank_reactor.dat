25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a plug flow reactor model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactor</b> keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E

50|$|The AR {{is defined}} as the {{collection}} all possible outcomes for all conceivable reactor combinations. Geometrically, the AR may (for instance) be represented as a convex region in state space representing all possible outlet compositions for all reactor combinations. A combination of reactors is often termed a reactor structure. An example of the reactors that are considered for this theory are Continuous flow <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactor</b> (CSTR) and a Plug flow reactor model (PFR).|$|E
50|$|The {{behavior}} of a CSTR is often approximated or modeled by that of a Continuous Ideally <b>Stirred-Tank</b> <b>Reactor</b> (CISTR).

In practice it can only be approached, particularly in industrial size reactors in which the mixing time may be very large.|$|E
50|$|The {{removal of}} {{pollutants}} is greatly influenced by {{the length of time}} fluid elements spend in the MBR (i.e. the residence time distribution or RTD). The residence time distribution is a description of the hydrodynamics/mixing in the system and is determined by the design of the MBR (e.g. MBR size, inlet/recycle flowrates, wall/baffle/mixer/aerator positioning, mixing energy input). An example of the effect of mixing is that a continuous <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactor</b> will not have as high pollutant conversion per unit volume of reactor as a plug flow reactor.|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} batch and plug flow {{reactors}} (PFRs), the dispersities {{for the different}} polymerization methods are the same. This is largely because while batch reactors depend entirely on time of reaction, plug flow reactors depend on distance traveled in the reactor and its length. Since time and distance are related by velocity, plug flow reactors can be designed to mirror batch reactors by controlling the velocity and length of the <b>reactor.</b> Continuously <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactors</b> (CSTRs) however have a residence time distribution and cannot mirror batch or plug flow reactors, which can cause {{a difference in the}} dispersity of final polymer.|$|R

It was demonstrated that for the pair of species involved into the irreversible reaction (B and C), the space time of their corresponding concentration dependence intersection is invariant and {{does not depend on}} the initial conditions of the system.

The amount of fluorescence can then be measured to tell whether or not a reaction took place. The DNAzyme that changes is then “used,” and cannot initiate any more reactions. Because of this, these reactions take place in a device such as a continuous <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactor,</b> where old product is removed and new molecules added.|$|E

The latter company produces about 50 fine chemicals up to multi-kilogram quantities in microreactors. From a technological point of view, MRT, a.k.a. continuous flow reactors, represents the first breakthrough development in reactor design since the introduction of the <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactor,</b> which was used by Perkin & Sons, when they set up a factory on the banks of what was then the Grand Junction Canal in London in 1857 to produce mauveïne, the first-ever synthetic purple dye. For a comprehensive coverage of the subject see Micro Process Engineering. Examples for reactions that have worked in microreactors include aromatics oxidations, diazomethane conversions, Grignards, halogenations, hydrogenations, nitrations and Suzuki couplings.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{pre-treatment}} and even anaerobic co-digestion strategies {{have emerged in}} order to make organic matter more accessible. However, these technologies have been reached less than 60 % degradation/conversion of organic matter to methane. In comparison, over millions of years, living organisms have explored and optimized the digestion {{of a wide variety of}} substrates with high yields (> 70 %). The aim of the study is the analysis of natural innovation in animal digestive tracts in order to improve anaerobic digestion processes. The approach consists of a large descriptive inventory of animal digestive tracts. Animals (vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, etc.) use all types of organic matter as food. Moreover over evolutionary time, organisms become more and more specialized and use only specific type of food (leaves, seed, meat, bones, faeces, etc.). In parallel, the digestive systems evolve to optimize the nutrient recovery. Each animal species domesticates its own microbe consortium and develops its own digestive tract structure. The digestive systems can be seen as a microbial reactor with abiotic pre- and/or post-treatments. When considering their functions, physiological compartments can be imagined as <b>reactors.</b> Thus, continuous <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactors,</b> continuous <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactors</b> in series, plug-flow reactors, and batch reactors can be used to model the function of these compartments. In this paper, we relate animal size, animal phylogeny and the feeding habit (carnivorous, omnivorous, granivorous, herbivorous) to the type and the position of microbial compartment with respect to the abiotic compartments within the digestive tract. We also relate the role of these parameters on the microbial diversity within the microbial compartment. The results show that (i) the feeding habit determines the type of microbial reactor and its position within the digestive tract; (ii) the phylogeny of the animal determines the type of abiotic pre- and/or post-treatment; (iii) finally, the size of the animal determines the level of diversity of the microbial communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for biological nitrification of an industrial waste containing 4, 000 mg of ammonia N (NH 4 +-N) and 10, 000 mg of fluoride per liter was investigated. Ammonium sulfate and sodium fluoride {{were tested in}} various combinations of 100 to 2, 000 mg of NH 4 +-N per liter and 0 to 5, 000 mg of F− per liter in suspended-growth <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactors</b> containing enriched cultures of nitrifying bacteria from a municipal sewage treatment plant. The <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>reactors</b> were fed once per day at a constant hydraulic retention period and cell retention time of 10 days. Temperature was 23 °C, and pH was 7. 0 to 7. 5. Clarified secondary effluent was used to make up feeds and to provide minor nutrients. Steady-state data, confirmed by mass balances, were obtained after five to six retention periods. In the absence of fluoride, nitrification efficiency was near 100 % for up to 500 mg of NH 4 +-N per liter. The influence of fluoride was studied at a low ammonia concentration (100 mg/liter) and exerted no significant effect on nitrification at concentrations of up to 200 mg/liter. Maximum effect of fluoride was reached at 800 mg of F− per liter, and no greater inhibition was observed for up to 5, 000 mg of F− per liter. At the highest concentrations studied, ion pairing of ammonium and fluoride may exert {{a significant effect on}} kinetic coefficients. Kinetic analyses showed maximum specific substrate removal rates (qmax) of NH 4 +-N to be about 2. 3 mg of N per mg of volatile suspended solids per day in the absence of fluoride and 0. 85 mg of N per mg of volatile suspended solids per day in the presence of fluoride. The form of inhibition due to the presence of fluoride was shown to be not competitive, conforming to a mixed inhibition model...|$|R
