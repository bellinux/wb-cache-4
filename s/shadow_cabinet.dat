5|$|Lamont began {{appointing}} {{members of}} her <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinet</b> on 19 December 2011. Those given positions on her initial frontbench team include Macintosh (<b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth), Hugh Henry (Labour spokesman for Education and Lifelong Learning), Lewis Macdonald (Shadow Justice Minister) and Boyack (Local Government and Planning). The post of Shadow Health Minister was given to Jackie Baillie, who had held the position previously.

5|$|By 1966, {{party leaders}} viewed Thatcher as a {{potential}} <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> member. Jim Prior suggested her as a member after the Conservatives' 1966 defeat, but party leader Edward Heath and Chief Whip William Whitelaw eventually settled on Mervyn Pike as the Shadow Cabinet's sole woman member.|$|E
5|$|Over 100 Oxford alumni {{were elected}} to the House of Commons in 2010. This {{includes}} former Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, and numerous members of the cabinet and <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Additionally, over 140 Oxonians sit in the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving office}} as CGS, Dannatt {{effectively}} {{retired from the}} Army, but technically remained a serving officer until November 2009. Shortly after leaving office, Dannatt was approached by David Cameron, then leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition. Cameron invited Dannatt to become a defence adviser for the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> once he was officially retired from the Army and no longer bound by Queen's Regulations, which mandate political neutrality in the armed forces. Although uncommon for a former service chief to align himself with one political party, Dannatt accepted the role on an informal basis. The timing of the decision, which became public in October 2009—within two months of Dannatt's effective retirement—attracted some controversy, with some former ministers and civil servants suggesting it potentially compromised the neutrality of the armed forces. He advised Cameron and his <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinet</b> until he resigned, shortly after the 2010 general election, stating that Cameron, by then prime minister, should turn to the incumbent chiefs of staff for defence advice and citing no desire to become a special adviser.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to {{take part}} in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a {{professional}} exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a Cabinet or <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future Prime Minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. In 1967, Heath appointed Thatcher to the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> as Fuel and Power spokesman. Prior to the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential {{candidate}} {{of his party}} for the first time, but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP, who {{was supported by the}} ruling center-left coalition. Ahead of the 1976 elections, CDU chairman Helmut Kohl included him in his <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinet</b> for the party’s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor. Between 1979 and 1981, Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 2013, Miliband {{reshuffle}}d his <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> for {{the third}} time, saying {{that this would be}} the last reshuffle before the general election. In a move similar to his 2011 reshuffle, several MPs from the 2010 intake were promoted, while more long-serving MPs were moved. Tristram Hunt and Rachel Reeves received promotions, while Liam Byrne and Stephen Twigg were among those demoted.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{practice}} of parliamentary <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinets</b> or frontbenches is not widespread in Germany, party leaders have often formed boards of experts and advisors ("teams of experts", or Kompetenzteam, in CDU/CSU and SPD parlance; alternate [...] "top team", or Spitzenteam, in Alliance '90/The Greens parlance).|$|R
50|$|A Palestinian ferrokinetic, Iron Butterfly is the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet's</b> field commander. Although her origins are {{uncertain}} (she's given conflicting accounts), {{it is known}} that her family was murdered and that she is seeking to avenge this. She is secretly in love with Dharma, the team's leader, as evidenced when she refused to escape after he decided to imprison the entire team in their base.|$|R
50|$|Hailsham {{announced}} his retirement {{after the end of}} the Heath government in 1974. He popularised the term 'elective dictatorship' in 1976, later writing a detailed exposition, The Dilemma of Democracy. However, after the violent death of his second wife, he decided to return to active politics, first as a shadow minister without portfolio in the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinets</b> of Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher, then again as Lord Chancellor from 1979 to 1987 under Margaret Thatcher.|$|R
5|$|A {{doctoral}} {{graduate of}} the University of Edinburgh, Brown spent his early career working as both a lecturer at a further education college and a television journalist. He entered Parliament in 1983 as the MP for Dunfermline East. He joined the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> in 1989 as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade, and was later promoted to become Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1992. After Labour's victory in 1997, he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, becoming the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history.|$|E
5|$|After Labor's {{defeat at}} the 2001 federal election, Gillard {{was elected to}} the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> under then-Labor Leader Simon Crean, where she was given {{responsibility}} for Population and Immigration. In February 2003, she was given additional responsibilities for Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs. In these roles, {{in the wake of the}} Tampa and Children Overboard affairs, which were partly credited with Labor's 2001 election loss, Gillard developed a new immigration policy for the Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|First {{elected to}} {{parliament}} as Member of Parliament for Sedgefield, County Durham, at the 1983 general election, Tony Blair became {{the leader of}} the Labour Party in 1994, after winning 57% of the vote in that year's leadership election, defeating John Prescott and Margaret Beckett. His first <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinet</b> role came in November 1988, when Neil Kinnock appointed him as Shadow Secretary of State for Energy, and in July 1992, was promoted to the role of Shadow Home Secretary on the election of John Smith as Leader of the Labour Party.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Abbott became Minister for Health and Ageing, {{retaining}} {{this position}} until {{the defeat of}} the Howard Government at the 2007 election. Initially serving in the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinets</b> of Brendan Nelson and then Malcolm Turnbull, Abbott resigned from the front bench in November 2009, in protest against Turnbull's support for the Rudd Government's proposed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Forcing a leadership ballot on the subject, Abbott defeated Turnbull by 42 votes to 41, to become the Party's leader and Leader of the Opposition.|$|R
50|$|Hardware later {{appears in}} the {{aftermath}} of the JLA's dissolution following Final Crisis. After raiding the hideout of Dakota crime lord Holocaust, he is forced into helping the remaining Justice League members track down Dr. Light, who went missing while chasing Shadow Thief and Starbreaker. Using a tracer installed in her costume, Hardware is able to track Dr. Light and the others to the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet's</b> HQ, Shadowspire.

He served in the cabinet from 2003-10, under the premierships of both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. From 2010-16, he served in various Labour Party <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinets,</b> most recently as Shadow Foreign Secretary from May 2015 until June 2016, when he was dismissed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. In October 2016, he was elected as the Chair of the new Exiting the European Union Select Committee.|$|R
5|$|In 1982 Larkin turned sixty. This {{was marked}} most {{significantly}} by {{a collection of}} essays entitled Larkin at Sixty, edited by Anthony Thwaite and published by Faber and Faber. There were also two television programmes: an episode of The South Bank Show presented by Melvyn Bragg in which Larkin made off-camera contributions, and a half-hour special on the BBC that was devised and presented by the Labour <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> Minister Roy Hattersley.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{was elected}} to Parliament as MP for Tooting at the 2005 general election. He had {{previously}} worked as a human rights lawyer. After being the campaign manager for Ed Miliband in the latter's successful bid to become Labour Party leader, Khan {{was appointed to the}} <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> as Shadow Secretary of State for Justice in 2010, a post from which he resigned after the 2015 General Election and Miliband's resignation as Labour leader.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 2009, the Coalition's {{climate change}} {{spokesman}} Ian Macfarlane {{agreed to a}} deal with the government to amend the ETS legislation. The amendments provided industry with substantial compensation and exemptions from the ETS. Turnbull took the deal to Liberal MPs for formal approval, but a majority of backbenchers opposed it. Turnbull nonetheless claimed he had the Coalition's support, by counting as supporters the 20 members of the Coalition <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinet</b> who he argued should be presumed to support the deal. This claim was met with rancour by his opponents in the Coalition.|$|E
50|$|Lewis held {{multiple}} portfolios in the <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinets</b> of both Barry MacKinnon and Richard Court, {{and after}} the Liberal victory at the 1993 election was appointed Minister for Planning and Minister for Heritage in the Court-Cowan ministry. Following the resignation of Doug Shave later in 1993, he was also appointed Minister for Housing, although he was replaced by Kevin Prince after a few months. After leaving politics, Lewis was named chairman of the East Perth Redevelopment Authority (serving from 1997 to 2001), and was also {{a director of the}} Western Power Corporation (from 1998 to 2001).|$|R
5000|$|After {{joining the}} Foreign Office in 1965, Ridley was quickly {{seconded}} to the recently established Department of Economic Affairs, where he remained until 1968. He was a Harkness Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, for {{the academic year}} 1968-1969, {{then returned to the}} Civil Service. He was with HM Treasury from 1970 to 1971, then joined Edward Heath new Central Policy Review Staff (or [...] "Think Tank") and remained there until the change of government in 1974. He then served for five years as Economic Adviser to the Conservative <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinets</b> of Heath and Margaret Thatcher.|$|R
2500|$|He {{served as}} Foreign Affairs critic in the <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinets</b> of both Dion and Ignatieff. On June 9, 2009, Rae was denied entry by Sri Lankan Immigration {{officials}} at the Bandaranaike International Airport, Colombo, Sri Lanka on grounds that he was [...] "a {{threat to national security}} and sympathetic to the Tamil Tigers rebel group". Rae responded, [...] "Sri Lanka is afraid of dialogue, afraid of discussion, afraid of engagement... If this is how they treat me, imagine how they treat people who can't speak out." [...] Rae has described Sri Lanka as 'a very dangerous place to be a journalist. [...] "It's a very dangerous place to be any kind of Tamil right now and this is nuts." ...|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} the leadership, Whitlam reorganised the ALP caucus, {{assigning}} portfolios and turning the Labor frontbench into a <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinet.</b> While the Liberal-Country Coalition had a huge majority in the House of Representatives, Whitlam energised the party by campaigning intensively to win two by-elections in 1967: first in Corio in Victoria, and later that year in Capricornia (Queensland). The November half-Senate election saw a moderate swing to Labor and against the Coalition, compared with the general election the previous year. These federal victories, in which both Whitlam and Holt campaigned, helped give Whitlam the leverage he needed to carry out party reforms.|$|E
5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Lamont was {{appointed}} Deputy Minister for Justice and oversaw reforms to Scotland's Lower Courts system. She held the post until Labour was defeated at the 2007 election. McConnell appointed her as Labour's spokesperson for Communities and Sport in his post-election frontbench team, a role she {{retained in the}} <b>shadow</b> <b>cabinet</b> formed by his successor, Wendy Alexander, in September 2007. Following Alexander's decision to step down {{as leader of the}} Labour MSPs in June 2008, and Cathy Jamieson's subsequent resignation as her deputy, Lamont stood against fellow MSP Bill Butler for the position vacated by Jamieson. She was elected as deputy leader in September 2008 with 60.16 percent of the vote, against 39.82 percent for Butler. At the same time, Iain Gray was elected to lead the Labour group at Holyrood.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{committees}} {{for which the}} Cabinet Office is administratively responsible, but which are not Cabinet committees.

2500|$|The {{daughter}} of Zaidee Brasier ( [...] Barnes) and Hubert Brasier, a vicar, May {{grew up in}} Oxfordshire. From 1977 until 1983, she worked for the Bank of England, and from 1985 until 1997 at the Association for Payment Clearing Services, also serving as a councillor for Durnsford in Merton. After unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the House of Commons in 1992 and 1994, she was elected as the MP for Maidenhead in the 1997 general election. From 1999 to 2010, May held a number of roles in the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinets</b> of William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard, and David Cameron, including Shadow Transport Secretary and Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary. She was also Chairman of the Conservative Party from 2002 to 2003.|$|R
50|$|Between 2003 and 2008, {{he was the}} Shadow Home Secretary in the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Cabinets</b> of both Michael Howard and David Cameron. Davis had {{previously}} been {{a candidate for the}} leadership of the Conservative Party in 2001 and 2005, coming fourth and second respectively. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary; this was in order to force a by-election in his seat for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting a specific campaign designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Following his formal resignation as an MP he became the Conservative candidate in the resulting by-election and won a month later.|$|R
