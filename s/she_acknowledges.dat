25|$|Many of {{her books}} and {{articles}} present for discussion the mystical literature and religious practices of Spain, renaissance and medieval (including al-Andalus), i.e., both Christian and Muslim. <b>She</b> <b>acknowledges</b> {{the influence of the}} early 20th century Spanish Arabist, the Rev. Miguel Asín Palacios, among others. In particular, she has followed traces of the trail that show a fruitful interaction between Muslims and Christians in Iberia, e.g., as it affected San Juan de la Cruz and Santa Teresa de Avila. Evidently, this trail continues on, eventually leading also to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. She has also done work on the literature of Puerto Rico.|$|E

500|$|In {{the view}} of Catherine Cubitt the reform [...] "has rightly been {{regarded}} as one of the most significant episodes in Anglo-Saxon history", which [...] "transformed English religious life, regenerated artistic and intellectual activities and forged a new relationship between church and king". The prosperity of later Anglo-Saxon England was important to its success, and it was underpinned by trade and diplomacy with continental Europe as well as by religious needs. <b>She</b> <b>acknowledges</b> the reform's limited geographical impact: ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Getaway" [...] is {{the fourth}} season finale of the American {{television}} drama series Dexter, and the 48th overall episode of the series.

500|$|In Abbo's {{version of}} events, the king {{refused to meet}} the Danes in battle, preferring to die a martyr's death. The {{historian}} Susan Ridyard maintains that Edmund's martyrdom cannot be proved {{and the nature of}} his fate — whether he died fighting or was cruelly murdered in the battle's aftermath — cannot be read from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. She notes that the story that Edmund had an armour-bearer implies that {{he would have been a}} warrior king who was prepared to fight the Vikings on the battlefield, but <b>she</b> <b>acknowledges</b> the possibility that later accounts belong to [...] "the realm of hagiographical fantasy".|$|E
500|$|According to Franklin, the {{selective}} fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced {{to attract and}} hold people's attention {{by focusing on the}} unusual over the usual. <b>She</b> <b>acknowledges</b> that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there [...] "and the world is structured to believe in them." [...] She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force. [...] "And somewhere, someone will have to ask, 'How come the right to change our mental environment—to change the constructs of our minds and the sounds around us—seems to have been given away without anybody's consent?'" ...|$|E
500|$|She was {{inspired}} to follow her brother to Princeton University, where he graduated in 1983, after which {{he went on to}} become a basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University. She recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, that she had been told she was [...] "setting my sights too high". She believed that her brother's status as an alumnus may have helped her during the admission process, but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worthiness. <b>She</b> <b>acknowledges</b> that she was overwhelmed when first arriving in first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college, and that she had never spent time on a college campus.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1925, Nella Larsen {{had decided that}} she wanted to be among the [...] "New Negro" [...] writers {{receiving}} considerable attention at the time. Initially writing short stories that were sold early in 1926 to a ladies magazine, she was rumored that year to be writing a novel. In a letter to her friend, Carl Van Vechten, <b>she</b> <b>acknowledges,</b> [...] "it is the awful Truth. But, who knows if I'll get through with the damned thing. Certainly not I." [...] In April 1927, Larsen and her husband, Elmer Imes, moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Harlem to be closer to the cultural phenomenon. The following year, Larsen published her first novel Quicksand with New York-based publisher Knopf, and its favorable critical reception encouraged her ambitions to become known as a novelist.|$|E
500|$|... "Gay Power, Gay Politics" [...] {{continued}} to be a target of criticism by LGBT community leaders and authors, although some have acknowledged that the program included [...] "more than a few kernels of truth". Former National Gay and Lesbian Task Force executive director Urvashi Vaid attacked the program for its presentation of gays as [...] "sexual hedonists, privileged powerbrokers, and arrogant men scheming to force their 'lifestyle' on a recalcitrant public". She further castigated the show for excluding lesbians and people of color (although <b>she</b> <b>acknowledges</b> that this to an extent mirrored the state of gay leadership at the time) and noted her belief that anti-gay attack videos produced in the 1990s were modeled on this broadcast. Gay cultural critic Frank Browning, while agreeing with the criticism of the tone of the documentary, nonetheless found the dudgeon that many in the community expressed to be [...] "layered with disingenuousness". Browning wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{differences}} between Ezri and Jadzia were often considered by viewers and critics. In Where No Woman Has Gone Before: Feminist Perspectives On Star Trek, an essay by Susan A. Lentz within the book Star Trek Visions of Law and Justice, Ezri {{was described as}} [...] "less assured, insecure, and uncertain who she is. Of course, Jadzia may have herself once been such a host. The growth and evolution of Ezri unfold as <b>she</b> <b>acknowledges</b> her 'past lives'." [...] Ezri's relationship with Bashir and Worf were also regarded {{as an extension of}} Jadzia's previous relationships, leading to it being listed as one of the 5 [...] "great geek TV love triangles" [...] by the website Den of Geek. However, this romantic plot featuring Ezri and Worf/Bashir was criticised by website DVD Talk in their review of the season seven DVD release saying that it was similar to a [...] "soap opera".|$|E
60|$|Helen read Douglass's letter {{next morning}} {{while still in}} bed, and its forthright assault made her shiver. She {{did not attempt to}} deceive herself. <b>She</b> <b>acknowledged</b> the {{singular}} power of this young man to shake her, to change her course of action. From the first <b>she</b> <b>acknowledged</b> something almost terrifying in the appeal of his eyes, a power which he seemed unconscious of. His words of condemnation, of solicitude, troubled her as the praise of no other man in all her life had done. He had spoken to her soul, making her triumph over the vast audience loathsome--almost criminal.|$|R

500|$|... "S" [...] {{received}} mixed {{responses from}} music critics. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described [...] "S" [...] as an ode to sadomasochism that compares to Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope. Conner felt that [...] "S", {{as well as}} other Loud tracks [...] "What's My Name?" [...] and [...] "Skin", were songs which allowed Rihanna to boast about how good she is in certain situations, as she did on Rated R. He chose the lyrics [...] "I may be bad/ but I'm perfectly good at it... Chains and whips excite me" [...] as an example of her vaunt. USA Todays Steve Jones opined that [...] "Louds pulsating opener, 'S,' makes it clear from the jump where [...] headed as <b>she</b> <b>acknowledges</b> that 'chains and whips excite '", while Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "S" [...] an [...] "explicitly carnal opener" [...] with [...] "late-night-Cinemax naughtiness".|$|E
500|$|The comrades {{eventually}} {{decide to}} act on their own, calling themselves [...] "Freeborn British Communists". They start experimenting with explosives and build a car bomb. Alice does not fully support this action, but accepts the majority decision. They target an upmarket hotel in Knightsbridge, but their inexperience results in the premature detonation of the bomb, which kills Faye and several passers-by. The remaining comrades, shaken by what they have done, decide to leave the squat and split up. Alice, disillusioned by Jasper, chooses not to follow him and remains behind because she cannot bear to abandon the house into which she has poured so much effort. Despite her initial reservations about the bombing, Alice feels a need to justify their actions to others, but realises it would be fruitless because [...] "rdinary people simply didn't understand". <b>She</b> <b>acknowledges</b> {{that she is a}} terrorist now, though she cannot remember when the change happened.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois on December 20, 1954, the third of seven children. The only {{surviving}} daughter, she considered herself the [...] "odd number {{in a set of}} men". Cisneros's great-grandfather had played the piano for the Mexican president and was from a wealthy background, but he gambled away his family's fortune. Her paternal grandfather was a veteran of the Mexican Revolution, and he used what money he had saved to give her father, Alfredo Cisneros de Moral, the opportunity to go to college. However, after failing classes due to what Cisneros called his [...] "lack of interest" [...] in studying, Alfredo ran away to the United States to escape his father's anger. While roaming the southern United States with his brother, Alfredo visited Chicago where he met Elvira Cordero Anguiano. After getting married, the pair settled in one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. Cisneros's biographer Robin Ganz writes that <b>she</b> <b>acknowledges</b> her mother's family name came from a very humble background, tracing its roots back to Guanajuato, Mexico, while her father's was much more [...] "admirable".|$|E
5000|$|In May 2006, Wexner {{promoted}} Sharen Jester Turney {{from the}} Victoria's Secret catalog and online units {{to lead the}} whole company. In 2008, <b>she</b> <b>acknowledged</b> [...] "product quality that doesn't equal the brand's hype".|$|R

5000|$|The Senate {{report also}} [...] "suggests Miss Rice played a more {{significant}} role than <b>she</b> <b>acknowledged</b> in written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee submitted in the autumn."
