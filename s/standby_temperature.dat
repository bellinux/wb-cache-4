50|$|Burn-up {{compensation}} is achieved automatically by the LEMs, achieving 80% of the nominal {{power at the}} end-of-life of the fuel cartridge. The LEM is a thermometer-like device actuated by the volume expansion of the Li6. This “liquid control rod” can keep the reactor power almost constant throughout the design life.Partial load operation is possible by adjusting the primary coolant flow rate. Reactor power will be in proportional with the primary coolant flow rate due to LEMs reactivity feedback. The LRM is composed of an envelope divided by a frozen seal into two chambers. The lower chamber, within the active core, has a 95% enriched Li6 reservoir, while the upper chamber is a vacuum prior to reactor startup.Reactor startup can be done automatically if the primary coolant temperature reaches its <b>standby</b> <b>temperature.</b> Coolant heating {{can be achieved by}} heat release from the primary pump circulation. Then the frozen seal of the LRM will melt at the hot <b>standby</b> <b>temperature</b> (approximately 780 °C), and Li6 is released slowly from lower level (active core level) to the upper level to achieve a positive reactivity increase.It will take 7(11) hours to complete startup. The LIMs assure sufficient negative reactivity feedback in unprotected transients. The LRMs enable an automated reactor startup by detecting the hot <b>standby</b> <b>temperature</b> of the primary coolant. All these systems use Li6 and are actuated by highly reliable physical properties (volume expansion of Li6 for LEM, and frozen seal melting for LIM and LRM). A configuration with Quick LEMs requires 3+(1) LEMs of smaller size than a configuration with Slow LEMs requiring 24 LEMs.The RAPID-L is equipped with 28 LEMs, 16 LIMs and 16 LRMs in the design concept. Two of the 16 LRM are reserves or dummies. It is a very redundant system. Failure of some of these devices would result in only a slight temperature deviation of the coolant. In case that most of the LEMs fail, the burn-up compensation by the LEMs could be impossible, and the reactor would shut down.|$|E
40|$|Electricity use in many {{buildings}} is increasing, sometimes such that new buildings built to modern standards can have greater energy usage than their predecessors. A major cause is {{increased use of}} appliances such as computer equipment, lighting, and electronics. Increasing standby power consumption and more appliances being left running unnecessarily, compounds these effects. Monitoring equipment should provide insights into these issues, but the few systems currently available are either expensive, invasive, or both. This paper shows a case study where temperature monitoring was used to reduce industrial plant usage, and shows a method of electrical appliance monitoring, using very low cost sensors. Results show that the method can effectively reveal equipment usage patterns.

40|$|Background. Various microRNAs (miRNAs) {{are used}} as markers of acute {{coronary}} syndrome, in which heparinization is considered mandatory therapy. Nevertheless, a standard method of handling plasma samples has not been proposed, {{and the effects of}} heparin treatment on miRNA detection are rarely discussed. Materials and Method. This study used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis to investigate how storage <b>temperature,</b> <b>standby</b> time, hemolysis, and heparin treatment affect miRNA measurement in plasma samples from 25 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Results. For most miRNAs, the qPCR results remained consistent during the first 2 hours. The miRNA signals did not significantly differ between samples stored at 4 °C before processing and samples stored at room temperature (RT) before processing. miR- 451 a/miR- 23 a ratio < 60 indicated < 0. 12 % hemolysis with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Pretreatment with 0. 25 [*]U heparinase I recovered qPCR signals that were reduced by in vivo heparinization. Conclusions. For miRNA measurement, blood samples stored at RT should be processed into plasma within 2 hours after withdrawal and should be pretreated with 0. 25 [*]U heparinase I to overcome heparin-attenuated miRNA signals. The miR- 451 a/miR- 23 a ratio is a reliable indicator of significant hemolysis...|$|R
