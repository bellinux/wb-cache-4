40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study using}} an inviscid three-dimensional Lagrangian fluid dynamics code {{has been conducted}} {{as a part of}} an overall effort to understand the flow behavior in the SSME fuel side hot-gas manifold. The model simulates flow from the high-pressure fuel turbine exit through the transfer ducts, including the effects of swirl, inlet flow symmetry, and presence of straightening vanes and struts; a separate, more-detailed effort is in progress that includes viscosity and turbulence effects. The simplified model presented is divided into two parts, the first includes the 180 -degree turnaround duct downstream of the turbine exit and the <b>spherical</b> fuel <b>bowl</b> section, while the second models the three transfer ducts. The two parts of the model are coupled together with the interface conditions being updated through iteration. Results indicate that a transverse pressure differential of 165 psi would be imposed on the turbine exit and that unstable flow separation occurs around the vanes, struts, and within the transfer ducts. The three transfer ducts show a mass flux split of approximately 41, 21, and 38 percent. Results to date are encouraging that certain flow characteristics can be usefuly represented using a relatively coarse grid inviscid code...|$|R
50|$|Dwellings {{were set}} up on meadows, terraces, hills and even in caves, {{wherever}} the environment was friendly. The dwellings were embedded in the early phases and were huts at ground level, in the later phases. Asymmetrical receptacles, <b>bowls,</b> <b>spherical</b> cups, {{all of which were}} made of clay, furnish the interiors of this culture. The lithic utensil inventory includes flint and obsidian microlites, as well as large polished stone axes of the Walzenbiele type. It is now, too, that the first small copper items occur sporadically. The pintaderas decorated with geometrical patterns as well as the Spondylus and Tridacna shells testify to possible connections with Eastern Mediterranean regions. Burials were performed both inside and among the dwellings. Anthropological analyses have revealed a major Mediterranean component suggesting a southern origin of this population.|$|R

The droplet undergoes thermo-physical and morphological changes under external heating load (convective or radiative) forming different solid structures due to particle agglomeration. We report an agglomeration model based on population balance approach coupled with species and energy conservation equations in the liquid phase {{and compare it}} with the experimentally observed structure formations using high speed photography.

40|$|International audienceDrop {{generation}} from an axially vibrating nozzle {{exhibits a}} transition in drop diameter when varying the vibration amplitude. Below a threshold amplitude, forcing has essentially {{no effect on}} drop size and drops form in dripping mode. Above the threshold, drop size is controlled by forcing: drops detach at resonance, i. e., when the first eigenfrequency of the growing drop coincides with the forcing frequency. We experimentally study {{the impact of the}} nozzle inner diameter, dispersed phase flow rate, interfacial tension, and dispersed phase viscosity on this transition. Drop diameter is well correlated to the mode 1 eigenfrequency of Strani and Sabetta for a drop in partial contact with a <b>spherical</b> <b>bowl.</b> We propose a transient model to describe drop dynamics until detachment. The drop is modelled as a linearly forced harmonic oscillator, with the eigenfrequency of Strani and Sabetta. Since the dispersed phase does not wet the nozzle tip, an additional damping coefficient is introduced to account for the viscous dissipation in the film of continuous phase between the drop and nozzle surface. The model adequately reproduces the effect of the different parameters on the threshold amplitude...|$|E
40|$|The In-cylinder {{gas flow}} is complex three dimensional, {{unsteady}} and turbulent and hence poses many problems and uncertainties in the theoretical predictions. Of course, {{to study and}} {{have a better understanding}} of such combustion processes, the simulation models are more suitable compared to the time consuming experimental methods. The computational Fluid Dynamic models have gained momentum with the advent of high end computers for analysis of IC engine combustion process. FLUENT is the versatile tool for modeling the dynamic mesh parameters, in-cylinder flows and better analysis of pollutants. It is found that ignoring the effect of Scalar Dissipation Rate Fluctuations may cause inconsistency in predictions. Hence it is aimed to adopt Scalar Dissipation Rate Fluctuations by writing the User Defined Function (UDF) and appending it to existing code. Air motion which depends on piston bowl configuration plays important role in fuel-air mixing, combustion and emission formation especially at the end of compression stroke at TDC. In order to understand this effect, <b>spherical</b> <b>bowl</b> configuration was chosen for computations. the predicted results were compared with and without piston howl configuration to include scalar dissipation rate fluctuations (SDRF). The validation of the modified computer code is done by comparing the measured available data. Results were presented in the form of temperature, pressure and TKE contours gives better analysis of in-cylinder processes. ...|$|E
40|$|Carried {{out within}} {{the project of}} the German Research Foundation (DFG) “ECG Mapping Proceedings on a Heart Surface Defined by Ultrasound” (He 1669 / 11), this study aimed at {{developing}} and characterising an isolated heart model. In particular, basic conditions for a perfusion with preferable physiological cardiac activity should be established. In order to validate a clinically used ECG mapping system, a model of an independently beating and perfused heart had to be developed, aiming at recording reproducibly the excitation cycle of a filled heart in an electrically homogeneous medium. Seven porcine hearts were surgically explanted and perfused for 280 minutes in a four-chamber working heart mode {{so as to make}} haemodynamic, biochemical and electrophysiological measurements, which were used to validate and characterise the perfusion system. A blood mixture was used as perfusate, allowing oxygen transportation to occur in a physiological way. Furthermore, a higher oncotic pressure was provided compared to crystalloid solutions, preventing thus oedema development within the myocardium. The perfusate oxygenated, dialysed and temperated. After reperfusing the porcine heart, it was inserted into a <b>spherical</b> <b>bowl</b> fitted with 75 electrodes, which allowed recording the ECG mapping data in an electrically homogeneous medium. The heart was prepared and connected to the system. First, it was perfused using the Langendorff mode. After stabilization of heart activity it was filled antegradly via the atrium while independently beating in the working-heart modus (average heart rate of 70 - 81 min- 1) and performing pressure-volume work. While perfusing the heart, oxymetries and blood gas analyses were carried out in regular intervals, and other parameters were checked in the laboratory in order to examine the organ’s quality. A left atrial preload of 3, 7 - 7, 4 mmHg and a median aortic afterload of 55, 1 - 57, 4 mmHg lead to an average inflow of 848 - 1085 ml/min into the left atrium. The average aortic flow remained stable during the first 80 minutes of perfusion (576 - 600 ml/min), decreasing continuously thereafter. Since the heart was isolated and not subjected to neuronal or humoral control, {{it was not possible to}} attain physiological values for all parameters. Haemodynamic values did not reach the reference values, coinciding with results of other studies. Proceeding deterioration, a known issue with isolated perfusion, was indicated by increasing values of LDH (MW: 1029 U/l after 120 minutes of steady-state) and GOT (MW: 279 U/l after 120 minutes of steady-state). The presented model was developed in order to examine a new method of ECG mapping, delivering well comparable and proportionate ECG curves for the interval of perfusion, thus providing the opportunity of showing local changes in heart activity independent from anatomical features or interaction of the electrodes and the heart’s surface. During the experiment, P duration (85 ± 27 ms – 120 ± 41 ms) and the PQ interval (159 ± 56 ms– 190 ± 43 ms) remained close to reference values. The QRS interval (115 ± 14 ms – 129 ± 11 ms) was similar to the results presented in other studies with isolated hearts. However, the QT interval (417 ± 85 ms – 462 ± 58 ms) was larger than in other studies with isolated hearts and in vivo. The QRS (988 ± 409 µV – 1549 ± 759 µV) and T amplitudes (535 ± 222 µV– 885 ± 335 µV) tended to increase during the first half of the perfusion, decreasing afterwards. ECG voltages and intervals are affected by various factors. Under constant perfusion conditions however, variating conductibility of the myocardium, which changes due to myocardial oedema or myocardial ischaemia, remains a main factor. The perfusion method applied in this study permitted the conduction of ECG maps in an electrically homogeneous medium without attaching electrodes to the surface of a completely filled heart. ECG mapping data was collected in order to validate the clinical usage of ECG mapping systems and to enhance the model. A physical doctoral thesis carried out in the same framework aimed at the fluorimetric characterisation of metabolic activity of ex vivo perfused pig hearts. At the stage of evaluation, technical as well as experimental limitations arising from the model’s complexity became evident. Complexity, however, was a requisite within the DFG project. It is advisable for further research to choose a suitable model for the respective question, which is less complex and adapted to the experimental framework. Many perfusion models are described in literature and seem more viable from an economical point of view...|$|E
