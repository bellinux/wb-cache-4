40|$|Abstract Background An aortic {{aneurysm}} {{is a local}} dilation of the aorta, which tends to expand and often results in a fatal rupture. Although larger aneurysms have {{a greater risk of}} rupture, some small aneurysms also rupture. Since the mechanism of aortic rupture is not well understood, clarification of the microstructure influencing the failure to rupture is important. Since aortic tissues are <b>stretched</b> <b>biaxially</b> in vivo, we developed a technique to microscopically observe the failure of an aortic rupture during biaxial stretch. Methods A thinly sliced porcine thoracic aortic specimen was adhered to a circular frame and pushed onto a cylinder with a smaller diameter to <b>stretch</b> the specimen <b>biaxially.</b> To induce failure to rupture at the center, the specimen was thinned {{at the center of the}} hole as follows: the specimen was frozen while being compressed with metal plates having holes, which were 3 mm in diameter at their centers; the specimen was then sliced at 50 -μm intervals and thawed. Results The ratio of the thickness at the center to the peripheral area was 99. 5 % for uncompressed specimens. The ratio decreased with an increase in the compression ratio ε c and was 47. 3 % for specimens with ε c = 40 %. All specimens could be stretched until failure to rupture. The probability for crack initiation within the cylinder was ε c ε c > 30 %, respectively. Among specimens ruptured within the cylinder, 93 % of those obtained from the mid-media showed crack initiation at the thin center area. Conclusions Aortic tissues were successfully <b>stretched</b> <b>biaxially</b> until failure, and their crack initiation points were successfully observed under a microscope. This could be a very useful and powerful method for clarifying the mechanism of aortic rupture. We are planning to use this technique for a detailed investigation of events occurring at the point of failure when the crack initiates in the {{aortic aneurysm}} wall. </p...|$|R

For user-prescribed waveforms, the annular region of the deformable membrane is pulled into the well around the pillar under vacuum, causing the pillar-supported region with cultured cells to be <b>stretched</b> <b>biaxially.</b> The optically clear device and pillar-based mechanism of operation enables imaging on standard laboratory microscopes.

40|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{is vital}} for supporting patients with pulmonary insufficiency. However, experimental data suggests that pulmonary injury can occur during mechanical ventilation {{as a result of}} elevated regional lung volumes resulting in excessive alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) stretch due to basement membrane deformation and reduced barrier function. AECs maintain integrity of the blood-gas barrier with gasket like intercellular tight junctions (TJ) which are anchored internally to the actin cytoskeleton. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of physiologically relevant, high magnitude biaxial stretch on the actin cytoskeleton, a principal regulator of monolayer barrier properties, as a foundation to develop strategies to reduce mechanical injury in stretched AECs. We used primary rat type I-like AEC monolayers cultured on flexible membranes and <b>stretched</b> <b>biaxially</b> to mimic the alveolus during high volume mechanical ventilation. We hypothesized that the actin cytoskeleton underwent rapid remodeling initiated through activation of the Rac 1 /Rho signaling pathways and resulted in increased monolayer permeability. We have demonstrated that AEC monolayers <b>stretched</b> <b>biaxially</b> undergo rapid magnitude and frequency-dependent actin cytoskeletal remodeling to form perjunctional actin rings (PJARs). PJAR formation during stretch was mediated by the Rac 1 /Akt pathway but not by the Rho kinase and myosin light chain pathway. Inhibition of several Rac 1 pathway targets, including PI 3 K, Rac 1, and PAK- 1, resulted in the attenuation of stretch-induced PJAR formation and preservation of barrier properties in stretched monolayers. Rac 1 pathway agonists platelet derived growth factor and calyculin-A were shown to induce actin cytoskeleton remodeling to form PJAR in unstretched monolayers. Furthermore, exogenous PIP 3 increased Akt phosphorylation in unstretched monolayers and reduced cell death, but increased monolayer permeability in stretched monolayers. In summary, stretch of primary rat AEC monolayers increased Rac 1 pathway activity, cytoskeleton remodeling, and monolayer permeability, all of which could be attenuated with Rac 1 pathway inhibitors. With this data we can begin to develop novel treatment strategies aimed at preventing mechanical ventilator associated barrier dysfunction in vivo. We anticipate these treatments will reduce the incidence of pulmonary injury and mortality in patients that require mechanical ventilation. ...|$|R

Secondly, we will investigate the relationship between the failure properties and the age of patients, showing that patients below 55 years of age display significantly higher strength.

The linear shrinkage occurring at temperatures between 85 and 100 -degrees-C decreased with increasing draw temperature and draw ratio. Specimens taken near the edges of the drawn sheets, which had been subjected to in-plane shear deformations, were found to exhibit linear shrinkage 5 - 8 times lower than those taken {{from the middle of the}} sheet. Subsequent experiments, using purpose-built clamps to achieve a more uniform state of shear in both directions of the biaxially drawn samples, confirmed the universality of the principle of shrinkage suppression by the superposition of shear deformations. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the phenomenon was not related to differences in type of orientation of the crystals. The information from the X-ray diffraction studies and data from thermal analysis have led to the conclusion that the enhanced dimensional stability of biaxially drawn sheets subjected to superimposed shear deformations results from a combination of a higher rate of stress-induced crystallization and a reduction in the level of orientation within the amorphous phase...|$|R

This article reports on the effect on the strain properties of uniaxially and <b>biaxially</b> <b>stretched</b> β-form polyvinylidene fluoride when applying a low quasi-static triangular electric field E (100 mHz, E < 16 MV/m). For an applied electrical field at this level, the strain was proportional to the square of the electric field. The strain depended mainly on the electrostriction effect, linked to the induced reversal polarization and to interlaminar charges. The dielectric constant of the <b>biaxially</b> <b>stretched</b> polyvinylidene fluoride at 100 mHz was higher than for its uniaxially stretched counterpart. As a consequence, the induced charges and microscopic polarization for the first film exceeded those of the second one, and the electroactive strain for the <b>biaxially</b> <b>stretched</b> sample was more significant than for the uniaxially stretched film.

Rapidly adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptor neurons {{are known to}} be stretch sensitive, yet in the past, they have been studied using stretch stimuli applied along only a single direction. In this study, cutaneous rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors were studied in preparations of isolated skin in which the skin was stretched dynamically using biaxial stretch stimuli and in which loads and displacements were measured along two directions. Stretch stimuli followed a pseudo-Gaussian waveform and were applied along either one or two directions simultaneously. Associations between spikes and mechanical variables were determined using multiple logistic regression. When the skin was actuated along a single direction, holding the orthogonal axis fixed, spike responses were strongly associated with mechanical variables along the actuated direction. The variables were stress and its rate of change, the rate of change of strain, and the product of stress and its rate of change, which is proportional to strain energy density. When the skin was stretched along a single direction, spikes were very poorly associated with stress variables measured along the direction orthogonal to the stretch. Afferents showed weak directional selectivity: they were slightly more responsive to the variable stress along the circumferential direction of the hindlimb. When the skin was <b>stretched</b> <b>biaxially</b> (i. e., along both directions simultaneously) with identical pseudo-Gaussian noise stimuli, neuronal responses were associated with the same variables as above, but the associations were weaker...|$|R

Yet, {{it is still}} unclear how mechanical stress is sensed and transduced on the molecular level. To systematically elucidate the underlying signal transduction pathways, we analyzed the gene expression profile of stretched cardiomyocytes on a genome-wide scale in comparison with other inducers of hypertrophy such as pharmacological stimulation. Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were either <b>stretched</b> <b>biaxially</b> or stimulated with phenylephrine (PE), both resulting in a similar degree of hypertrophy. Microarray analyses revealed 164 genes 2. 0 -fold up- and 21 genes 0. 5 -fold downregulated (P 0. 01). Differential expression was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Genes of the “fetal gene program ” such as BNP were induced by both stretch (4. 2) and PE (2. 9). We also verified upregulation of known stretch-responsive genes, including HSP 70 (20. 9) and c-myc (3. 0). Moreover, several genes {{were found to be}} preferentially induced by stretch, such as the cardioprotective cytokine GDF 15 (24. 8) and heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox 1, 10. 8; both confirmed on protein level). Neither PE nor endothelin- 1 upregulated GDF 15 and Hmox 1, whereas angiotensin II significantly induced both genes. Conversely, the AT 1 receptor blocker irbesartan markedly blunted stretch-mediated GDF 15 and Hmox 1 upregulation, suggesting that the angiotensin receptor tranduces the biomechanical induction of these genes.

Primary AEC monolayers were <b>stretched</b> <b>biaxially</b> to create a change in surface area (ΔSA) of 12 %, 25 %, or 37 % in a cyclic manner at 0. 25 Hz for up to 60 min, or held tonic at 25 % ΔSA for up to 60 min, or left unstretched. By 10 min of stretch PJARs were evident in 25 % and 37 % ΔSA at 0. 25 Hz, but not for 12 % ΔSA at 0. 25 Hz, or at tonic 25 % ΔSA, or with no stretch. Treatment with 1 μM jasplakinolide abolished stretch-induced PJAR formation, however. As a rough index of remodeling rate, we measured spontaneous motions of 5 -μm microbeads bound to actin focal adhesion complexes on the apical membrane surfaces; within 1 min of exposure to ΔSA of 25 % and 37 %, these motions increased substantially, increased with increasing stretch frequency, and were consistent with our mechanistic hypothesis. With a tonic stretch, however, the spontaneous motion of microbeads attenuated back to unstretched levels, whereas PJAR remained unchanged. Stretch did not increase spontaneous microbead motion in human alveolar epithelial adenocarcinoma A 549 monolayers, confirming that this actin remodeling response to stretch was a cell-type specific response.

Stretched type I-like AECs undergo magnitude- and frequency-dependent actin cytoskeletal remodeling into perijunctional actin rings.

Type I-like AECs were also treated with Rho pathway inhibitors (ML- 7, Y- 27632, or blebbistatin) and stained for F-actin or treated with the myosin phosphatase inhibitor calyculin-A and quantified for monolayer permeability. Counter to our hypothesis, ROCK activity and MLC 2 phosphorylation decreased in type I-like AECs stretched to 25 % and 37 % ΔSA and did not change in monolayers stretched to 12 % ΔSA. Furthermore, RhoA activity decreased in type I-like AECs stretched to 37 % ΔSA. In contrast, MLC 2 phosphorylation in HPAECs increased when HPAECs were stretched to 12 % ΔSA but then decreased when they were stretched to 37 % ΔSA, similar to type I-like AECs. Perijunctional actin rings were observed in unstretched type I-like AECs treated with the Rho pathway inhibitor blebbistatin.

Here, we show that fully piezoelectric PVDF films can be produced via a single-step process that exploits the fact that PVDF can be molded at temperatures below its melting temperature, i. e. via solid-state-processing. We demonstrate that we thereby produce δ-PVDF, the piezoelectric charge coefficient of which is comparable to that of <b>biaxially</b> <b>stretched</b> β-PVDF. We expect that the simplicity and scalability of solid-state processing combined with the excellent piezoelectric properties of our PVDF structures will provide new opportunities for this commodity polymer and will open a range of possibilities for future, large-scale, industrial production of plastic piezoelectric films...|$|R
