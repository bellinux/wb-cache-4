50|$|Tineidae is {{a family}} of moths in the order Lepidoptera. Collectively, they are known as fungus <b>moths</b> or <b>tineid</b> <b>moths.</b> The family {{contains}} considerably more than 3,000 species in more than 300 genera. Most of the <b>tineid</b> <b>moths</b> are <b>small</b> or medium-sized, with wings held roofwise over the body when at rest. They are particularly common in the Palaearctic, but many occur elsewhere, and some are found very widely as introduced species.|$|R
50|$|Insects often adapt {{their nests}} {{to aid in}} {{parasite}} defense. For example, {{one of the key}} reasons the Polistes canadensis nests across multiple combs rather than building a single comb like {{much of the rest of}} its genus is as a defense mechanism against the infestation of <b>tineid</b> <b>moths.</b> The <b>tineid</b> <b>moth</b> lays its eggs within the wasps' nests and then these eggs hatch into larvae that can burrow from cell to cell and prey on wasp pupae. Adult wasps attempt to remove and kill moth eggs and larvae by chewing down the edges of cells, coating the cells with an oral secretion that gives the nest a dark brownish appearance.|$|R

50|$|As type {{species of}} Endrosis, the {{white-shouldered house moth}} was {{originally}} included in the genus when it was established (by Jacob Hübner in 1825) as Alucita betulinella, a scientific name established by Johan Christian Fabricius under this name in 1787. But Hübner had misidentified Fabricius' species, which was in reality a <b>tineid</b> <b>moth</b> known today as Nemaxera betulinella. In addition to this case of mistaken identity, the white-shouldered house moth as discussed by Hübner had actually been named Tinea lactella by J. N. C. M. Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. Earlier still, Carl Linnaeus had described the white-shouldered house moth as Phalaena (Tinea) sarcitrella in 1758, but neither Denis and Schiffermüller nor Hübner did remember it. Later authors, who {{were aware of the}} earlier descriptions, supposed the taxon of Denis and Schiffermüller or that of Linnaeus to be this type of Endrosis.|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of dipteran remains on mummified individuals {{can lead to}} either cause for curatorial concern or {{to a better understanding}} of the individual’s post-mortem environment. The present study analyzed insect remains associated with the body of a unique medieval mummy of religious significance, that of the Blessed Antonio Patrizi da Monticiano. A total of 79 puparia were examined and all were identified as Ophyra capensis (Diptera: Muscidae). Additionally, a desiccated moth (Lepidoptera: Tineidae) was encountered. Puparia of O. capensis would be associated with normal decomposition shortly after the death of the mummified individual, and not an infestation beginning during more recent years. Similarly, the <b>tineid</b> <b>moth</b> found would likely be related with decomposition of cloth associated with the remains. These findings illustrate how collection and identification of insects associated with human remains can distinguish between historical decomposition versus issues of modern curatorial concern...|$|R
40|$|On sub-Antarctic Marion Island, {{wandering}} albatross (Diomedea exulans) nests support high abundances of <b>tineid</b> <b>moth,</b> Pringleophaga marioni, caterpillars. Previous work {{proposed that the}} birds serve as thermal ecosystem engineers by elevating nest temperatures relative to ambient, thereby promoting growth and survival of the caterpillars. However, only 17 days of temperature data were presented previously, despite year-long nest occupation by birds. Previous sampling was also restricted to old and recently failed nests, though nests from which chicks have recently fledged are key to understanding how the engineering effect is realized. Here we build on previous work by providing nest temperature data for a full year and by sampling all three nest types. For the full duration of nest occupancy, temperatures within occupied nests are significantly higher, consistently by c. 7 °C, than those in surrounding soils and abandoned nests, declining noticeably when chicks fledge. Caterpillar abundance is significantly higher in new nests compared to nests from which chicks have fledged, which in turn have higher caterpillar abundances than old nests. Combined with recent information on the life history of P. marioni, our data suggest that caterpillars are incidentally added to the nests during nest construction, and subsequently benefit from an engineering effect...|$|R
50|$|The larvae of most <b>tineids</b> (e.g. clothes <b>moths)</b> {{have adapted}} to feeding on non-herbaceous material, but Ceratophaga are {{especially}} remarkable in that they feed, apparently exclusively, on solid keratin from dead vertebrates. For most species this means the horns and hooves of ungulates but the North American C. vicinella feeds on the shells of the tortoise Gopherus polyphemus.|$|R
5000|$|Polistes canadensis, {{commonly}} known as the red paper wasp, is a Neotropical, primitively eusocial wasp. A largely predatory species, it hunts for caterpillar meat to supply its colony, often supplementing its developing larvae with nectar. The most widely distributed American species of the Polistes genus, it colonizes multiple combs, which it rears year-round. [...] Emerging from hibernation in the spring, the females found nests built out of plant material such as dry grass and dead wood. These nests are not covered with an envelope and feature hexagonal cells in which eggs are laid and larvae develop. The Polistes canadensis colony divides its colony among several combs and does not reuse these combs as a defense mechanism against parasites such as the <b>tineid</b> <b>moth.</b> A single female queen with, on average, 9.1 foundresses, usually initiates the construction of new combs and cells to form nests. The more foundresses in a colony, the more combs produced. On average, combs grow for 15.4 days and achieve a size of 30.8 cells. One female queen exercises absolute dominance over all other females, often using lateral abdominal vibrations and stroking to suppress the aggressive behavior of her nestmates.While the queen handles all the nest reproduction, the subordinates work to care for, defend, and feed the nest instead. The divisions of labor within the nest correlate with the ages of the red paper wasps. Aside from the female division of labor, male red paper wasps engage in two alternative mating tactics: the role of the territorial male (who chases away intruding patrollers) {{and the role of the}} patroller (who flies from tree to tree and does not chase other males). The study of the dominance relations within the Polistes canadensis has provided insight into the social organization that characterizes many social invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|Present in a {{majority}} of colonies, the <b>tineid</b> <b>moth</b> (belongs to an undescribed genus) {{is the most common}} pest of the red paper wasps. The moth lays its eggs and then these eggs hatch into larvae that can burrow from cell to cell and prey on meconia and wasp pupae. While only 0.47% of the brood is lost to predation, the wasps perform many defense mechanisms to protect their nests from these infestations. Adult wasps attempt to remove and kill moth eggs and larvae by chewing down the edges of cells, coating the cells with an oral secretion that gives the nest a dark brownish appearance. The colonies then do not reuse these infested combs to raise another brood. The wasps also clip disused combs, reducing the rate of reinfestation by moths. In some instances, though, the comb clipping is also used to provide room for the construction of new combs. One of the key reasons the Polistes canadensis nests across multiple combs rather than building a single comb like {{much of the rest of}} its genus is as a defense mechanism against the infestation of these moths. The average amount of nesting material required to build a new cell in a comb decreases as the number of cells in the comb increases. Therefore, there are many inefficiencies associated with constructing several smaller combs rather than single larger combs like much of the rest of the Polistes genus does. For example, with the construction of multiple combs, comes the need to build a separate petiole for each comb. By building multiple combs and failing to reutilize them, the costs Polistes canadensis pay to defend its nests are significant and quite large in terms of energy expended in nest construction per brood reared. Other common parasites include three species of the obligate hymenopterous parasitoid: Seminota, Toechorychus albimaculatus and the Pachysomides iheringi. 4.4% of the red paper wasp pupae are lost to these Hymenoptera.|$|R
