40|$|The Discrete Event Systems (DES) {{theory of}} {{supervisory}} and {{state feedback control}} offers many advantages for implementing supervisory systems. Algorithmic concepts have been introduced {{to assure that the}} supervising algorithms are correct and meet the specifications. It is often assumed that the supervisory specifications are invariant or, at least, until a given <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> is completed. However, there are many practical applications where the supervising specifications update at real time. For example, in a Reconfigurable Discrete Event System (RDES) architecture, a bank of supervisors is defined to accommodate each identified operational condition or different supervisory specifications. This adaptive supervisory control system changes the supervisory configuration to accept coordinating commands or to adjust for changes in the controlled process. This paper addresses reconfiguration at the supervisory level of hybrid systems along with a RDES underlying architecture. It reviews the state-based supervisory control theory and extends it to the paradigm of RDES and in view of process control applications. The paper addresses theoretical issues with a limited number of practical examples. This control approach is particularly suitable for hierarchical reconfigurable hybrid implementations...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the legal}} base of the SSM, Council Regulation (EU) no 1024 / 2013 and a {{literature}} overview, this thesis will approach the main question: Is there a need to change accountability practices of the ECB now that it has new tasks regarding prudential supervision? This new Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will divide the European Central Bank (ECB) tasks into a monetary function and a supervisory function. Hereby the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of all Member States of the euro zone form the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The debate involving the ECB independence and its new integrated <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> alongside monetary policy raises a number of questions. This particularly relates to central bank independence, since the possibility of trade-offs between monetary policy and <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> could lead to conflicts of objectives. Hence, reputational risks are significant challenges and threats, which need to be overcome. Moreover, when executing the two tasks during crisis situations within the euro zone, the ECB must have a high incentive to improve its accountability practise towards the European public to strengthen its credibility. Therefore, the existing accountability framework of the ECB must be critically reviewed. Thus the ECB could take certain extra measures to maintain its high standard of accountability...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this short essay is to clarify the purpose of and issues {{surrounding}} the variant of educational supervision known as self-supervision. Educational supervision usually {{takes the form of}} individual supervision, team supervision, or group supervision. The self-supervision investigated here is a special form of individual supervision. Individual supervision is usually carried out by two people―a single supervisor and a single supervisee. With self-supervision, however, the instructor has a dual role, playing the parts of both supervisor and supervisee. Self-supervision, in short, is characterized {{by the fact that the}} instructor takes the initiative,organizes his or her supervision by himself or herself,and conducts an internal dialogue regarding own work performance. The issue thus becomes ａ matter of refashioning <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> so that they encourage, assist, and enable ａ single instructor to play this dual role, to develop an ability to self-reflect in order to carry out this internal dialogue regarding own work performance, and to encourage him or her to make better classes. In this article, I first discuss the positioning and characteristics of self-supervision in the area of educational supervision, and then analyze the necessity of self-supervision based on the present conditions facing instructors in their work. Grounded in the basic theories that make self-supervision possible, l then identify the objectives of selfしsupervisionand explore examples of <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> developed with the goal of achieving internal dialogue...|$|E

40|$|Within Scotland, as elsewhere, {{there has}} been a {{resurgence}} of interest in the critical role of supervision within social work practice. However, those in transition from practitioner to supervisor still commonly report feeling unprepared for their changing role and uncertain about what it entails. This paper will explore our experiences of delivering an accredited post-qualifying supervision course since 2008 to professionals from different sectors, diverse professional backgrounds, and with varying levels of supervisory experience. The course provides time and space to think about the different elements of supervision, and to consider how these translate into day-to-day practice. We will argue that the opportunity to explore the complexity of the <b>supervisory</b> <b>task,</b> while learning from and with peers, {{is an important part of}} making the transition in professional role and identity. Moreover, in organisational contexts where the reflective space which supervision can provide may feel under threat, and where the focus on people who use services can at times be lost, professional staff undertaking supervision training describe feeling more confident and competent in their role, with renewed commitment both to uphold the value of reflective supervision, and to sustain a clear emphasis on people who use services...|$|R
40|$|Practical {{approach}} to modelling and controlling stick-slip oscillations in oilwell drillstrings Eva María Navarro-López and Rodolfo Suárez Abstract — Stick-slip friction-induced oscillations appearing in oilwell drillstrings {{are a source}} of failures which reduce penetration rates and increase drilling operation costs. For this reason, a major problem to solve is modelling the drillstring torsional behaviour and proposing control solutions to help reduce stick-slip phenomenon. This paper is focused on both problems. On the one hand, it presents dynamic drillstring models in order to reproduce stick-slip vibrations under different operating conditions. The model used for the torque on the bit is the main difference with respect to other models proposed in the literature. On the other hand, some experience-based control estrategies are evaluated in order to reduce stick-slip oscillations. These estrategies will use the angular velocity at the drillstring upper part, the torque on the bit and the weight on the bit, proved to have a key importance in the reduction of drillstring torsional vibrations. The control approach followed is a decentralized one, i. e., the angular velocity at the top end of the drillstring and the bit velocity are controlled separately. The <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> is made by the driller. I...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{the optimal}} principal-supervisor-agent {{relationship}} in an incomplete contract setting. We show that while having a three-layer structure with full separation of tasks has no efficiency consequence under a complete contract, it becomes crucial under an incomplete contract {{and can even}} lead to a result of irrelevance of the contractual incompleteness. When {{it is not possible}} to achieve this outcome, managers non-compliance arises as equilibrium behaviour despite the presence of complying supervisors. However, although always more efficient relative to a bilateral structure, the three-layer structure is prone to collusion and renegotiation. We show that the response to such drawback is to involve financially the supervisor into the venture, with the extent of the participation depending on how costly it is to collude and renegotiate the contract terms. Last, we derive the welfare properties of the various contract forms showing that they depend on the relative scarcity of each form of financing (monitoring/non monitoring), on transaction costs of collusion and on the distribution of cash flows relative to the project size. This allows us to derive the conditions for the emergence of a bilateral structure in which the financing and <b>supervisory</b> <b>task</b> are centralised on to the same subject and to argue that riskier firms, with high risk of collusive behaviour, are more likely to be financed by a single monitoring lender and thus face a higher cost of credit. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{advanced}} autonomy, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations {{will likely}} be conducted by single operators controlling multiple UAVs. As operator attention is divided across multiple <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks,</b> {{there is a need}} to support the operator's awareness of the state of the tasks for safe and effective task management. This research explores enhancing audio cues of UAV interfaces for this futuristic control of multiple UAVs by a single operator. This thesis specifically assesses the value of continuous and discrete audio cues as indicators of course-deviations or late-arrivals to targets for UAV missions with single and multiple UAVs. In particular, this thesis addresses two questions: (1) when compared with discrete audio, does continuous audio better aid human supervision of UAV operations, and (2) is the effectiveness of the discrete or continuous audio support dependent on operator workload? An experiment was carried out on the Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Experiment (MAUVE) test bed with 44 military participants. Specifically, two continuous audio alerts were mapped to two human <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks</b> within MAUVE. These continuous alerts were tested against single beep discrete alerts. The results show that the use of the continuous audio alerts enhances a single operator's performance in monitoring single and multiple, semi-autonomous vehicles. The results also emphasize the necessity to properly integrate the continuous audio with other auditory alarms and visual representations in a display, as it is possible for discrete audio alerts to be masked by continuous audio, leaving operators reliant on the visual aspects of the display. by Hudson D.

This success can be largely attributed to learning shared representations from multiple <b>supervisory</b> <b>tasks.</b> However, existing multi-task approaches rely on enumerating multiple network architectures specific to the tasks at hand, that do not generalize.

These units combine the activations from multiple networks and can be trained end-to-end.
