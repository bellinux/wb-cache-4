5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
5|$|After Yogesh has met {{most of the}} girls, one of them, Sanjana (Priyanka Chopra), asks {{to talk to him}} privately. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> {{him that}} a boy has agreed to marry her, but she is reluctant. She asks Yogesh to give her time {{to decide what to do}} about her boyfriend. He agrees, telling her about his {{problems}} with Jitu. Sanjana, touched that Yogesh will help her despite his own problems, hugs him. Devu walks in, and thinks he has interrupted them; Sanjana chases him, trying to explain. Tailing Devu, the detective is unaware that he had been with Anila at a hotel and sees him with Sanjana. Sanjana shows Devu a picture; when he says something supposedly demeaning, she becomes angry and tries to leave. Devu stops her, holding her while she cries before they leave in his car. The detective convinces Yogesh and his father that Devu is having an affair with Sanjana. Anila then comes downstairs, looking for Devu. Yogesh shows her the photos, telling her that Devu and Sanjana went to Khandala, a hill station near Mumbai. The detective tells Devu's wife this story, and they find Devu at a hotel with Sanjana. Devu thinks Yogesh betrayed him, and Yogesh thinks Devu is having an affair with Sanjana.|$|E
25|$|The ad depicts Mrs Claus as {{more modern}} than {{previous}} examples, with her riding a snowmobile and flying a helicopter while Santa is out delivering gifts {{in the traditional}} sleigh. At {{the conclusion of the}} ad, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> Santa “Well it wouldn’t be fun if you knew all my secrets” suggesting she has a secret life assisting with Christmas present delivery. The brand also created a social media campaign in which Mrs. Claus answered requests and questions from members of the public.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Yes; {{and what}} will <b>she</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> that? what does <b>she</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> it? Just that her father's wishes are sacred to her, and that she shall always look up to me as her {{guardian}} whether I care to face the responsibility or not. Refuse! You might as well refuse to accept the embraces of a boa constrictor when once it gets round your neck.|$|R

500|$|Reports of {{the reasons}} behind Lehzen's {{departure}} varied; court diarist Charles Greville noted she was leaving [...] "for her health (as <b>she</b> <b>says),</b> <b>to</b> stay five or six months, but it is supposed never to return." [...] The Times however reported that she was simply visiting friends in Germany. After her departure, family adviser Baron Stockmar remarked of the affair thatt was not without great difficulty that the Prince succeeded in getting rid of [...] She was foolish enough to contest his influence, and not to conform herself to the change in her position... If she had done so, and conciliated the P, she might have remained in the Palace {{to the end of}} her life.|$|E
500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and cotton candy. The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> him, [...] "You're special. I wish you could see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home through the rain, and sets his keys down with a sigh. The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E
500|$|Another spoof was of {{a musical}} {{detailing}} the life of Bessie Bunter, entitled Bessie! The musical starts as an Andrew Lloyd Webber parody with the setting of a girl's private school but they've [...] included {{issues such as the}} Spanish Civil War and the McCarthy era. On being asked about Bessie's fatness, the producer (Sir Dave) replies [...] "it is a sort of mental fatness". The lead actress, Carla, belts out in rehearsals one of the songs, [...] "One Day", despite insisting she has [...] "pneumonia". <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the role she starts with the bra and then everything falls into place. Later, Bessie! is rewritten completely and the previous cast are sacked: it is, after all, a musical about [...] "a big fat girl". Meanwhile, Carla is crying and being comforted by her colleagues, but further upset by Sir Dave telling her to [...] "get the **** out of here will you Carla, we don't really want snot all over the plush love" [...] In this rewritten part of Bessie, she is played by Victoria Wood who sings an impossibly glamorous and upbeat number. However, she complains at the end that [...] "you're {{going to have to change}} this floor".|$|E
6000|$|He {{lifted his}} hat, mounted his horse, and was gone. She {{had not even}} known that he could ride--that was strangely the first thought. The second {{discovered}} herself intent upon the rhythm of his canter as it died southward upon the road. There was shame in this, mingled with a thankfulness {{that he would not}} meet Clarence. She hurried a few steps toward the house, and stopped again. What should <b>she</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Clarence now? What could <b>she</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did <b>she</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you?" [...] I asked, for by now I was {{interested}} enough. Who wouldn't be when old Potts took to describing beautiful women? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] responded Tom Flynn {{with some}} cheerfulness. [...] "P'r'aps we may. But {{how about your}} wife, Old Man? What does <b>SHE</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> it?" ...|$|R
500|$|The final segment, [...] "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] is {{a parody}} of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (and was {{supposed}} to be named [...] "It's The Great Pumpkin, Milhouse," [...] but due to legal reasons, was renamed) and contains several references to the Peanuts series. In the segment, Milhouse wears the same clothes and plays the same role as Linus van Pelt. Lisa is modelled after Sally Brown and Bart looks like Charlie Brown; he even says [...] "good grief", echoing Charlie Brown's catchphrase. The main theme to Peanuts [...] "Linus and Lucy" [...] is played several times. A redesigned version of Santa's Little Helper can be seen sleeping on top of his dog house and Homer is seen sleeping on top of his house {{in a manner similar to}} Snoopy. When Marge first speaks, she uses a muted trombone. This is {{a parody of}} the [...] "wah wah wah" [...] voice that is used for adults in the various Peanuts specials. At the end of the segment, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> the audience that they can send complaints to an address which she only says in more muted trombone noises. Milhouse' prayer to the Grand Pumpkin is similar to the Nicene Creed. The dance scene during the Halloween party is a parody of the dance scene in A Charlie Brown Christmas right down to Kang and Kodos in a nonspeaking cameo as the twins 3 and 4.|$|E
2500|$|When Enrique finally {{decides to}} take the position, Rosa becomes gravely ill with typhus {{contracted}} from the rat bites she received during their border crossing. When this happens, Enrique must make the tough decision of missing the flight to Chicago to be by her side, and thus loses the position. As Enrique visits the hospital, Rosa laments that she will not live to enjoy {{the fruits of their}} harrowing journey to the U.S. Rosa sums up the film's major theme when <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> Enrique: ...|$|E
2500|$|Estella Tincknell {{describes}} how the particular combination of well-known and obscure recordings helps establish the film as a [...] "self-consciously 'cool' text. [...] use of the mono-tracked, beat-heavy style of early 1960s U.S. 'underground' pop mixed with 'classic' ballads such as Dusty Springfield's 'Son of a Preacher Man' {{is crucial to the}} film's postmodern knowingness." [...] She contrasts the soundtrack with that of Forrest Gump, the highest-grossing film of 1994, which also relies on period pop recordings: [...] "he version of 'the sixties' offered by Pulp Fiction... is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter-culture featured in Forrest Gump, but is, rather, a more genuinely marginal form of sub-culture based around a lifestyle— surfing, 'hanging'— that is resolutely apolitical." [...] The soundtrack is central, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>to</b> the film's engagement with the [...] "younger, cinematically knowledgeable spectator" [...] it solicits.|$|E

2500|$|In Milagro, {{the eighteenth}} {{episode of the}} sixth season, Agent Scully’s {{vulnerability}} is exposed. In this episode, the murderer takes the victim’s heart out. The suspect, a writer named Phillip Padgett, has a particular interest in Scully and is fascinated by her beauty and personality. When she goes to a church to observe a painting, the writer is there and talks to her about the Sacred Heart of Jesus. During the conversation he says she visits the church because she likes art, but not as place of worship. Scully doesn’t say otherwise and later <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> Agent Mulder the writer told her her life story. All this suggests that Scully isn’t a devout Roman Catholic, although she attempted to approach again the Catholic community and the Catholic faith to which she was devout in her youth, after handling the strange case presented in [...] "Revelations" [...] and also after dealing with life-threatening cancer during the fourth season.|$|E
