We {{prove that}} the {{homology}} of the mapping class group of any 3 manifold stabilizes under <b>connected</b> <b>sum</b> and boundary <b>connected</b> <b>sum</b> <b>with</b> an arbitrary 3 -manifold when both manifolds are compact and orientable. The stabilization also holds for the quotient group by twists along spheres and disks, and includes as particular cases homological stability for symmetric automorphisms of free groups, automorphisms of certain free products, and handlebody mapping class groups. Our methods also apply to manifolds of other dimensions {{in the case of}} stabilization by punctures. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} extend to 3 -manifolds the homological stability theorems for mapping class groups of surfaces proved by Harer and Ivanov [14, 25]. The classical surface stabilization is with respect to genus, achieved by taking <b>connected</b> <b>sum</b> <b>with</b> a torus.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that two {{homotopy}} equivalent, simply connected 4 -manifolds become diffeomorphic after taking the <b>connected</b> <b>sum</b> <b>with</b> enough copies of S 2 ˜×S 2 [20]. The same result is true with S 2 ˜×S 2 replaced by S 2 × S 2, and similar results are known for special families of 4 -manifolds when S 2 ˜×S 2 is replaced by other manifolds. Taking the <b>connected</b> <b>sum</b> <b>with</b> one of these specific manifolds is called stabilization. For this paper, we will only consider <b>connected</b> <b>sums</b> <b>with</b> S 2 ˜×S 2, and stabilization will refer to taking the <b>connected</b> <b>sum</b> <b>with</b> this specific manifold. Most of the arguments in this paper can be easily modified to address other summands as well. Many families of distinct homotopy equivalent simply connected 4 -manifolds that become mutually diffeomorphic after one stabilization are known [15]. There is, in fact, no known pair of homotopy equivalent simply connected 4 -manifolds which are not diffeomorphic after one stabilization. In this paper, we will introduce a cut and paste move, called a geometrically null log transform, and prove that any two manifolds related by a sequence of these moves become diffeomorphic after one stabilization. To motivate the cut and paste move, we will use the symplectic fiber sum, and a construction of Fintushel and Stern to construct several large families of 4 -manifolds. We will then proceed to prove that the members of any one of these families become diffeomorphic after one stabilization. Finally, w...|$|R
