Specifically, this study focuses on {{an investigation of}} the effects of the moisture conditions on the strength performance and durability of very soft clay <b>soil</b> <b>stabilized</b> with Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures during the wetting–drying cycles, referred to as weathering conditions in this study. Cylindrical <b>stabilized</b> <b>soil</b> specimens were produced and then cured for 28 days. The cured specimens were subjected to different numbers of wetting–drying cycles, and then tested for unconfined compressive strength. The results show that the compressive strength increased with an increase in the Bassanite content for the different wetting–drying cycles investigated. The increase in the Bassanite content is associated with the increase in the dry unit weight, as well as in the decrease in the moisture content of the stabilized specimens for the different wetting–drying cycles investigated. The compressive strength of the <b>soil</b> <b>stabilized</b> with the Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures gradually decreases with an increase in the number of wetting–drying cycles, and the earlier cycles are seen to have a more negative effect on durability than the later cycles. Generally, the influence of the wetting–drying cycles on changes in the strength, durability and volume of the soft clay <b>soil</b> <b>stabilized</b> with Bassanite and furnace cement mixtures is not significant. This is evidence that the use of recycled Bassanite, produced from gypsum waste to <b>stabilize</b> soft clay <b>soil,</b> achieves acceptable durability, raises the strength performance and improves the engineering properties of soft clay soil in a wet environment. In addition, the effective use of gypsum waste contributes to the development of a sustainable society by reducing the huge quantity of solid waste and establishing a sound environment...|$|R

Results of the experiment indicated that organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), bulk density, infiltration rate, bund height, and inter-terrace slope are significantly (p? 0. 05) affected by soil conservation measures. The non-conserved fields had significantly lower OC, total N, and infiltration rate; whereas higher bulk density as compared to the conserved fields with different conservation measures. However, no significant differences in bulk density were observed among the conservation methods. The field treated with 9 -year old <b>soil</b> bund <b>stabilized</b> with tree lucerne or sole soil bund had significantly higher OC content than all other treatments. Fields having 6 -year old soil bunds had lower OC and total N when compared to fields having 9 -year old soil bunds irrespective of their method of stabilization. Fields with <b>soil</b> bunds <b>stabilized</b> with vetiver grass had the highest bund height and the lowest inter-terrace slope than fields with the remaining conservation measures.
