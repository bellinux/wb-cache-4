40|$|Gonads and {{otoliths}} {{were collected}} from a total of 300 <b>silk</b> <b>snapper</b> sampled from January 8, 2005 to December 30, 2005 to determine the size of 50 % maturation, reproductive season and age and growth. Samples {{were collected from}} deep water fishers from Rincón. The catch method was buoying a main line with several hooks tied up to a buoy and left to drift with the current. In any given fishing trip up to three buoys are set to drift at determined fishing ground simultaneously for an hour. Of the total individuals sampled a total of 235 histological cuts were prepared, of which 108 (46. 0 %) were males and 127 were females (54. 0 %). The obtained males to females ratio was 1 M: 1. 18 F, roughly one to one. Males sizes ranged from 211 to 515 mm fork length. Mean size of males was 321. 30 mm ± 60. 54. Sampled females sizes ranged from 224 to 603 mm of fork length. The obtained mean size of females was 333. 43 mm ± 73. 19. Of total sampled females 78. 0 % were mature, meanwhile 61. 1 % of males were mature. From the gonadosomatic index (GSI) of females shown in Figure 8 {{it can be seen}} that <b>silk</b> <b>snapper</b> reproduce in all sampled months with a peak during November to December. It was not possible to plot the age growth curve for sampled silk snappers. Results for the number of otoliths ring versus fork length yielded a non-linear relationship...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of bathymetric distribution of five snappers caught along the Brazilian Northeastern coast by artisanal fleets through {{the analysis of}} the catch composition and relative abundance (CPUE) showed that, on the overall, fished mean size increased along depth and that particular species dominated the catch according to the depth strata. Mutton snapper, L. analis, yellowtail snapper, L. chrysurus, and dog snapper, L. jocu were mainly caught at intermediate depth (20 - 80 m) whereas lane snapper, L. synagris, and <b>silk</b> <b>snapper,</b> L. vivanus, inhabit respectively shallow (80 m) waters. Each fleet category exploited preferentially a particular combination of species and their size range. The fleet dynamic of the Northeast Brazil is technologically heterogeneous and determines the catch composition. Geographical distribution of the fishery and technical interaction between fleets and gears should be considered by the management of these species {{in order to maintain the}} sustainability of the stock and to guarantee the continuance of the resource...|$|E

A distribuição batimétrica de cinco espécies de peixes do Nordeste Brasileiro foi examinada através da análise da composição da captura e e abundância relativa (CPUE) mostrou que, de uma maneira geral, o comprimento furcal aumentou com a profundidade e que algumas espécies dominaram a captura de acordo com a faixa de profundidade. A cioba, L. analis, a guaiúba, L. chrysurus, e o dentão, L. jocu foram principalmente pescados na zona intermediaria (20 - 80 m) enquanto ariocó, L. synagris e o pargo olho-de-vidro L. vivanus ocorreram respectivamente nas águas rasas e nas águas profundas. Cada tipo de embarcação do Nordeste do Brasil explota preferencialmente uma combinação particular de espécies e uma determinada amplitude de tamanho. A dinâmica da frota do nordeste do Brasil é tecnologicamente heterogênea e determina a composição da captura. A distribuição geográfica da pesca e a interação técnica entre as frotas e as artes de pesca devem ser consideradas pelo manejo destas espécies visando a manutenção dos estoques em bases sustentáveis e a garantia de continuidade do recurso...|$|E
