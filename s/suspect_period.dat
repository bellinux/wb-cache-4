40|$|The {{earnings}} management literature {{relies heavily}} on accrual expectation models to make inferences about opportunism. However, many have argued that legitimate changes in accruals are often misclassified as opportunism. This paper proposes an alternative approach to detect opportunism by examining {{the reliability of the}} accruals recorded by managers in a <b>suspect</b> <b>period,</b> where reliable accruals translate into the cash flows to which the accruals relate. A key feature of the model is that accrual levels, rather than changes, are examined as they provide a more complete measure of the estimates included in earnings for the period. Simulation-based tests of the accrual reliability model indicate that it is both reasonably powerful and not susceptible to the same performance-related bias as are discretionary accruals.

40|$|We {{elaborate}} {{an error}} {{budget for the}} long-term accuracy of IGS (International Global Navigation Satellite System Service) polar motion estimates, concluding {{that it is probably}} about 25 – 30  μas (1 -sigma) overall, although {{it is not possible to}} quantify possible contributions (mainly annual) that might transfer directly from aliases of subdaily rotational tide errors. The leading sources are biases arising from the need to align daily, observed terrestrial frames, within which the pole coordinates are expressed and which are continuously deforming, to the secular, linear international reference frame. Such biases are largest over spans longer than about a year. Thanks to the very large number of IGS tracking stations, the formal covariance errors are much smaller, around 5 to 10  μas. Large networks also permit the systematic frame-related errors to be more effectively minimized but not eliminated. A number of periodic errors probably also influence polar motion results, mainly at annual, GPS (Global Positioning System) draconitic, and fortnightly periods, but their impact on the overall error budget is unlikely to be significant except possibly for annual tidal aliases.

40|$|As part of {{a project}} to better {{characterize}} comparatively bright but so far little studied cataclysmic variables in the southern hemisphere, we have obtained spectroscopic and photometric data of the nova-like variables LS IV - 08 ^ o 3 and HQ Mon, and of the Z Cam type dwarf nova ST Cha. The spectra of all systems are as expected for their respective types. We derive improved orbital ephemeris of LS IV - 08 ^ o 3 and map its accretion disk {{in the light of}} the Hα emission using Doppler tomography. We find that the emission has a two component origin, arising in the outer parts of the accretion disk and possibly on the illuminated face of the secondary star. The light curve of LS IV - 08 ^ o 3 exhibits a low level of flickering and indications for a modulation on the orbital period. Spectroscopy of HQ Mon suggests an orbital period of ≈ 5. 15 hours which is incompatible with previous (uncertain) estimates. The light curves show the typical low scale flickering of UX UMa type nova-like systems, superposed upon variations on longer time scales. During one night a modulation with a period of ≈ 41 min is observed, visible for at least 4 hours. However, it does not repeat itself in other nights. A spectroscopic orbital period of ≈ 5. 5 hours is derived for ST Cha. A previously <b>suspected</b> <b>period</b> of 6. 8 hours (or alternatively 9. 6 hours), based on historical photographic photometry is incompatible with the spectroscopic period.

40|$|Abridged] Classical novae (CNe) {{represent}} the major class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) {{in the central}} region of our neighbouring galaxy M 31. We performed a dedicated monitoring of the M 31 central region, aimed to detect SSS counterparts of CNe, with XMM-Newton and Chandra between Nov and Mar of the years 2009 / 10, 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12. In total we detected 24 novae in X-rays. Seven of these sources were known from previous observations, including the M 31 nova with the longest SSS phase, M 31 N~ 1996 - 08 b, which was found to fade below our X-ray detection limit 13. 8 yr after outburst. Of the new discoveries several novae exhibit significant variability in their short-term X-ray light curves with one object showing a <b>suspected</b> <b>period</b> of about 1. 3 h. We studied the SSS state {{of the most recent}} outburst of a recurrent nova which had previously shown the shortest time ever observed between two outbursts (about 5 yr). The total number of M 31 novae with X-ray counterpart was increased to 79 and we subjected this extended catalogue to detailed statistical studies. Four previously indicated correlations between optical and X-ray parameters could be confirmed and improved. We found indications that the multi-dimensional parameter space of nova properties might be dominated by a single physical parameter. We discuss evidence for a different X-ray behaviour of novae in the M 31 bulge and disk. Exploration of the multi-wavelength parameter space of optical and X-ray measurements is shown to be a powerful tool for examining properties of extragalactic nova populations. While there are hints that the different stellar populations of M 31 (bulge vs disk) produce dissimilar nova outbursts, there is also growing evidence that the overall behaviour of an average nova might be understood in surprisingly simple terms.

Law enforcement authorities may intercept and record specific conversations with a court order and CDRs can {{be obtained}} from telephone service providers. However, the CDRs of a <b>suspect</b> for a <b>period</b> of time are often fairly large in volume. To obtain useful information and make appropriate decisions automatically from such large amount of CDRs become more and more difficult. Current analysis tools are designed to present only numerical results rather than help us make useful decisions. In this paper, an algorithm based on fuzzy decision tree (FDT) for analyzing CDRs is proposed. We conducted experimental evaluation to verify the proposed algorithm and the result is very promising. © 2011 ICST Institute for Computer Science, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.
