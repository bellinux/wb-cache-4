25|$|At {{the center}} of this {{strategy}} was Iraq's oil. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector.

Syrian President Hafez al-Assad would become deputy leader in a union, and this would drive <b>Saddam</b> <b>to</b> obscurity. Saddam acted to secure his grip on power.

25|$|After the Ba'athists {{took power}} in 1968, Saddam focused on {{attaining}} stability {{in a nation}} riddled with profound tensions. Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus Shi'ite, Arab versus Kurd, tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant. The desire for stable rule in a country rife with factionalism led <b>Saddam</b> <b>to</b> pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.|$|E
25|$|In February and March 2003, {{he visited}} Iraq {{and talked with}} Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, as a special {{representative}} of President Putin. He brought to Baghdad a message from Putin to call for <b>Saddam</b> <b>to</b> resign voluntarily. He tried to prevent the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a move which received some support from several nations opposed to the war. Primakov suggested that Saddam must hand over all Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} to the United Nations, among other things. However, the Iraqi leader told Primakov he was confident that no harm would befall him personally—a belief that was later proven incorrect. Primakov later claimed Saddam's execution in 2006 was rushed to prevent him from revealing information on Iraq–United States relations that could embarrass the U.S. government.|$|E
25|$|According to veteran {{intelligence}} officer Malcolm Nance, al-Douri and the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council developed deep relations with Hafez al-Assad and the Syrian Ba'ath party, despite historical {{differences between the}} two Ba'ath factions. Al-Douri urged <b>Saddam</b> <b>to</b> open oil pipelines with Syria, building a financial relationship with the Assad family. After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, al-Douri allegedly fled to Damascus, Syria where he organised the National Command of the Islamic Resistance which co-ordinated major combat operations during the Iraqi insurgency. In 2009, General David Petraeus, who was at the time heading the United States Central Command, told reporters from Al Arabiya that al-Douri was residing in Syria. Iraqi leaders such as former national security advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie and former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have accused the Assad government of harbouring and supporting Iraqi militants.|$|E

Hussein was referred to the Mayo Clinic in the United States after having urological problems; he had his left kidney removed after tests showed his ureter contained precancerous cells. When Hussein went back healed to Jordan, he received a hero's welcomea third of Jordan's population filled the streets to greet him. On 23November 1992 he gave an unusually aggressive speech. He called on extremists on both the right and left of the political spectrum to end their opposition to the peace negotiations, denounced what he saw as the Gulf countries' undemocratic nature, and called on <b>Saddam</b> <b>to</b> introduce democracy to Iraq. Meanwhile, Yitzhak Rabin, under the leftist Labor Party, emerged as prime minister of Israel. Thus, the PLO and Israeli representatives were quick to reach an agreement, which culminated in the 1993 Oslo Accords. The Accords were held in secrecy between Arafat and Rabin without Hussein's knowledge, completely marginalizing Jordan and the Palestinian-Jordanian delegation in Washington.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2002, a {{representative}} of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former Central Intelligence Agency Counterterrorism Department head Vincent Cannistraro stating that Saddam [...] "knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he {{had weapons of mass destruction}} (WMDs)." [...] Cannistraro further added that [...] "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it." [...] Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all [...] "killed" [...] by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed <b>Saddam</b> <b>to</b> remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.|$|E
2500|$|Iranian leaders, {{including}} Khomeini and {{his successor}} Ali Khamenei, have long espoused {{a belief that the}} U.S. gave Saddam Hussein a [...] "green light" [...] to launch the invasion of Iran—something U.S. officials [...] "have unanimously and vociferously denied." [...] Joost Hiltermann observed that a U.S. [...] "green light" [...] is also [...] "the conventional wisdom in the Arab world." [...] In fact, Iranian suspicions that the U.S. would use Iraq to retaliate for the hostage-taking predated the invasion, as Carter noted in his diary on April 10, 1980: [...] "The Iranian terrorists are making all kinds of crazy threats to kill the American hostages if they are invaded by Iraq—whom they identify as an American puppet." [...] There are several reasons for this perception, including some circumstantial evidence. First, although the Carter administration had long been interested in rapprochement with Iraq, prior to the hostage crisis the administration's preference for Iran as the [...] "strategic choice" [...] effectively rendered this impossible. After the dramatic break in Iran–United States relations, however, both American and Iraqi officials made a number of positive gestures towards one another, including [...] "a speech by Saddam denouncing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan," [...] and culminating in an April 10 statement by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David D. Newsom that [...] "The United States is prepared... to resume diplomatic relations with Iraq at any time." [...] Saddam later acknowledged that Iraq had accepted Newsom's offer [...] "during the two months prior to the war between us and Iran" [...] but [...] "when the war started, and to avoid misinterpretation, we postponed the establishment of relations." [...] Moreover, the CIA—desperate for intelligence on Iran—maintained contacts with Iranian opposition figures including [...] "the Shah's last Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar" [...] and Gholam Ali Oveisi, who were themselves in touch with Iraqi officials and had encouraged <b>Saddam</b> <b>to</b> invade. Even though declassified documents state the U.S. [...] "would not fund, assist, or guide [...] movement, but [...] providing the channel as a means by which he could provide us information on his intentions and capabilities," [...] and there is no evidence either Bakhtiar or Oveisi were acting {{at the behest of the}} U.S., [...] "the Iranian militants occupying the embassy found dozens of documents detailing these contacts"—which began [...] "even before the hostage crisis"—and [...] "read them extremely selectively." [...] What ultimately convinced the Iranian leadership of [...] "American complicity in any Iraqi attack" [...] was the July 9 Nojeh coup plot, a failed military coup d'état against Khomeini funded by Iraqi intelligence through Bakhtiar (the Iraqis may have notified the Iranian authorities in advance, as they understood [...] "the damage the subsequent purge would inflict on the Iranian military"). Bakhtiar told the plotters the U.S. [...] "had given [...] its blessing," [...] but [...] "he was lying" [...] as the U.S. [...] "knew nothing about the Nojeh operation and would likely have opposed it on the grounds that it would endanger the lives of the hostages." [...] In August, Saddam made a trip to Saudi Arabia in which King Khalid [...] "reportedly gave his personal blessing to the invasion and promised Saudi backing," [...] which Bryan R. Gibson commented was [...] "a very significant gesture, especially in light of the closeness of American–Saudi relations." [...] United States Secretary of State Alexander Haig told Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, that it was during this visit that [...] "President Carter gave the Iraqis a green light to launch the war against Iran through [...] Fahd," [...] as related to Haig by Fahd himself, but at a 2008 conference several academics and former U.S. officials questioned the veracity of this assertion as well as the motives of both Haig and Fahd in promulgating it. As described by Malcolm Byrne: [...] "The American veterans were unanimous that no 'green light' was ever given, and that the Haig document, while intriguing on its face, leaves far too much room for interpretation to be definitive. In any event the Saudi comments did not address the various policy arguments that militated against an invasion—chiefly, the potential danger posed to the American hostages in Tehran—which the participants said held sway with most American officials." ...|$|E

50|$|When <b>Saddam</b> Hussein came <b>to</b> power {{concerns}} {{turned to}} the division between Sunni and Shi'ite factions in Iraq. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, had taken up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of An Najaf. There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, whom Saddam tolerated. Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there <b>to</b> overthrow <b>Saddam,</b> contributing <b>to</b> <b>Saddam's</b> decision <b>to</b> expel Khomeini in 1978 to France. In early 1979, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution, thus giving way to an Islamic republic led by Khomeini. The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq. Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas—hostile to his secular rule —were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population. Ultimately, an eight-year-long Iran-Iraq War ensued, ending in a stalemate.|$|R
50|$|The invasion's purpose, {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>Saddam,</b> was <b>to</b> {{blunt the}} edge of Khomeini's movement and to thwart his attempts to export his Islamic revolution to Iraq and the Persian Gulf states. Saddam hoped that by annexing Khuzestan, he would send such a blow to Iran's prestige that {{it would lead to}} the new government's downfall, or, at the very least, end Iran's calls for his overthrow.|$|R
