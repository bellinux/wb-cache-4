50|$|In 2010, Danielewski {{announced}} {{that he was going to}} be doing a stage performance of the limited-release novella The Fifty Year Sword. The first of these performances was October 31, 2010 at the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater (REDCAT) in downtown Los Angeles. There were two back-to-back sold-out performances that night. The production featured music, guests performers, five people reading for the five speakers in the novella, and <b>shadow</b> <b>casting</b> on a large screen. Christine Marie was the shadow caster commissioned for the project. Betsy Brandt, who played Marie Schrader on Breaking Bad, was one of the five performers reading for the five voices in the novella. The following year, on October 31, 2011, Danielewski produced a slightly modified production of The Fifty Year Sword back to back at the REDCAT again. This time there was live music by Partch Ensemble percussionists Matthew Cook and T.J. Troy, as well as special guest performances. The production still featured Christine Marie's <b>shadow</b> <b>casting</b> and five actors reading for the five speakers in the novella. The two performances were again sold out.|$|E
50|$|Jean-Jacques Lequeu is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} more eccentric and obscene of the early visionary architects. He worked as a civil servant as a cartographer, surveyor, and draftsman, but owing to the French Revolution his career as an actual architect never came to fruition. He spent most of his career preparing an unpublished treatise entitled Architecture Civile, which is primarily composed of the rudiments of architectural drawing and <b>shadow</b> <b>casting,</b> which is followed by a series of fragments of his own fanciful architectural designs. These designs are usually an elevation or section or plan, but rarely an entire design.|$|E
50|$|In many {{implementations}} it is {{practical to}} render only {{a subset of}} the objects in the scene to the shadow map in order to save some of {{the time it takes to}} redraw the map. Also, a depth offset which shifts the objects away from the light may be applied to the shadow map rendering in an attempt to resolve stitching problems where the depth map value is close to the depth of a surface being drawn (i.e., the <b>shadow</b> <b>casting</b> surface) in the next step. Alternatively, culling front faces and only rendering the back of objects to the shadow map is sometimes used for a similar result.|$|E

Early work utilised a single crystal of known orientation being inserted into the SEM chamber and a particular feature of the EBSP was known to correspond to the pattern centre. Later developments involved exploiting various geometric relationships between the generation of an EBSP and the chamber geometry (<b>shadow</b> <b>casting</b> and phosphor movement).|$|E
5000|$|The {{article in}} issue number 4, [...] "Architectural {{software}} on the cheap" [...] was contributed by Paul Coates, then {{working in the}} School of Architecture at Liverpool Polytechnic.

In those days the conventional wisdom was that CAD required a much larger computer and expensive graphics hardware. The article illustrated the use of the relatively cheap combination of a PET micro and an A3 plotter for generating floor plans, <b>shadow</b> <b>casting</b> and daylight calculation. The work illustrated was funded by a small RIBA (The Royal Institute of British Architects) grant for teaching architecture using computers.|$|E
5000|$|All heliodons {{can benefit}} by {{including}} a moveable, tiltable device {{that can be}} set to match any surface on a model to show angle of incidence. The angle of incidence device indicates the relative intensity of the direct beam on the surface. The device consists of a diagram of concentric rings around a shadow-casting pointer perpendicular to the diagram. Each ring represents a percent of the direct solar beam incident on the surface. The percentage varies from 100%—the ray runs straight down the pointer perpendicular to the diagram—to zero—the ray runs parallel to the diagram and misses surface. The cosine of the angle of incidence gives the percentage. A cosine of 0.9, 90%, for example, corresponds to an angle of incidence of 26.84 degrees. The radius of the ring for the angle is equal to its tangent times {{the height of the}} <b>shadow</b> <b>casting</b> pointer. A 45 degree angle of incidence would generate a cosine of about [...]7, 70%, for example. Since the tangent of 45 degrees is 1, the radius of the 70% ring would be equal to the height of the shadow-casting rod.|$|E

5000|$|As an {{explanation}} {{as to why the}} illusion works, Adelson writes:The visual system needs to determine the color of objects in the world. In this case the problem is to determine the gray shade of the checks on the floor. Just measuring the light coming from a surface (the luminance) is not enough: a cast shadow will dim a surface, so that a white surface in shadow may be reflecting less light than a black surface in full light. The visual system uses several tricks to determine where the shadows are and how to compensate for them, {{in order to determine the}} shade of gray [...] "paint" [...] that belongs to the surface. The first trick is based on local contrast. In shadow or not, a check that is lighter than its neighboring checks is probably lighter than average, and vice versa. In the figure, the light check in shadow is surrounded by darker checks. Thus, even though the check is physically dark, it is light when compared to its neighbors. The dark checks outside the shadow, conversely, are surrounded by lighter checks, so they look dark by comparison. A second trick is based on the fact that shadows often have soft edges, while paint boundaries (like the checks) often have sharp edges. The visual system tends to ignore gradual changes in light level, so that it can determine the color of the surfaces without being misled by shadows. In this figure, the shadow looks like a shadow, both because it is fuzzy and because the <b>shadow</b> <b>casting</b> object is visible. The [...] "paintness" [...] of the checks is aided by the form of the [...] "X-junctions" [...] formed by 4 abutting checks. This type of junction is usually a signal that all the edges should be interpreted as changes in surface color rather than in terms of shadows or lighting. As with many so-called illusions, this effect really demonstrates the success rather than the failure of the visual system. The visual system is not very good at being a physical light meter, but that is not its purpose. The important task is to break the image information down into meaningful components, and thereby perceive the nature of the objects in view.|$|E

To approximate the result of environment lighting and shadowing, the system uses a dome of <b>shadow</b> <b>casting</b> light sources.
