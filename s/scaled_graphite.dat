40|$|In this paper, a {{multiscale}} modelling {{approach is}} followed for the modelling {{of time and}} temperature dependent behaviour of compacted graphite cast iron (CGI) material.

40|$|Graphite oxide (GO) and its {{constituent}} layers (i. e., graphene oxide) {{display a}} broad range of functional groups and, as such, have attracted significant attention for use in numerous applications. GO is commonly prepared using the "Hummers method" or a variant thereof in which graphite is treated with KMnO 4 and various additives in H 2 SO 4. Despite its omnipresence, the underlying chemistry of such oxidation reactions is not well understood and typically affords results that are irreproducible and, in some cases, unsafe. To overcome these limitations, the oxidation of graphite under Hummers-type conditions was monitored over time using in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure analyses with synchrotron radiation. In conjunction with other atomic absorption spectroscopy, UV vis spectroscopy and elemental analysis measurements, the underlying mechanism of the oxidation reaction was elucidated, and the reaction conditions were optimized.

40|$|The oxidation-corrosion {{behaviour}} of {{hot rolled}} alloys was examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The corrosion behaviour of the non-oxidised alloys was first determined {{in order to}} have a reference behaviour. Then, each alloy was oxidised for 1 and 3 days at 650 degrees C in air and its corrosion behaviour was also determined. For all the alloys, Fe 2 O 3 was formed at the scale-gas interface. However, the Fe 2 O 3 crystallographic structures varied as a function of the alloy composition. Differences in the corrosion behaviour are due to the thickness, the microstructure and the porosity of the <b>scale.</b> The new <b>graphite</b> chromium iron alloy (Hi-Cr + C) have an oxidation-corrosion behaviour close to the indefinite chill double paired (ICDP) one and is therefore thought to be a good candidate to replace the ICPD alloy. In the case of the high speed steel (HSS) alloy, the oxidation-corrosion kinetics are too slow to prevent sticking problems. The Co addition decreases the corrosion-oxidation rates for the non-oxidised and oxidised samples but this effect is limited in time. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Expanded graphite (EG) has also attracted market attention, as it outperforms not expanded graphite and other conductive fillers in terms of thermal and electrical conductivity. New solutions based on the application of microwaves and radio frequencies were exploited in the projecting and building of specific laboratory plants, involving four different processes: chemical vapour infiltration (CVI), Liquid Silicon Infiltration (LSI), graphite expansion (GE) and polymer impregnation and pyrolysis (PIP). Microwave (MW) radiation {{has been used as}} an alternative to conventional radiant heating techniques in CVI processes to produce SiCf/SiC components [1 - 2], showing that fabrication times can be dramatically reduced. LSI could benefit from MW processing because of the higher heating rates resulting in reduced cycle times, limiting energy consumption and costs, and in thermally induced cracks in the material. MW heating has already been proven to be effective at lab <b>scale</b> in expanding <b>graphite,</b> resulting in an expanded material whose properties are at least as good as those of the standard thermally expanded product [3].

40|$|A {{scanning}} tunneling microscope with a {{focus on}} digital instrumentation has been built. The aim of this project was to allow a digital signal processor full control over all essential microscope variables, especially simultaneous control of the vertical and horizontal tip position. Due to the fact that its operation is controlled by software, this system offers convenient operation and considerable flexibility, allowing different modes of operation, such as topographical and spectroscopic scans. Presently this microscope is the only one in New Zealand that allows the operator full software control over the tip position and bias voltage, thereby allowing it to become a powerful research tool. Atomic <b>scale</b> images on <b>graphite</b> were successfully recorded. The spatial resolution of the microscope was estimated to be 5 pm vertically and 40 pm horizontally. Two different imaging methods were demonstrated on a gold sputtered TEM grating with a scan area that was larger than 4 μm x 4 μm. One method has variable horizontal scan speed, while the other method can possibly be used for nanolithography. Both show the flexibility of this system. Although digital electronics is often perceived as being slower and noisier than analog electronics, in this instrument it did not decrease the data acquisition speed nor did it reduce the signal-to-noise ratio. The bandwidth of the closed-loop controlled microscope is currently about 1 kHz, limited by the bandwidth of the current-to-voltage converter, an analog component. The resolution is limited by the large gain of the high-voltage amplifiers used to drive the actuators. With a faster current-to-voltage converter and a reduced high-voltage amplifier gain, a bandwidth of 8 kHz should be possible with a vertical resolution of less than 2 pm and a horizontal resolution of 10 pm...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) {{procedure}} for atomistic modeling of the microstructure of activated carbons whereby the guessed configuration for the HRMC construction simulation is generated using the characterization results (pore size and pore wall thickness distributions) {{obtained by the}} interpretation of argon adsorption at 87 K using our improved version of the slit-pore model, termed the finite wall thickness (FWT) model (Nguyen, T. X.; Bhatia, S. K. Langmuir 2004, 20, 3532). This procedure overcomes limitations arising {{from the use of}} shortrange potentials in the conventional HRMC method, which make the latter unsuitable for carbons such as activated carbon fibers that are anisotropic with medium-range ordering induced by their complex pore structure. The newly proposed approach is applied specifically for the atomistic construction of an activated carbon fiber ACF 15, provided by Kynol Corporation (Nguyen, T. X.; Bhatia, S. K. Carbon 2005, 43, 775). It is found that the PSD of the ACF 15 ’s constructed microstructure is in good agreement with that determined using argon adsorption at 87 K.

This finding is in agreement with the enhancement of the LJ carbon-fluid well depth due to the curvature of the carbon surface, found by the use of ab initio calculations (Klauda, J.

40|$|Synthetisch hergestelltes Siliziumdioxid (SiO 2) im Submikro- und Nanopartikelmaßstab findet bereits in Farben und Lacken, sowie in Kunst- und Klebstoffen Einsatz, um deren Brillanz, Kratz- und Kohäsionsfestigkeit zu verbessern. Die gute Verfügbarkeit und der geringe Preis des SiO 2 machen es für viele Anwendungen zu einem interessanten Füllstoff. Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, durch werkstoffwissenschaftliche, grundlagenorientierte Betrachtungen ein tieferes Verständnis für die Funktionsmechanismen von modifizierten SiO 2 -Partikeln in einer EP-Matrix zu erlangen und eine Verbesserung der tribologischen Eigenschaften (Reibungskoeffizient und Verschleißrate) der Komposite zu erreichen. Der erste Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit der Herstellung und Charakterisierung von modifizierten Siliziumdioxid-Partikeln mittels eines modifizierten Stöberprozess. Es wurden die Katalysatoren Ammoniak, Tetramethylammoniumhydroxid (TMAH) und Tetramethylethylendiamin (TMED) getestet. Als Referenz wurden kommerziell erhältliche SiO 2 -Nanopartikel (Aerosil 200) sowie ein ebenfalls kommerziell erhältliches Partikelgemisch (NanoVit) als Füllstoffe getestet. Zur Ermittlung der tribologischen Eigenschaften wurde an den Kompositen eine Gleitverschleißuntersuchung (Stift-auf-Scheibe (PoD)) mit unterschiedlichen Parametervarianten (Geschwindigkeit-/Druckvariationen) durchgeführt. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die modifizierten SiO 2 -Partikel einen positiven Einfluss auf die tribologischen Eigenschaften der EP-Komposite haben. Weiter konnte bewiesen werden, dass durch die Zugabe der neu synthetisierten SiO 2 -Partikel auf eine Zugabe von Graphit als Schmiermittel verzichtet werden kann. Auch wurde festgestellt, dass durch das Eleminieren des Graphites sich ein sehr dünner Gleitfilm auf dem Gegenkörper ausbildete, der als ein Indiz für die Ursache der Verbesserung des Reibwertes gelten kann. Ein Prozess für dieses Kompositverhalten wurde in dieser Arbeit postuliert. resins (EP), are {{increasingly}} being used as templates {{for the development of}} anti-wear coatings and composites. An improvement in the tribological properties of EP composite materials is thus of great importance. As a basic functionalization for high performance EP composites micro scale short carbon fibers (SCFs) and micro <b>scale</b> <b>graphite</b> are being utilized. In the last years the use of nanomaterials as fillers in polymer matrices has started to increase. A common way to produce nanoreinforced polymer composites is to purchase microagglomerates with a primary particle size on the nanoscale directly from the market, to transfer those particles into the respective polymer matrix and to destroy those microagglomerates by the application of various “milling techniques”. In case of thermosets e. g. epoxy resins dissolver techniques like a torus mill are applied, in case of thermoplastics a twin screw extruder will be used. At the end of the “milling process” a broad distribution of nanoparticles as well as remaining microagglomerates are present in the respective polymer matrix. Therefore an exactly controlled synthesis of defined and homogenously controlled particle sizes is not given. In order to obtain such nano- or submicroparticles respectively the so called bottom-up method has to be applied. The basis of this method are molecules e. g. tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) which will be condensed in alkaline medium to aggregates with a defined particle size by using stabilizing agents and temperature control. Nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2), silicium dioxide (SiO 2), zinc oxide (ZnO) or molybdeniumdisulfide (MoS 2) are now an important part of industrial materials. Silicon dioxide (quartz) is caused by dehydration of silicic acid {{and is one of the}} hardest natural materials. To synthesize this material as nanoparticles, to use it as fillers in composites, offers a high potential for the creation of new nanomaterial composites. The good availability and low price of silica make it attractive for many applications. Synthetically produced SiO 2 in the sub-micron and nano-scale can already be found in paints and varnishes, plastics and adhesives to use boost their brilliance, as well as to improve scratch resistance and cohesive strength. Depending on the desired particle properties and production rates, a suitable production method must be selected from the large number of possible processes to generate the perfect nanoparticles. One challenge is the transfer of these manufacturing processes from the laboratory to an industrial scale. Here the sol-gel process takes an attractive position for synthesizing innovative nanoscale SiO 2 particles. The aim of this work is to stabilize the Stöber process for producing SiO 2 nanoparticles, so that it allows a scale-up in the industrial scale, without significant changes in the SiO 2 particles quality. The SiO 2 particles are controlled during the synthesis in terms of their shape and size. For this purpose, SiO 2 particles with two different stabilizers, Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMED) are manufactured. A SiO 2 particle growth law is defined by which carefully coordinated synthesis parameters (concentration, temperature and pH) homogeneous, monodispersed particles can be produced with a defined particle size between 50 nm and 700 nm (± 10 nm). These particles are characterized by analytical methods (IR spectroscopy, DLS analysis, SEM images, NMR spectroscopy and BET measurements). The SiO 2 particles, which have been produced with the aid of the stabilizer TMAH, show a higher concentration of silanol groups in their structure. After ensuring the controlled SiO 2 - manufacturing process, the particles thus produced are used as filling material for EP composites. With the modified Stöber SiO 2 particles in combination with SCF and graphite, the tribological properties (coefficient of friction and wear) of the EP- composites should be improved. After the production of the SiO 2 particles, these are introduced, differentiated by their different size in an EP- matrix. In addition to provide a reference the fillers SCF and graphite can be tested in an EP matrix as well. These composites are now being analyzed by the tribological pin-on-ring method in terms of wear values. In the next step EP composites are produced which include the best SiO 2 particle sizes from the previous chapter together with SCF and graphite as filler materials to create better tribological properties. After this they were characterized by the pin-on-disc method with respect to their wear rate and coefficient of friction. A commercially available SiO 2 nanoparticle (Aerosil 200) as filler is used in an EP composites in the next chapter as a reference. This composite is compared to two other composites containing the self-produced SiO 2 particles, wherein both types differ by the choice of the stabilizer used during the synthesis. In the last section of this work a composite in which a commercially available filler mix (NanoVit) is included were tested, compared with a composite with the best previously determined fillers. It is shown that the modified SiO 2 particles have a positive effect on the tribological characteristics of the EP-composites. They produce a lower coefficient of friction and improved wear performance. It is also proven that by adding the newly synthesized SiO 2 particles the addition of graphite as a lubricant is no longer relevant. Furthermore, it is proven that by eliminating the graphite a very thin film of lubricant on the counter body is formed which is an indication of the cause of improving the coefficient of friction. A process for this behavior is postulated. ...|$|R
40|$|Metal dusting {{is a type}} of high {{temperature}} corrosion in which Fe-, Ni- or Co-base alloys are disintegrated from bulk materials into metal or carbide particles in a coke deposit formed in strongly carburising gas atmospheres (carbon activity ac > 1) at elevated temperatures (400 - 800 °C). Mechanism study reveals that dusting occurs only when graphite grows into the metal or carbide interior, disrupting its structure and converting it to the dust. Therefore, prevention of dusting requires a surface barrier to carbon entry. The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of nano-crystalline structure on carburization and metal dusting of nickel-chromium alloys. Nano-crystalline Ni-Cr structure was prepared by either sputtering coating or electro-plating, which was then reacted in 47 %CO- 47 %H 2 - 6 %H 2 O gas for 50 h or pre-oxidised first in 47 %Ar- 47 %H 2 - 6 %H 2 O gas for 24 h and then in carburizing gas for 50 h at 650 °C. The coarse grained Ni-Cr alloys were also reacted in the same reaction conditions for the comparison. In general, increasing Cr content reduced weight gain kinetics. For sputtering coated Ni-Cr alloys, without pre-oxidation, Ni- 5 Cr experienced a significant metal dusting. Higher Cr content, Ni- 10 Cr and 20 Cr alloys, however, appeared little attack due to the formation of chromia scales on the surface and along the interfaces among the columns. Both alloys formed other reaction products inside of columnar coating <b>scales,</b> with fine <b>graphite</b> deposits for Ni- 10 Cr and relatively large Cr 7 C 3 precipitates for Ni- 20 Cr. For electroplated samples, the rates of weight gain performed a slow increase first, followed by an accelerated increase. Pre-oxidation before dusting significantly improved the resistance of alloy against carburization and metal dusting for all cases. This effect is especially significant for low Cr content Ni- 5 Cr and for nano-coated alloys as fine grain size accelerates chromium diffusion and therefore the protective oxide scale formation. The effect of chromium content on protective chromia scale formation and chromium carbide formation is analysed using Wagner’s analysis and product solubility calculation. The prediction is basically in agreement with the experimental observation...|$|R

In order to investigate the influence of aqueous phase radiolysis, further experiments were performed in the presence of g-irradiation sources under argon atmosphere. It was established that the slow corrosion of carbonaceous materials in different aquatic phases in the absence of irradiation was caused by interaction with dissolved oxygen. Corrosion rates in aqueous solutions under pure oxygen and air atmosphere decrease in the order water > brine? 3 > brine- 2. Acceleration of graphite and pyrocarbon corrosion was observed in the presence of g-irradiation in brines while the opposite influence of the aqueous phases on the corrosion rates was additionally observed. The corrosion rates of graphite and pyrocarbon in irradiated brine- 2 and brine- 3 in argon atmosphere were two orders of magnitude higher than in pure oxygen atmosphere without irradiation. This {{may be related to the}} formation of highly oxidising chlorine species in brines, which react with carbon materials. In pure water, radiolysis did not influence the oxidation process significantly. However, calculating the expected lifetime of the graphite matrix in the repository on the basis of the corrosion rates determined is an extremely conservative consideration since the radiation dose rates used are significantly higher than could ever occur during final disposal of high-temperature reactor fuel elements. In the second part of the present work, thermal treatment of contaminated structural graphite from the high-temperature reactor core and thermal columns of the research reactors was investigated as a possible decontamination process. The main problem associated with direct disposal of contaminated graphite is its large volume. Reprocessing of the graphite based on graphite gasification offers the opportunity to separate the radionuclides from the main graphite mass, which could then be reused or disposed conventionally. The experiments were performed in an argon flow and steam in the temperature range of 870 – 1060 °C. Comparison of the release rate ratios of the volatilised radionuclides 14 C and 3 H with the release of 12 C showed that under all experimental conditions tritium and 14 C were released faster than the graphite sample was oxidised. The maximum value of the release rate ratio was obtained for tritium in experiments with argon atmosphere at 1060 °C. It was shown that 14 C could be separated from the main graphite mass with a 14 C/ 12 C enrichment factor of about 20. However, the total fractional release was not sufficient for a pilot scale process under these conditions. The fractional release of 14 C can be increased by addition of water steam, but in this case the enrichment factor drops below 5. In general, this separation of carbon isotopes is only possible because 14 C is mainly located near the grain boundary surfaces and its concentration profile decreases with depth inside the graphite grains.

40|$|This Thesis {{presents}} {{studies of}} modern aspects of nanotechnology where {{the size and}} density of nanostructures play a huge role for further technological advances of our life. As {{an example of this}} is heterogeneous catalysis in which studies of catalytic properties of metallic nanostructures are of major interest. As a result the primary motivations of the work were to find methods for controlling size and density of nanostructures, and to investigate how these influence catalytic properties. The control over the catalytic properties of such structures allows for greater reaction selectivity and smaller amounts of waste byproducts in chemical processes. In order to improve the miniaturization effect one would require breaking and extending some well-known limitations that are related to nanofabrication. In fact, just such a possibility was found in the present work. In this Thesis, results are obtained from experimental, theoretical, and to some extent computational evidences. Correlation between experimental and theoretical analysis is presented. The systems studied include transition metals such as Pt and Au, while polycrystalline graphite and highly oriented pyrolytic polycrystalline graphite (HOPG) have been served as substrates. It is well-known that catalytic properties of Pt and Au dramatically change at the nanometer <b>scale,</b> while polycrystalline <b>graphite</b> and HOPG are known to prohibit a high degree of order. Hence, investigation of these systems is important for industry applications. Self-assembled Pt and Au nanostructures have been initially formed by physical vapour deposition on graphite, while off-normal Ion Beam Sputtering (IBS) was used for post fabrication of these. The Pt and Au nanostructures were exposed to low energetic 500 eV Ar+ ion beam bombardment for various time periods. Additionally, many complementary techniques were used in the experimental work; X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The surface analysis was made by XPS for estimating the amount of studied materials as well as chemical states of those. TPD was used to study catalytic properties of studied materials for investigation of the behaviour of the nanoparticles towards gases (in our case CO) as a function of temperature. SEM, STEM and AFM were applied for surface features imaging. Depending on the task correlation between these tools has been made. The evidence gained points out that depending on the time-regime and geometry of eroded materials IBS can be used as an innovative technique. It can reduce dimensions down to 2 nm in width and distribute nanostructures. It also can make quantum nanodots with size of about 1 nm out of self-assembled nanostructures proving to be a tool for application and enhancement of the levels of integration of nanocomponents. Theoretical analysis that is correlated to this experimental evidence was developed as well. It is based on controlling the effect of smoothing over roughening and describes a new model with correlations from previous studies. New terminology such as nanotransient kinetics has been introduced to describe the IBS process. From theoretical and experimental analysis follow that the main smoothing mechanism during IBS at normal temperatures is the ion-induced viscous laminar flow in the surface layer rather than the surface diffusion although this is also enhanced in the process. It was verified that a time associated with these mechanisms is important for the smoothing effect during IBS and it was recognized that low energy is not the only reason for smoothing domination over roughening. New terminology such as laminar, turbulent flow and associated momentum and concentration boundary layers were introduced, and applied to the nanoscale dimension. The option of controlling of smoothing over roughening was discussed and correlated to the experimental data determining the effects during IBS. In addition, to explain the distribution of nanostructures under IBS a new concept such as ioninduced island diffusion has been introduced. After applying IBS towards self-assembled Pt nanostructures it was found that ion-induced smaller Pt nanostructures result in lower desorption temperatures of carbon monoxide CO. This is valuable information for catalytic properties of Pt nanostructures. The evolution of self-assembled Pt nanostructures that are formed by evaporation on polycrystalline graphite was studied as well. A new concept such as “arm diffusion” was introduced to explain the growth characteristics of the nanostructures. A new model that is based on nanotransient kinetics and describes self-assembly and post-growth relaxation of deposited materials was also introduced. According to the model, a convective mass transport is the main mechanism for an initial instability of the growth process that will eventually lead to complex pattern shapes. Another finding of the Thesis is a new model that reconstructs colourful 3 D surfaces of the nanostructures from corresponding SEM images by using MATLAB software for better understanding of material and surface interactions. I believe that the result of this PhD study has impact on further technological advances. PhD i fysikkPhD in Physic...|$|R
30|$|Graphene oxide (GO) can be {{prepared}} in large <b>scales</b> from natural <b>graphite.</b> It was synthesized by a modified Hummers method {{as described in the}} previous studies [79]. It is a single sheet of graphite oxide-bearing oxygen functional groups on their basal planes. In recent years, GO has attracted great interest because of its superior mechanical, structural, and thermal properties and also its low cost compared to other conventional carbon nanomaterials like CNT. GO can be easily dispersed in aqueous solution and act as an excellent dopant for the chemical and electrochemical polymerization of conducting polymers due to the abundance of carboxyl groups that are negatively charged in aqueous solution. Kim et al. demonstrated that GO can play a role as a chemical oxidant for various CPs (polythiophene, polyaniline, and polypyrrole). In addition, diverse graphene/CP composites (graphene/polythiophene, graphene/polyaniline, and graphene/polypyrrole) can simply and rapidly be synthesized using the GO as both graphene precursor and chemical oxidant [80]. Poly[3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene] was largely studied to synthesize (GO/PEDOT) nanocomposites. Luo et al. have successfully synthesized GO/PEDOT nanocomposites by cyclic voltammetry using graphene oxide as dopant. The resulting nanocomposite is highly biocompatible with neuronal cells [68]. Due to their many negatively charged carboxyl groups, GO is an excellent dopant for the electropolymerization of conducting polymers. The formed film contains functional groups promoting any modification of the surface of the nanocomposite film. These groups reach carboxyl groups of GO partially exposed {{to the surface of the}} film PEDOT/GO. Normally, GO is an electrically insulating material, but its conductivity is recovered by restoring its network through its reduction to form what is called graphene or reduced graphene oxide. This reduction can be done thermally, electrochemically, or chemically using strong reducing agents such as hydrazine or sodium borohydride. GO is also an attractive platform for the production of functionalized graphene platelets with improved mechanical, thermal, and/or electronic properties [81, 82, 83, 84]. Ambrosi and Pumera confirmed later that the electrochemical reduction is more interesting, because this process allows to control accurately the obtained chemical structures of graphene with reproducible density of the oxygen functionalities PEDOT/GO nanocomposite of reduced GO-doped conducting polymer PEDOT was prepared to improve electrochemical catalytic property of the resulting nanocomposite [85]. The same nanocomposite was electrodeposited on GCE and followed by electrochemical reduction. The obtained modified electrode was used as a sensitive sensor for DA detection without ascorbic and uric acids interference [86]. Seekaew et al. performed a gas sensor based on graphene–PEDOT:PSS composite film. Incorporating graphene in the polymer increased the specific adsorption surface area which has improved the NH 3 response [87]. The preparation and the thermoelectric proprieties of PEDOT composites containing PEDOT, reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and single-walled CNT (SWCNT) were also reported by Li et al. [88]. Nanocomposites based on PPy and GO exhibited enhancement in electrical conductivity. Bora et al. synthesized polypyrrole (PPy)/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites via liquid/liquid interfacial polymerization. The developed PPy/GO nanocomposite, comparing to pure polypyrrole, has shown improvement in electrical conductivity [89]. In another work, GO/PPy nanocomposites were performed by a one-step co-electrodeposition method. During the pyrrole electropolymerization, a negative charge of GO was incorporated into the polymer to balance the positive charge on the polymer. Moreover, the π–π interactions between GO and PPy play a considerably role in the formation of GO/PPy nanocomposites [67]. Overoxidized polypyrrole (PPyox) was used to synthesize PPyox/graphene nanocomposite due to their cation exchange and molecular sieve properties. The nanocomposite-modified GCE has been prepared and applied as dopamine sensors without the interference of ascorbic acid [64]. GO/PPy was also used to prepare molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for quercetin detection [63]. In the same way, the reduced form of graphene was combined with PPy for application as supercapacitors or sensors [90]. As example of sensor, Rong et al. have prepared GO/PPy by reducing GO to RGO and polymerization of PPy using potentiostatic mode. The resulted nanocomposites were applied for ammonia and Pb 2 + detection [91]. In a comparative study, properties of PANI/G and PANI/MCWNT nanocomposites were investigated. It was proved that the charge transfer between the PANI and carbon materials (MWCNTs and G) improved the electrical conductivity of PANI. The obtained composites have different morphologies and conductivities. It was elucidated that PANI/G composite has a plate form, while PANI/MCWNT composite is tubular [92]. An electrochemical biosensor based on PANI/RGO nanocomposite has been reported. The nanocomposite was synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization method and was then used as the sensitive layer of a DNA adsorbent for detecting Hg 2 +. The detection limit was 0.035  nM [93]. Nguyen et al. synthesized PANI grafted RGO composites via a two-step method. First, RGO was modified with 1, 3 -diaminopropane providing reactive NH 2 groups on surface witch can polymerize with aniline. The formed GO–NH 2 was then grafted with polymer chains by in situ chemical polymerisation. The RGO-g-PANI composites were used for the chemical detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solutions [94]. The G/PANI-modified electrode allowed selective determination of the target metals in the presence of bismuth Bi(III). Graphene–polyaniline (G/PANI) nanocomposite was used to develop an electrochemical sensor for simultaneous detection of Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). To prevent nanoparticle aggregation during nanocomposites synthesis, they added polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) by a method called reverse dropping which creates a solution of well-dispersed particles [95]. Under optimal conditions, the detection limits were 1.0  µg L− 1 for Zn(II) and 0.1  µg L− 1 for both Cd(II) and Pb(II). Recently, electrospun graphene/polyaniline/polystyrene (G/PANI/PS) nanoporous fiber-modified screen-printed carbon electrode was investigated and optimized also to simultaneous determination of Pb 2 + and Cd 2 + in the presence of bismuth. The limits of detection were found to be 3.30  µg L− 1 for Pb 2 + and 4.43  µg L− 1 for Cd 2 + [96]. Poly(diaminonaphthalene) combined with RGO was synthesized in one step using cyclic voltammetry. The chelating capacity of poly(1, 5 diaminonaphthalene) and the properties of RGO were used to elaborate a lead sensor [97].|$|R
