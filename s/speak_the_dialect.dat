Other non-native speakers of the dialect include those persons that regularly do business with native speakers.|$|E
25|$|Among them, the Old Order Amish {{population}} was probably around 227,000 in 2008. Additionally, the Old Order Mennonite population, a sizable percentage {{of which is}} Pennsylvania German-speaking, numbers several tens of thousands. There are also thousands of other Mennonites who <b>speak</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialect,</b> as well as thousands more older Pennsylvania German speakers of non-Amish and non-Mennonite background. The Grundsau Lodge, which is an organization in southeastern Pennsylvania of Pennsylvania German speakers, {{is said to have}} 6,000 members. Therefore, a fair estimate of the speaker population today might be approaching 300,000, although many, including some academic publications, may report much lower numbers, uninformed of those diverse speaker groups.|$|E

2500|$|The Pittsburgh English dialect, {{commonly}} called Pittsburghese, {{was influenced by}} Scots-Irish, Welsh, German, Central European, and Eastern European immigrants. Locals who <b>speak</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialect</b> are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Yinzers" [...] (from the local word [...] "yinz" [...] , a blended form of [...] "you ones," [...] similar to [...] "y'all" [...] and [...] "you all" [...] in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: slippy (slippery), redd up (clean up), jagger bush (thorn bush), and gum bands (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb [...] "to be." [...] In Pittsburghese one would say [...] "the car needs washed" [...] instead of [...] "needs to be washed," [...] "needs washing," [...] or [...] "needs a wash." [...] The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as, [...] "the Galapagos Islands of American dialect." [...] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.|$|E

6000|$|If, {{after half}} a century, fiction still mainly works for [...] "children, minors, and semi-fatuous persons of both sexes," [...] it is {{nevertheless}} {{one of the}} hopefulest signs of the world's progress that it has begun to work for [...] "grown persons," [...] and if not exactly {{in the way that}} Carlyle might have solely intended in urging its writers to compile memoirs instead of building the [...] "novel-fabric," [...] still it has, in the highest and widest sense, already made Reality its Romance.

But let fiction cease to lie about life; let it portray men and women as they are, actuated by the motives and the passions in the measure we all know; let it leave off painting dolls and working them by springs and wires; let it show the different interests in their true proportions; let it forbear to preach pride and revenge, folly and insanity, egotism and prejudice, but frankly own these for what they are, in whatever figures and occasions they appear; let it not put on fine literary airs; let it <b>speak</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialect,</b> the language, that most Americans know--the language of unaffected people everywhere--and {{there can be no doubt}} of an unlimited future, not only of delightfulness but of usefulness, for it.|$|E
