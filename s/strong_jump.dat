50|$|Pole-sitter Scott Riggs {{lost the}} lead on the first lap after getting loose in turn 4, sliding up and colliding with Ryan Newman, {{allowing}} Jeremy Mayfield to take the lead. A tire on Newman's car popped, which brought out the first caution. Much of the early portion of the race was dominated by Mayfield, Tony Stewart, Bobby Labonte and defending race winner Rusty Wallace. Meanwhile, Jeff Gordon fell behind three laps by lap 70 due to a loose wheel, but regained two laps, and via the beneficiary rule, got back on the lead lap after a caution on lap 276, while gaining the lead with 35 laps left. Sometime during the race, Gordon and Kurt Busch made contact, sending Busch into the wall. With three laps left, Travis Kvapil's car spilled oil on the track, bringing out the final caution. Gordon had a <b>strong</b> <b>jump</b> on the restart, and held off Kasey Kahne, Mark Martin and Newman to claim his 71st career win, his seventh at Martinsville, and his second of the season.

50|$|The Ibizan Hound {{authority}} Miquel Rosselló {{has provided}} {{a detailed description of}} a working trial which characterises their typical hunting technique and action, strikingly illustrated with action photos by Charles Camberoque which demonstrate hunt behaviour and typical hunt terrain. While local hunters will at times use one dog or a brace, and frequently packs of six to eight or as many as fifteen, the working trial requires an evaluation of one or two braces. A brace is called a colla. The couples should be tested on at least two to five rabbits (not hares), without the use of any other hunting aid. An inspection and evaluation of the exterior, fitness, character and obedience of the dogs is recommended prior to the hunt. The trial is qualified as having 5 parts. The dogs should show: (1) careful tracking and scenting of the rabbit, without being distracted in the least, 0-30 points; (2) correct signalling of the game, patient stand, <b>strong</b> <b>jump</b> into the air, obedience 0-10 points; (3) chase, giving tongue, speed, sureness, anticipation 0-30 points; (4) putting the game to cover at close quarters, listening, waiting, obedience, correct attack 0-10 point; and (5) good catch, or correct indication of the game’s location, retrieval, obedience 0-20 points.|$|E

In the 1 D case, the spectral radius of the iteration matrix tends to the ratio of heat conductivities in the semidiscrete spatial limit, but to {{the ratio of the}} products of density and specific heat capacity in the semidiscrete temporal one.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the interaction between computability and randomness. In the first part, we study the notion of traceability. This combinatorial notion has an increasing influence in the study of algorithmic randomness. We prove a separation result about the bounds on jump traceability, and show that the index set of the strongly jump traceable computably enumerable (c. e.) sets is Π 0 4 -complete. This shows that the problem of deciding if a c. e. set is strongly jump traceable, is as hard as it can be. We define a strengthening of <b>strong</b> <b>jump</b> traceability, called hyper jump traceability, and prove some interesting results about this new class. Despite the fact that the hyper jump traceable sets have their origins in algorithmic randomness, we are able to show that they are natural examples of several Turing degree theoretic properties. For instance, we show that the hyper jump traceable sets are the first example of a lowness class with no promptly simple members. We also study the dual highness notions obtained from <b>strong</b> <b>jump</b> traceability, and explore their degree theoretic properties. In the second part we investigate the degree theoretic aspects of different classes arisin...|$|E
40|$|The thin {{interface}} {{separating the}} inner turbulent region {{from the outer}} irrotational fluid is analysed in a direct numerical simulation of a spatially developing turbulent mixing layer. A vorticity threshold is defined to detect the interface separating the turbulent from the non-turbulent regions of the flow, and to calculate statistics conditioned on the distance from this interface. The conditional statistics for velocity are in remarkable agreement with the results for other free shear flows available in the literature, such as turbulent jets and wakes. In addition, {{an analysis of the}} passive scalar field {{in the vicinity of the}} interface is presented. It is shown that the scalar has a jump at the interface, even stronger than that observed for velocity. The <b>strong</b> <b>jump</b> for the scalar has been observed before in the case of high Schmidt number (Sc). In the present study, such a <b>strong</b> <b>jump</b> is observed for a scalar with Sc ≈ 1. Conditional statistics of kinetic energy and scalar dissipation are presented. While the kinetic energy dissipation has its maximum far from the interface, the scalar dissipation is characterised by a strong peak very close to the interface. Finally, it is shown that the geometric features of the interfaces correlate with relatively large scale structures as visualised by low-pressure isosurfaces. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

40|$|We {{systematically}} analyse all {{publicly available}} XMM-Newton spectra of radio-quiet PG quasars. The soft X-ray excess in these objects is well modelled by an additional, cool, Compton scattering region. However, the remarkably constant temperature derived for this component {{over the whole}} sample requires a puzzling fine tuning of the parameters. Instead, we propose that the soft excess is an artifact of strong, relativistically smeared, partially ionized absorption. The <b>strong</b> <b>jump</b> in opacity at ~ 0. 7 keV from OVII, OVIII and iron can lead to an apparent soft excess below this energy, which is trivially constant since it depends on atomic processes. This can have a dramatic effect on the derived spectrum, which has implications for fitting the relativistic smearing of the reflected iron line emission from the disc.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the edge}} vector finite element {{solution}} of the frequency domain Maxwell equations, {{the presence of a}} large kernel of the discrete rotor operator is known to ruin convergence of standard iterative solvers.

40|$|It {{is a great}} {{challenge}} to discover <b>strong</b> <b>jumping</b> emerging patterns (SJEPs) from a high-dimensional dataset because of the huge pattern space. In this article, we propose a dynamically growing contrast pattern tree (DGCP-tree) structure to store grown patterns and their path codes arrays with 1 -bit counts, which are from the constructed bit string compression tree. A method of mining SJEPs based on DGCP-tree is developed.

General analytical spectral bounds obtained previously are applied, which displays {{the conditions under which}} good performances could be expected. The arguments also reveal that, if the total number of unknowns is very large or the number of unknowns in one direction is much larger than in both other ones, or if there are <b>strong</b> <b>jumps</b> in the variation of the PDE coefficients or fewer Dirichlet boundary conditions, then linewise preconditionings could be significantly more efficient than the corresponding pointwise ones. We also discuss reasons to explain why in the case of constant PDE coefficients, the advantage of preferring linewise methods to pointwise ones is not as pronounced as in 2 D problems. Results of numerical experiments are reported. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} there is no minimal bound for jump traceability.

The uniformity of the proof method allows us to adapt the technique to showing that the index set of the c. e. strongly jump traceables is Π 0 4 -complete. § 1. Introduction. One of the fundamental concerns of computability theory is in understanding the relative difficulty of computational problems as measured by Turing reducubility (≤T). The equivalence classes of the preordering ≤T are called Turing degrees, and it is long recognized that the fundamental operator on the structure of the Turing degrees is the jump operator.

In {{contrast}} to the sharp transitions in ASC, the smearing out due to the measurement concept is particularly clear. In this case, even reducing the rate does not help very much. The DSC data for the cooling runs show supercooling for both transitions and the strong end-of-supercooling jump that was already seen in the ASC data for the Cry_II–R_V transition. Even in the DSC, where the thermal contact between sample and environment {{is supposed to be}} very efficient, so much heat is released that the temperature of the sample rises substantially. The R_II–Liq transition does not display a <b>strong</b> <b>jump</b> at the end of supercooling, although all the runs do show the spike at the high-temperature side of the transition that we saw earlier in RT 42 and found to be indicative of a small supercooling effect.|$|E

Previous analyses have assumed a uniformly bright stellar surface and concluded that wind mass flux and density should increase with the increased centrifugal force toward the wind equator. In contrast, we show here that a gravity darkening in which the surface flux scales with the effective (centrifugally reduced) gravity leads to dramatically different wind morphology, with the strongest mass loss now occurring toward the relatively bright poles. We also review recent work that indicates nonradial (poleward) components of the line-driving force in such rotating winds can effectively inhibit the equatorward wind deflection needed to form an equatorial wind-compressed disk.

40|$|Abstract. A {{survivor}} swap (SS) is {{an agreement}} to exchange cash flows in the future based on a mortality-dependent index. Pricing survivor swaps means to determine the fixed proportional premium pi which makes the initial value of the swaps is zero to each party. In order to price the mortality derivatives, such as SS precisely, an appropriate model to fore-cast mortality rate is necessary. The proposed model extends the Cox, Lin and Wang’s (2006) model by considering mortality jumps and de-fault risk simultaneously. Based on the collected data, we use the pro-posed model to price SSs, and in our simulated results, {{we find that the}} premium of SS is negatively correlated with the market price of risk and the jump frequency. Moreover, a <b>stronger</b> <b>jump</b> frequency will enhance the effect of market price of risk on the premium. On the other hand, the premium of SS is also found to be negative correlated with the mar-ket price of risk and the jump frequency at any level of default risks, but fixed the levels of market price of risk and jump frequency, a higher (lower) default risk will imply a lower (higher) premium...|$|R
