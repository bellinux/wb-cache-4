5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to {{a wider range of}} foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings can serve as a good balance to foods that have a high <b>salt</b> <b>content.</b> In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E
5|$|The crystalline-solid {{structure}} of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor. However, once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and electrically conductive. A recent study {{has shown that the}} electrical conductivity of volcanic ash increases with (1) increasing moisture content, (2) increasing soluble <b>salt</b> <b>content,</b> and (3) increasing compaction (bulk density). The ability of volcanic ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems.|$|E
5|$|When sieved {{from the}} water, food is {{swallowed}} and travels through the esophagus where it enters a three-chambered-stomach. The first compartment {{is known as}} the fore-stomach; this is where food gets ground up into an acidic liquid, which is then squirted into the main stomach. Like in humans, the food is mixed with hydrochloric acid and protein-digesting enzymes. Then, the partly digested food is moved into the third stomach, where it meets fat-digesting enzymes, and is then mixed with an alkaline liquid to neutralize the acid from the fore-stomach to prevent damage to the intestinal tract. Their intestinal tract is highly adapted to absorb the most nutrients from food; the walls are folded and contain copious blood vessels, allowing for a greater surface area over which digested food and water can be absorbed. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food; however, the <b>salt</b> <b>content</b> of most of their prey (invertebrates) are similar to that of seawater, whereas the <b>salt</b> <b>content</b> of a whale's blood is considerably lower (three times lower) than that of seawater. The whale kidney is adapted to excreting excess salt; however, while producing urine more concentrated than seawater, it wastes a lot of water which must be replaced.|$|E
30|$|The <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> of the {{groundwater}} were also slightly greater under the forest plots (groundwater conductivities: oak- 1023  μS/cm, poplar- 1167  μS/cm and pasture- 960  μS/cm). The present values of <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> do not cause any problem for forest vegetation, but salt accumulation induced by future climate change {{may have more}} severe long-term effects for afforestation may. Nosetto et al. (2007) also detected a higher conductivity of groundwater under an oak forest than under grassland in Hortobágy, but the <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> were notably higher–– 4900  μS/cm and 2000  μS/cm for oak and for grassland sites, respectively. The cause of this notable difference is that soils on the study area of Hortobágy have finer texture (clayey soils); therefore, salinization effect is much stronger there than on our study sites with sandy soils.|$|R
40|$|Weathering steel has an {{anticorrosive}} function {{by creating}} protective rust {{on the surface}} of steel. This function would be able to provide the possibility reducing life time cost of a steel bridge. However, anticorrosive function is strongly affected by corrosion environment, which is amount of salts, temperature, humidity and wind condition surrounding the bridge. This paper reports the results of observation of corrosion environment on multi-girder multi-span weathering steel bridge. From the observation, a relationship between airborne <b>salts</b> <b>contents</b> and <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> which is attached to the surface of girders was become clear...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{variability}} of hydrographic preconditioning defined as the heat and <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> in the Ligurian Sea before convection. The stratification is found to reach a maximum in the intermediate layer in December, whose causes and consequences for the interannual variability of convection are investigated. Further study of the interannual variability and correlation tests between {{the properties of the}} deep water formed and the winter surface fluxes support the description of convection as a process that transfers the heat and <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> from the top and intermediate layers to the deep layer. A proxy for the rate of transfer is given by the final convective mixed layer depth, that is shown to depend equally on the surface fluxes and on the preconditioning. In particular, it is found that deep convection in winter 2004 – 2005 would have happened even with normal winter conditions, due to low pre-winter stratification...|$|R
25|$|A {{characteristic}} of traditional Japanese food is the sparing use of red meat, oils and fats, and dairy products.

25|$|Mannitol salt agar {{is also a}} {{selective}} and differential medium. The mannitol indicates organisms that ferment mannitol: mannitol fermentation produces lactic acid, lowering the pH and turning the plate yellow.

25|$|Respirable {{suspended}} particulate matter, {{of less than}} 10 micrometers (µm) in size, can {{be present in the}} drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10µm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5µm, (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM10 and PM2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser <b>salt</b> <b>content</b> in fresh water drift (below 2,000ppm) compared to the <b>salt</b> <b>content</b> of sea water drift (60,000ppm).|$|E

40|$|Drying and {{fermentation}} are oldest methods allowing meat preservation. Dry-fermented sausage (DFS) manufacture {{consists in}} decreasing water activity ‘aw’ by adding high quantity of sodium chloride and proceeding to drying. Reducing <b>salt</b> and fat <b>contents</b> {{in these kinds}} of products could be interesting from a human health point of view but it could affect water transfer phenomena. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of modifying <b>salt</b> and fat <b>contents</b> on DFS weight loss and water activity and to build a sorption isotherm model that relates DFS water activity to water, <b>salt</b> and fat <b>contents.</b> Results showed that water transfer phenomena (weight losses and aw) depended strongly on fat and <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> and that combined salt and fat reductions led to faster weight losses but to higher aw values. On the other hand, we highlighted that DFS aw could be evaluated from a Ross model corresponding to a salted and fatty gelatin gel, however with a new γ coefficient...|$|R

25|$|In {{times of}} flood, the <b>salt</b> <b>content</b> of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. The Dead Sea {{temporarily}} {{comes to life}} in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from Hebrew University of Jerusalem found the Dead Sea to be teeming with a type of alga called Dunaliella. Dunaliella in turn nourished carotenoid-containing (red-pigmented) halobacteria, whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the Dead Sea basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.|$|E
25|$|A zone {{of rapid}} {{salinity}} increase with depth {{is called a}} halocline. The temperature of maximum density of seawater decreases as its <b>salt</b> <b>content</b> increases. Freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity, and boiling temperature of water increases with salinity. Typical seawater freezes at around −1.9nbsp&°C at atmospheric pressure. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, {{as is the case}} in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, {{as is the case in}} tropical regions, salinity will be higher. Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.|$|E
25|$|The solute {{content of}} water {{is perhaps the most}} {{important}} aspect of water conditions, as total dissolved solids and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment. <b>Salt</b> <b>content,</b> or salinity, is the most basic measure of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000PPM), simulating an ocean environment. Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Layer-by-layer (LbL) {{assembly}} of polymer electrolyte multilayers {{is now a}} well-established method for the fabrication of thin films by sequential adsorption of alter-nating layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Most commonly, such adsorptions have been from quiescent solutions of varying ionic strength and pH. Here, we report results on an alternative processing route for the achievement of polymeric multilayer assemblies of poly(sodium- 4 -styrene sulfonate) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) that utilizes conven-tional spin coating. We investigated and describe herein the dependence of multilayer film buildup on solution ionic strength for comparison with similar dependence in quiescent adsorption. Using UV-Vis spectroscopy we monitored {{the growth of the}} multilayered films, while with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) we examined the surface features and mea-sured coating thicknesses at different salt concentrations. AFM and UV-Vis data reveal two regimes of behavior with increasing salt: strong salt-dependence at low <b>salt</b> <b>contents,</b> and weak salt-dependence for high <b>salt</b> <b>contents.</b> To explain this observation, we introduce the relevance of the dimensionless group De ̇, the local Deborah Number, to the problem.

40|$|Impedance {{spectroscopy}} (IS), low-field proton nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (LF 1 H NMR), chloride titration, ion chromatography, and an ion selective electrode were used to investigate the physicochemical parameters and measure sodium and potassium contents in low-salt brines and fish. Salt solutions (0 – 3 w/w, %) and model products of minced hake with added NaCl (0. 5 – 3. 0 w/w, %), or a mixture of NaCl and KCl (50 / 50 w/w, %), were analyzed. Good correlation was observed between the sodium content determined by using the ion selective electrode method and ion chromatography (R 2 = 0. 97). In both salt solutions and fish minces, the impedance spectroscopy measurements could detect the difference in <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> in mince with <b>salt</b> <b>contents</b> down to 0. 5 %.

A new desalination plant to be built near the Jordanian tourist resort of Aqaba would convert salt water from the Red Sea into fresh water for use in southern Israel and southern Jordan; each region would get eight billion to 13 billion gallons a year. This process would produces about as much brine as a waste product; the brine would be piped more than 100 miles to help replenish the Dead Sea, already known for its high <b>salt</b> <b>content.</b> This would reinforce {{the status of the}} Dead Sea as an important economic resource to both nations, in multiple areas including tourism, industry and business.|$|E
25|$|Overuse {{and poor}} {{irrigation}} practices {{have led to}} increased <b>salt</b> <b>content</b> in the soil, reducing the productivity of the land. Irrigation salinity is caused by water soaking through the soil level adding to the ground water below. This causes the water table to rise, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. As the irrigated area dries, the salt remains. At Wakool in the Riverina region of New South Wales, irrigation salinity is mitigated through a salt interception scheme that pumps saline ground water into evaporation basins, protecting approximately 50,000 hectares of farmland in the area from high water tables and salinity. The subsequent salt has various uses including as an animal feed supplement. The program has returned to production over 2,000 hectares of previously barren farmland and encouraged the regeneration of native eucalypts.|$|E
