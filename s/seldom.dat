5|$|A {{year before}} their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Evolution which suggested that gradual evolution was <b>seldom</b> seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of allopatric speciation might suggest a possible resolution.|$|E
5|$|Channels such as Game Theory do {{occasionally}} feature Five Nights at Freddy's related videos, {{although they}} <b>seldom</b> provide gameplay footage, giving {{more attention to}} discussion of the game.|$|E
5|$|El Greco painted {{many of his}} {{paintings}} on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium. He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, madder lake, ochres and red lead, but he <b>seldom</b> used the expensive natural ultramarine.|$|E
5|$|It {{is to the}} ignominy of the Socialist Party and the Socialist Labor Party {{that they}} have so <b>seldom</b> joined forces with the I.W.W. in these desperate {{political}} struggles.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions <b>seldom</b> held official recognition outside church membership and <b>seldom</b> resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E
5|$|Palladium {{is one of}} {{the three}} most popular {{alloying}} metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but <b>seldom</b> causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).|$|E
5|$|Unlike typical vomiting, the {{regurgitation}} {{is typically}} described as effortless and unforced. There is <b>seldom</b> nausea preceding the expulsion, and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile.|$|E
5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata <b>seldom</b> pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very <b>seldom</b> pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E
5|$|A variant on {{this design}} {{is the use}} of arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it <b>seldom</b> justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it. Baggage is <b>seldom</b> inspected, and cash customers {{do not require}} identification. Greyhound says that security wands have been deployed on buses, {{but they do not}} appear to be routinely used.|$|E
5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of the stations <b>seldom</b> had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, {{it was able to}} pass underneath the bridge at low tide.) However, on 15 December 1975, Bessie Surtees collided with the Swing Bridge, forcing it to close for the rest of that weekend.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods <b>seldom</b> settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are vulnerable to pollution. This may make the population of Coptothyrus adamsi useful {{as a measure of}} environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata is <b>seldom</b> seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Borscht, {{like any}} other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is <b>seldom</b> eaten by itself, but rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and <b>seldom</b> drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who <b>seldom</b> spoke of his many adventures.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are <b>seldom</b> fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but <b>seldom</b> life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too fast for a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and <b>seldom</b> misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Reagan himself, he recalls the East German police not allowing people to get near the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all. The fact that West German police acted {{in a similar way}} has however <b>seldom</b> been noted in accounts such as these.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1990s, the two teams were <b>seldom</b> equally good. The Yankees had the worst record in the American League when the Red Sox won their third {{division}} title in five years in 1990. In 1992, both teams finished {{at or near the}} bottom of the AL East.|$|E
5|$|Infant {{and parent}} {{chimpanzees}} show dyadic joint attention in an affectionate manner {{by looking at}} each other's eyes Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys <b>seldom</b> engage in dyadic joint attention. For these animals, the eye contact involved in dyadic joint attention is deemed threatening.|$|E
5|$|Raymond Dumbell{Sic} (Ray) Tarbuck {{was born}} in Philadelphia on 4 May 1897. His middle name caused him embarrassment and was <b>seldom</b> used, and he {{preferred}} the shortened form of his first name. He was educated at Philadelphia Central High School and the Philadelphia College of Pedagogy, where he studied to be a teacher, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He also attended the Naval Academy Preparatory School.|$|E
5|$|Standard Swedish is the {{language}} used by virtually all Swedes and most Swedish-speaking Finns. It is called rikssvenska or standardsvenska ("Standard Swedish") in Sweden. In Finland högsvenska ("High Swedish") {{is used for the}} Finnish variant of standard Swedish and rikssvenska refers to Swedish as spoken in Sweden in general. The word högsvenska is <b>seldom</b> used in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{was indicted}} as an {{accessory}} in {{the assassination of}} Goebel. He fled to Indianapolis, where the governor refused to extradite him. At least one attempt to abduct him by force failed in 1901. Despite being pardoned in 1909 by Republican Governor Augustus E. Willson, Taylor <b>seldom</b> returned to Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs <b>seldom</b> hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E
5|$|The dogs of {{all these}} islands were short, and their sizes vary {{from that of a}} lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They <b>seldom</b> if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of coon hunting is sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, {{the animals are}} both climbers by nature, and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being too easy to hunt and too greasy to be edible if killed, and are <b>seldom</b> hunted today.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the halfback, {{also known as the}} tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and {{function}} primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations and are <b>seldom</b> used in passing situations.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{delivered}} by the marbled electric ray can be painful but is <b>seldom</b> life-threatening, {{although there is a}} danger of a shocked diver becoming disoriented underwater. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, leading it and other electric fishes to be used in medicine. The ancient Greeks and Romans applied live rays to those afflicted with conditions such as chronic headaches and gout, and recommended that its meat be eaten by epileptics.|$|E
5|$|Tintin {{is a young}} Belgian {{reporter}} and adventurer who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day. The Adventures may feature Tintin hard at work in his investigative journalism, but <b>seldom</b> is he seen actually turning in a story.|$|E
5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is <b>seldom</b> that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of Jackson State University, {{he was a}} teammate of Walter Payton. Drafted {{in the third round}} of the 1976 NFL Draft, Slater <b>seldom</b> played his first few years before starting in 1979. Known as the most consistent member {{of one of the most}} potent offensive lines in NFL history, Slater was selected to seven Pro Bowls and broke a record for most seasons with one team. His jersey number was retired, and he was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Again thick urine, the {{sediment}} from which is white, indicates that pain and disease {{are to be}} apprehended {{in the region of}} joints or viscera... Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra. These <b>seldom</b> attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the menses have become suppressed... some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and venery.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was <b>seldom</b> hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, Alison Krauss {{holds the}} record for the most wins in this category, having won six times (five times with the band Union Station). The group {{consisting}} of Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder has been presented five awards. Two-time recipients include Jim Lauderdale as well as the Nashville Bluegrass Band. The award has been presented to artists or groups originating from the United States each year to date. The <b>Seldom</b> Scene and Rhonda Vincent share {{the record for}} the most nominations without a win, with five each.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2012 Aberdeenshire Council {{gave the}} go-ahead for the present owner's planned {{restoration}} work on the temple and bridges, which he hoped would enhance existing facilities at nearby Drinnies Wood surrounding the Observatory, White Cow Woods and Aden Country Park. The lake is used regularly by local fishermen, and a fishing club with about 120 members was established in 2011. The rest of the estate is <b>seldom</b> used by local residents, {{many of whom are}} completely unaware of it.|$|E
