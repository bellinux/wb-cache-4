2500|$|The first {{hydroelectric}} power station was built in 1890 just below the confluence of Red Tarn Beck and Glenridding Beck. The water for this came from Keppelcove Tarn, along a leat on the lower slopes of Catstye Cam to a wooden penstock about [...] above the power station. From there it was piped down to a water turbine driving a dynamo which produced a 600volt DC supply. Copper cables took this to the mine, through the Low Horse Level and down the Low Level Shaft to a <b>switchroom</b> in Warsop's Crosscut. As the mine deepened, power demands increased. In 1899 a second turbine and a 500volt dynamo was installed in the power station. The two power lines were kept separate, but the new one followed the same route into the mine, where {{it seems to have}} been used to power an air compressor. New equipment was put into the power station in 1911 to produce a 2,000 volt threephase AC supply. A transformer in Warsop's Crosscut converted this to 350volts for use in the mine, and to the 550volt DC supply needed for the existing motors.|$|E
50|$|The {{substation}} {{building has}} four separate areas: the HV <b>switchroom,</b> communications room, personnel {{room and the}} standby generator room. The test site was officially opened by Scotland's First Minister in September 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Non-switching entity codes {{may begin}} with A (administrative office space and computers), E (exchange <b>switchroom),</b> F (frame), K (software cross-connectable entity), M (maintenance group), P (test/service position), Q (radio tower), S (service centre), T (toll test) or W (miscellaneous), {{followed}} by anything except G (to avoid conflict with switches).|$|E
50|$|In {{commercial}} settings, {{this style}} of home run or star topology wiring was already in use on 66 blocks in telecom closets and <b>switchrooms.</b> The 110 block has been slowly replacing the 66 block, especially for data communications usage.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905 Clothier went to Tyneside to {{work with}} Charles Hesterman Merz and Bernard Price and joined Mr Alphonse C. Reyrolle at A. Reyrolle & Company in 1906, and {{remained}} employed with them {{for the rest of}} his life. In Tyneside he began an investigation of protective gear for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution at the instigation of Charles Merz and Bernard Price. While thus engaged his attention was directed to improvement of high-voltage switchgear. At the time, switchgear was prone to catching fire, making <b>switchrooms</b> a dangerous place to work. It was largely due to Clothier's work and initiative that both the Merz-Price protective-gear and the metal-clad switchgear, which controlled arcing on open-type electric switchboards, became not only technically but commercially practicable.|$|R
50|$|When a test access {{crosspoint}} {{itself was}} stuck closed, {{it would cause}} sporadic FCG failures all over both grids that were tested by that controller. Since the J links were externally connected, <b>switchroom</b> staff discovered that such failures could be found by making busy both grids, grounding the controller's test leads, and then testing all 128 J links, 256 wires, for a ground.|$|E
5000|$|From the Harbour Bridge {{the route}} follows the Northern Busway. The cables are {{installed}} in ducts that were originally placed during {{the construction of}} the busway in 2005. [...] Cable joint bays are installed at 500-800 m intervals. The cables are deviated from the Northern Busway at Wairau Road to connect to a new grid exit point (Wairau Road) adjacent to Vector's Wairau Valley zone substation, containing a single 120 MVA 220/33 kV connecting into the Wairau Valley zone substation and supplying the southern North Shore. Vector’s work at this site includes the conversion of the existing outdoor 33 kV switchyard into an indoor <b>switchroom.</b> From Wairau Road, the cable route again follows the Northern Busway to Constellation Drive.|$|E
50|$|When the dam {{was being}} voted on local {{municipalities}} {{had just been}} given {{the right to use}} eminent domain for construction of projects like this. However, the use of eminent domain was not used to secure the necessary right. At the time there were no other dams upstream of the Sturgis Dam. The original design of the dam had four floors in the powerhouse. When first constructed, there was the 2,300-volt oil switches and 23,000-volt lightning arresters on the <b>switchroom</b> floor. The lowest floor held six 200-kW oil-cooled transformers. The original transmission line out was a 17 mi three-phase line of No. 4 B & S hard drawn copper. The bond that was approved was for $175,000 however the cost came to $250,000. When the dam was constructed it caused the Langley Covered Bridge to be raised 8 ft.|$|E

40|$|While {{gathering}} the in-field experience {{to improve my}} professional grade I {{was introduced to the}} Chief of the Maintenance centre of Semperflex Optimit company Ltd. Thanks to that I have become familiar with the company‘s production‘s strategy, subdivisions of the operative maintenance centre {{as well as with the}} running of the part of electro-maintenance unit focusing the HV specialists. Simultaneously with my visit in the company I have been thinking over the subject of my bachelor´s thesis. Especially what took my interest was the HV branch of the electro-maintanance centre. What kind of qualifacation is necessary? How to achieve it? And what are the conditions for working with the HV unit? Is there any system of keeping the sufficient knowledge, work habits and skills? These, all together with other questions I have asked myself, convinced me to give my bachelor´s thesis the title „ The standards of the <b>switchroom</b> and transformer station’s worker maintenance. ...|$|E
40|$|The 11 kV {{distribution}} system at Paraburdoo mine site {{has been in}} service {{for the better part}} of the last forty years and has come to the end of its service life and requires replacing. These 11 kV electricity assets include the 11 kV bulk supply <b>switchroom,</b> a significant proportion of the plant distribution, six distribution transformers and a shunt reactor. In addition a new administration/workshop building and wash pad is currently under construction at West Angelas mine site and requires power installed from nearby overhead power lines. The purpose of my internship has been to write a Scope of Works and a Functional Specification for the replacement of the electricity assets at Paraburdoo and the installation of power at West Angelas. This was achieved by assessing the installation requirements, understanding the functionality of the electrical network in which they operate and consulting the relevant Australian Standards applicable to each installation whilst communicating with the project stakeholders in order to facilitate the replacement and installation of these assets at both sites. Specifically the assets at Paraburdoo shall be replaced with contemporary switchgear, transformers and shunt reactors while at West Angelas the new buildings will receive power via new underground cable from nearby take-off poles to a kiosk comprising an LV switchboard...|$|E
