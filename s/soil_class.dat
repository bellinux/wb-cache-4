Additionally, the use of DRIS could reduce the costs for farm planning. This study evaluated the relationship between the <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> and nutritional status of coffee plants (Coffea canephora Pierre) using the Critical Level (CL) and DRIS methods, based on two multivariate statistical methods (discriminant and multidimensional scaling analyses). During three consecutive years, yield and foliar concentration of nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Zn, Mn, Fe and Cu) were obtained from coffee plantations cultivated in Espírito Santo state. Discriminant analysis showed that the <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> was an important factor determining the nutritional status of the coffee plants. The grouping separation by the CL method was not as effective as the DRIS one. The bidimensional analysis of Euclidean distances did not show the same relationship between plant nutritional status and <b>soil</b> <b>class.</b> Multidimensional scaling analysis by the CL method indicated that 93. 3 % of the crops grouped into one cluster, whereas the DRIS method split the fields more evenly into three clusters.

40|$|Abstract. Digital <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> mapping (DSCM) {{provides}} a means of meeting the growing global demand for soil information. The search for optimal models for digital <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> mapping {{to take advantage of}} increasing availability of ancillary information, such as gamma radiometric data, is ongoing. One of the novel approaches to DSCM is based on genetic algorithms, which provide predictive function for DSCM. This paper aims: to develop a scheme for implementing genetic algorithms for rule-set production (GARP) in digital <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> mapping; to compare the performance of GARP and classification tree model (CT); and to evaluate the usefulness of gamma radiometrics as a predictor for DSCM of legacy soil data. We first collated the legacy <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> data from databases of soil profiles and the associated ancillary data from disparate sources. We then created a 200 -m resolution DSCM based on the Australian Soil Classification, for the Namoi catchment in north-western New South Wales, using GARP based on the general scorpan-sspfe model and compared the GARP performance with the widely used CT model. Elevation, terrain attributes, magnetic survey, land use, NDVI, and, where available, radiometric data were used as the ancillary variables. In this implementation, inclusion of radiometric data in either of the prediction models significantly improved the classification accuracy and the resulting DSCM. Based on various classification and prediction performance measures, GARP was shown to be outperformed by the CT. We conclude that GARP needs further improvement for its full potential to be realised for digitally mapping soil classes...|$|E

A greenhouse study (2006) and field studies (2007 to 2008) in Illinois and Nebraska were conducted to quantify the growth and interference of maize and velvetleaf in response to varying synthetic N fertilizer rates in soils with high and low N mineralization potential. Natural soils were classified as having ‘‘low mineralization potential’’ (LMP), while soils amended with composted manure were classified as having ‘‘high mineralization potential’’ (HMP). Maize and velvetleaf were grown in monoculture or in mixture in both LMP and HMP soils and fertilized with zero, medium, or full locally recommended N rate. In the greenhouse, velvetleaf interference in maize with respect to plant biomass increased as N rate increased in the HMP soil, whereas increasing N rate in the LMP soil reduced velvetleaf interference. In contrast, velvetleaf interference in maize decreased as N rate increased regardless of <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> in the field experiment. With respect to grain yield, velvetleaf interference in maize was unaffected by N rate or <b>soil</b> <b>class.</b> In both greenhouse and field experiments, velvetleaf biomass was greater in the HMP <b>soil</b> <b>class,</b> whereas maize interference in velvetleaf was generally greater in the LMP <b>soil</b> <b>class.</b> While soil N levels influenced weed-crop interference in the greenhouse, the results of the field study demonstrate the difficulty of controlling soil nutrient dynamics in the field and support a maize fertilization strategy independent of weed N use considerations...|$|E

Continuous pedotransfer functions were applied to samples with different texture within each <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> to construct discrete probability distributions of the soil hydraulic parameters. When propagating the parameter distributions through a hydrologic model, a wide range of simulated soil moisture was generated within a single <b>soil</b> <b>class.</b> The pedotransfer function was found to play a crucial role in assessing the uncertainty in the modeled soil moisture, and the geographic origin of the pedotransfer function (region specific versus nonregion specific) highly affected the range and shape of the probability distribution of the soil hydraulic parameters. Furthermore, the modeled soil moisture distribution was found to be non-Gaussian. An accurate uncertainty assessment therefore requires the characterization of its higher-order moments.

A set of permanent plots with annual or bi-annual measurements was used to fit different models of dominant height by age.

40|$|Legacy soil maps {{typically}} {{consist of}} a tessellation of polygon soil map unit delineations where the map units {{consist of a}} defined assemblage of soil classes assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations {{in this kind of}} mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is {{the fact that most of}} the time, the soil classes that comprise the soil map units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying soil map unit report. Spatial disaggregation of soil map units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual soil classes that comprise a legacy soil map. We developed an approach called "Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees" (DSMART). DSMART samples the polygons of a legacy soil map and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual soil classes. These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy soil map. We demonstrate the DSMART approach on a legacy soil map from the former Dalrymple Shire in central Queensland, Australia. We mapped the estimated probability of occurrence of the 71 soil classes in the legacy soil map, as well as the most probable <b>soil</b> <b>class,</b> second-most-probable <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> and the degree of confusion between them as determined by a confusion index.

We hypothesize that these directly calculated PVs are equivalent to the PVs estimated from an infinite number of realizations and thus realizations visualized from the calculated PVs represent the spatial variation of soil distribution. This hypothesis is supported by simulation results showing that: (i) with increasing the number of realizations generated by the Markov chain model from 10 to 100 and to 1000, PVs estimated from these realizations gradually approach the calculated PVs; (ii) similar to simulated realizations, realizations visualized from calculated PVs also can reflect the spatial patterns of <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> and approximately reproduce the complex indicator variograms of <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> of the original soil map. © Soil Science Society of America...|$|R

The conventional <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> map was created by free survey, while the property maps were created with the representative profile description (RPD) and map unit means (MUM) methods. For each method, we computed the effort invested in the mapping {{in terms of the}} sampling and cost densities. The accuracies of the created soil maps were estimated from independent probability sample data. The results showed that for DSM, the cost density could be reduced by a factor of three compared with CSM without compromising accuracy. The map purity of both maps was around 55 %. For conventional soil property mapping, the MUM maps were more accurate than the RPD maps. For SOM, CSM-MUM (RMSE 7. 5 %) performed better than DSM (RMSE 12. 1 %), although accuracy differences were not significant. For peat thickness, DSM (RMSE 23. 3 cm) performed slightly better than CSM-MUM (RMSE 24. 9 cm). Despite the differences in accuracy being small, the digital soil property maps were produced more efficiently. The cost density was a factor of 3. 5 smaller.

40|$|Introduction: Soil classiﬁcation {{generally}} aims {{to establish}} a taxonomy based on breaking the soil continuum into homogeneous groups that can highlight the essential differences in soil properties and functions between classes. The two most widely used modern soil classification schemes are Soil Taxonomy (ST) and World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB). With the development of computers and technology, digital and quantitative approaches have been developed. These new techniques that include the spatial prediction of <b>soil</b> properties or <b>classes,</b> relies on ﬁnding the relationships between soil and the auxiliary information that explain the soil forming factors or processes and finally predict soil patterns on the landscape. These approaches are {{commonly referred to as}} digital soil mapping (DSM) (14). A key component of any DSM mapping activity is the method used to define the relationship between soil observation and auxiliary information (4). Several types of machine learning approaches have been applied for digital soil mapping of <b>soil</b> <b>classes,</b> such as logistic and multinomial logistic regressions (10, 12), random forests (15), neural networks (3, 13) and classiﬁcation trees (22, 4). Many decisions about the soil use and management are based on the soil differences that cannot be captured by higher taxonomic levels (i. e., order, suborder and great group) (4). In low relief areas such as plains, it is expected that the soil forming factors are more homogenous and auxiliary information explaining soil forming factors may have low variation and cannot show the soil variability. Materials and Methods: The study area is located in the Shahrekord plain of Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari province. According tothe semi-detailed soil survey (16), 120 pedons with approximate distance of 750 m were excavated and described according to the “field book for describing and sampling soils” (19). Soil samples were taken from different genetic horizons, air dried and grounded. Soil physicochemical properties were determined. Based on the pedon description and soil analytical data, pedons were classified according to the ST (20) and WRB (11). Terrain attributes, remote sensing indices, geology, soil and geomorphology map were considered as auxiliary information. All of the auxiliary information were projected onto the same reference system (WGS 84 UTM 39 N) and resampled to 50 × 50 m according to the suggested resolution for digital soil maps (14). Four modeling techniques (multinomial logistic regression (MLR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF)) were used for each taxonomic level to identify the relationship between <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> and auxiliary information in each classiﬁcation system. The models were trained with 80 percent of the data (i. e., 96 pedons) and their validation was tested by remaining 20 percent of the dataset (i. e., 24 pedons) that split randomly. The accuracy of the predicted <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> was determined by using overall accuracy and Brier score. For each classiﬁcation system, the model with the highest OA and the lowest BS values were considered as the most accurate model for each taxonomic level. Results and Discussion: The results confirmed that ST showedmore accessory soil properties compared to WRB. The ST described the cation-exchange activity, <b>soil</b> depth <b>classes,</b> temperature and moisture regime. The different models had the same ability for prediction of <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> across all taxonomic levels based on ST. Among the studied models, MLR had the highest performance to predict <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> based on WRB. For all the studied models and both classification system, OA values showed a decreasing trend with increasing the taxonomic levels. Predicted <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> based on the ST had the higher accuracy. Different models selected different auxiliary information to predict <b>soil</b> <b>classes.</b> For most of the models and both classification systems, the terrain attributes were the most important auxiliary information at each taxonomic level. Conclusion: Results demonstrated that although ST showed more accessory soil properties compared to WRB, the DSM approaches have not enough accuracy for prediction of the <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> at lower taxonomic levels. More investigations are needed in this issue to make a firm conclusion whether DSM approaches are appropriate for prediction of <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> at the levels that are important for soil management. Prediction accuracy of <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> can be influenced by the target taxonomic level and classiﬁcation system, soil spatial variability in the study area, soil diversity, sampling density and the type of auxiliary information...|$|R

Subsequently, soil samples were collected from pedogenetic horizons and subjected to soil particle size and chemical analyses. Their Vis-NIR spectra were measured, followed by principal component analysis. Pearson's linear correlation coefficients were determined among the four principal components and the following soil properties: pH, organic matter, P, K, Ca, Mg, Al, CEC, base saturation, and Al saturation. We also carried out interpretation {{of the first three}} principal components and their relationships with <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> defined by SiBCS. In addition, numerical classification of the profiles based on the OSACA algorithm was performed using spectral data as a basis. We determined the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Uncertainty Coefficient (U). These coefficients represent the similarity between the numerical classification and the <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> from SiBCS. Pearson's correlation coefficients were significant for the principal components when compared to sand, clay, Al content and soil color. Visual analysis of the principal component scores showed differences in the spectral behavior of the <b>soil</b> <b>classes,</b> mainly among Argissolos and the others soils. The NMI and U similarity coefficients showed values of 0. 74 and 0. 64, respectively, suggesting good similarity between the numerical and SiBCS classes. For example, numerical classification correctly distinguished Argissolos from Latossolos and Nitossolos. However, this mathematical technique was not able to distinguish Latossolos from Nitossolos Vermelho férricos, but the Cambissolos were well differentiated from other <b>soil</b> <b>classes.</b> The numerical technique proved to be effective and applicable to the soil classification process...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{treatment}} {{describes the}} procedure under which a soil acquires certain characteristics {{that did not}} originally have. This paper is focused {{in the field of}} road earthworks and the treatment of a material found in the region of Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria. This material has poor characteristics that do not meet the standards used in road geotechnics. To remedy this, firstly, the Proctor Standard characteristics of this material were improved using mechanical treatment that increased the compaction energy. Then a chemical treatment was employed, adding some cement dosages, and results show that the material classified in the A 1 h class, for an increased maximum dry density and a reduction in water content. A comparative study is made on the optimal properties of the material between the two modes of treatment. On the other hand, after treatment, one finds a decrease in the plasticity index and the methylene blue value. This material exhibits a change of class. Therefore, <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> CL turned into a <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> CL-ML (silt of low plasticity). This observation allows the material to be used as backfill or subgrade...|$|E

40|$|Stream discharge-concentration {{relationships}} are indicators of terrestrial ecosystem function. Throughout the Amazon and Cerrado regions of Brazil rapid changes in {{land use and}} land cover may be altering these hydrochemical relationships. The current analysis focuses on factors controlling the discharge-calcium (Ca) concentration relationship since previous research in these regions has demonstrated {{both positive and negative}} slopes in linear log(10) discharge-log(10) Ca concentration regressions. The objective of the current study was to evaluate factors controlling stream discharge-Ca concentration relationships including year, season, stream order, vegetation cover, land use, and soil classification. It was hypothesized that land use and <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> are the most critical attributes controlling discharge-Ca concentration relationships. A multilevel, linear regression approach was utilized with data from 28 streams throughout Brazil. These streams come from three distinct regions and varied broadly in watershed size (10 (6) ha) and discharge (10 (- 5. 7) - 10 (3. 2) m(3) s(- 1)). Linear regressions of log(10) Ca versus log(10) discharge in 13 streams have a preponderance of negative slopes with only two streams having significant positive slopes. An ANOVA decomposition suggests the effect of discharge on Ca concentration is large but variable. Vegetation cover, which incorporates aspects of land use, explains the largest proportion {{of the variance in the}} effect of discharge on Ca followed by season and year. In contrast, stream order, land use, and <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> explain most of the variation in stream Ca concentration. In the current data set, <b>soil</b> <b>class,</b> which is related to lithology, has an important effect on Ca concentration but land use, likely through its effect on runoff concentration and hydrology, has a greater effect on discharge-concentration relationships.

40|$|Information on spatial {{variability}} of Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) {{is useful for}} implementation of appropriate control measures for the salt-affected soils. The major objective {{of this study was}} to use geostatistics to describe the {{spatial variability}} of (i) the SAR and consequently (ii) the soil sodicity, in areas of different <b>classes</b> of salt-affected <b>soils.</b> Attention was on areas of very severely salt-affected <b>soils</b> (<b>class</b> 1), severely salt-affected <b>soils</b> (<b>class</b> 2), and moderately salt-affected <b>soils</b> (<b>class</b> 3). For each class, 2 study sites were chosen, totally 6 sites were taken into consideration. In each site, 100 soil samples were collected at 0 - 30 cm depth according to the stratified systematic unaligned sampling method in the dry season of 2012, and analyzed for the SAR in the laboratory. Descriptive statistics and Geostatistics were applied to describe the variability and spatial variability of SAR and soil sodicity, respectively. The result revealed very high variability of SAR. Descriptive statistics showed the CV values of ≥ 35 % for every site of every class. When using semivariogram to describe the spatial correlation of SAR, it was found that in 3 study sites, the semivariogram models fitted well with the corresponding semivariogram samples indicating spatial correlation of SAR in the areas.
