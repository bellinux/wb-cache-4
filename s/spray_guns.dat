25|$|An {{airbrush}} is a small, air-operated {{tool that}} sprays various media including ink and dye, but most often paint {{by a process}} of nebulization. <b>Spray</b> <b>guns</b> developed from the airbrush and are still considered a type of airbrush. The first airbrush was invented in 1876 by Francis Edgar Stanley of Newton, Massachusetts.|$|E
2500|$|Some airbrushes use {{pressures}} {{as low as}} 20 psi (1.38 bar) {{while others}} use pressures {{in the region of}} 30-35 psi (2-2.4 bar). Larger [...] "spray guns" [...] as used for automobile spray-painting need 100 psi (6.8 bar) or more to adequately atomize a thicker paint using less solvent. They are capable of delivering a heavier coating more rapidly over a wide area. Even with small artist airbrushes using acrylic paint, artists must be careful not to breathe in the atomized paint, which floats in the air for minutes and can go deep into the lungs. With commercial <b>spray</b> <b>guns</b> for automobiles, it is vital that the painter have a clean air source to breathe, because automotive paint is far more harmful to the lungs than acrylic. Certain <b>spray</b> <b>guns,</b> called High-Volume Low-Pressure (HVLP) <b>spray</b> <b>guns,</b> are designed to deliver the same high volumes of paint without requiring such high pressures.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{essential}} robot peripheral {{is the end}} effector, or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), <b>spray</b> <b>guns</b> and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually electromechanical or pneumatic). Another common means of picking up an object is by vacuum. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time. [...] They may utilize various sensors to aid the robot system in locating, handling, and positioning products.|$|E

2500|$|Manufacturers who mass-produce {{products}} implement automated flatline finish systems. [...] These systems {{consist of}} a series of processing stations that may include sanding, dust removal, staining, sealer and topcoat applications. As the name suggests, the primary part shapes are flat. Liquid wood finishes are applied via automated <b>spray</b> <b>guns</b> in an enclosed environment or spray cabin. The material then can enter an oven or be sanded again depending on the manufacturer’s setup. The material can also be recycled through the line to apply another coat of finish or continue in a system that adds successive coats depending on the layout of the production line. The systems typically used one of two approaches to production.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{including}} his {{time spent in}} Lecumberri Prison, Siqueiros produced a series of politically themed lithographs, {{many of which were}} exhibited in the United States. His lithograph Head was shown at the 1930 exhibition [...] "Mexican Artists and Artists of the Mexican School" [...] at The Delphic Studios in New York City. In 1932, he led an exhibition and conference entitled [...] "Rectifications on Mexican Muralism" [...] at the gallery of the Spanish Casino in Taxco, Guerrero. Shortly after, he traveled to New York, where he participated in the Weyhe Gallery's [...] "Mexican Graphic Art" [...] exhibition. Also in 1932, Nelbert Chouinard invited Siqueiros to Los Angeles to conduct mural workshops. It was at this time that, with a team of students, he also completed Tropical America in 1932, at the Italian Hall at Olvera Street in Los Angeles. Painting fresco on an outside wall – visible to passersby as well as intentional viewers – forced Siqueiros to reconsider his methodology as a muralist. He wanted the image – an Indian peon being crucified by American oppression – to be accessible from multiple angles. Instead of just constructing [...] "an enlarged easel painting," [...] he realized that the mural [...] "must conform to the normal transit of a spectator." [...] Eventually, Siqueiros would develop a mural technique that involved tracing figures onto a wall with an electric projector, photographing early wall sketches to improve perspective, and new paints, <b>spray</b> <b>guns,</b> and other tools to accommodate the surface of modern buildings and the outdoor conditions. He was unceremoniously deported from the United States for political activity the same year.|$|E

50|$|High volume low {{pressure}} (HVLP) {{is similar to}} a conventional <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> using a compressor to supply the air, but the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> itself requires a lower pressure (LP). A higher volume (HV) of air is used to aerosolise and propel the paint at lower air pressure. The result is a higher proportion of paint reaching the target surface with reduced overspray, materials consumption, and air pollution.A regulator is often required so that the air pressure from a conventional compressor can be lowered for the HVLP <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> Alternatively a turbine unit (commonly containing a vacuum cleaner derived motor) can be used to propel the air without the need for an air line running to the compressor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{trajectory}} planning process of spray painting robot, {{an approach to}} automatic trajectory generation of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> using point cloud slicing is presented. Firstly, the point cloud data is obtained by scanning {{the surface of the}} workpiece. After the uniform slicing of point cloud model, the spraying position is determined by the average sampling of cross-section contours. Then the normal vectors of the sampling points are estimated. Finally {{the trajectory}} of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> is generated by offsetting the sampling points along their normal vectors. Experimental results show that the method has good feasibility and effectiveness. The spraying trajectory, direction and distance of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> can be controlled accurately, thus the spraying quality and efficiency are improved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMaterial {{consumption}} and {{dry film thickness}} are the two main indicators for identifying the efficiency of spray coating process. Using a proper spray condition, less material consumption could be obtained as per a given dry film thickness. This paper presents the influences of supplying- air pressure, spray time and nozzle size of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> on the weight of material used per shot and the dry film thickness obtained. A high- volume-low-pressure type <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> was used to atomize and deliver a liquid solution of Teflon depositing on a flat work surface. The experimental results showed that low spray time, large nozzle size and low spray pressure {{were responsible for the}} increased material {{consumption and}} dry film thickness. The optimization was performed, where the material consumption was minimized and the dry film thickness was set within a specified standard. Based on the geometric interaction between the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> and work-piece, a spray coating model in this application, which is considered unique was also developed and discussed in this paper. Moreover, this paper demonstrates a determination of the coefficient of spray coating process (k) through a relationship between coating thickness and material consumption using data obtained from the experiment. As a result, a relationship among the dry film thickness and positions of the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> was established and {{it can be used to}} predict the coating thickness. In conclusion, the optimal conditions in the spray coating process was determined to minimize material consumption whereas the developed spray coating model predicts the coating thickness related to the position of the <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> This model will substantially reduce <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> setup time during production in order to obtain required dry film thickness...|$|R

40|$|In spray {{painting}} applications, {{it is essential}} to generate a <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> trajectory such that the entire surface is completely covered and receives an acceptably uniform layer of paint deposition; we call this the “uniform coverage ” problem. The uniform coverage problem is challenging because the atomizer emits a non-trivial paint distribution, thus making the relationships between the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> trajectory and the deposition uniformity complex. To understand the key issues involved in uniform coverage, we consider surface patches that are geodesically convex and topologically simple as representative of subsets of realistic automotive surfaces. In addition to ensuring uniform paint deposition on the surface, our goal is to also minimize the associated process cycle time and paint waste.

50|$|Upon departing the <b>spray</b> <b>gun,</b> the {{graphene}} flake’s {{tendency to}} aggregate is reduced {{due to its}} quick evaporation and dispersion. Much to the researchers’ surprise, this spray method produces flakes that contain substantially less defects that would commonly occur. Common graphene defects including holes and lumps in the layer, and the Stone-Wales defect were absent upon surface impact. The large amount of kinetic energy delivered by the supersonic nozzle creates the healing of these defects, as the graphene flakes stretches upon impact. The carbon atoms within the graphene rearrange to create seamlessly perfect hexagonal lattice structures. The result of these perfect hexagon structures {{is the creation of}} a smooth, even layer of graphene. This is a large contrast to the applications of graphene onto large-scale substrates prior {{to the creation of the}} graphene <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> The graphene layers would commonly contain defecting clumps and spaces, which troubled scientists ever since the discovery of graphene.
