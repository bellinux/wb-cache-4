Although, many people know that smoke is dangerous for the human body healthy, but it doesn’t make the smoker stop to consume it. It has been done many ways to make smokers <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> or at least lessen it, but the converse happens. The smoker back to their past habit that is smoke. It is caused by the lack of self-control in smoker. Based on the background, hence the smoker’s self-control role is needed here. That is a procedure where somebody directs or manages their own behaviors. So that, the function of self-control later is the smoker able to not to back again to their past habit that is smoking. This study was done to know the effect of self-control therapy to lessening the number of consumed cigarettes. It uses single case non-experimental design or case study with 3 persons as the subject, of course, with the certain requirements that is the subject is a light smoker. To know the development of subject conditions is done an assessment start from pre-therapy to the post-therapy. It is done by using interview method and self-report. Evaluation is done once in 3 days during the therapy terms.

Considering both overall smoker status {{as well as the}} number of cigarettes consumed, we provide estimates for the smoking wage penalty using standard regression methods, including panel estimators for fixed eects and panel instrumental variable estimators. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of <b>stopping</b> and starting <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> relative <b>to</b> permanent smokers and non-smokers by Mahalanobis-matching. In the cross-section, we find a rather large wage penalty for smokers of about 4 %. However, panel estimator and IV results show relatively few support for hypotheses linking the smoking wage penalty to either lower productivity of smokers, be it health related or not, or discrimination.

40|$|Objective: To examine {{attitudinal}} {{changes of}} bar owners and staff regarding a smoke-free bar law. Design: Bar owners and staff were random selected and telephone interviewed in June 1998, shortly after a smoke-free bar law was enacted, and October 2002.

Participants: 651 and 650 respondents worked for either stand alone bars or combination bars. Measures: Preference of working in a smoke-free environment, concerns of the effect of SHS, and how to comply with the law. Results: The percentage of bar owners or staff working in stand alone bars who prefer to work in a smoke-free environment increased from 17. 3 % in 1998 to 50. 9 % in 2002 (p, 0. 001). Significantly more respondents (45. 5 %) working in stand alone bars were concerned about the effects of SHS on their health, comparing to 21. 6 % in 1998 (p, 0. 001).

2500|$|Many {{governments are}} trying to deter people from smoking with anti-smoking campaigns in mass media {{stressing}} the harmful long-term effects of smoking.

This is a law enforced <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> individuals smoking in indoor public places, such as bars, pubs and restaurants. The idea behind this is to discourage smoking by making it more inconvenient, and <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> harmful <b>smoke</b> being present in enclosed public spaces. A common concern among legislators is to discourage smoking among minors and many states have passed laws against selling tobacco products to underage customers (establishing a smoking age).

40|$|Tobacco use, mostly smoking, {{has been}} a deeply rooted habit for many people for centuries. However, {{it was not until}} the second half of last century that the risks with smoking became obvious. Today when the bad {{consequences}} of smoking are recognized by almost all people, it is important to discuss why smokers choose to continue smoking. The main aim of this thesis is to try to better explain why some middle aged smokers choose to continue smoking in spite of knowledge of the huge mass of information that is gathered about the serious side effects of smoking. Many of these people cannot by any means stop smoking while others succeed in their attempt to quit. Since 1990 all inhabitants in Västerbotten County are invited to a health survey the year they become 40, 50 and 60 years: the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP). The VIP health survey consists of risk markers for cardiovascular diseases (blood pressure, blood sugar and blood lipids), a questionnaire on socioeconomic, psychosocial and life style factors, supplemented by a health counselling discussion with a district nurse. The thesis is based on five papers. Four of them use VIP data. In Paper I tobacco habits are related to different levels of age, gender and education and are analyzed in a 18 year perspective, based on 112 920 VIP participants. As it has been suggested that women might have more difficulties than men <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> smoking, Paper II elucidates women’s perceptions about smoking, based on interviews with nine smoking and ex-smoking women. Paper III identify metabolic consequences of heavy smoking and relate these to social and life style factors that might accompany smoking behaviour. Paper IV analyzes the individual pattern of changes in tobacco use over a ten year period among 16 492 subjects, while Paper V, a questionnaire study, addresses 513 respondents own assessments of what was especially important for them in their attempts to become smoke-free and what was positive and what was negative when they <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> Their knowledge and attitudes about smoking issues were also analyzed. The thesis shows that heavy smokers seem to have a metabolic profile heading towards the metabolic syndrome, and that this pattern could be reinforced by some social and life style factors. Smoking women expressed their concern over weight gain, if quitting. They provided a series of different hinders and barriers against smoking cessation as well as some explanations of why it was reasonable to continue smoking. Feeling of shame and fatalism played a major role but also influence from friends, relatives and media was regarded as important factors. For both men and women the decision to quit smoking was supported from relatives and from a wish for a healthier lifestyle. Support from the health care providers was perceived to be rare. Snus use and nicotine replacement therapy in the attempts <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> smoking were also discussed. In summary the thesis stresses that the use of tobacco products in Västerbotten is slowly decreasing in the middle aged population in general. For people with shorter school education and at somewhat younger age the dual use of tobacco products, cigarettes and snus, are slowly increasing. However, after ten years, half of the smokers in these age cohorts still smoke. It is possible that the more addicted smokers remain, why a major challenge is to find new ways to support these individuals. Health care providers have to do more, but also schools, media, societal organizations and governmental bodies on local, regional and national levels. One proposal is to look upon nicotine dependence, especially smoking, as a chronic condition that needs various multifactorial treatment and long time follow up, and that it is important to organize the support accordingly. Special antitobacco or life style centres outside the established health care organization where focus could be on different healthy life style matters is suggested. The thesis also suggest different ways to handle smoking cessation at the primary health care level...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundElectronic {{cigarettes}} (ECs) and nicotine {{replacement therapy}} (NRT) are non-combustible nicotine delivery devices being widely {{used as a}} partial or a complete long-term substitute for smoking. Little {{is known about the}} characteristics of long-term users, their smoking behaviour, attachment to smoking, experience of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, or their views on these devices. This study aimed to provide preliminary evidence on this and compare users of the different products. MethodsUK participants were recruited from four naturally occurring groups of long-term (≥ 6 months) users of either EC or NRT who had <b>stopped</b> or continued <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> (N= 36 per group, total N= 144). Participants completed a questionnaire assessing socio-demographic and smoking characteristics, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, smoker identity and attitudes towards the products they were using. ResultsAdjusting for relevant confounders, EC use was associated with a stronger smoker identity (Wald X 2 (1) = 3. 9, p= 0. 048) and greater product endorsement (Wald X 2 (1) = 4. 6, p= 0. 024) than NRT use, irrespective of smoking status. Among ex-smokers, EC users reported less severe mood and physical symptoms (Wald X 2 (1) = 6. 1, p= 0. 014) and cravings (Wald X 2 (1) = 8. 5, p= 0. 003), higher perceived helpfulness of the product (Wald X 2 (1) = 4. 8, p= 0. 028) and lower intentions <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> using the product (Wald X 2 (1) = 17. 6, p< 0. 001) than NRT users. ConclusionsCompared with people who use NRT for at least 6 months, those who use EC over that time period appear to have a stronger smoker identity and like their products more. Among long-term users who have stopped smoking, ECs are perceived as more helpful than NRT, appear more effective in controlling withdrawal symptoms and continued use may be more likely...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: Suppressing smoking {{thoughts}} {{has been}} shown to result in elevated smoking. However, the effect of suppressing smoking thoughts on desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and withdrawal symptoms has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of suppressing smoking thoughts on the subsequent desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and on tobacco withdrawal symptoms, relative to groups that were either thinking about anything they wished or actively thinking about smoking. METHODS: A randomised experimental study compared the effects of three manipulations (suppressed smoking thoughts, expressed smoking thoughts and thoughts of anything they wished) on desire and withdrawal immediately after the manipulation and 5 and 10  min after. RESULTS: Suppressing smoking thoughts did not result in elevated subsequent desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke,</b> relative <b>to</b> the other manipulations. Suppressing smoking thoughts resulted in a significant elevation in hunger ratings, relative to the other manipulations, at all measurement times. There were no significant effects for the other withdrawal symptoms. Self-reported greater use of thought suppression in everyday life was significantly associated with greater desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> at baseline and was associated with lower mindfulness scores. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory-instructed suppression of smoking thoughts is associated with increased reports of hunger but did not lead to increases in other withdrawal symptoms or elevated desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke.</b> Reports of everyday use of thought suppression are associated with elevated desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> at baseline. Further investigations need to assess the effect of suppressing smoking cravings, instead of general smoking thoughts, on desire <b>to</b> <b>smoke</b> and tobacco withdrawal...|$|R
