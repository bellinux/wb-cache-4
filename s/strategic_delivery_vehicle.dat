40|$|IBM's {{transition}} as {{a company}} from its early 1990 s image of a tired old dinosaur, to today's forward thinking, technology leading, services driven company, {{has been one of}} the most remarkable corporate transformation success stories of recent times. There are many elements behind this transition, but one was the role by IBM's re-focussed approach to human capital management and the accompanying internal skills and training programs. This included the adoption of e-business technologies and a major shift to e-learning as a <b>strategic</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> for skills development. Today, over 40 % of IBM's internal training program is delivered by e-learning, saving the company over $ 350 M (US) each year. Learning has become mission critical for IBM. In the words of our recently departed CIO, Lou Gerstner, "I believe that in this networked world the single greatest factor separating winners and losers in all industries and in fact, in all societies, will be the ability to use information and build a culture based on knowledge and the ability to learn. " In this session, the speaker will outline the transition of IBM's skills development and e-learning processes, cover IBM's strategy to learning and discuss the adoption of e-learning techniques as a core component. To demonstrate IBM's approach, the speaker will focus on the transformatio...|$|E

The Soviets secretly agreed to reduce Tu-22M production to thirty aircraft per year and not to give them an intercontinental range. It was particularly important for the United States to limit Soviet efforts in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) rearmament area.|$|R

40|$|<b>Delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{that can}} {{encapsulate}} and release active ingredients of pre-determined volumes {{at the target}} site on-demand present a challenge in biomedical field. Due to their tunable physiochemical properties and degradation rate, polymeric particles {{are one of the}} most extensively employed <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Generally they are fabricated from emulsion templates. Conventional bulk emulsification technique provides little control over the characteristics of droplets generated. Thus the properties of the subsequent particles cannot be controlled. The advance of droplet microfluidics enables the generation and manipulation of designer single, double or higher-order emulsion droplets with customizable structure. These droplets are powerful and versatile templates for fabricating polymeric <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with pre-determined properties. Due to the monodispersity of droplet templates by microfluidics, the relationship between size, size distribution, shape, architecture, elastic responses and release kinetics can be systematically studied. These understandings are of key importance for the design and fabrication of the next generation polymeric <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with custom-made functions for specific applications. In the present work, we engineer the droplet templates generated from microfluidics to fabricate designer polymeric microparticles as <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> We investigate and obtain the relationship between the particle size, size distribution, structure of microparticles and their release kinetics. Moreover, we also identify an innovative route to tune the particle shape that enables the investigation of the relationship between particle shape and release kinetics. We take advantage of the dewetting phenomena driving by interfacial tensions of different liquid phases to vary the droplet shape. We find that the phase-separation-induced shape variation of polymeric composite particles can be engineered by manipulating the kinetic barriers during droplet shape evolution. To predict the performance of our advanced polymer particles in practical applications, for instance, in narrow blood vessels in vivo, we also develop a novel capillary micromechanics technique to characterize the linear and non-linear elastic response of our polymer particles on single particle level. The knowledge of the mechanical properties enables the prediction as well as the design of the mechanical aspects of polymer particles in different applications. The ability to control and design the physical, chemical, mechanical properties of the <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and the understanding between these properties and the biological functionalities of <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles,</b> such as the release kinetics, lead towards tailor-designed <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with finely-designed functionalities for various biomedical applications. Our proposed electro-microfluidic platform potentially enables generation of submicron droplet templates with a narrow size distribution and nanoscaled <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with well-controlled properties, leading to a next generation of intracellular <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Microfluidic-based technique has the potential to be scaled up by parallel operation. Therefore, we are well-equipped for the massive production of custom-made droplet templates of both micron-size and nanosized, and we can design the physiochemical properties and biological functionalities of the <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These abilities enable us to provide solutions for applications and fundamental topics where encapsulation, preservation and transportation of active ingredients are needed. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|There were 2. 5 {{million people}} newly {{infected}} with HIV in 2007, clearly motivating {{the need for}} additional novel prevention methods. In response, topical vaginal antimicrobials, or microbicides, are being developed. These products aim to stop HIV transmission through local, vaginal delivery of antiviral compounds. To succeed, microbicides require a potent active compound within a well-engineered <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle.</b> A well-engineered <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> provides an antiviral compound with the greatest opportunity to interact with HIV and/or infected cells, thereby increasing overall microbicide effectiveness. The theoretical and experimental investigations within this dissertation are concerned with the study of HIV and active compound transport within microbicide <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> and with the mechanisms by which these transport processes can be affected to maximize viral neutralization. To initially investigate the factors contributing to microbicide effectiveness, a combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model of HIV transport and neutralization within a microbicide product was created. Model results suggested that thin (~ 100 µm) layers of microbicide product may protect against HIV infection. Model results also indicated that a specific and engineerable property of <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> - the ability to restrict viral transport - may increase the overall effectiveness of a microbicide. Two new experimental assays were developed to test the hypothesis that <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> can slow viral transport. First, a novel methodology was created to measure particle diffusion over length scales relevant to microbicide delivery (50 - 500 µm). Results showed that current vehicles significantly restrict the transport of small molecules and proteins. The second assay was designed to test HIV transport in a biologically relevant, layered (fluid-microbicide-tissue) configuration of a microbicide product in vivo; infectious HIV was placed above a thin layer of a microbicide <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Assay results showed that HIV transport is significantly slowed by two different placebo gels. This experimental confirmation of viral restriction in hydrogels, combined with the theoretical finding that viral restriction increased microbicide effectiveness, strongly motivates the future development of new <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> that intentionally slow viral transport. These new experimental methodologies {{can also be used to}} screen and compare future <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> to produce optimal microbicide products. Finally, a two-dimensional, computational finite-element vaginal model was created to evaluate the transport of drugs from an intravaginal ring. This model determined that while IVRs may be effective in the delivery of antiviral compound, their performance is influenced by the flow of vaginal fluid. The analysis also warns about the potential for local toxicity. Well-engineered <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> are an essential component to microbicide performance because they maximize the opportunities for active compounds to interact with and neutralize HIV. The studies in this dissertation demonstrate that <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> have a significant effect on active compound and HIV transport. To create an effective microbicide, vehicle effects on transport processes must be well understood, purposefully engineered, and carefully optimized to ensure maximal interactions between antiviral compounds and virus. Directed engineering of <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> contribute to the foundation for microbicide success. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is {{the most}} potent poison known to mankind. Currently no {{antidote}} is available to rescue poisoned synapses. An effective medical countermeasure strategy would require developing a drug that could rescue poisoned neuromuscular synapses and include its efficient delivery specifically to poisoned presynaptic nerve terminals. Here we report a drug delivery strategy that could directly deliver toxin inhibitors into the intoxicated nerve terminal cytosol. Results A targeted <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> was developed for intracellular transport of emerging botulinum neurotoxin antagonists. The drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> consisted of the non-toxic recombinant heavy chain of botulinum neurotoxin-A coupled to a 10 -kDa amino dextran via the heterobifunctional linker 3 -(2 -pyridylthio) -propionyl hydrazide. The heavy chain served to target botulinum neurotoxin-sensitive cells and promote internalization of the complex, while the dextran served as a platform to deliver model therapeutic molecules to the targeted neurons. Our {{results indicated that the}} drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> entry into neurons was via BoNT-A receptor mediated endocytosis. Once internalized into neurons, the drug carrier component separated from the drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> in a fashion similar to the separation of the BoNT-A light chain from the holotoxin. This drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> could be used to deliver BoNT-A antidotes into BoNT-A intoxicated cultured mouse spinal cord cells. Conclusion An effective BoNT-based drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> can be used to directly deliver toxin inhibitors into intoxicated nerve terminal cytosol. This approach can potentially be utilized for targeted drug delivery to treat other neuronal and neuromuscular disorders. This report also provides new knowledge of endocytosis and exocytosis as well as of BoNT trafficking. </p...|$|R
