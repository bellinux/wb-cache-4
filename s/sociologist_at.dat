500|$|Herbert Spencer (27 April 1820– 8 December 1903) {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{influential}} 19th-century sociologists. It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including Émile Durkheim, defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's Division of Labour in Society is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable biologist, Spencer coined the term [...] "survival of the fittest". While Marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology, Spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a laissez-faire style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the United States and England.|$|E

Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches {{have a lot in common}} when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, a <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} after the RCG's foundation, {{disagreements}} emerged amongst its members regarding such topics as Stalinism and the South African government. One group, dominated by Frank Furedi (1947-), a <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> the University of Kent who used the pseudonym of [...] "Frank Richards", began to argue against the views put forward by David Yaffe and his supporters. Yaffe himself later remarked that Furedi had been [...] "organising among a clique of middle-class members, and became their self-styled guru". In November 1976, Furedi and his followers were expelled from the RCG, following which {{they went on to}} form their own rival organisation, the Revolutionary Communist Tendency (RCT). Soon, the RCT itself splintered, with a group calling itself the Committee for a Communist Programme (CPP) being founded by several dissenting members. Following this, the RCT went on to change its name to the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1981, and would publish the magazine Living Marxism from 1988 to 2000, in which their political position moved from Leninism to Libertarian Marxism.|$|E

2500|$|Following Horkheimer's {{taking up}} the {{directorship}} of the Institute, a new journal, Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, was produced to publish the research of Institute members {{both before and after}} its relocation to the United States. Though Adorno was not himself an Institute member, the journal nevertheless published many of his essays, including [...] "The Social Situation of Music" [...] (1932), [...] "On Jazz" [...] (1936), [...] "On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening" [...] (1938) and [...] "Fragments on Wagner" [...] (1938). In his new role as social theorist, Adorno's philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena heavily relied on the language of historical materialism, as concepts like reification, false consciousness and ideology came to play an ever more prominent role in his work. At the same time, however, and owing to both the presence of another prominent <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> the Institute, Karl Mannheim, as well as the methodological problem posed by treating objects—like [...] "musical material"—as ciphers of social contradictions, Adorno was compelled to abandon any notion of [...] "value-free" [...] sociology in favour of a form of ideology critique which held on to an idea of truth. Before his emigration in autumn 1934, Adorno began work on a Singspiel based on Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer entitled The Treasure of Indian Joe, which he would, however, never complete; by the time he fled Hitler's Germany Adorno had already written over a hundred opera or concert reviews and an additional fifty critiques of music composition.|$|E
2500|$|Stallwood {{writes that}} they saw ALF {{activism}} {{as part of their}} opposition to the state, rather than as an end-in-itself, {{and did not want to}} adhere to non-violence. In the early 1980s, the BUAV, an anti-vivisection group founded by Frances Power Cobbe in 1898, was among the ALF's supporters. Stallwood writes that it donated part of its office space rent-free to the ALF Supporters Group, and gave ALF actions uncritical support in its newspaper, The Liberator. In 1982, a group of ALF activists, including Roger Yates, now a <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> University College, Dublin, and Dave McColl, a director of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, became members of the BUAV's executive committee, and used their position to radicalize the organization. Stallwood writes that the new executive believed all political action to be a waste of time, and wanted the BUAV to devote its resources exclusively to direct action. Whereas the earliest activists had been committed to rescuing animals, and destroyed property only where it contributed to the former, by the mid-1980s, Stallwood believed the ALF had lost its ethical foundation, and had become an opportunity [...] "for misfits and misanthropes to seek personal revenge for some perceived social injustice". He writes: [...] "Where was the intelligent debate about tactics and strategies that went beyond the mindless rhetoric and emotional elitism pervading much of the self-produced direct action literature? In short, what had happened to the animals' interests?" [...] In 1984, the BUAV board reluctantly voted to expel the ALF SG from its premises and withdraw its political support, after which, Stallwood writes, the ALF became increasingly isolated.|$|E
2500|$|Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), the English philosopher, {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{influential}} 19th-century sociologists. The early sociology of Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte and Marx; writing before and after the Darwinian revolution in biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as socially Darwinistic terms. In fact, his early writings show a coherent theory of general evolution several years before Darwin published anything on the subject. Encouraged by his friend and follower Edward L. Youmans, Spencer published The Study of Sociology in 1874, which was the first book with the term [...] "sociology" [...] in the title. In the 1900 edition of the journal International Monthly, Franklin H. Giddings (1855–1931), the first professor of sociology at Columbia University, described it as the book that [...] "first awakened in England, America, France, Italy and Russia a wide interest general interest" [...] in the then fledgling discipline of sociology. In the United States, Charles Horton Cooley, stated in a 1920 article that The Study of Sociology [...] "probably did more to arouse interest in the subject than any other publication before or since." [...] It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including Émile Durkheim, defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim’s Division of Labour in Society is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology Durkheim borrowed extensively. Also a notable biologist, Spencer coined the term [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] as a basic mechanism by which more effective socio-cultural forms progressed. Whilst many intellectuals of his day were proponents of socialism as a scientifically informed manner of steering society, Spencer was a critic of socialism and an advocate for a laissez-faire style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the United States and England. Although Spencer's work is rarely discussed in contemporary sociological theory, his work has been adapted and changed, and resurfaces in various contemporary forms.|$|E
