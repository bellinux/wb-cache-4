5|$|Along {{with the}} {{improvements}} in critical reception, The Wolverine outgrossed Origins in total box office, though earned less domestically. The film closed in US theaters on December 5, 2013, grossing $132,556,852 in North America (as opposed to $179,883,157 for the earlier film) and $282,271,394 in other territories (as {{opposed to the}} earlier film's $193,179,707), for a worldwide total of $414,828,246. The film earned $139.6 million on its worldwide opening weekend. When compared {{to the rest of}} the X-Men film franchise, The Wolverine has garnered somewhat mixed results in terms of box office success. While its domestic gross is greater than the production budget, it is still lower than the other five films of the franchise, with its domestic box office total being roughly $45.1 million less than the franchise's average. However, its overseas total currently exceeds the franchise's average by roughly $75.7 million and is <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any of the other X-Men films. With a worldwide total of roughly $414.8 million, The Wolverine was at that time the third highest grossing film.|$|E
40|$|In Belgium, {{marriage}} and adoption for {{gays and lesbians}} are legal since respectively 2003 and 2006. Despite the legalization, public opinion is still not unanimous and some heterosexuals continue to disapprove those families. This study aims at examining the correlated variables {{of positive and negative}} attitudes toward same-sex {{marriage and}} same-sex parenting. Attitudes were assessed through self-report questionnaires in a cohort of 3663 heterosexual participants that are resident in Belgium, 47 % Females, 53 % males aged from 18 to 61. It is hypothesized that correlates of positive attitudes toward SSM and GLP will be associated with female gender, lower religiosity, liberal political ideology, and higher education and socioeconomic status. Results suggest that females are <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> favorable <b>than</b> males toward same-sex marriage. People aged between 18 and 25 are <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> favorable <b>than</b> older age groups. Atheists/agnostics are <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> favorable <b>than</b> all religious groups. Left-wing individuals are <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> favorable <b>than</b> right-wing.

5|$|De Gomme {{prepared}} several {{plans for}} the King in 1665; a further iteration of the designs was submitted in 1670 and given royal approval. Work began the same year but it took until 1685 to complete the project. The work {{was carried out by}} skilled contractors, who were supplemented by large teams of pressed men brought in from across the region; during 1671, up to 256 workers were employed on the site. Around 3,000 timber piles had to be brought from Norway for the project in 1671 to support the foundations in the marshy ground. The resources needed for the King's multiple defence projects became stretched, and one of the planned bastions at Tilbury, originally planned to face the river, was cancelled in 1681, in part to save money. The total cost of the project is unknown, but was <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the original estimate of £47,000.|$|E

Water ice {{seems to be}} {{ubiquitous}} on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 %, <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. Galileo results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.|$|E

It was decided that the only practical course of action was to investigate the site while it still existed, and a preliminary evaluation was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004–05. The surveyed area covered 10ha (25acre), <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the 0.4ha (1acre) of the 1998 investigations. 50 trenches were excavated in a herringbone pattern outside the buildings, each 50m long and 1.80m wide (194 by 5.9ft), and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel. The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches. The geology was investigated with eight boreholes, and geophysics (magnetometry and metal detection) were used to locate subsurface anomalies.|$|E
