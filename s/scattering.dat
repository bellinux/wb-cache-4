40|$|First {{and second}} order Rayleigh and Raman <b>scatter</b> {{is a common}} problem when fitting Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) to {{fluorescence}} excitationemission data (EEM). The <b>scatter</b> does not contain any relevant chemical information and does not conform to the low-rank trilinear model. The <b>scatter</b> complicates the analysis instead and contributes to model inadequacy. As such, <b>scatter</b> can be considered an an example of element-wise outliers. However, no straightforward method for identifying the <b>scatter</b> region {{can be found in}} the literature. In this paper an automatic <b>scatter</b> identification method is developed based on robust statistical methods. The method does not demand any visual inspection of the data prior to modeling, and can handle first and second order Rayleigh <b>scatter</b> as well as Raman <b>scatter</b> in various types of EEM data. The results of the automated <b>scatter</b> identification method were used as input data for three different PARAFAC methods. Firstly inserting missing values in the <b>scatter</b> regions are tested, secondly an interpolation of the <b>scatter</b> regions is performed and finally the <b>scatter</b> regions are down-weighted. These results show that the PARAFAC method to choose after <b>scatter</b> identification clearly depends on the data, for example signal to noise ratio and overlap between signal and <b>scatter...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} {{method for}} <b>scatter</b> compensation in SPECT imaging is the triple energy window technique (TEW) which estimates {{the fraction of}} <b>scattered</b> photons in the projection data pixel by pixel. This technique requires an acquisition of counts in three windows of the energy spectrum for each projection bin, which is not possible on every gamma camera. The {{aim of this study}} is to set up a <b>scatter</b> template for brain perfusion SPECT imaging by means of the <b>scatter</b> data acquired with the triple energy window technique. This <b>scatter</b> template can be used for <b>scatter</b> correction as follows: the <b>scatter</b> template is realigned with the acquired, by <b>scatter</b> degraded and reconstructed image by means of the corresponding emssion template, which also includes <b>scatter</b> counts. The ratios between the voxelvalues of this emission template and the acquired and reconstructed image are used to locally adjust the <b>scatter</b> template. Finally the acquired and reconstructed image is corrected for <b>scatter</b> by substracting the thus obtained <b>scatter</b> estimates. We compared the template based approach with the TEW <b>scatter</b> correction technique for data acquired with same gamma camera system and found a similar performance for both correction methods. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Effect of {{inaccurate}} <b>scatter</b> estimates: <b>Scatter</b> estimation requires {{knowledge about}} the attenuation distribution. In all phantom experiments and patient data sets presented in this work, <b>scatter</b> estimation {{is based on the}} uncorrected attenuation map, i.e., without hardware components present, as this corresponds to the clinical setting where hardware attenuation is neglected. However, since the annihilation photons may also be <b>scattered</b> by the hardware, the <b>scatter</b> estimate based on attenuation maps not including the hardware components may be inaccurate. Therefore, to investigate the effect of such inaccurate <b>scatter</b> estimates and the potential benefit when <b>scatter</b> estimation is based on attenuation maps including hardware components, we calculated and compared estimated <b>scatter</b> distributions corresponding to the uncorrected, xMLAA-, and CTAC-based attenuation maps. The impact of the different <b>scatter</b> estimates on PET quantification was also evaluated.|$|R

Five <b>scatter</b> correction methods were compared in this study where applicable: the dual-energy window (DEW) technique, the convolution-subtraction (CVS) method, two variants of the Monte Carlo-based <b>scatter</b> correction technique (MCBSC 1 and MCBSC 2) and our newly developed statistical reconstruction-based <b>scatter</b> correction (SRBSC) method.

40|$|<b>Scatter</b> {{correction}} {{is crucial}} to the quality of reconstructed images in x-ray cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Most of existing <b>scatter</b> correction methods assume smooth <b>scatter</b> distributions. The high-frequency <b>scatter</b> noise remains in the projection images even after a perfect <b>scatter</b> correction. In this paper, using a clinical CBCT system and a measurement-based <b>scatter</b> correction, the authors show that a <b>scatter</b> correction alone does not provide satisfactory image quality and the loss of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the <b>scatter</b> corrected image may overwrite the benefit of <b>scatter</b> removal. To circumvent the problem and truly gain from <b>scatter</b> correction, an effective <b>scatter</b> noise suppression method must be in place. They analyze the noise properties in the projections after <b>scatter</b> correction and propose to use a penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) algorithm to reduce the noise in the reconstructed images. Experimental results on an evaluation phantom (Catphan© 600) show that the proposed algorithm further reduces the reconstruction error in a <b>scatter</b> corrected image from 10. 6 % to 1. 7 % and increases the CNR by a factor of 3. 6. Significant image quality improvement is also shown in the results on an anthropomorphic phantom, in which the global noise level is reduced and the local streaking artifacts around bones are suppressed...|$|R
30|$|For {{comparison}} of the Monte Carlo-based <b>scatter</b> correction, reconstructions were also performed with a dual-energy window <b>scatter</b> correction [16] and without <b>scatter</b> correction. In the case of dual-energy window <b>scatter</b> correction, projections of the <b>scatter</b> window (20 % around 110  keV) were additionally simulated—again with Poisson noise added. These <b>scatter</b> projections were smoothed by a Gaussian filter of two pixels, added to the reconstruction loop and weighted with a k factor for the scaling of the difference of <b>scatter</b> in the photopeak window and the <b>scatter</b> window, which was evaluated at the clinically used value of k[*]=[*] 0.5 and an optimal value. This optimal k-value was first based on {{the ratio of the}} <b>scatter</b> in the photopeak and the <b>scatter</b> energy window and was then further tuned by additionally simulating more k-values both above and below this first estimate. The k-value resulting in the lowest mean squared error with the phantom over the entire liver was used as the optimal value. The recovery profiles of the different <b>scatter</b> corrections methods were measured to study their effect on tumor contrast.|$|R
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is a form}} of elastic scattering; {{the outgoing}} X-rays have the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic <b>scattering</b> occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher energy level. Such inelastic <b>scattering</b> reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of the outgoing beam. Inelastic <b>scattering</b> is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|Raman <b>scattering</b> {{is another}} {{phenomenon}} that involves inelastic <b>scattering</b> of light {{caused by the}} vibrational properties of matter. The detected range of frequency shifts and other effects are very different compared to Brillouin <b>scattering.</b> In Raman <b>scattering,</b> photons are scattered by the effect of vibrational and rotational transitions in the bonds between first-order neighboring atoms, while Brillouin <b>scattering</b> results from the <b>scattering</b> of photons caused by large scale, low-frequency phonons. The effects of the two phenomena provide very different information about the sample: Raman spectroscopy {{can be used to}} determine the transmitting medium's chemical composition and molecular structure, while Brillouin <b>scattering</b> can be used to measure the material's properties on a larger scale – such as its elastic behaviour. The frequency shifts from Brillouin <b>scattering,</b> a technique known as Brillouin Spectroscopy, are detected with an interferometer while Raman <b>scattering</b> uses either an interferometer or a dispersive (grating) spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|Refractive {{processes}} {{take place}} in the physical optics limit, where the wavelength of light is similar to other distances, as a kind of <b>scattering.</b> The simplest type of <b>scattering</b> is Thomson <b>scattering</b> which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected by single particles. In the limit of Thomson <b>scattering,</b> in which the wavelike nature of light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton <b>scattering</b> which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical process, involving the nature of light as particles. In a statistical sense, elastic <b>scattering</b> of light by numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light is a process known as Rayleigh <b>scattering</b> while the similar process for <b>scattering</b> by particles that are similar or larger in wavelength is known as Mie <b>scattering</b> with the Tyndall effect being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light <b>scattering</b> from atoms or molecules may undergo Raman <b>scattering,</b> wherein the frequency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules. Brillouin <b>scattering</b> occurs when the frequency of light changes due to local changes with time and movements of a dense material.|$|E
40|$|The <b>scattered</b> wave {{theory has}} built {{the basis of}} <b>scattered</b> wave imaging of the sunken pillar in coal field seismic exploration. When seismic waves meet with the <b>scatter</b> point underground, the waves {{propagate}} around and generate <b>scattered</b> waves.

Through the numerical modeling, we can receive the <b>scattered</b> waves from the steep dip interface of the sunken pillar in coal seam. After researching wave characteristic on common <b>scatter</b> point (CSP) gathers, we can recognize the <b>scattered</b> waves, and obtain the information of geologic structure underground, including the structure position and the outline of heterogeneous geologic body. Tested with field seismic data, the result of <b>scattered</b> wave imaging indicates that the equivalent offset method (EOM) can reasonably and accurately use the information of <b>scattered</b> waves, and the pre-stack time migration based on EOM is an effective method for the imaging of sunken pillars and inhomogeneous geologic bodies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to determine individual <b>scatter</b> kernels and to use them for <b>scatter</b> correction by integral transformation of the projections. Methods: Individual <b>scatter</b> components are fitted on the projections of a line source by monoexponentials. The position-dependent <b>scatter</b> parameters of each <b>scatter</b> component are then used to design non-station ary <b>scatter</b> correction kernels for each point in the projection. These kernels are used in a convolution-subtraction method which consecutively removes object, collimator and detector <b>scatter</b> from projections. This method is based on a model which assumes that image degradation results exclusively from Comp-ton interactions of annihilation photons, thus neglecting further Compton interactions of object <b>scatters</b> with collimator and de tector. Results: Subtraction of the object <b>scatter</b> component improved contrast typical of what is obtained with standard con volution-subtraction methods. The collimator <b>scatter</b> component is so weak that it can be safely combined with object <b>scatter</b> for correction. Subtraction of detector <b>scatter</b> from images did not improve contrast because statistical accuracy is degraded by removing counts from hot regions while cold regions (back ground) remain unchanged. Conclusion: Subtraction of object and collimator <b>scatter</b> improves contrast only. The slight gain in image sharpness resulting from the subtraction of detector scat ter does not justify removal of this component at the expense of sensitivity.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the <b>scatter</b> problem for foundational evidentialism. Reflection on the <b>scatter</b> problem uncovers significant epistemological lessons. The <b>scatter</b> problem is evaluated {{in connection with}} Ernest Sosa’s use of the problem as an argument against foundational evidentialism. Sosa’s strategy is to consider a strong intuition in favor of internalism—the new evil demon problem, and then illustrate how a foundational evidentialist account of the new evil demon problem succumbs to the <b>scatter</b> problem. The goal in {{this paper is to}} evaluate the force of the <b>scatter</b> problem. The main argument of the paper is that the <b>scatter</b> problem has mixed success. On the one hand, <b>scatter</b> undermines objectual evidentialism, an evidentialist theory that formulates principles of basic perceptual justification in terms of the objects (or properties) of perceptual states. On the other hand, the problem of <b>scatter</b> does not undermine content evidentialism, an evidentialist view that formulates its epistemic principles in terms of the assertive content of perceptual states. The significance of the <b>scatter</b> problem, especially in concert with the new evil demon problem, is that it provides an argument for content evidentialism. The problem of <b>scatter</b> is a significant and neglected epistemological problem. Ernest Sosa has done the most in developing the <b>scatter</b> problem.
