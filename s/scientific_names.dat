5|$|Characters and {{elements}} from the series have inspired <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> of several organisms, including the dinosaur Dracorex hogwartsia, the spider Eriovixia gryffindori, the wasp Ampulex dementor, and the crab Harryplax severus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of taxonomy, over 80 taxa (genera and species) have been given <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> honouring, or {{deriving}} from, characters or other fictional elements from The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and other works set in Middle-earth.|$|E
5|$|The wood warblers are a {{group of}} small, often {{colorful}} passerine birds restricted to the New World. Most are arboreal, but some are more terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores. In August 2011, the North American Committee of the AOU changed their classification {{of many of the}} wood warblers. Since this list is based on the AOU classification, changes to <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> are updated here. Since many other taxonomic committees have yet to rule on these changes (including the South American Committee of the AOU) or have ruled in other ways, species pages remain with their original <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> until more of a consensus is achieved.|$|E
50|$|In {{scientific}} nomenclature, {{a synonym}} is a <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> {{that applies to}} a taxon that (now) goes by a different <b>scientific</b> <b>name,</b> although the term is used somewhat differently in the zoological code of nomenclature. For example, Linnaeus {{was the first to}} give a <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> (under the currently used system of scientific nomenclature) to the Norway spruce, which he called Pinus abies. This name is no longer in use: it is now a synonym of the current <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> which is Picea abies.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of {{the species}} derives from Latin: septentrionalis means [...] "northern". Latin obtusirostris means [...] "blunt-nosed". Despite the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> P. septentrionalis obtusirostris {{translating}} to [...] "blunt-nosed northern great skink", it is a southern subspecies.|$|R
5|$|In 1758, Linnaeus {{described}} the tiger {{in his work}} Systema Naturae and gave it the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Felis tigris. In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus Panthera using the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Panthera tigris.|$|R
5|$|This black, {{white and}} pink bird is quite unmistakable, {{especially}} in its erratic flight, {{which is like}} that of a giant butterfly. It is the only member of its family. The song is a trisyllabic oop-oop-oop, which gives rise to its English and <b>scientific</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E
5|$|This list's taxonomic {{treatment}} (designation {{and sequence}} of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and <b>scientific</b> <b>names)</b> follow {{the conventions of}} The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. All of the birds below {{are included in the}} total bird count for Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all modern}} paleontologists agreed with Riggs {{that the two}} dinosaurs should be {{classified}} together in a single genus. According {{to the rules of}} the ICZN (which governs the <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> of animals), the name Apatosaurus, having been published first, has priority as the official name; Brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that A.ajax and A.excelsus were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} moon snail, <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Euspira heros (previously {{known by}} the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Lunatia heros), is a species of large sea snail, a predatory marine gastropod mollusk in the family Naticidae, the moon snails (U.S.) or necklace snails (U.K.).|$|R
50|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> for the Western Sand Darter is Ammocrypta clara. “Ammoncrypta” means {{concealed}} in sand while “clara” means clear. The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> {{is indicative of}} the Darter’s tendency to bury itself in sand, while “clara” alludes to its translucent flesh.|$|R
5000|$|The genus' <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> {{references}} {{the type}} locality: it {{is derived from}} Ancient Greek tympanon (drum) + nesiotes (islander). The specific name honors the famous ornithologist Alexander Wetmore; thus the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> means roughly [...] "Alexander Wetmore's Drum Island bird".|$|R
5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the <b>scientific</b> <b>names,</b> such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{taxonomy}} and classification {{became the}} focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> for all his species. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin.|$|E
5|$|Several metamorphosing insects' <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> {{reference}} the myth. Myrrha is a genus of ladybug beetles, {{such as the}} 18-spot ladybird (Myrrha octodecimguttata) Libythea myrrha, {{the club}} beak, is a butterfly native to India. Cupido myrrha is a rare species of butterfly named by Herrich-Schäffer found on Mount Erciyes in south-eastern Turkey. Catocala myrrha is a synonym for a species of moth known as married underwing. In total the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum lists eight Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) with the myrrha name.|$|E
50|$|Both the lichen and {{the fungus}} partner bear the same <b>scientific</b> <b>name,</b> and the lichens are being {{integrated}} into the classification schemes for fungi. The alga bears its own <b>scientific</b> <b>name,</b> which bears no relationship {{to that of the}} lichen or fungi.|$|R
50|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of the species, Machimus cowini (Hobby, 1946), {{comes from}} the {{entomologist}} who discovered the species, W. S. Cowin. The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of the species was once Epitriptus cowini; however, it was renamed Machimus cowini after being placed in the genus Machimus.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Rhapidophyllum means [...] "needle-leaf", while hystrix is {{from the}} <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> of a genus of porcupines. The English name {{likewise}} refers to the needle-like spines produced at the petiole bases; for similar reasons, it is also occasionally called [...] "porcupine palm".|$|R
5|$|Six states chose {{reptiles}} {{named after}} the state. In common names, Arizona and Texas were represented by the Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake and Texas horned lizard. Mississippi and North Carolina appeared in scientific names: Alligator mississippiensis and Terrapene carolina carolina. Alabama and New Mexico appeared in both common names (Alabama red-bellied turtle and New Mexico whiptail lizard) and <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> (Pseudemys alabamensis and Cnemidophorus neomexicanus).|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} known living ctenophore species is uncertain, {{since many of}} those named and {{formally}} described {{have turned out to}} be identical to species known under other <b>scientific</b> <b>names.</b> Claudia Mills estimates that there about 100 to 150 valid species that are not duplicates, and that at least another 25, mostly deep-sea forms, have been recognized as distinct but not yet analyzed in enough detail to support a formal description and naming.|$|E
5|$|There is no unique {{generally}} accepted {{system at the}} higher taxonomic levels and there are frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature. Fungal species can also have multiple <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> depending on their life cycle and mode (sexual or asexual) of reproduction. Web sites such as Index Fungorum and ITIS list current names of fungal species (with cross-references to older synonyms).|$|E

Introduced, stray and extirpated species are included in the total species counts for Vieques.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact reflected by their <b>scientific</b> <b>names.</b> A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle. A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet {{at the back of the}} squid.|$|E
5|$|Mycena arcangeliana (commonly {{known as}} the angel's bonnet or the late-season bonnet) is a species of Mycenaceae fungus. It has been known {{by a number of}} <b>scientific</b> <b>names,</b> and its {{taxonomy}} is still somewhat disputed. It produces small mushrooms with caps varying in colour from whitish to a darker grey-brown, and stems of an olive-greyish that fade with age. The mushrooms can be mistaken for the similar Mycena flavescens. They have a mild taste, but a strong smell of iodoform; they are not edible. The species grows on dead wood in autumn months, and can be found throughout Europe.|$|E

50|$|The {{common name}} honours Charles Sturt, who {{recorded}} seeing {{large quantities of}} the flowers while exploring central Australia in 1844; the second version of the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> honours the naturalist Isaac Swainson, and the third (rejected) version of the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> was intended to honour the explorer William Dampier.|$|R
5|$|Systematizing, naming and {{classifying}} dominated {{natural history}} {{throughout much of}} the 17th and 18th centuries. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> for all his species. While Linnaeus conceived of species as unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy, the other great naturalist of the 18th century, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his work would influence the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and <b>scientific</b> <b>names.</b> Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running {{from the back of}} its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Pablo Jayat {{and colleagues}} {{reviewed}} {{the members of}} the Akodon boliviensis species group, including A.spegazzinii, in Argentina. They could not find clear differentiation in either morphological or molecular characters between animals belonging to A.alterus, A.leucolimnaeus, A.spegazzinii, and A.tucumanensis, and consequently concluded that they all represent a single species. Although genetic variation is relatively high within A.spegazzinii, there is no clear geographic structure among haplotypes from different regions. The next year, Ulyses Pardiñas and colleagues concluded that A.oenos, which had formerly, and incorrectly, been placed in the A.varius species group, was in fact another synonym of A.spegazzinii. The proliferation of <b>scientific</b> <b>names</b> for this one species occurred because of the terseness of the original description of A.spegazzinii, and a lack of large samples and of appreciation of the substantial variation occurring within A.spegazzinii.|$|E
50|$|Blumenbach shortly {{afterward}} wrote a manual {{of natural history}} entitled Handbuch der Naturgeschichte; 12 editions and some translations. It was published first in Göttingen by J. C. Dieterich in 1779/1780. He {{was also one of}} the first scientists to study the anatomy of the platypus, assigning the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> Ornithorhynchus paradoxus to the animal, being unaware George Shaw had already given it the name Platypus anatinus. However, Platypus had already been shown to be used for the <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> for a genus of Ambrosia beetles so Blumenbach's <b>scientific</b> <b>name</b> for the genus was used.|$|R
