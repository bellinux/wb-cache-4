50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>cyclamate</b> (sweetener code 952) is an {{artificial}} sweetener.

5000|$|The highest profile {{issue that}} Ley {{had to confront}} was <b>sodium</b> <b>cyclamate.</b> An {{artificial}} sweetener, it was originally brought to market as a flavoring ingredient in drugs, but in 1958, it was designated GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) and its uses expanded, first into table sugars, then into many foods. By 1969 there were $1 billion in annual sales of cyclamate. However, by that time some animal studies had shown that very high doses of cyclamates, at levels of humans ingesting 350 cans of diet soda per day, led to higher rates of bladder cancer in rats. [...] Amidst {{the growth of the}} environmental movement and its concern with chemicals, pressure mounted on the government to restrict the use of cyclamate. In October 1969, Department of Health, Education & Welfare Secretary Robert Finch bypassed Ley and the FDA, and removed the GRAS designation from cyclamate, banning its use in general purpose foods but keeping it available for restricted use in dietary products with additional labeling. In October 1970, a year after Ley left, the FDA banned cyclamate completely from all food and drug products in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Rat bladder {{epithelial}} cell transformation {{was found to}} in-volve at least three distinct phenotypic stages in vitro. The effects on this process of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), sodium saccharin, <b>sodium</b> <b>cyclamate</b> and 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) alone or in combination were investigated. MNU was a potent inducer of proliferating pre-neoplastk epithelial foci. Sodium saccharin alone induced a transient hyperpiastic response of the cultured urothetium but did not induce significantly more foci than in controls, though a late toxic effect of saccharin may have masked focus induc-tion. In combination with a single dose of 250 /ig/ml MNU, sodium saccharin did not increase focus incidence compared with MNU treatment alone but following a single treatment with 25 /ig/ml MNU which alone induced no foci, saccharin induced {{a significant number of}} foci indicating a promoting effect under these conditions. <b>Sodium</b> <b>cyclamate</b> alone induced a marked and prolonged epithelial hyperplasia and a signifi-cant increase in focus incidence above controls and above MNU-treated cultures.

Rapidly-proliferating cell lines were established from nine foci induc-ed by treatment with MNU alone or MNU + saccharin. Four of these were tumorigenic.

Results The method showed a good linearity for all the analysts over the range of 10 ~ 600 μg/L with r≥ 0. 995. The detection limits of <b>sodium</b> <b>cyclamate,</b> saccharin sodium and acesulfame were 0. 8, 5. 0 μg/kg and 1. 0 μg/kg, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Two-bottle {{preference}} {{tests have}} often been used to make inferences about gustatory thresholds. The validity of such inferences depends {{on the extent to}} which taste differences produce differential fluid consumptions from the bottles. If equal amounts are consumed despite perceived gustatory dissimilarity, inaccurate threshold estimates result. Modifications of common preference-test procedures, interacting with tastant properties and genetic variation, disclosed instances of such non-discrimination among inbred strains of mice. With an hedonically neutral to mildly unpalatable tastant (<b>sodium</b> <b>cyclamate),</b> taste-aversion conditioning yielded lower thresholds. With a palatable tastant (maltose), testing without prior conditioning usually indicated lower thresholds. Descending concentration series produced lower thresholds than ascending concentration series, for both palatable (sucrose) and neutral (cyclamate) tastants. Previous experience with the tastants elevated preference scores, yielding lower thresholds with palatable tastants (sucrose, maltose) and higher thresholds with an unpalatable tastant (sucrose octaacetate). Within-strain discrepancies between thresholds indicated by the different methods were often large (2 — 3 log molar concentration steps). Among-strain differences of comparable magnitude, both in preferences and threshold estimates, were found for sucrose, maltose and cyclamate...|$|E

This system is composed of EBV-nonproducer Raji cells as the indicator, n-butyrate as the EBV-inducer and the test substance. None of eight known bladder carcinogens (2 -naphthylamine, 2 -acetylaminofluorene, N-butyl-N-(4 -hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine, N-butyl-N-(3 -carboxypropyl) nitrosamine, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, N-[4 -(5 -nitro- 2 -furyl) - 2 -thiazolyl] formamide, benzidine, cyclophosphamide) or five promoters (sodium saccharin, <b>sodium</b> <b>cyclamate,</b> urea, allopurinol, DL-tryptophan) were detected by this system. Normal urine from 20 rats did not activate the EBV genome. Neither the 0. 45 micron membrane filtrates nor ether extracts of urine obtained from rats given one of 4 bladder carcinogens, 4 promoters or phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate reacted with this system, whereas those from rats given either vincristine or vinblastine did, although their activity for promoting bladder carcinogenesis is not known. Urine samples from 42 patients with bladder cancers, when tested as filtrates, ether extracts or XAD- 2 resin adsorbates, did not activate EBV expression. These results suggest that EBV-activating substances contribute little to promotion of bladder carcinogenesis and that this test might not be applicable for screening of tumor promoters in urine...|$|E
40|$|The broad {{spectrum}} of negative effects of food additives and surfactants on living organisms and the environment in general indicate a necessity of a detailed study on this issue. The aim {{of this article is}} to evaluate the impact of food additives and surfactants in a concentration of 350 mg/kg of fodder on the body weight of third age Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, 1758 (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) larvae. A significant change in the body weight of T. molitor larvae was observed when they consumed a diet containing 350 mg/kg of sodium glutamate, <b>sodium</b> <b>cyclamate</b> and sodium benzoate. We observed a tendency towards increase in body weight after addition of the food colouring Allura Red, saccharin, benzoic acid, betaine, emulsifying wax, AOS and SLES, and also we observed a decrease in body weight after addition of Tartrazine and Indigo Carmine in the same concentration. Out of the 18 tested food additives, 3  significantly stimulated an increase in the body weight of third age T. molitor larvae, and 3 manifested the same effect at the level of tendency (stimulated an increase in mass on average by 43 – 58 % over the 14 -day experiment), and 2  caused decrease in the body weight of larvae. Also, the 4 studied surfactants manifested a tendency towards increase in the body weight of T. molitor. This study on the impact of food additives and surfactants on organisms of insects is of great significance for protecting rare species of insects...|$|E
