The An, clusters were produced in a laser vaporization source and deposited with low kinetic energy (similar to 0. 4 eV/atom) on atomically flat substrates (graphite, mica, and gold and silver films <b>on</b> <b>mica)</b> under UHV conditions. Their size distribution is probed with time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ranges from dimers to several hundreds of atoms. Scanning probe microscopy is used to characterize the deposited clusters and the formation of islands by cluster aggregation.

The shape and size of the island configurations are strongly system dependent. Gold clusters deposited on Au(111) and Ag(111) films grown <b>on</b> <b>mica</b> do not aggregate, but deform due to strong cluster-substrate interactions.

30|$|In this framework, {{the study}} of the surface {{morphology}} of Au deposited <b>on</b> <b>mica</b> is crucial [18 – 39] in view of the fabrication of flat Au films for applications in biological, electronic, optical devices and techniques (i.e. surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy). Mica is a suitable support for crystalline Au deposition because the small mismatch of the crystal lattice allows the Au to grow in large atomically flat areas. The understanding of the kinetic growth mechanisms of Au <b>on</b> <b>mica</b> allows to tune the process parameters (substrate temperature, pressure, rate deposition, film thickness) to obtain ultra-flat Au film as suitable platform for anchoring self-assembling monolayers (due to Au affinity to thiol groups of organic molecules), molecules, nanotubes, nanoparticles and so on. Atomically flat Au substrates are ideal for imaging adsorbate layers using scanning probe microscopy techniques. For these characterization methods, flat substrates are essential to distinguish the adsorbed layer from the substrate features. Obviously, the control of the kinetic growth mechanisms of Au <b>on</b> <b>mica</b> is a prerequisite for control of the film nano- and micro-structure to obtain materials with desired morphological properties. The main literature concerns Au film <b>on</b> <b>mica</b> produced by ultra-high-vacuum evaporation [18 – 25, 29 – 34, 37 – 39]. Very few works regard sputtered Au films <b>on</b> <b>mica</b> [22, 26 – 28] and the general deposition criteria deduced for the evaporation technique do not necessarily apply to other methods. The sputtering method is simpler than vacuum evaporation both for instrumentation and deposition procedure; with the deposition parameters properly chosen, the sputtered films exhibit superior surface planarity, even flatter than the smoothest evaporated films reported to date [28].|$|R
