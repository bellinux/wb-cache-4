The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the teat end health and <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance of two experimental heptanoic acid based teat dips vs the commercial product Remain Gold ® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic acid teat dips KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar teat end health and teat <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in teat end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported teat skin studies rely on comparing teat dips in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage. This study illustrates the high risk of traditional design skin toleration studies inaccurately attributing effects to teat dips...|$|R

40|$|A {{coarse-grained}} lattice gas {{model is}} developed to study pattern forming processes in drying drops containing surfactant. By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the model, the coupled dynamics of surfactant and liquid evaporation {{and the resulting}} oscillatory dynamics at the contact line are elucidated. We show that the coupled drop dynamics and the resulting final deposition patterns can be altered by adsorption kinetics. For slow adsorption rates, surfactant molecules recirculate along with colloidal particles and the area covered by the surfactant on the surface grows from the contact line as the initial concentration of the surfactant increases. This leads to coffee-ring patterns with wide rim areas upon drying or to multi-ring patterns depending on the surfactant concentration. For fast adsorption rates, a <b>surfactant</b> <b>skin</b> covers the entire surface area during the early phase of evaporation.

Polysaccharides can exhibit complex structure and various functional activities. These bio macromolecules can therefore serve as raw materials for various different materials, e. g. rayon, cellulose acetate, celluloid and nitrocellulose; and they find multiple applications, for instance as surgical threads (chitin), as sources of energy, dietary fibers, as blood flow adjuvants, in cosmetics, emulsion stabilizers, film formers, binders, viscosity increasing agents or <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> agenta, as food additives in gums, chewing gum bases and as vaccines. Polysaccharides form the basis for useful products, like xanthan gum, dextran, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum and pullulan.

40|$|Surfactants {{frequently}} come {{in contact}} with the skin in the form of personal care products, where they are used to improve the wetting and oil solubilizing qualities of the products. Surfactants are also known to induce skin irritation by damaging the barrier properties of the stratum corneum, the outer layer of the skin, and denaturing proteins in the epidermis and the dermis. The goal of this thesis has been to understand the relationship between the physicochemical properties of surfactant solutions and their skin irritation potential. In vitro tests were developed to measure: (1) the effect of surfactants on the barrier properties of the skin, (2) the concentration of <b>surfactant</b> in the <b>skin,</b> and (3) surfactant-induced protein denaturation, all of which can be related to skin irritation. The physicochemical properties of the surfactant solution, specifically, the concentration of the surfactant monomers (unmicellized surfactant), the composition of the surfactant monomers, and {{the size and shape of}} the surfactant micelles, were related to the results of these tests. An in vitro skin irritation test was developed that measures the electrical conductivity of pig skin to quantify the reduction in the barrier properties of the skin, or the skin damage, induced by <b>surfactant</b> solutions. <b>Skin</b> conductivity was found to be directly related to the transdermal water permeability, directly relating the skin conductivity to in vitro skin irritation. Skin conductivity was used to measure the in vitro skin irritation potential of mixtures of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the nonionic surfactant dodecyl hexa(ethylene oxide) (C 12 E 6), and a relationship was observed between the surfactant monomer concentration and(cont.) the skin conductivity. The in vitro skin irritation test correctly ranked the in vivo irritation potential of three mild commercial soap bars-Dove, Lever 200, and Ivory. In order to understand the relationship between the micelle concentration and the surfactant-induced damage to the skin, a method was developed to measure the penetration of 14 C-radiolabeled SDS <b>surfactant</b> into pig <b>skin.</b> It was found that both monomeric and micellar SDS are able to penetrate into the skin, and that the contribution of the micellar SDS to the concentration of SDS in the skin is comparable to the contribution of the monomeric SDS. SDS penetration into the skin was also measured in the presence of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), which forms PEO-bound SDS micelles, and C 12 E 6, which forms SDS/C 12 E 6 mixed micelles. In mixtures of PEO-bound and free SDS micelles, the PEO-bound SDS micelles were found not to penetrate into the skin while the free SDS micelles were found to penetrate. Mixing SDS with C 12 E 6 led to a reduction in the penetration of SDS into the skin by reducing the SDS monomer concentration, as well as by reducing, or preventing altogether, the penetration of micellar SDS. The hydrodynamic radii of the free SDS micelles (21 A), the PEO-bound SDS micelles (25 A), and the SDS-C 12 E 6 mixed micelles (24 - 30 A) were measured using dynamic light scattering. Based on these results, a new model of surfactant penetration into the skin was proposed, in which the penetration of micellar <b>surfactant</b> into the <b>skin</b> is limited by the size of the micelles [...] . by Peter Nathaniel Moore.

The no-shock group received the same training and testing in all phases, except no stimuli were ever paired with shock. The data indicated that <b>skin</b> conductance response <b>conditioning</b> did not occur for the shock groups or for the no-shock group. Tests showed transfer of the established discriminative functions, however, only for the shock groups, indicating the formation of two stimulus classes only for those participants who received respondent class training.

50|$|The {{various members}} of this family are able to secrete {{cationic}} <b>surfactants</b> through their <b>skin</b> which {{can act as a}} chemical defense mechanism.

40|$|In {{the current}} review article it is {{suggested}} that fear is a central emotional state that can be activated by external threat cues. The subcortical defensive system cannot only be activated by intrinsically aversive events but shows also strong plasticity enabling previously innocuous stimuli to get access to the fear system after they were paired with painful outcomes. On the other hand, aversive conditioning does not only result in the acquisition of a defensive disposition, the organism also learns on a pure cognitive level that one stimulus predicts the occurrence of another stimulus. It is suggested here that potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex is a rather specific measure for fear acquisition, while skin conductance discrimination indexes contingency learning. It is shown that the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle does not require cortical processing of the conditioned stimulus. Moreover, data indicate that conditioned startle potentiation is abolished in patients with unilateral lesions of the amygdala. Finally, conditioned startle potentiation can be obtained without contingency awareness, which on the other hand is necessary for <b>skin</b> conductance <b>conditioning</b> to occur.

During the interaction, the amount of bound surfactant (Qt) and the swelling degree of collagen fibres (αm) were determined. It was confirmed, that the effect of <b>surfactant</b> on <b>skin</b> depends on pH value. At pH = 6 large amount of anionic surfactant SDS was bound to collagen (Qt = 1, 6 mmol/g), whereas no binding was observed with nonionic surfactant Ig. Using a mixture of both surfactants, the amount of surfactants bound was only 0, 3 mmol/g. Addition of nonionic surfactant did not lead to a reduction of SDS detergent efficacy, but caused a significant decrease in SDS irritation potential as demonstrated by determination of the swelling degree. Presence of nonionic surfactants in the mixture decreased collagen swelling and therefore improved barrier function of skin.

40|$|To gain a more {{fundamental}} understanding of the frictional properties of skin, various parameters (hydration, oils, <b>surfactants,</b> etc) affecting <b>skin</b> friction were evaluated using a rotational friction technique. The rotational device utilized a motor-driven wheel. The wheel and drive shaft were connected to the motor through a flexible rubber coupling {{in such a way}} that friction encountered by the wheel caused a lateral displacement of the drive shaft which was monitored by a photocell and recorded on a strip-chart recorder. Our observations suggest that separate frictional events occur when materials are applied to the skin surface. Thus, the increase in friction observed upon wetting the skin involves two distinct phenomena—one is related to the surface tension of the aqueous phase, while the other, closely associated with hydration, is a consequence of physicochemical adhesion of the skin to the rotational friction probe...|$|R
40|$|Objective(s) :The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find a stable microemulsion vehicle for transdermal delivery of ibuprofen to improve the skin permeability. Materials and Methods: Microemulsion was prepared using different sorts of oils, surfactants and co-surfactants. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were used to evaluate the microemulsion domain. The effects of oleic acid and <b>surfactant</b> mixture on <b>skin</b> permeation of ibuprofen were evaluated with excised skins. Results: The optimum formulation F 3 consisting of 6 % oleic acid, 30 % Cremophor RH 40 /Transcutol P (2 : 1, w/w) and 59 % water phase, showed a high permeation rate of 42. 98 μg/cm 2 /hr. The mean droplet size of microemulsion was about 43 nm and no skin irritation signs were observed on the skin of rabbits. Conclusion: These results indicated that this novel microemulsion is a useful formulation for the transdermal delivery of ibuprofen...|$|R
40|$|Article {{accepted}} on 8 / 3 / 2006 Thanks to {{the recently}} introduced silicone image sensor technology, skin capacitance imaging {{has now been}} made possible. The dedicated device is called SkinChip®. This method is easy to handle and provides infor-mation about the skin microrelief, the level of stratum corneum hydra-tion and the sweat gland activity. The apparatus sees and measures these parameters with a 50 lm resolution. A series of conditions have been explored using skin capacitance imaging. This review summarizes rel-evant findings about regional variability on the body, changes occurring with ageing, effects of a hydrating formulation, reactivity kinetics of corneocytes to <b>surfactants,</b> acne and <b>skin</b> pores characteristics, as well as hyperkeratotic dermatoses and tumours. Key words: microrelief, hydration, capacitance, stratum corneum S ince the mid eighties, several imaging methods havebeen developed for non invasively studying the skinin health and disease.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis represents a significant advancement in the current mechanistic understanding of low-frequency ultrasound-mediated transdermal drug delivery. Specifically, while prior {{research has focused on}} a more general understanding of the mechanisms associated with low-frequency sonophoresis (LFS), this thesis directly investigates the mechanisms associated with phenomena that occur due to LFS skin treatment. These include a deeper understanding of: i) the reasons for heterogeneous perturbation of skin treated with LFS, ii) the physical mechanism that causes synergism between LFS and chemical penetration enhancers (CPEs), iii) the interactions between traditional and non-traditional <b>surfactants</b> in LFS <b>skin</b> treatments, and iv) the effects of LFS and LFS/CPEs on skin structural perturbation. In the first study of this thesis, the intrinsic properties and formation mechanisms of localized-transport regions (LTRs), and the surrounding less-perturbed non-LTRs, of low-frequency sonophoresis-treated skin are investigated. By independently analyzing LTR, non-LTR, and total skin samples treated at multiple LFS frequencies, {{it was found that the}} pore radii (rpore) within non-LTRs are frequency-independent, ranging from 18. 2 - 18. 5 A, but significantl...|$|R
