50|$|Research {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that there is a correlation between drinking sugar-sweetened beverages and gaining weight or becoming obese. Sugar-sweetened beverages do not provide the feeling of fullness like solid foods do, which may cause one to consume more of the beverage. According the Center for Disease Control, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey found that 30.1% of American adults consume at least one <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverage</b> daily. Around the United States, <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverage</b> intake differs based on geographic regions and socio-demographic characteristics. States known for their obesity rates also had high consumption rates of sugar-sweetened beverages. For example, 47.1% of Mississippi adults consume at least one <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverage</b> a day. Their obesity rate correlates, with 35.6% of the adult population being obese in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{to reduce}} {{consumption}} of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> and obesity include both monetary penalties and limiting exposure to <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages.</b> For example, numerous states, including Vermont have proposed taxing <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> or increasing the prices to reduce consumption. Economists estimate that increasing sugar sweetened beverage prices by 10% would reduce sugar sweetened beverage consumption by 12%. Other solutions target children, focusing on prohibiting <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> on school/after care property, including vending machines and lunches. Limits {{are also being}} considered on <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> in the workplace.

50|$|Dietary {{improvements}} in expecting mothers {{are important for}} the future health of the mother and child. <b>Sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> among other beverages like coffee and alcohol are recommended to be reduced in intake. A Norwegian study, showed that pregnant woman minimized their intake of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages,</b> alcohol, and coffee, when educated about the negative effects these beverages can have on their unborn child. The statistics for each beverage showed that among alcohol, coffee, and <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages,</b> <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> were still consumed more despite there being a minimized intake. The minimized intake of coffee and alcohol {{is due to the}} less harmful effects <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> have compared to coffee and alcohol.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify changes in the affordability of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages,</b> a product implicated as a contributor to rising rates of obesity worldwide, as a function of product price and personal income. MethodsWe used international survey data in a retrospective analysis of 40 high-income and 42 low-income and middle-income countries from 1990 to 2016. Prices of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> were from the Economist Intelligence Unit 2 ̆ 019 s World Cost of Living Survey. Income and inflation data were from the International Monetary Fund 2 ̆ 019 s World Economic Outlook Database. The measure of affordability was the average annual percentage change in the relative-income price of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages,</b> which is the annual rate of change in the proportion of per capita gross domestic product needed to purchase 100 L of Coca-Cola in each country in each year of the study. ResultsIn 79 of 82 countries, the proportion of income needed to purchase <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> declined on average (using annual measures) during the study period. This pattern, described as an increase in the affordability of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages,</b> indicated that <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> became more affordable more rapidly in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries, a fact largely attributable to the higher rate of income growth in those countries than to a decline in the real price of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages.</b> ConclusionWithout deliberate policy action to raise prices, <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> are likely to become more affordable and more widely consumed around the world. 28472607 PMC 542044...|$|R

RESULTS: Overall, 24 % of children appeared to be genuinely capable of distinguishing between non-nutritively sweetened and <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages.</b> The mean ± SD score for how much the children liked the non-nutritively sweetened beverages was 3. 39 ± 0. 7 and that for the <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> 3. 39 ± 0. 6 (P = 0. 9) on a scale running from 1 (disgusting) to 5 (delicious).

40|$|Adverse health {{consequences}} of consuming <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> are frequently cited {{as an example}} of market failure, justifying government intervention in the marketplace, usually in the form of taxation. However, declining sales of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> in Australia and a corresponding increase in sales of drinks containing non-nutritive sweeteners, in the absence of significant government regulation, appear to reflect market forces at work. If so, the public health challenge in relation to <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> may have less to do with regulating the market and more to do with harnessing it. Contrary to assertions that consumers fail to appreciate the links between their choice of beverage and its {{health consequences}}, the health conscious consumer appears to be driving the changes taking place in the beverage market.

50|$|Existing {{evidence}} from large-scale cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies supports that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is {{correlated with the}} childhood and adult obesity epidemic in the United States population (Malik et al. 2006). Sweetened drinks containing either sucrose alone or sucrose in combination with fructose appear to lead to weight gain due to increase energy intake. Fructose might also be preferentially metabolized into fat as feedback inhibition as with glucose is missing. In fact, about half of total added sugar consumed in the United States is in liquid form. Teenage boys showed the greatest consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, upwards of 357 calories per day. In addition to the evidence that humans have a natural propensity towards sugar, there exists additional biological plausibility that explains the correlation of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverage</b> consumption and obesity.|$|E

40|$|Background: Individual {{variations}} in child weight {{can be explained}} by genetic and behavioural susceptibility to obesity. Behavioural susceptibility can be expressed in appetite-related traits, e. g. food responsiveness. Research into such behavioural factors is important, as it can provide starting points for (preventive) interventions. Objectives: To examine associations of children’s appetitive traits with weight and with fruit, snack and <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverage</b> intake, and to examine whether parenting style interacts with appetite in determining child weight/intake. Methods: Data were used from 1275 children participating in the INPACT study in 2009 – 2010, {{with a mean age of}} 9 years in 2009. Their height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). Parents completed a questionnaire to measure children’s appetitive traits, children’s dietary intake and parenting style.

Methods: A cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling method was conducted. Data were collected using an online questionnaire from 8 / 24 / 2015 to 10 / 8 / 2015. Subjects were male and female vegetarians aged > 16 years. Using a food frequency questionnaire, we assessed the weekly consumption of ultra-processed food and <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> and described the frequency of daily consumption overall and according to type of vegetarianism. The association between overweight and excessive daily intake of ultra-processed food was analyzed by multiple logistic regression (OR [95 CI%]). Results: Information was retrieved from 503 individuals (29. 8 ± 8. 5 years old); 83. 7 % were women. The most frequent types of vegetarianism in our sample were ovo-lacto (45. 5 %) and vegan (41. 7 %), and the median time of vegetarianism was 5. 3 years. The consumption of <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> (≥ 2 x/day) and ultra-processed food (≥ 3 x/day) was 21. 0 % and 16. 0 %, respectively, and regarding the different vegetarianism types, vegans showed the lowest frequency of excessive daily <b>sugar-sweetened</b> <b>beverages</b> and ultra-processed food consumption. In the multivariable analysis, consumption of ultra-processed food ≥ 3 x/day (2. 33 [1. 36 - 4. 03]), male sex (1. 73 [1. 01 - 2. 96]), age ≥ 35 years (2. 03 [1. 23 - 3. 36]) and not preparing one’s food (1. 67 [0. 95 - 2. 94]) were independently associated with overweight.
