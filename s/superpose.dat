5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to <b>superpose</b> the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E
5|$|Topologically, the Pythagorean tiling has {{the same}} {{structure}} as the truncated square tiling by squares and regular octagons. The smaller squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to four larger tiles, as are the squares in the truncated square tiling, while the larger squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to eight neighbors that alternate between large and small, just as the octagons in the truncated square tiling. However, the two tilings have different sets of symmetries, because the truncated square tiling is symmetric under mirror reflections whereas the Pythagorean tiling isn't. Mathematically, this {{can be explained by}} saying that the truncated square tiling has dihedral symmetry around the center of each tile, while the Pythagorean tiling has a smaller cyclic set of symmetries around the corresponding points, giving it p4 symmetry. It is a chiral pattern, meaning {{that it is impossible to}} <b>superpose</b> it on top of its mirror image using only translations and rotations.|$|E
25|$|Age {{relations}} among structural features are not readily apparent. In the Bach region, the youngest craters cut by a scarp are of c4 age; the oldest crater to <b>superpose</b> a scarp is a c3. These relations suggest that scarp formation occurred in c3 to c4 time. Very smooth plains material flanks some scarps and ridges and, if {{the material is}} ponded extrusives or mass-wasted products, may postdate the structures. Scarps and ridges are abundant in intercrater, intermediate, and smooth plains units, {{but they are not}} embayed by intermediate and intercrater plains materials. These relations suggest that the structures began to form after emplacement of these two oldest plains units. Some of the oldest craters and basins, such as Cervantes, have polygonal shapes at least as marked as more recent craters, suggesting that some structural lineaments are older than c1 craters.|$|E
30|$|However, {{applying}} FEC metric masking {{requires the}} information of <b>superposed</b> band in advance. Therefore, the <b>superposed</b> band detection techniques are proposed under <b>superposed</b> multicarrier transmission in [2 - 4]. A <b>superposed</b> band detection technique is proposed in [2] where the <b>superposed</b> band is detected by searching the FEC metric masking position that minimizes the packet error rate (PER). This scheme can detect the <b>superposed</b> band but requires a large computational complexity, because the receiver needs to perform turbo decoding several times. In [3], <b>superposed</b> band is detected based on residual power calculated by subtracting replica signals from received ones. Since the received signals on <b>superposed</b> band {{are affected by}} interference, the residual power on the <b>superposed</b> band is larger than that of on non-superposed band. By exploiting the difference of residual power between <b>superposed</b> and non-superposed bands, <b>superposed</b> bands are detected. This scheme can reduce computational complexity compared to [2], because it requires decoding only once.|$|R

The experiments are conducted using a tubular specimen of type {{304 stainless steel}} at room temperature. The specimen was subjected to cyclic shear straining under the axial <b>superposed</b> stress.

Moreover, even under the zero <b>superposed</b> stress, biaxial ratcheting strain occurred in the axial direction due to the cyclic shearing straining.

30|$|<b>Superposed</b> {{multicarrier}} {{transmission is}} one of the schemes that achieve efficient use of frequency resources. In the scheme, desired signals are interfered by other systems sharing the same frequency band, which causes unreliable LLR (log-likelihood ratio) setting and leads to degradation of the BER (bit error rate) performance. In many conventional schemes for OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) systems, the interference power for each subcarrier is estimated independently. Otherwise, {{based on the assumption that}} interferences have the same average power, one interference power is estimated and applied to all subcarriers. However, when there exist multiple wideband interferences with different average power, it is better to detect each interference and estimate each power based on all subcarriers within each <b>superposed</b> band to make it accurate. In this paper, we propose a scheme to suppress multiple wideband interferences based on the probability with which each subcarrier is <b>superposed,</b> referred to as the superposition probability.

30|$|<b>Superposed</b> {{multicarrier}} transmission {{scheme is}} known to improve frequency utilization efficiency when several wireless systems share the same spectrum. To suppress the effect of interference, forward error correction (FEC) metric masking is proposed. In this technique, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) that corresponds to the <b>superposed</b> band is set to zero, because received bits that correspond to the <b>superposed</b> band are unreliable. However, to apply FEC metric masking, the information about <b>superposed</b> band must be known at the receiver beforehand.

We use the estimated power of the undesired signal to calculate the LLR that takes the channel estimation error into account, since including this extra information about the channel improves the bit error rate (BER). The proposed scheme estimates the power of undesired signal on each subcarrier, and thus, the information about <b>superposed</b> band is not required.
