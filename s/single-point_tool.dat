2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just {{thread cutting}} when the context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a <b>single-point</b> <b>tool</b> to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone.

This {{committee}} developed American Standard <b>Single-Point</b> <b>Tools</b> and Tool Posts (ASA B 5. 22 - 1950), Section 1 {{of which}} covered terminology and definitions for <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tools.</b> Late in 1955, Technical Committee 2 was subdivided into Groups A, B, and C, with Group C {{being responsible for}} nomenclature of <b>Single-Point</b> <b>Tools.</b> This Group became Technical Com Committee 16 on Nomenclature of <b>Single-Point</b> <b>Tools</b> in 1957, but remained inactive until January, 1962, when work on formulation of the present standard, as a revision of Section 1 of ASA B 5. 22 - 1950, was started. Later in 1962, ASA Sectional Committee B 94 on Cutting Tools, Holders, Drivers, and Bushings was formed as an off-spring of Committee B 5, and TC 16 was included in its area of responsibility. In 1963, B 94 Technical Committees were renumbered and TC 16 became TC 3. At the same time, its scope was broadened to cover “nomenclature of edges, faces, tool angles and their reference system, working angles and their reference system, for the working parts of cutting tools ” {{and the name of}} the committee was changed to Technical Committee 3 on Basic Nomenclature of Cutting Tools.

50|$|For the {{machining}} of complex shapes, {{it is common}} to use form tools. This contrasts with the cutting that is performed on an engine lathe where the cutting tool is usually a <b>single-point</b> <b>tool.</b> A form tool has the form or contour of the final part but in reverse, so it cuts the material leaving the desired component shape. This contrasts to a <b>single-point</b> <b>tool,</b> which cuts on one point at a time and the shape of the component is dictated by the motion of the tool rather than its shape.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of machining, a cutting tool or cutter is any tool {{that is used to}} remove {{material}} from the workpiece by means of shear deformation. Cutting may be accomplished by <b>single-point</b> or multipoint <b>tools.</b> <b>Single-point</b> <b>tools</b> are used in turning, shaping, planing and similar operations, and remove material by means of one cutting edge. Milling and drilling tools are often multipoint tools. Grinding tools are also multipoint tools. Each grain of abrasive functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge (although of high negative rake angle), and shears a tiny chip.|$|R
50|$|The various angles, shapes, {{and sizes}} of a <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tool</b> have direct {{relation}} to the resulting surface of a workpiece in machining operations. Different types of angle such as rake angle, side rake angle, cutting-edge angle, relief angle, nose radius exist and may be different {{with respect to the}} workpiece. Also, there are many shapes of <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tools,</b> such as V-shaped and Square. Usually, a special toolholder is used to hold the cutting tool firmly during operation.|$|R

5000|$|In machining, boring is {{the process}} of {{enlarging}} a hole that has already been drilled (or cast) by means of a <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tool</b> (or of a boring head containing several such tools), such as in boring a gun barrel or an engine cylinder. Boring is used to achieve greater accuracy of the diameter of a hole, and can be used to cut a tapered hole.

25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a thread. The <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tools</b> or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult.

5000|$|Lathe boring is {{a cutting}} {{operation}} {{that uses a}} <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tool</b> or a boring head to produce conical or cylindrical surfaces by enlarging an existing opening in a workpiece.

5000|$|When {{deciding}} what feed rate {{to use for}} a certain cutting operation, the calculation is fairly straightforward for <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tools,</b> {{because all of the}} cutting work is done at one point (done by [...] "one tooth", as it were). With a milling machine or jointer, where multi-tipped/multi-fluted cutting tools are involved, then the desirable feed rate becomes dependent on the number of teeth on the cutter, as well as the desired amount of material per tooth to cut (expressed as chip load). The greater the number of cutting edges, the higher the feed rate permissible: for a cutting edge to work efficiently it must remove sufficient material to cut rather than rub; it also must do its fair share of work.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the study}} of {{material}} removal mechanism is focused on a non-linear quasi-static analysis of the elastoplastic interaction between a <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tool</b> and the material being cut. An updated Lagrange procedure is applied to solve the large strain elastoplastic deformation problem which generates part of the irregularities observed on machined surfaces. A unique three-dimensional finite element model is developed to simulate the single-point metal cutting process. The effects of cutting parameter settings and workpiece material on the elastoplastic deformation of machined surfaces are investigated. The validity of this analysis is verified by experiments.

This paper presents experimental findings of orthogonal cutting of unidirectional {{glass fibre reinforced plastic}} (UD-GFRP) composites using HSS <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tools.</b> Key process indicators including cutting forces, chip formation and surface integrity were evaluated. Full factorial design is employed with fibre orientation, depth of cut, cutting speed and rake angle as process control variables. Fibre orientation and depth of cut were found to be the most significant factors affecting the investigated responses. Lower cutting forces and better surface quality were obtained at 0 o fibre orientation and lower depth of cut. Cutting at 45 o fibre orientation generated extremely damaged surfaces with relatively high average surface roughness values and should be avoided in practical applications...|$|R
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of <b>single-point</b> cutting <b>tools</b> arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|R

Tests which evaluate the blade performance throughout its useful life and examination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have shown that these defects adversely affect the performance and wear resistance of surface engineered blades. Further investigations suggest that significant improvements in coating integrity can be achieved through the careful preparation of the substrate surface and refinement of the cutting edge geometry prior to treatment. For this application, the need for refinement and enhancement of current manufacturing practices is demonstrated if the full benefits of advanced surface engineering are to be realized...|$|R
