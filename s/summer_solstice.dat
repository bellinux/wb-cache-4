5|$|Thom {{wished to}} examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> and one at the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice,</b> which has a double sunset.|$|E
5|$|Morning/Evening was {{announced}} in May 2015, with an expected release date of July 2015. It was made available to stream and download from Hebden's Bandcamp page on 21 June 2015 to celebrate the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice.</b> Music critics praised Hebden for continuing to release challenging and unique electronic music. The physical release of Morning/Evening became Hebden's second highest-charting album, peaking at number 48 in the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice,</b> the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E
50|$|François Bertemes and Peter Biehl began a major {{excavation}} {{of the site}} in 2002. When archaeologists combined the evidence with GPS observations, they noticed that the two southern openings marked the sunrise and sunset of the winter and <b>summer</b> <b>solstices.</b>|$|R
50|$|The dolmen {{is covered}} by a mound or tumulus 50 m in diameter. Like most Iberian tombs, it is {{oriented}} slightly south of east (96°), situated precisely so that at the <b>summer</b> <b>solstices</b> the sunlight at daybreak illuminates the burial chamber.|$|R
50|$|Folk plays such as Hoodening, Guising, Mummers Play and Soul Caking are {{generally}} verse sketches performed in countryside pubs in European countries, private houses or the open air, at set {{times of the}} year such as the Winter or <b>Summer</b> <b>solstices</b> or Christmas and New Year. Many have long traditions, although they are frequently updated to retain their relevance for modern audiences.|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on the surface suggests that Titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of CO2, much {{like that of the}} Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, are unlikely to be present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania's <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> (89 K), the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).|$|E
5|$|Wales {{lies within}} the north {{temperate}} zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate {{and is one}} of the wettest countries in Europe. Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53° 43′ N and 51° 38′ N). Aberystwyth, at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17hours of daylight at the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice.</b> Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over sevenandahalf hours.|$|E
5|$|As well as solar alignments, {{there are}} {{proposed}} lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received. The Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> sunrise azimuth {{is no longer}} equal to the construction era direction.|$|E

50|$|She also {{designed}} the central plaza for Sylvan Rodriguez Clear Lake Park. Friend designed {{a grove of}} 13 oaks, one for each cycle of the moon in the solar year. She created a labyrinth-paving pattern based on a one at Chartres Cathedral in France; and stone portals that mark the points on the horizon where the sun will rise and set on the winter and <b>summer</b> <b>solstices.</b> In preparation for the park, she researched astronomy, archeology and sacred geometry.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{looking at}} the {{components}} of the second term of Eq. (7), the combination of both effects in far-pole regions produces positive values of the difference between VTEC at night and the respective values at noon in both <b>summer</b> <b>solstices</b> and in southern spring during low solar activity. This conclusion reinforced the ideas previously expressed by Horvath (2006) and Jee et al. (2009) who asseverated that the most important factor to produce the WSA is the neutral wind effects on reducing the electron density during the day and enhancing the density at night. Following the same reasoning, OSA could also be explained.|$|R
5|$|By astronomical convention, {{the four}} seasons can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|E
5|$|In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers, St Kilda {{was named}} as the ninth {{greatest}} natural wonder in the British Isles. In 2007 an opera in Scots Gaelic called St Kilda: A European Opera {{about the story}} of the islands received funding from the Scottish Government. It was performed simultaneously at six venues in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Scotland over the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> of 2007. As part of its legacy, the production left a year-long time lapse camera on Hirta. Britain's Lost World, a three-part BBC documentary series about St Kilda began broadcasting on 19 June 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the site has been {{organised}} around a restricted backstage compound, with the Pyramid stage on the north, and Other stage on {{the south of the}} compound. Attractions on the east of the site include the acoustic tent, comedy tent and circus. To the south are the green fields, which include displays of traditional and environmentally friendly crafts. In King's Meadow, the hill at the far south of the site, is a modern small megalith circle which, like Stonehenge, is coordinated with the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice,</b> and since 1990 represents a stone circle.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{constitutes a}} Worship Book {{for those who}} wish to honor the integrity of creation in regular worship services throughout the Christian liturgical year. Eight liturgies for the Winter and <b>Summer</b> <b>Solstices,</b> the Spring and Fall Equinoxes and four “cross-quarter days, ” plus a Full Moon ritual are provided, based upon what is known about pre-Christian, Celtic spirituality, the theology and four-path principles of Creation Spirituality, and suggested readings from the Revised Common Lectionary for Year B. The format used in developing these rituals is a model for small groups that wish to work in a sacred manner. -ii-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT...|$|R
40|$|The prehistoric stone funerary monuments of the Sahara desert, {{distributed}} {{in a huge}} geographical area, had been created in several different shapes. Some {{of them have a}} design that looks like a keyhole, and therefore are known as keyhole tombs. Since they are facing the sunrise, these tombs had been proposed as places for the worship of the sun too. In this paper, we show that one of them, in Algeria, has two radial lines oriented with the sunrise azimuths of winter and <b>summer</b> <b>solstices.</b> This monument is then a prehistoric solar observatory in the middle of Sahar...|$|R
5000|$|A gnomon is used {{along with}} a shadow box commonly. A gnomon is a stick placed {{vertically}} in a sunny place so that it casts a shadow that can be measured. By studying {{the shadow of the}} gnomon you can learn a lot of information about the motion of the sun. Gnomons were most likely independently discovered by many ancient civilizations, but it is known that they were used in the 5th century BC in Greece. Most likely for the measurement of the winter and <b>summer</b> <b>solstices.</b> [...] "Herodotus says in his Histories written around 450 B.C., that the Greeks learned the use of the gnomon from the Babylonians.|$|R
5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: <b>summer</b> <b>solstice,</b> winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E
5|$|Some {{have argued}} that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion, {{although}} this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers. The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which occurs at the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice,</b> when the sun, viewed from the Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E
30|$|The first mode of PCA applied on VTEC {{scattering}} represents {{on average}} the 93  % {{of the total}} VTEC variability. Thus, the PCA expansions up to mode 1 resulted enough to show WSA and OSA during <b>summer</b> <b>solstices</b> in both solar activity conditions, as well as WSA during spring equinox during low solar activity. Besides, {{the analysis of the}} temporal variations of these first modes should provide the interpretation of a probable physical explanation to the observed anomalies. We conclude that the main contributors to the anomalies should be a combination of the same physical mechanisms that explain annual variation and semiannual anomaly in that regions located far from the magnetic poles.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{measured}} axial orientations and siting of Irish passage tombs. The distribution of monuments with passages/entrances directed at related tombs/cairns is shown. Where this phenomenon occurs, the targeted structure is invariably located {{at a higher}} elevation on the skyline and this could suggest a symbolic and hierarchical relationship in their relative siting in the landscape. Additional analysis of astronomical declinations at a national scale has identified tombs with an axial alignment towards the rising and setting positions of the Sun at the winter and <b>summer</b> <b>solstices.</b> A criteria-based framework is developed which potentially allows for these types of data to be more meaningfully considered and culturally interpreted within broader archaeological and social anthropological contexts...|$|R
50|$|In Earth-based spiritualities the Eight Directions {{are often}} used to {{represent}} the Wheel of the Year. The Eight Directions represent the four seasons (North - Winter, South - Summer, East - Spring, and West - Autumn) and the Winter and <b>Summer</b> <b>Solstices,</b> {{as well as the}} Spring and Fall Equinoxes. The midpoints between those four times of year are the four lesser directions. This Eight Direction model maps perfectly onto the eight arrows of the root chakra. The four petals of the chakra also map onto the four elements of Earth (North), Air (East), Fire (South) and Water (West). This chakra, being so closely related to the element of Earth, also reflects the earth elements.|$|R
5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} {{shortly after}} giving birth. Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant {{for nearly a}} year. For {{the first half of}} the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E
5|$|While {{the stars}} are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies {{throughout}} the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices {{a bit like a}} pendulum, slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice.</b> For more information see History of solar observation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the <b>summer</b> <b>solstice</b> it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E
50|$|The first 50 {{days of the}} Somali Calendric Year of 2007-2008, in the Gregorian system, {{are from}} Saturday July 21, 2007, to Saturday Sep. 8, 2007. The same pattern applies to {{the first and the}} last days of the year, while the first day of the year is Saturday, July 21, 2007, the last day of the year is Saturday, July 19, 2008, because this {{calendar}} is based on the <b>summer</b> <b>solstices.</b> Thus, the time units used in this year are 50-day intervals and 365-day intervals, and the name of this year is Saturday. These time units are carefully and systematically enumerated day by day and period by period where practice and redundancy have resulted in sophistication and accuracy.|$|R

25|$|In the Babylonian star {{catalogues}} {{dating from}} at least 1100 BCE, the stars of Crater were possibly incorporated {{with those of the}} crow Corvus in the Babylonian Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). John H. Rogers observed that the adjoining constellation Hydra signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with the water snake Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and <b>summer</b> <b>solstices</b> respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the celestial equator in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.|$|R
