40|$|Abstract — Hybrid {{electrical}} energy storage (HEES) systems {{are composed of}} multiple banks of heterogeneous {{electrical energy}} storage (EES) elements with distinctive properties. Charge replacement in a HEES system (i. e., dynamic assignment of load demands to EES banks) {{is one of the}} key operations in the system. This paper formally describes the global charge replacement (GCR) optimization problem and provides an algorithm to find the near-optimal GCR control policy. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, where the objective function is the charge replacement efficiency. The constraints account for the energy conservation law, efficiency of the charger/converter, the rate capacity effect, and self-discharge rates plus internal resistances of the EES element arrays. The near-optimal solution to this problem is obtained while considering the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> (<b>SoCs)</b> <b>of</b> the EES element arrays, characteristics of the load devices, and estimates of energy contributions by the EES element arrays.
