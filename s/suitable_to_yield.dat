40|$|In the Volta River Basin, {{flooding}} {{has been}} one of the most damaging natural hazards during the last few decades. Therefore, flood frequency estimates are important for disaster risk management. This study aims at improving knowledge of flood frequencies in the Volta River Basin using regional frequency analysis based on L-moments. Hence, three homogeneous groups have been identified based on cluster analysis and a homogeneity test. By using L-moment diagrams and goodness of fit tests, the generalized extreme value and the generalized Pareto distributions are found <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> accurate flood quantiles in the Volta River Basin.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of spectral parameters characterizing analog–to–digital converters (ADC) is addressed by applying a single or dual tone generator to the device input and by properly processing its output data stream. The coherent sampling condition, highly {{recommended by the}} IEEE standards 1057 and 1241 which list the most effective ADC testing procedures, is usually difficult to achieve, and sometimes even unfeasible. In fact, it requires a fine synchronization between the input and the sampling signals frequencies {{and it can not}} be achieved when spurious tones are present in the ADC output spectrum. Data windowing is usually employed to reduce the associated spectral leakage phenomenon. However, IEEE standards do not provide clear criteria for choosing the window to be used for testing a given b–bit converter. Therefore, a reduced measurement reproducibility can result. The European draft standard Dynad suggests the employment of one out of seven windows in accordance to the ADC resolution. However, each proposed sequence covers only a limited converter resolution range. In this paper an ADC testing procedure is described, <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> highly repeatable and reproducible measurements also when non–coherent sampling applies. To this aim, the use of a class of windows is proposed, that uniquely applies to ADCs with arbitrarily high resolution. Finally, experimental results that validate its effectiveness are presented...|$|E

We study the effect of various physical parameters on the formation of defects in a kinetic model of step doubling. We treat this manifestly non- equilibrium problem by mapping the model onto a 1 -D random sequential adsorption problem and solving this analytically. We also do simulations to check the validity of our treatment. We find that our treatment effectively captures the dynamic evolution and the final state of the surface morphology. We show that the number and nature of the defects formed is controlled by a single dimensionless parameter q. For q close to one we show that the fraction of defects rises linearly with ϵ≡ 1 -q as 0. 284 ×ϵ.

40|$|When {{amphetamine}} {{is associated}} with a tastant conditioned stimulus, rats learn to avoid the taste even when employing doses that promote conditioned place preference. One hypothesis raised to account for this effect proposes that taste avoidance induced by amphetamine may be motivated by fear. A sensitive period has been identified in the rat (until postnatal day 10) in which infants learn conditioned appetitive effects to stimuli to which aversions are conditioned after this period. Exogenous administration of corticosterone within this period reverses this effect, generating aversive conditioning. In the present study, we tested conditioning of aversions to amphetamine or LiCl, within and after the sensitive period (Experiments 1 and 2). A third experiment evaluated unconditioned rejection of an aversive quinine solution within the sensitive period. Finally, we tested whether corticosterone administration before conditioning modulates amphetamine-induced taste avoidance. After the sensitive period, infant rats rejected the solution paired with amphetamine or LiCl after 2 conditioning trials, but within the sensitive period, aversions were conditioned only by LiCl and after 4 conditioning trials. Amphetamine-induced taste avoidance was not observed even when corticosterone was administered before conditioning. Additionally, during the sensitive period, a low LiCl dose promoted conditioned taste preference. According to Experiment 3, parameters employed in this study were <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> rejection of aversive solutions within the sensitive period. These results suggest that during the sensitive period, there is a notable resistance to the acquisition of taste avoidance induced b...|$|E
40|$|WP 16 / 2000; n {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} {{shed some light on}} the way the {{regulation}} of public transit systems has been approached in the past and is presently addressed in Italy. The reduction of x-inefficiency represents a great challenge for the local authorities, given the high operating costs faced by the transportation companies and the moderate tariffs level that do not allow the operators to balance costs and revenues. Throughout the 1980 's and {{the first half of the}} 1990 's, the problem was essentially met by means of stopgap measures taken mainly for emergency, to curb the deficit build-up. In the past five years it has been turning the efforts towards a radical reorganization of the whole local public transportation (LPT) industry, with the law 549 / 95, completed with the Decreti Legge 422 / 97 and 400 / 99. The reform process includes among its goals the attribution of financial responsibility to the sector operators and the start of privatization of the public transit systems. The introduction of more competitive environment, mainly by the resort to tendering for the allotment of concessions, represents the challenge for the future. A complete evaluation of the achieved results is probably still premature. Nevertheless, as the first goal is concerned, the reform appears <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> some positive result. On the contrary, the liberalization and privatization of the LPT sector is progressing very slowly, due to the protection still given to the public-owned companies. It is then expected that in the future a decisive action with regard to such important aspects of the regulatory reform will be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} Chern-Weil theory for compact Lie group action whose generic {{stabilizers}} are finite {{in the framework}} of equivariant cohomology. This provides a method of changing an equivariant closed form within its cohomological class to a form more <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> localization results. This work is motivated by our work [5] on reproving wall crossing formulas in Seiberg-Witten theory, where the Lie group is the circle. As applications, we derive two localization formulas of Kalkman type for G = SU(2) or SO(3) actions on compact manifolds with boundary. One of the formulas is then used to yield a very simple proof of a localization formula due to Jeffrey-Kirwan [15] in the case of G = SU(2) or SO(3). Throughout this paper, G will be a compact connected Lie group, with g as its Lie algebra. Assume that G acts freely on a smooth manifold P. Then the quotient map P → P/G = M gives P a structure of principal G-bundle. The celebrated Chern-Weil theory gives us a homomorphism (1) cw: S(g ∗) G → H ∗ (M), called the Chern-Weil homomorphism. Here S(g ∗) G is the algebra of polynomials on g which is invariant under the adjoint representation of G on g. The Chern-Weil construction uses a connection 1 -form ω ∈ (Ω 1 (P) × g) G and its curvature 2 -form Ω = dω + 1 2 [ω, ω]. The equation dΩ = [Ω, ω] can be used to show that for any invariant polynomial F ∈ S n (g ∗) G, F(Ω) is the pullback of a closed form on M. This defines the homomorphism (1). Furthermore, for two connections ω 0 and ω 1 with curvatures Ω 0 and Ω 1 respectively, there is a canonically defined differential form T (ω 0,ω 1) F on M, called the transgression form, such that dT (ω 0,ω 1) F = F(Ω 1) − F(Ω 0). Therefore, the Chern-Weil homomorphism is independent of the choice of ω. We call this Chern’s formulation. Cartan [7] presented Weil’s formulation, which we shall review in § 1. Through Weil’s formulation, Cartan (§ 5 in [8]) discovered that the Chern-Weil homomorphism can be factored a...|$|E

Delineating a paddock into a few `management zones' is therefore a practical management approach. In this study, yield maps of various crops and seasons were used to delineate `management zones'. Map standardisation {{and the application of}} geographic information systems (GIS) were necessary <b>to</b> combine various <b>yield</b> maps for `management zones' delineation. A user-defined fuzzy set membership function was employed <b>to</b> standardise <b>yield</b> maps.

40|$|From both {{theory and}} {{experimental}} evidence, an optimum solution for filament wound tubes subjected to hydrostatic pressure is the  55 ° laminate, maximising strength and allowing for satisfactory production rates. The usual strength criteria predict an equally good behaviour if a (0 °/ 90 ° 2) s laminate is adopted. Although the latter solution would imply dedicated {{filament winding machines}} and longer fabrication times, it would also provide a sensibly higher flexural stiffness in the circumferential direction, required when buried pipes are concerned. At this time, no data are available, comparing the performances of  55 ° and (0 °/ 90 ° 2) s on a common basis. This {{was one of the}} objectives of the present work, where Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) pipes, made of E-glass and Synolite NP 244 polyester resin, were produced according to the lay-ups (90, 0, 90) n and ( 55) n, with n = 1 - 3, obtaining shell thicknesses in the range 1 to 3 mm. From the pipes, specially designed specimens were fabricated, <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> valid failure modes. The samples were subjected to hydrostatic tests in a Hammel Sciteq P 400 machine, by which an internal pressure was applied through water inlet. During the mechanical characterisation tests, the specimens were continuously monitored by two Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors linked to a Vallen AMSY 4 system. The scope of AE analysis was twofold: a) to verify the usefulness of typical AE parameters [1 - 3], as the hits evolution, energy, and amplitude, in identifying the different failure modes occurring during loading; b) to attempt an effective localisation of the damage, rendered difficult by the acoustic anisotropy of the material [4]. After tests, some specimens were sectioned and microscopically examined, in order to verify their failure modes. It was found that, before the pipe burst, a dense network of resin microcracks, resulting in water leakage, is generated in the shell (Fig. 1 a). This phenomenon impairs the possibility of actually achieving burst with evident fibre failure. It was found that the critical stress for leakage of the 0 / 90 is slightly lower than its  55 counterpart. Further, the AE response is strongly influenced by the laminate type, with the  55 laminate emitting much more than the 0 / 90 laminate. In all cases, the resin microcracks were characterised by low amplitude signals...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} study aims {{to identify the}} best way of processing colemanite concentrates, which is sometimes characterised by a high content of As sulphides, finely disseminated in the matrix of the boron mineral. Scanning Electron Microscopy analyses have been carried out to identify all the mineralogical constituents and to evaluate their distribution, frequency and mutual relationships. Colemanite concentrates are mainly used by chemical plants producing boric acid and gypsum. A high As content is unacceptable for further use of tailings coming from the leaching process and is very dangerous if the tailings are released into the environment. Grinding tests were conducted under dry and wet conditions in order to assess how As sulphide minerals are released from colemanite minerals. Some of the difficulties involved in obtaining selective liberation of As sulphides from colemanite minerals were overcome, although a certain decrease in As grade in the higher size classes was registered. All comminution products have been analysed by SEM, monitoring the degree of liberation of the mineralogical constituents. Flotation tests have been carried out, following different comminution flow sheets and adopting different modulating conditions in order to evaluate the influence of the following parameters: ! collector concentration versus contaminants concentration (As minerals) in the froths; ! kind and quantity of the frothing agent to maximise mineral recovery in the froths; ! kind and quantity of the modulating agents to maximise the selectivity of the process; ! conditioning modalities in order to obtain a suitable dispersion of fines and avoid segregation of Asbearing particles together with colemanite ones; ! solid/liquid ratio of the pulp to minimise the water flow into the plant. Information obtained from SEM analysis has been adopted to evaluate segregation phenomena in pulp and in flotation products. The influence of the chemical characteristics of industrial waters flowing in the flotation process has been investigated. On the basis of the results of all the experiments, performed under optimum operating conditions, it has been possible to model different process flow sheets with the objective of maximising of boron recovery and minimisation of both As recovery and As grade in the colemanite product. Results demonstrate how to obtain a level of As in the colemanite product <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> <b>yield,</b> after the chemical process, a gypsum characterised by an As content acceptable for further industrial uses...|$|E

However, attempts to produce glycosylated polyketides, by the expression of heterologous sugar pathways, have been hampered until now by the low levels of glyco-sylated compounds produced by the recombinant hosts. By carrying out metabolic engineering of three endogenous pathways that lead to the synthesis of TDP sugars in E. coli, we have greatly improved the intracellular levels of the common deoxysugar intermediate TDP- 4 -keto- 6 -deoxyglucose resulting in increased production of the heterologous sugars TDP-L-mycarose and TDP-D-desosamine, both com-ponents of medically important polyketides. Bio-conversion experiments carried out by feeding 6 -deoxyerythronolide B (6 -dEB) or 3 -a-mycaro-sylerythronolide B (MEB) demonstrated that the genetically modified E. coli B strain was able to produce 60 - and 25 -fold more erythromycin D (EryD) than the original strain K 207 - 3, respectively.

This farming package has been described as <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> improve <b>yields</b> and livelihoods of smallholders in semi-arid regions of Kenya, which since the colonial period have been heavily subjected to tillage. Our study is based on a qualitative approach that followed local meanings and understandings of soil fertility, rainfall and CA in Ethi and Umande located in the semi-arid region of Laikipia, Kenya. Farm visits, 53 semistructured interviews, informal talks were carried out from April to June 2015. Ethi and Umande locations were part of a resettlement programme after the independence of Kenya that joined together people coming from diﬀerent farming contexts. Since the 1970 – 80 s, state and NGOs have been promoting several approaches to control erosion and boost soil fertility. In this context, CA has also been promoted preferentially since 2007. Interviewees were well acquainted with soil erosion and the methods to control it. Today, rainfall amount and distribution are identiﬁed as major constraints to crop performance. Soil fertility is understood as being under control since farmers use several methods to boost it (inorganic fertilisers, manure, terraces, agroforestry, vegetation barriers). CA is recognised <b>to</b> deliver better <b>yields</b> but it is not able to perform well under severe drought and does not provide yields as high as ‘promised’ in promotion campaigns. Moreover, CA is mainly understood as “cultivating with chemicals”, “kulima na dawa”, in kiswahili. A dominant view is that CA is about minimum tillage and use of pre-emergence herbicides. It is relevant to reﬂect about what kind of CA is being promoted and if elements like soil cover and crop rotation are given due attention. CA based on these two ideas, minimum tillage and use of herbicides, is hard to stand as a programme to be promoted and up-scaled. Therefore CA appears not to be recognised as a convincing approach to improve the livelihoods in Laikipia...|$|R

The algorithms appear <b>to</b> be particularly <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> problems involving bifurcation and limit point calculations. An important by-product of the algorithms is that it provides a systematic and economical means for computing the stepsize at each iteration stage when a Newton-like method is employed to solve the systems of equations.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that high efficiency (20 %) solar cells can be routinely fabricated using single crystal photovoltaic (PV) materials with low defect densities. Polycrystalline materials with small grain sizes and no crystallographic texture typically result in reduced efficiences. This has been ascribed primarily {{to the presence of}} grain boundaries and their effect on recombination processes. Furthermore, lack of crystallographic texture can result in a large variation in dopant concentrations which critically control the electronic properties of the material. Hence in order to reproducibly fabricate high efficiency solar cells a method which results in near single crystal material is desirable. Bulk single crystal growth of PV materials is cumbersome, expensive and difficult to scale up. We present here a possible route to achieve this if epitaxial growth of photovoltaic materials on rolling-assisted-biaxially textured-substrates (RABiTS) can be achieved. The RABiTS process uses well-established, industrially scaleable, thermomechanical processing to produce a biaxially textured or single-crystal-like metal substrate with large grains (50 - 100 {mu}m). This is followed by epitaxial growth of <b>suitable</b> buffer layers <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> chemically and structurally compatible surfaces for epitaxial growth of device materials. Using the RABiTS process {{it should be possible to}} economically fabricate single-crystal-like substrates of desired sizes. Epitaxial growth of photovoltaic devices on such substrates presents a possible route to obtaining low-cost, high performance solar cells...|$|R

We demonstrate the many advantages of this method in the simulation of 2 D Ising model with complex-valued temperature. 1 The Sign Problem In order to evaluate a multi-dimensional integral of the partition function Z ≡ fdV (1) using Monte Carlo (MC) one can sample the points in the integration domain with a non-uniform distribution, p. This sampling gives the following estimate for the integral: Z ≈ 〈f/p 〉 ± √ S/N, (2) where N is the number of points sampled, p ≥ 0 and is normalised...|$|R
40|$|Maize is an {{important}} crop for the Portuguese agricultural sector. Future climate change, with warmer and dryer conditions in this Mediterranean environment, will challenge this high-water demanding crop. The present study aims at assessing the response of maize yield, growth cycle, seasonal water input and daily water productivity (DWP) to climate change, and analyse water-yield relations. For this purpose, two process-based crop models are used (STICS and AquaCrop) and were validated in simulating irrigated maize yields in Central Portugal (Ribatejo) by using regional statistics (1986 – 2005). Both models show an overall agreement in their outputs. The 2 -model mean outputs are considered under future climate projections (2021 – 2080; RCP 4. 5 and 8. 5), using the global/regional climate model chain M-MPI-ESM-LR/SMHI-RCA 4. The most significant reductions on maize yield (− 17 %), growth cycle (− 12 %) and DWP (− 19 %) are observed for 2061 – 2080 under RCP 8. 5, with a noticeable decrease of seasonal water input (− 9 %) during 2041 – 2060. Decreased DWP is largely due <b>to</b> significant <b>yield</b> reduction, with limited benefit of atmospheric CO 2 enrichment. A water-yield relation analysis highlights that an increase of 2 – 14 % in irrigation for future scenarios (compared to 1986 – 2005) might be a <b>suitable</b> strategy <b>to</b> mitigate <b>yield</b> reduction, despite substantially lower DWP (down to − 23 %). These findings demonstrate that our model approach {{can be used as}} a decision support tool by Portuguese farmers, particularly in optimizing maize production under changing climates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{illustrates}} a new optical flow estimation technique, which builds upon a genetic algorithm (GA). First, the current frame is segmented into generic shape regions, using only brightness information. For each region a two-parameter motion model is estimated using a GA. The fittest individuals identified {{at the end}} of this step are used to initialise the population of the second step of the algorithm, which estimates a six-parameter affine motion model, again using a GA. The proposed method is compared against a multiresolution version of the well-known Lukas-Kanade differential algorithm. It proved <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> the same or better results in term of energy of the residual error, yet providing a compact representation of the optical flow, making it particularly <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> video coding applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Drying can add value, {{facilitate}} {{transport and}} extend the storage life of agro-products; therefore, in developing countries with poorly established cool-chains, drying is particularly effective. Furthermore, drying within small-scale village-based enterprises contributes to rural development. However, most equipment <b>suitable</b> <b>to</b> such operations <b>yields</b> a product of non-uniform quality and shows low levels of energy efficiency. The aim {{of this research was}} to improve the batch uniformity and the energy efficiency of a cabinet dryer suitable for smallholder farmers. Experiments were carried out with the cooperation of a dryer manufacturer and a group of users. On each trial 144. 5 kg of peeled and deseeded litchis were placed at the dryer’s 17 trays, that were stacked atop each other. Moisture content (wet basis) was reduced from 87 to 23 % in about 15. 5 h. It was found that a low-cost modification to the dryer chamber’s air inlet was able to improve heat distribution and increase the uniformity of the fruit’s moisture content. In the original design, {{at the end of the}} drying process, moisture content of the fruits on the top tray was 38 % while at the bottom tray was 12 %. The modification to the dryer reduced this disparity and the final moisture content of the fruits placed at the top tray was 25 % while at the bottom tray was 21 %. In addition, the modification reduced the dryer’s air mass flow from 0. 3 to 0. 1 kg s− 1 without jeopardizing drying forces, consequently the dryer energy efficiency increased from 33 to 42 %...|$|R
