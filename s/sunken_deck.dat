50|$|Each session lasts {{approximately}} 1 hour, {{to discover}} the biology and ecology of dolphins, before approaching the dolphins for 20 minutes under close supervision by trainers on a <b>sunken</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} memorial {{has three}} main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large open windows on either wall and ceiling, {{to commemorate the}} date of the attack. Rumor says the 21 windows symbolically represents a 21-gun salute or 21Marines standing at eternal parade rest over the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site will confirm this was not the architect's intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the <b>sunken</b> <b>decks.</b> It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, leis were tossed in the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Roe mainly {{continued}} to build passenger bodies, although supplying {{the war effort}} more directly with such specialised bodywork as mobile printing presses for field communications use on Foden lorries and articulated mobile kitchens, canteens and dormitories to assist blitzed factories. These were on semi-trailer chassis coupled to Bedford tractor units. Similar bus-seated vehicles were built mainly for use within Ordnance factories (where they became known as Bevin buses) but two were supplied to Liverpool Corporation and briefly used as service buses (1942-44) before being converted to mobile canteens. More normal passenger vehicle bodies were built during the war to the Government-mandated 'utility' outline including 240 single-deck 32 seaters on Bedford OWB chassis and over 400 double-deck bodies on Guy and Daimler motorbuses and Sunbeam trolleybuses, most to the <b>sunken</b> upper <b>deck</b> offside gangway or lowbridge layout.|$|R
500|$|In 1932, the Bulgarian Navy {{conceived}} a plan {{to search}} for the wreck of UB-45 with the intent of raising it for restoration as a training vessel, or, at the very least, to recover the <b>sunken</b> U-boat's [...] <b>deck</b> gun. An additional consideration was the recovery of the remains of UB-45s crew. On 19 July 1934, after a two-year search, Bulgarian minesweepers discovered the location of the wreck, which was resting at position , near the then Bulgarianâ€“Romanian border. UB-45s wreck was raised in an operation that cost several times less than the cost of a new 8.8-centimeter gun. The remains recovered were buried on 26 February 1936 in a Varna cemetery, after a procession through the town.|$|R
