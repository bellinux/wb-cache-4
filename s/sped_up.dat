5|$|An {{alternative}} edit of {{the song}} appeared on the Beatles' Anthology 2 out-takes compilation in 1996. Slightly <b>sped</b> <b>up,</b> and mixed in stereo, this version comprises the song's basic track without most of the April 1967 overdubs, and with a vocal take that contains some changes to the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, {{it follows that the}} flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were <b>sped</b> <b>up.</b> The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that her building had been <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> by using guns and/or turrets originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905. It seems more likely that Dreadnoughts turrets and guns merely received higher priority {{than those of the}} earlier ships.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBacterial spores (Bacillus subtilis), {{cyanobacteria}} (Chroococcidiopsis sp.), and lichen (Xanthoria elegans) {{embedded in}} martian analogue rock (gabbro) {{were exposed to}} shock pressures between 5 and 50 GPa which is the range of pressures observed in martian meteorites. The survival of Bacillus subtilis and Xanthoria elegans up to 45 GPa and of Chroococcidiopsis <b>sp.</b> <b>up</b> to 10 GPa supports the possibility of transfer of life inside meteoroids between Mars and Earth and it implies {{the potential for the}} transfer of life from any Mars-like planet to other habitable planets in the same stellar system...|$|R

5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or <b>sped</b> <b>up,</b> often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Developed by Liverpudlian Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly {{known as}} Psygnosis), {{production}} of Wipeout Pure started in August 2003 and lasted until early 2005. Throughout development, the team created entirely new user interfaces and other algorithms which <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> {{the development process}} {{in time for the}} PlayStation Portable's launch in March 2005. The game received positive reviews from critics upon release. Reviewers unanimously praised the graphics, track designs and general aesthetics; however, some noticed occasional framerate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{plants were}} {{built at the}} Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a {{production}} facility at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 calutrons and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week.|$|E
40|$|The {{tracking}} in the LHC can be {{speeded up}} considerably if we lump some sections {{that for a}} given problem are not relevant. This {{is the case of}} the arcs in collision optics where the dynamic aperture is dominated by systematic multipole field errors in the low-beta quadrupoles. This situation gives us a very simple case where to study systematically the influence of the lump in the beam dynamics and in the speed of tracking. This {{is the subject of this}} paper, it is shown that the lumped lattice works and could be used to <b>spped</b> <b>up</b> the tracking...|$|R
40|$|Phenol is a toxic organic {{compound}} that potentially contaminates particular territorial water, decreases water quality, and disturbs territorial water ecosystem. The aims {{of this research}} were to find isolate of bacteria that able to degrade phenol and select them to obtain the best isolate on degrading phenol. The isolates used in this research were from Kawengan oil well in Cepu. It consist of 16 isolates of Bacillus spp. Five isolates were chosen based on its growth activity in a liquid mineral medium contained 100 ppm phenol. The optimum amount of phenol for the chosen isolates was determined by inoculating them in a mineral medium containing different amount of phenol. Growth curve was then constructed, {{and the ability of}} the isolate on decreasing phenol concentration in the mineral medium measured by using UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The result of the research indicated that the reduction of phenol taken place as a result of phenol biodegradation by 5 best isolates of bacteria. The decrease of the phenol concentration measured for 24 hours were: Bacillus sp 1 dcreased the phenol up to 214. 21 ppm, Bacillus <b>sp</b> 4 <b>up</b> to 224. 67 ppm; Bacillus <b>sp</b> 6 <b>up</b> to 217. 28 ppm; Bacillus <b>sp</b> 8 <b>up</b> to 197. 91 ppm; and Bacillus <b>sp</b> 12 <b>up</b> to 208, 34 ppm subsequently. The isolate of Bacillus sp 4 indicated the highest ability of biodegradation that is can decreasing phenol equal to 56. 17 % during 24 hours...|$|R

5|$|Recovery {{began with}} the mid-1948 {{currency}} reform in Western Germany, and was <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the Marshall Plan (1948â€“1951) both directly and indirectly caused. The post-1948 West German recovery {{has been called the}} German economic miracle. Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded. By contrast, the United Kingdom {{was in a state of}} economic ruin, and although it received a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country, continued relative economic decline for decades.|$|E
5|$|The geographical, {{engineering}} and logistical difficulties of conducting operations in SWPA were driven home by Alamo Force's first operation, Operation Chronicle, {{the occupation of}} Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands in June 1943. Despite {{the fact that the}} operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> the base development effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a success}} for the western {{development}} project at some level, for statistics show a substantial growth in foreign investment in the western regions. However, the rate of progress was not equal in all regions, partially due {{to the creation of}} the West Triangle Economic Zone, which <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> development in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Xi'an, but slowed down development in other areas of the West. For example, while foreign direct investment in Chongqing grew, foreign investment in other Western Chinese cities like Guizhou, Guangxi, and Ningxia declined significantly, dropping about USD $19.71, $250.96 million, and $34.54 million respectively.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} {{fully enclosed}} racks were delivered in late 1974 and early 1975. The Whitehead & Kales tri-level design, renamed Safe-Pak, {{was delivered to}} ATSF, CP, CRR, FEC, NW, SCL, SSW, UP, and WP, all of them riding on railroad-owned flats. Portec's RailPac design, developed in cooperation with Chrysler, was placed into service by ATSF, C, C, D, GTW, N, RF, SLSF, <b>SP,</b> <b>UP</b> and several other roads, with most riding on leased Trailer Train flats. These two designs were refined during the late 1970s and by 1980 fully enclosed tri-levels accounted for roughly {{a third of the}} in-service fleet, however fully enclosed bi-levels lagged far behind.|$|R

5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and <b>sped</b> <b>up,</b> and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{collected}} a bronze in the medley relay after swimming the freestyle leg in the heats before {{being replaced by}} first-choice Stockwell in the final. Competing {{in the third and}} final heat, Australia and the United States were equal at the last change before Brooks posted the fastest freestyle leg in the heats, pulling out a 0.40s margin over Tom Jager. Australia again qualified fastest, but the Americans again had more in reserve, having rested all of their first-choice quartet in the heats. Stockwell combined with Kerry, Evans and Glenn Buchanan to finish behind the United States and Canada in the final, missing silver by just 0.02s. Australia improved on their qualifying time by only 0.68s, while the Americans <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> by 5.03s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the parallel implementation of fastDNAml, {{a program for}} the maximum likelihood inference of phylogenetic trees from DNA sequence data. Mathematical means of inferring phylogenetic trees have been {{made possible by the}} wealth of DNA data now available. Maximum likelihood analysis of phylogenetic trees is extremely computationally intensive. Availability of computer resources is a key factor limiting use of such analyses. fastDNAml is implemented in serial, PVM, and MPI versions, and may be modified to use other message passing libraries in the future. We have developed a viewer for comparing phylogenies. We tested the scaling behavior of fastDNAml on an IBM RS/ 6000 <b>SP</b> <b>up</b> to 64 processors. The parallel version of fastDNAml is one of very few computational phylogenetics codes that scale well. fastDNAml is available for download as source code or compiled for Linux or AIX...|$|R
5|$|For Galileo, {{the tides}} {{were caused by}} the {{sloshing}} back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as a point on the Earth's surface <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{troubles}} delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials {{worried that}} high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds {{to complete the}} Green Line, forcing Maryland to pay these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation had created a $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget. By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the Green Line. In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the Green Line be <b>sped</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|Double Dash {{was first}} shown at E3 2001 as a seven-second video clip. The clip {{featured}} Mario and Luigi driving their karts on a bump mapped 3D surface with no background. At the time, {{it was early}} in development, and the working title of the game was simply Mario Kart. In April 2003, Nintendo released the first pictures and details of the game, as well as revealing the title to be Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. At E3 2003, a playable demo of the game was available. New features, such as having two characters drive one kart, had been implemented. An updated demo with some new additions was shown at the Games Convention in August 2003. In September, Nintendo held a Gamers' Summit for the press, in which a nearly complete and more <b>sped</b> <b>up</b> version of Double Dash was displayed. The Gamers' Summit also announced the North American release date to be November 17, 2003.|$|E
