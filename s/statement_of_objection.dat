First, the new European Commissioner for Competition Margarethe Vestager announced on April 15 th that the Commission had sent a <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objections</b> to Google, arguing that the giant IT company abused its dominant position in the “general Internet search” market {{and also in the}} market for mobile operating systems, apps and services.

These summarized the negotiations and documented how the airlines had discussed abolishing all competing services. The commission issued a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>objections</b> in January 2001.

The complainant, a small UK-based online travel agent, Skoosh, claimed that the hotels it bought room bookings from were under pressure from other resellers to maintain minimum prices. On 31 July 2012 the OFT issued a <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objections</b> against Booking.com, Expedia and Intercontinental Hotels. In the OFT's provisional view the parties had infringed competition law. In January 2014 the OFT accepted commitments proposal from the defendant parties in lieu of any fines. The OFT's Mr Rasmussen acknowledged there was a chance the set-up could lead to further monopoly, but he said the OFT would be monitoring movements in the market.

The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.|$|R
40|$|In June 2008, the European Commission (EC) was enabled to {{introduce}} a settlement procedure that aims at promoting the procedural efficiency of cartel enforcement in the European Union (EU). We use a data set consisting of 84 cartels decided by the EC from 2000 to 2014 to empirically investigate {{the impact of the}} EU settlement procedure on the duration of cartel investigations. Separating the enforcement process into two consecutive stages, we find that the introduction of the settlement procedure is followed by a substantial shortening of the second stage - reaching from the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>objections</b> (SO) to the decision - while it leaves the duration of the first stage {{from the beginning of the}} case to the SO unaffected.

40|$|Competition {{authorities}} {{carry out}} investigations and impose legal penalties on firms which are caught infringing the competition law. The rationale {{of this policy}} is to prevent firms from distorting free competition {{in a way that}} is detrimental to economic efficiency and at the same time to deter them from engaging in cartels and other anti-competitive behaviour. In this paper I try to evaluate the impact of major antitrust & abuse of dominant position investigations on firm’s financial value. For this purpose I divide the period of each investigation into two sub periods: the ‘Investigation period”, which begins from the outset of the anticompetitive case and ends when the competition authority issues the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>objections</b> to the infringed firms and the ‘Deterrence period’, which follows the ‘Investigation period’ and ends with the final judgment of the court. I use aggregate regression based approach to estimate the Average & Cumulative Average Residuals of the firms which infringe articles 1 & 2 of Greek Competition Law. The empirical results imply that the release of the final decisions of the Hellenic Competition Commission and the Court of Appeal negatively affect the share price of the infringed firms. ...|$|R

40|$|On 15 April 2015 the European Commission sent a <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objections</b> to Google in the {{framework}} of its ongoing investigation, which was opened against the company on 30 November 2010. The allegations against Google are the preferential treatment of its results in online search, i. e. that the company prefers “Google Shopping” to the vertical search results of its rivals. The competition law concerns of the European Commission are thereby an alleged abuse of a dominant position by Google (Article 102 TFEU). The investigation against Google is, on the one hand, an example of complex questions, which are posed to competition law in the Digital Economy. On the other hand, it is a “peak of an iceberg” in a much broader context. The Internet has embraced new business models, which (possibly) impact the patterns of users’ behaviour in the information-based economy. For competition law this means that, in order to better understand online markets, a much broader analysis may be needed, in particular, in terms of an interdisciplinary research on sociological and psychological aspects of the behaviour of Internet users. The question thereby is whether a “more behavioural approach” to competition law needs to be integrated into a competition law assessment. The case against Google is thereby an impulse, and may, thus, be the beginning rather than the end of the story...|$|R

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{antitrust}} {{is currently}} a centre of attention for the European Commission, with one decision against Lundbeck and <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objections</b> in investigations against Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, and Les Laboratoires Servier. This thesis {{is the first to}} develop in detail a ‘European approach’ to pay for delay settlements and early entry agreements – two types of conduct identified by the European pharmaceutical sector inquiry. Although pay for delay settlements have received extensive antitrust scrutiny in the United States, one has to be cautious when drawing from this expertise, as the underlying regulatory regimes are fundamentally different in Europe and the US. This need for careful comparative analyses in pharmaceutical antitrust and the fact that similar conduct might have to be treated differently {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic is showcased by a case study of the General Court’s AstraZeneca judgment. The analysis shows that the General Court was correct to dismiss AstraZeneca’s claim that its conduct would not have led to antitrust scrutiny following the US Walker Process Doctrine, which in fact covers similar conduct. Additionally, the hypothetical application of the market definition in AstraZeneca to the market of anti-epileptic drugs highlights the difficulties that the European Commission might encounter in its future enforcement in the pharmaceutical sector. Based on the different incentives for the parties of EU pay for delay settlements, a novel European theory of harm is developed for pay for delay settlements and early entry agreements, the latter posing significant anticompetitive potential in Europe. Based on this theory, pay for delay settlements are scrutinised under EU competition law and a novel “structured effects-based” test is proposed that is inspired by the recent Actavis judgment of the US Supreme Court. In terms of early entry agreements, this thesis is the first to apply EU competition law...|$|R
40|$|After {{years of}} unchallenged {{commercial}} domination of a sizeable {{portion of the}} EU's gas market, Gazprom is confronted with a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>objections</b> issued on 22 April by the EU Commission for abusing its dominant market position. The company was already prevented from going ahead with its South Stream project aimed at consolidating Gazprom's grip on Southeast Europe's markets by bypassing Ukraine – due to alleged non-compliance of intergovernmental agreements with the EU regulatory framework. Furthermore, it walked away from negotiations that could have allowed it to access more than 50 % of the OPAL pipeline – an onshore branch of the offshore Russian German Nord Stream pipeline –, whilst its attempts to go downstream through the acquisition of European distribution and transmission operators, such as Wingas and DESFA, failed due to current political tensions {{and the risk of}} a negative Commission ruling on the operation. Does this mean that the Russian gas behemoth – so often portrayed as the energy arm of the Kremlin – is not so powerful after all? This Policy Brief aims to frame the erosion of Gazprom's power in a wider perspective, analysing its peculiar position at a time of transition, with the global gas business going from a sellers' to a buyers' market, and providing recommendations on how Europe should deal with it. It will be argued that Gazprom – despite still being affected by the Kremlin's political priorities – is moving towards more commercially sound behavior. The EU should profit from this evolution without being tempted by mercantilist options, and rather use the political momentum provided by the energy union to remove barriers to solidarity and to increase competition on the trading platforms...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to present the issues <b>of</b> binding force <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> intent expressing <b>objection</b> to taking saving life actions in case of such a need in the future. This problem becomes current when a patient is {{unconscious}} and they cannot express their will basing on an assessment of all of the circumstances regarding their health. In the study the current legal status and judicature are being analysed. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the lack of legal regulations in Poland concerning the so-called statements pro futuro precludes a doctor from making a right assessment of his duties in the context of criminal responsibility for their negligence. It concerns both a duty to act and a negligence of life or health saving actions. The lack of legal criteria assessments of a doctor’s responsibility in the context of criminal responsibility for their negligence precludes from acknowledging statements pro futuro as obliging to negligence of treatment. The Polish law guarantees the patient the right to the self – determination in insufficient way but the constitutional principle of specificity of an offence (nullum crimen sine lege) does not give a permission to attribute criminal responsibility to the doctor for performing intervention despite the existence <b>of</b> such a <b>statement,</b> because the prohibition of undertaking the medical interventions in case <b>of</b> an <b>objection</b> raised before occurrence of the situation that needs such an intervention must have a source in the binding rules...|$|R
