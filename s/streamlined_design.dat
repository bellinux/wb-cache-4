A high-end model, Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 2017 for release in November, which features major hardware upgrades focused on enabling games to be rendered at 4K resolution.|$|E

25|$|The Breda Ba.88 Lince (Italian: Lynx) was a ground-attack {{aircraft}} {{used by the}} Italian Regia Aeronautica during World War II. Its <b>streamlined</b> <b>design</b> and {{retractable undercarriage}} were advanced for the time, and after its debut in 1937 the aircraft established several world speed records. However, when military equipment was installed on production examples, problems of instability developed and the aeroplane's general performance deteriorated. Eventually its operational career was cut short, and the remaining Ba.88 airframes were used as fixed installations on airfields to mislead enemy reconnaissance. It represented, perhaps, the most remarkable failure of any operational aircraft to see service in World War II.|$|E
25|$|The EC135 started {{development}} {{prior to}} the formation of Eurocopter under Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) under the designation Bo 108 in the 1970s. MBB developed it in partnership with Aérospatiale, the Bo 108 was initially intended to be a technology demonstrator, combining attributes of the successful MBB Bo 105 with new advances and an aerodynamically <b>streamlined</b> <b>design.</b> Technologies included on the Bo108 included the first full-authority digital engine controls (FADEC) on a helicopter, a hingeless main rotor, and the adoption of a new transmission. The first prototype made its first flight on 17 October 1988, powered by two Allison 250-C20R/1 engines. A second Bo108 followed on 5 June 1991, this time with two Turbomeca TM319-1B Arrius engines; unlike later production aircraft, both technology demonstrators flew with conventional tail rotors.|$|E
25|$|The basic hull {{design of}} Hamburg is a conventional, robust steel construction, with entirely flat decks amidship that slope {{slightly}} upwards towards the bow in {{a compromise between}} modern construction techniques and traditional design values. The superstructure adapted a clear, <b>streamlined</b> <b>design</b> in spirit of the modernism of the late 1960s. With usage as a cruise ships in mind, the ship was built with a mid-ship lido deck complex spanning two decks {{on the top of}} the ship. The upper level of the complex was extended all the way to the sides of the ship, allowing a view uninterrupted by lifeboats from the lido to the surrounding sea from behind the shelter provided by high glass screens. In addition to the lido deck, a large sports deck was designed behind the funnel.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with the previous generation model, the redesigned Lexus SC {{was intended as a}} convertible from its inception. The development team was led by chief engineer Yasushi Nakagawa from 1996 to 2000. Lexus designers from Europe and Japan worked together to create a <b>streamlined</b> <b>design.</b> A design theme was chosen in 1997 developed by Sotiris Kovos, who in return was named chief designer. Led by Kovos, designers traveled to the Côte d'Azur to develop the vehicle's exterior shape, and studied the region's architecture, lifestyle, and harbors. The resulting convertible of 1998 received character lines similar to the region's yachts, in {{contrast with}} traditional waveform lines. The vehicle's side profile, the product of extensive wind tunnel testing, was intended to channel air around the passenger compartment at high speed during top-down driving. Design patents were filed in Japan, at the Japan Patent Office on 14 June 1999 under patent number 1095312.|$|E
25|$|The {{front grille}} {{of a vehicle}} is used to direct air {{directly}} into the engine compartment. In a <b>streamlined</b> <b>design</b> the air flows around the vehicle rather than through; however, the grille of a vehicle redirects airflow from around the vehicle to through the vehicle, which then increases the drag. In order to reduce this impact a grille block is often used. A grille block covers up a portion, or {{the entirety of the}} front grille of a vehicle. In most high efficiency models or vehicles with low drag coefficients there will be a very small grille already built into the design, therefore a grille block is unneeded. The grille in most production vehicles is built generally to have as much air flowing into the engine compartment in order to keep it from overheating. But most commonly there is too much airflow into the engine compartment, preventing it from warming up in a timely manner, so a grille block is used to increase engine performance and reduce the vehicle's drag.|$|E
500|$|Development of the Pe-8 {{began in}} July 1934, when the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) issued {{requirements}} for an aircraft {{to replace the}} obsolete and cumbersome Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber. These requirements specified a bomber that could carry [...] of bombs [...] at a speed greater than [...] {{at an altitude of}} , figures that were twice the range, speed and service ceiling of the TB-3. The task was assigned to the Tupolev Design Bureau (OKB) where Andrei Tupolev handed the work to a team led by Vladimir Petlyakov and the project received the internal bureau designation of ANT-42. The resulting aircraft, a four-engined, mid-wing cantilever monoplane, was initially designated as the TB-7 ( [...] , Tyazholy Bombardirovschik—Heavy Bomber) by the VVS and owed more to the <b>streamlined</b> <b>design</b> of the Tupolev SB than to the block-like design of the TB-3.|$|E
