50|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{typically}} {{falls into}} two categories, classical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> and pyroshock or ballistic <b>shock</b> <b>testing.</b> Classical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{consists of the}} following shock impulses: half sine, haversine, sawtooth wave, and trapezoid. Pyroshock and ballistic <b>shock</b> <b>tests</b> are specialized and are not considered classical shocks. Classical shocks can be performed on Electro Dynamic (ED) Shakers, Free Fall Drop Tower or Pneumatic Shock Machines. A classical shock impulse is created when the shock machine table changes direction abruptly. This abrupt change in direction causes a rapid velocity change which creates the shock impulse.|$|R

40|$|Components used {{in space}} {{are subject to}} high {{frequency}} and high amplitude mechanical shocks that occur during the launch and separation phases of the space vehicles. <b>Shock</b> <b>testing</b> is done to ensure that components can withstand the shock events. A shock can be described by an acceleration and time history, but in <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> {{it is difficult to}} manage and quantify shocks by only looking at the acceleration and time history of a shock. Instead, a shock response spectrum is used, which plots the peak accelerations of multiple single degree of freedom systems with their own unique frequencies over a range of frequencies, usually from 100 Hz to 10 000 Hz. The shocks that occur in space can reach up to acceleration levels of 10 000 g’s. The main objective of this work was to develop a software application for the mechanical <b>shock</b> <b>testing</b> system at Tartu Observatory.

40|$|Abstract: The {{capability}} to withstand non-contact underwater explosions (UNDEX) {{is an important}} aspect to be emphasized {{in the design of}} modern warships, and shock testing is one of the efficient methods to qualify the ability. A brief history on the research of shock testing of naval shipboard equipment as well as major means in evaluating anti-shock performance of warship equipment is introduced first in this paper. Three prevailing <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> methods: UNDEX testing, virtual shock trial and land-based test with <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines are presented with the focus on the advances in <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines in US and Europe. Comparison of current shock testing facilities is also given. Moreover, some new concepts of <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines are reviewed as well, and three major directions of the development of <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines are concluded. The first trend is that shock testing machines are required to generate positive and negative shock pulse to simulate real UNDEX environment made up of shock wave followed by bubble pulse and structural whipping. The second is that <b>shock</b> <b>test</b> machines can test heavy equipments, and the last is that shock pulses can be controlled and customized conveniently. ...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical <b>shock</b> <b>tests</b> {{are very}} {{important}} for portable electronic products such as notebook computers and mobile phones because these products are subjected to high risks of impact loading. Impact loading often plays {{a critical role in}} the functional performance and mechanical reliability of electronic components and devices. Drop tests are adopted usually to the overall product to assess the structural and functional integrity. Traditional test method is to drop the products from a certain height with a quick release hook or drop tester. The obvious advantage for these methods is that they can directly duplicate the field impact scenarios. However, the test repeatability can not be guarantied in drop tests, because it is difficult to control the orientation of the object at impact and to instrument it. Moreover; by considering the real impact conditions, drop tests are not applicable for the <b>shock</b> reliability <b>tests</b> of individual components. <b>Shock</b> table <b>tests</b> are carried out to overcome the drawbacks described above. A shock impulse with a given shape, magnitude and duration is applied to the shock table and then imparted to the sample product or component fasted to the table. However, the <b>shock</b> table <b>test</b> is a simulation of the real-life drop impact process. To make the <b>shock</b> table <b>tests</b> adequately mimic the real drop impact, it is critical to make correlation between the <b>shock</b> table <b>test</b> parameter and field conditions. The present paper aims to conduct a systematic study, both experimentally and analytically, to evaluate the feasibility of using appropriate <b>shock</b> table <b>tests</b> to mimic the shock environment for components and systems adopted in portable electronics. Firstly, dynamic characteristics of typical portable electronic systems and components under drop impact are studied, and then effective <b>shock</b> table <b>test</b> methods are developed for adequately mimic the real-life impact state. At last, by comparing the typical results from <b>shock</b> table <b>tests</b> and those from drop tests, the correlation of <b>shock</b> table <b>test</b> parameters and drop tests conditions are investigated. ...|$|R
