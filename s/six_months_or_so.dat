Fearing that he may never be able to return to Earth and see his children again if he delays further, he decides to take leave of his hosts, carrying with him a gift of precious stones from the supreme monarch of the Moon, Irdonozur. The stones are of three different sorts: Poleastis, which can store and generate great quantities of heat; Macbrus, which generates great quantities of light; and Ebelus, which when one side of the stone is clasped to the skin renders a man weightless, or half as heavy again if the other side is touched.|$|E

40|$|Mumps is {{an acute}} viral illness {{caused by a}} paramyxovirus. The classic symptom of mumps is {{parotitis}} (i. e., acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary gland(s)), lasting at least two days, but may persist longer than ten days. 1 The mumps incubation period ranges from 12 – 25 days, but parotitis typically develops 16 to 18 days after exposure to mumps virus. 2 Nonspecific prodromal symptoms may precede parotitis by several days, including low-grade fever which may last three to four days, myalgia, anorexia, malaise, and headache. However, mumps infection may present only with nonspecific or primarily respiratory symptoms or may be a subclinical infection. 3 Clinical manifestations In the prevaccine era, rates of classical parotitis among all age groups typically ranged from 31 % to 65 %, but in specific age groups could be as low as 9 % or as high as 94 % depending on the age and immunity of the group. 4 – 7 Several articles discuss mumps symptoms as nonspecific or primarily respiratory, however, findings in these articles were based on serologies taken every <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> a year, <b>so</b> {{it is difficult to}} prove that the respiratory symptoms were because of mumps or that the symptoms occurred {{at the same time as}} the mumps infection. 6, 7 In th...|$|R

500|$|Newly hatched chicks {{are active}} and {{can leave the}} nest {{within a few days}} of hatching. They stand about [...] tall at first, weigh , and have {{distinctive}} brown and cream stripes for camouflage, which fade after three months or so. The male guards the growing chicks for up to seven months, teaching them how to find food. Chicks grow very quickly and are fully grown in five to six months; they may remain with their family group for another <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before they split up to breed in their second season. During their early life, the young emus are defended by their father, who adopts a belligerent stance towards other emus, including the mother. He does this by ruffling his feathers, emitting sharp grunts, and kicking his legs to drive off other animals. He can also bend his knees to crouch over smaller chicks to protect them. At night, he envelops his young with his feathers. As the young emus cannot travel far, the parents must choose an area with plentiful food in which to breed. In captivity, emus can live for upwards of ten years.|$|E
2500|$|David Weber and Eric Flint in 2002 (writing 1633 and Ring of Fire) {{originally}} contracted {{together and}} with Baen's Books to co-write five [...] "main series" [...] booksthe first two {{and perhaps some}} as yet unrevealed others being known as the naval thread. When working on the long-delayed [...] novel and with the prolonged and ongoing demand for the series sequels, and considering the already-experienced delays imposed by the difficulty of getting schedules between themselves synchronized (it took three planned [...] "windows of opportunity" [...] before one worked in The Baltic War) well enough for the two to have the three to <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> needed to collaborate successfully, the two decided to alter their original planning and spin off a new thread—one based on the United States of Europe as a naval power. The thread is continued in 1636: Commander Cantrell in the west indies. The story is about naval force projection in the new world.|$|E
2500|$|Morrell was {{a wealthy}} widow who {{suffered}} a stroke on 24 June 1948 while visiting her son in Cheshire. She was partially paralysed and was admitted to a hospital near Chester, where she received morphine injections for nine days from 27 June, prescribed by a Dr Turner. Cullen suggests that Adams, supposedly her usual doctor, arrived there on 26 June, the day before she was first prescribed morphine for the pain. However, the Attorney-General's opening speech states that Mrs Morrell was transferred to Eastbourne on 5 July 1948, only then becoming one of Adams' patients, who first prescribed morphine on 9 July, adding heroin on 21 July. Mrs Morrell was not expected to live more than <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> but survived her stroke for over two years, suffering also from arthritis: between July 1948 and August 1950, she received routine evening injections of morphine and heroin and her condition was stable but from then, as her condition deteriorated, the dosages increased. An expert {{witness for the prosecution}} claimed that Mrs Morrell would have become addicted, but the only apparent symptoms of this were attributed by the defence's expert to a second stroke ...|$|E
