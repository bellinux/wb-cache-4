40|$|<b>Sonar</b> <b>imaging</b> is a {{technique}} that can locate objects in a scene from their acoustic reflections. It utilizes multiple measurements from different angles to create a 2 D image. Conventional imaging algorithms such as backprojection (BP) require {{a large number of}} measurements to produce accurate images. Theory indicates that an al-ternative approach called compressive sensing (CS) can create accurate images using just a fraction of the measurements. CS requires that the scene is compressible and that each individual measurement provides information about the scene, not just a particular location. The <b>sonar</b> <b>imaging</b> experiment must be designed to meet these requirements. The {{purpose of this study is}} to show that the compressive sensing framework can be used in <b>sonar</b> <b>imaging</b> with results comparable to conventional methods. A sonar test stand was built that can measure acoustic reflections from a scene. A pseudo-random noise (PN) code was used for transmission. Four speakers and 16 microphones were mounted randomly perturbed from a circle surrounding the scene. Software was developed to create an image from this data through FBP. Also...|$|E

Sidescan sonars are used to produce complete maps of regions of the sea floor stitching together sequences of <b>sonar</b> images. However, <b>imaging</b> <b>sonar</b> images often lack proper contrast and are degraded by artefacts and distortions due to noise, attitude changes of the AUV/ROV carrying the sonar or non uniform beam patterns. Another common problem with sonar computer vision is the comparatively low frame rate of sonar images.|$|R

40|$|As of today, <b>sonar</b> <b>imaging</b> is {{the most}} {{effective}} means of documenting the subsea environment. Existing <b>sonar</b> <b>imaging</b> systems generally rely on conventional beamforming methods to form the image. While conventional beamformers are robust and simple, they leave many of the challenges of <b>sonar</b> <b>imaging</b> unresolved. Sonar images are often degraded by noise, and the image resolution as well as the range at which useful images can be obtained is limited. This thesis addresses the use of adaptive beamforming and imaging methods applied to active sonar. The goal of an adaptive beamformer in this context is {{to improve the quality of}} the sonar image by allowing the beamformer to adapt to the situation, recognizing sources of noise and interference and suppressing them before they have the chance to contaminate the image. The desired result is an image containing more useful and correct information, less noise, and improved image resolution. Focus has been on investigating how different adaptive methods can be implemented in a practical setting, and analyzing the performance of each method. Key challenges that are addressed include coherent signals, arbitrary array geometries, computational load, and robustness. Two of the most common adaptive beamforming methods, the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) and the amplitude and phase estimation (APES) beamformers, are considered, as well as a low complexity variant of the adaptive MVDR beamformer. Adaptive imaging methods based on aperture coherence represent a promising class of adaptive methods, and are also considered. We conclude that in many cases, improved image quality is obtained by using adaptive beamforming methods...|$|E
