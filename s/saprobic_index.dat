Their methodology was a non-chemical analysis that was based on patterns of abundance and distribution of various biological species. They examined the biological patterns of approximately 800 species of water plants and invertebrates in their studies, and produced a <b>saprobic</b> <b>index</b> of four zones defining levels of water quality. The term [...] "polysaprobic" [...] was used for river environments with a large amount of decaying organic matter; [...] "oligosaprobic" [...] described locations with the least amount of organic waste, while alpha- and beta-"mesosaprobic" [...] defined moderately polluted habitats. Later, this index was expanded into nine zones, with [...] "xenosaprobic" [...] being the least polluted and poly-saprobic" [...] having the highest level of waste.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>saprobic</b> <b>index</b> in {{the middle}} reaches of the Wieseck (at Großen-Buseck) is 1.77 which is {{considered}} [...] "good" [...] according to the WFD standards. In the lower reaches, within the urban area, it is 2.34, which is classified as [...] "moderate". The structural condition, however, should be classified as [...] "poor". Morphologically, large sections of the Wieseck are seriously impaired. Almost 96% of the sections were [...] "significantly distorted" [...] or worse. Only about 4% were classified as having moderate levels of distortion or better, which is the target.Several other indices calculated by evaluating the colonization of the Wieseck with aquatic organisms (macrobenthos), confirm this poor condition. These values, which indicate structural impairment of the river, show that the middle reaches of the Wieseck at Großen- -Buseck are [...] "unsatisfactory", and the lower reaches in the urban area are [...] "poor".Thus, {{on the basis of}} the WFD, which requires a [...] "good ecological condition" [...] by 2015, action is necessary to improve the condition of the river. Such action is envisaged in the coming years.|$|E

The STAR-AQEM method requires the sub-sampling and taxonomic identification of at least one-sixth of the sample and at least 700 individuals.

Sub-sampling effects caused more than 50 % of the overall variance between replicate samples values for 12 of the 27 macroinvertebrate metrics analysed and was generally greatest for metrics that depend {{on the number of}} taxa present. The sampling precision of each metric was estimated by the overall replicate sampling variance as a percentage Psamp of the total variance in metric values within a stream type.

This study aimed to use a large nation-wide database to develop a multimetric index (the Korean Benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biological Integrity—KB-IBI) applicable to the biological assessment of Korean streams. Reference and impaired conditions were determined based on watershed, chemical and physical criteria. Eight of an initial 34 candidate metrics were selected using a stepwise procedure that evaluated metric variability, redundancy, sensitivity and responsiveness to environmental gradients. The selected metrics were number of taxa, percent Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) individuals, percent of a dominant taxon, percent taxa abundance without Chironomidae, Shannon’s diversity index, percent gatherer individuals, ratio of filterers and scrapers, and the Korean <b>saprobic</b> <b>index.</b> Our multimetric index successfully distinguished reference from impaired conditions. A scoring system was established for each core metric using its quartile range and response to anthropogenic disturbances. The multimetric index was classified by aggregating the individualInt. J.

40|$|Most {{parts of}} Tamil Nadu face {{scarcity}} {{of drinking water}} due to conflicts over usage and degradation of water resources. The level of degradation of water resources can be quantified by bio-monitoring technology more than conventional chemical methods. The use of living organisms for monitoring and surveillance of water quality originated from and is used extensively in western countries only, so this attempt is to evaluate the efficacy of a bio-monitoring approach to monitor the water quality in our area’s water resources. In this present investigation several biological communities including phytoplankton, periphyton, microphytobenthos and aquatic macrophytes have had been considered apart from the various physico-chemical factors like water temperature, pH, alkalinity, free CO 2, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and calcium assessments of water quality in two freshwater bodies at Tiruvannamalai from April 2000 to March 2001. From the basic biological data various pollution indices like <b>Saprobic</b> <b>index,</b> Nyggard's index, Palmers algal pollution index, biological index and Shannon-Weiner index were calculated to quantify the water quality of the water bodies. Results showed that the bio-monitoring approaches with the chemical analysis for a 12 months period in two water bodies produced many significant correlations indicating 32 of the 40 comparisons betwee...|$|E
40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of habitats and species diversity in {{streams and rivers}} are strongly influenced by the catchment area. We analysed the influence of selected environmental and spatial variables on the diversity and species composition of epilithic diatom communities in periphyton. Samples were collected along the river course in a torrential river the Kamniška Bistrica. Sampling sites were selected in reaches distributed from the source to the outlet {{of the river and}} were under different influences from the catchment area and with different physical {{and chemical}} characteristics. The most common and dominant diatom species in the periphyton community were Achnanthes biasolettiana and A. minutissima. Achnanthes species often inhabit rivers and springs with moderate organic pollution. Another common diatom taxon was Gomphonema pumilum – a key species indicating oligosaprobic conditions. The results of the canonical correspondence analyses revealed that variance of the periphytic diatom community was explained by water temperature and conductivity as well as altitude. Diatom species richness was positively correlated with <b>saprobic</b> <b>index</b> values and abundance of filamentous algae in the river bed indicating a relatively low organic matter and nutrient input into the river system...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the trophic state of running water and impounded rivers a trophic index was {{developed}} with chemical, physical and biological (diatom) data from 31 different sampling sites of 5 western German 'Laender'. In total, 389 differnt diatom taxa were found. It was possible to classify 105 of them according to their tolerance of ammonia, nitrate, phosphate and total phosphorus. Applying these classified algae {{it is possible to}} value the trophic state of rivers and streams. The Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) has seven classes, 1, 1. 5, 2, [...] . 4. Aim of this new index is to complement the German Saprobic System, which indicates the degree of organic pollution in running water and the biological oxygen demand. The Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) is the trophic counterpart of the <b>Saprobic</b> <b>Index</b> (SI). Together, they represent the antagonistic processes: production (trophic state) and decomposition (saprobic state). Only the application of both these scores meets todays demands on river management.
