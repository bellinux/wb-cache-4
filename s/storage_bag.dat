25|$|A zipper <b>storage</b> <b>bag</b> is {{a plastic}} bag with a sealed or zipped opening that allows for {{transparent}} viewing of stored items inside the bag. Better known under the brand name and genericized trademark Ziploc, zipper storage bags are commonly used to hold perishable foods and snacks. Zipper storage bags were patented by Robert W. Vergobbi on May 18, 1954. However, {{they would not be}} introduced to consumers until 1968, when Dow Chemical introduced the Ziploc bags.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, on both {{commercial}} and recreational suits, [...] "quick-change" [...] rings {{have become increasingly}} common. These are permanently glued to the suit and accessories, either during manufacture or as a retrofit. These systems form a watertight seal between the suit and components using soft rings on both pieces that comprise a series of interlocking channels, similar in principle to a common food <b>storage</b> <b>bag.</b> Quick-change rings allow a diver to easily replace a damaged seal on the surface with no tools or adhesives, or to change attachments depending on conditions–for example, choosing between dry gloves and standard wrist seals. Different manufacturers' ring systems are generally incompatible, so the diver must choose accessories that are designed for the ring system {{on his or her}} suit.|$|E
2500|$|For {{secondary}} erythromelalgia, {{treatment of}} the underlying primary disorder is the most primary method of treatment. Although aspirin has been thought to reduce symptoms of erythromelalgia, it is rare to find evidence that this is effective. Mechanical cooling of the limbs by elevating them can help or managing the ambient environment frequently is often necessary constantly as flares occur due to sympathetic autonomic dysfunction of the capillaries. The pain that accompanies it is severe and treated separately (the pain is similar to CRPS, phantom limb or thalamic pain syndrome). Patients are strongly advised 'NOT' to place the affected limbs in cold water to relieve symptoms when flaring occurs. It may seem a good idea, but it precipitates problems further down the line causing damage to the skin and ulceration often intractable due to the damaged skin. [...] A possible reduction in skin damage may be accomplished by enclosing the flaring limb in a commonly available, thin, heat transparent, water impermeable, plastic food <b>storage</b> <b>bag.</b> [...] The advice of a physician is advised depending on specific circumstances.|$|E

It is also important to the project to develop a local supply chain for PICS bags that makes the technology available to rural farmers, as well as providing development opportunities for local businesses.|$|E

50|$|A tucker bag is a {{traditional}} food or dinner <b>storage</b> <b>bag</b> used in the Australian outback. Typically a tucker bag was carried by a swagman or bushman.

Tucker bags can {{come in a variety}} of sizes and in its larger form can be used for carrying other utensils and sleeping gear other than food. In this way the tucker bag can be regarded as an early form of backpack. Common materials used to make tucker bags were leather or oilskin.|$|E

50|$|Pastry bag {{users who}} do not have a dishwashing machine may prefer to use {{disposable}} bags, and thus avoid hand-washing messy bags. Disposable bags are ready-made in inexpensive plastic. A plastic food <b>storage</b> <b>bag</b> is also commonly used as a pastry bag. For small quantities and fine piping, a pastry bag can be made by rolling cooking parchment or wax paper into a cone, filling it, folding the wide end several times to close it, and then cutting the tip into whatever shape is desired. This is especially useful for small quantities of melted chocolate, since a very small hole can be cut and the bag can be discarded when it cools and becomes clogged.|$|E
50|$|This module was {{originally}} {{used for the}} Official Advanced Dungeons & Dragons tournament at the 1979 Origins International Game Expo (Origins '79). The original printing consisted of forty loose-leaf pages in a zipper <b>storage</b> <b>bag,</b> with a light blue cover; only three hundred copies were printed for sale at Origins '79.

After Origins '79, unsold copies were put up for sale at the Dungeon Shoppe in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Surviving examples of this version are quite rare and are highly prized by collectors.|$|E
