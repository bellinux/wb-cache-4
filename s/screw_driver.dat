40|$|Abstract. Robot {{manipulation}} tasks like inserting {{screws and}} pegs {{into a hole}} or automatic screwing require precise tip pose estimation. We pro-pose a novel method to detect and estimate the tip of elongated objects. We demonstrate that our method can estimate tip pose to millimeter-level accuracy. We adopt a probabilistic, appearance-based object detec-tion framework to detect pegs and bits for electric <b>screw</b> <b>drivers.</b> <b>Screws</b> are difficult to detect with feature- or appearance-based methods due to their reflective characteristics. To overcome this we propose a novel adap-tation of RANSAC with a parallel-line model. Subsequently, we employ image moments to detect the tip and its pose. We show that the pro-posed method allows a robot to perform object insertion with only two pairs of orthogonal views, without visual servoing...|$|R

5000|$|The pistol is {{converted}} to the [...]22 LR configuration by first disassembling the pistol and removing the barrel from the slide. Hold the extractor in the fully extended position by inserting a needle into {{a hole in the}} extractor. When purchased new, the pistol came with a <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> that incorporated a cleaning chain in the hollow handle. The <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> is designed to be inserted into the barrel guide in the slide without scratching the slide. Using the <b>screw</b> <b>driver,</b> the screw is removed from the extractor faceplate and the faceplate removed from the slide, being careful not to dislodge the small spring {{on the end of the}} firing pin. The faceplate is then flipped over and replaced in the slide so that the firing pin is inserted into the upper hole of the faceplate for rimfire operation. The screw is then reinserted into the faceplace. When the faceplate screw is fully tightened, it is important to note that the screw head will protrude from the faceplace slightly and will not be flush with the faceplate as with the centerfire configuration. Insert the [...]22 LR barrel into the frame. Remove the needle to allow the extractor to return to its operational position. The slide is replaced in the frame and the [...]22 LR magazine is inserted to complete the conversion. In the [...]22 LR configuration, the extractor remains extended and always shows the red marking on top. This means that when the pistol is in the [...]22 LR configuration, the extractor always indicates [...] "chamber loaded", even when the chamber is empty.|$|E

5000|$|VE {{follows a}} {{structured}} thought {{process that is}} based exclusively on [...] "function", i.e. what something [...] "does" [...] not what it is.

5000|$|Spiral ratchet <b>screw</b> <b>drivers,</b> often colloquially called Yankee {{screwdrivers}} (a brand name), {{provide a}} special mechanism that transforms linear motion into rotational motion.

The user pushes the handle toward the workpiece, causing a pawl in a spiral groove to rotate the shank and the removable bit. The ratchet can be set to rotate left or right with each push, or can be locked so that the tool can be used like a conventional screwdriver. One disadvantage of this design {{is that if the}} bit slips out of the screw, the resultant sudden extension of the spring may cause the bit to scratch or otherwise damage the workpiece.|$|R

5000|$|North Bros. key {{acquisition}} was {{the hiring}} of Zachary Furbish when it purchased the Forest City Screwdriver Co in 1897. He brought with him patents related to a spiral ratchet <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> and considerable experience in tool design.

Furbish alone would eventually amass 30 patents related to hand tools produced by North Bros., despite passing away in 1906, and his designs would become the backbone of their product lines for years to come. North Bros. tool brand was called Yankee, much like how Sears tools are branded Craftsman, and every tool they sold sported this trademark. In later years the [...] Yankee name would become synonymous with the spiral ratchet <b>screw</b> <b>driver</b> invented by Furbish but it was originally seen on everything from bench vises to cutting tools. Building upon the line of tools originally made by Forest City, North Bros. soon expanded their selection of offerings.

5000|$|Robertson, {{also known}} as a square, or Scrulox [...] screw drive has a {{square-shaped}} socket in the screw head and a square protrusion on the tool. Both the tool and the socket have a taper, which makes inserting the tool easier, and also tends to help keep the screw on the tool tip without the user needing to hold it there. (The taper's earliest reason for being was to make the manufacture of the screws practical using cold forming of the heads, but its other advantages helped popularize the drive.) Robertson screws are commonplace in Canada, though they have been used elsewhere [...] and have become much more common in other countries in recent decades. Robertson screwdrivers are easy to use one-handed, because the tapered socket tends to retain the screw, even if it is shaken. They also allow for the use of angled <b>screw</b> <b>drivers</b> and trim head screws. The socket-headed Robertson screws are self-centering, reduce cam out, stop a power tool when set, and can be removed if painted-over or old and rusty. In industry, they speed up production and reduce product damage. One of their first major industrial uses was the Ford Motor Company's Model A & Model T production. Henry Ford found them highly reliable and saved considerable production time, but when he couldn't secure licensing for them in the United States, limited their production use to his Canadian division. Robertson-head screwdrivers are available in a standard range of tip-sizes, from 1.77mm to 4.85mm. Reed and Prince, also called Frearson, is another historic cross-head screw configuration. The cross in the screw head is sharper and less rounded than a Phillips, and the bit has 45° flukes and a sharper, pointed end. Also, the Phillips screw slot is not as deep as the Reed and Prince slot. In theory, different size R&P screws fit any R&P bit size.|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a {{torque drive}} mechanism utilizing axially translatable, mutually engageable transmission members having mating crown gears, driven and driving members with a three-element drive train being biased together by resilient means or by a fluid actuator system, the apparatus being operable to transmit a precisely controlled degree of torque to a driven member. The apparatus is applicable {{for use in}} hand tools and {{as a replacement for}} impact torque drivers, torque wrenches, motorized <b>screw</b> <b>drivers,</b> or the like, wherein the applied torque must be precisely controlled or limited. The bevel torque drive includes a drive gear which is axially displaceable and rotatable within cylindrical driver housing, a rotatable intermediate gear, and an output gear. Key rotationally secures displaceable gear with respect to input shaft but permits axial movement therebetween. A thrust bearing is preferably connected to the lower end of shaft for support to reduce play and friction between shaft and a transmission joint disc during rotation of the gear train. Coaxially mounted coiled spring is footed against displaceable gear for biasing the displaceable gear toward and into engagement with the intermediate gear for driving intermediate gear and output gear. Torque control is achieved by the use of straight or spiral beveled gears which are of configurations adapted to withdraw from mutual engagement upon the torque exceeding a predetermined limit. The novel, advantageous features of the invention include the configuration of the mating, crown gear sets and the axially translatable, slidable drive gear. The mechanism is capable of transmitting a high degree of torque within a narrow, compact transmission housing. The compact size and narrow, elongated configuration of the housing is particularly applicable for use in hand tools and in multiple torque driver mechanisms in which it is necessary to drive multiple fasteners which are located in close proximity. Prior torque drivers such as 'click-type' torque wrenches do not actually limit torque application but only provide an audible warning that the limit has been reached...|$|R
