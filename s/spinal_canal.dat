5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the <b>spinal</b> <b>canal</b> is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E

25|$|Other {{compressive}} spinal causes include lumbar spinal stenosis, {{a condition}} in which the <b>spinal</b> <b>canal</b> (the spaces the spinal cord runs through) narrows and compresses the spinal cord, cauda equina, or sciatic nerve roots.

40|$|Background: Laminectomy is a {{major method}} to treat lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} (LSS), but it has lots of flaws such as scar tissue can form around the dura again or spinal instability. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of transverse rotation laminoplasty (TRL) {{in the treatment of}} LSS. Methods: The mimic operations of TRL were performed both in the computerized image processing and on the lumbar specimen. Computed tomography (CT) images were either collected from 80 clinical patients with complaints of lumbago or obtained from 40 sets of lumbar specimens after rebuild of <b>spinal</b> <b>canals.</b> In the CT image processing the heights of the spinous process and laminae at L 3 -L 5 were measured. The total length of the spinous process plus one side laminae after the operation was evaluated and compared with the length of inner margin of pedical before the operation. The areas of the vertebral canal were examined before and after the operation. Results: In the CT images, the height of spinous process of L 3, L 4 and L 5 was 24. 74 ± 3. 45, 22. 68 ± 5. 96 and 21. 54 ± 4. 12 mm respectively, and that of laminae was 23. 66 ± 2. 32, 22. 68 ± 5. 36 and 20. 99 ± 3. 67 mm respectively (P > 0. 05). Distance of inner border of pedical of L 3, L 4 and L 5 was 23. 01 ± 6. 59, 24. 65 ± 5. 54 and 26. 03 ± 7. 34 mm respectively, and length of spinous process with laminae of those was 29. 76 ± 4. 91, 29. 31 ± 6. 43 and 32. 53 ± 5. 76 mm respectively (P < 0. 05). Preoperative area of <b>spinal</b> <b>canals</b> of L 3, L 4 and L 5 was 299. 81 ± 10. 09, 297. 66 ± 9. 54 and 308. 22 ± 10. 04 mm 2 respectively, and postoperative area was 480. 01 ± 9. 33, 487. 32 ± 8. 65 and 501. 03 ± 9. 12 mm 2 respectively (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Until recently, {{material}} {{removed from}} the intervertebral disc (IVD) at surgery consisted either of 'loose bodies' from {{the centre of the}} IVD or discal tissue displaced (prolapsed) into the intervertebral root or <b>spinal</b> <b>canals.</b> This material is best regarded as a by-product of disc degeneration and therefore not representative of the disease process itself. Recent advances in surgical techniques, particularly anterior fusion, in which large segments of the anterior part of the IVD are excised with the anatomical relationships between different components intact, have generated material that can be investigated with modern molecular and cell biological techniques. This is an important area of study because degeneration of the lumbar IVDs is associated, perhaps causally, with low back pain, {{one of the most common}} and debilitating conditions in the West. 'Degeneration' carries implications of inevitable progression of wear-and-tear associated conditions. Modern research on human IVD tissue has shown that this is far from the case and that disruption of the micro-anatomy described as degeneration is an active process, regulated by locally produced molecules. The exciting consequence of this observation is the possibility of being able to inhibit or even reverse the processes of degeneration using targeted therapy...|$|R
40|$|In {{descriptions}} of surgical procedures in mandible, often {{there is no}} mention of an anatomical variance, the genial spinal foramina, where nerves and vessels go through. Aim of this study is to investigate frequency, shape, and dimensions of these foramina. 56 computed tomography dentascans were analyzed with an implant planning software. The considered parameters were frequency, number, position, diameters, and length of canals; the collected data were inserted in a spreadsheet and statistically analyzed; therefore, they were compared with those found in the literature. The measurements agree with the ones found in earlier studies, except for the length of the inferior <b>spinal</b> <b>canals,</b> which resulted lesser than that found in the literature. The frequency of the inferior spinal foramina, the data related to the inferior spinal foramina diameter (cross scan), and the measurements related to the superior spinal foramina diameter (axial scan) resulted to be major compared to those reported in literature. These obtained results are clinically interesting because an implant planning software has been employed, daily used by operators, and that permits in vivo investigations.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundLumbar spinal {{stenosis}} (LSS) {{is a growing}} health problem and {{a leading cause of}} disability and loss of independence in older adults. It is usually caused by age-related degenerative narrowing of the <b>spinal</b> <b>canals</b> leading to compression and ischemia of the spinal nerves and symptoms of neurogenic claudication. Limited walking ability is the dominant functional impairment caused by LSS. Animal studies suggest increased blood flow to the spinal nerves and spinal cord with superficial paraspinal electrical stimulation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the effectiveness of paraspinal transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) applied while walking on walking ability in patients with LSS. Methods/DesignWe propose to conduct a 2 -arm double-blinded (participant and assessor) randomized controlled trial. We will recruit individuals who have limited walking ability due to degenerative LSS from hospital specialists, community physicians, and chiropractors located in the city of Toronto, Canada. Eligible consenting participants will be randomly assigned to either paraspinal TENS or placebo paraspinal TENS applied while walking. The primary outcome will be walking distance measured during a single self-paced walking test. We will calculate the differences in proportions among participants in both groups who achieve at least a 30 % improvement in walking distance from baseline using Pearson χ 2 test with 95 % confidence intervals. DiscussionEffective nonoperative interventions for LSS are unknown. Interventions that can improve blood flow to the spinal nerves while walking may increase walking ability in this population. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is a low-cost intervention that may have the potential to achieve this objective. To our knowledge, this study will be the first clinical trial to assess the effects of TENS on walking ability of patients with LSS. Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials. gov ID: NCT 0259264...|$|R

25|$|Spinal disc herniation, {{also known}} as a slipped disc, is a medical {{condition}} affecting the spine in which a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an intervertebral disc allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings. Disc herniation is usually due to age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the anulus fibrosus, although trauma, lifting injuries, or straining have been implicated as well. Tears are almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the <b>spinal</b> <b>canal.</b> This tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which may directly cause severe pain {{even in the absence of}} nerve root compression.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the <b>spinal</b> <b>canal</b> can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E
40|$|A herniated lumbar disc is a {{very common}} disease of the spine. However, {{not all of the}} disc {{fragments}} are located at the expected site.

40|$|Objective: Disc herniations at the L 1 -L 2 and L 2 -L 3 {{levels are}} {{different}} from those at lower levels of the lumbar spine with regard to clinical characteristics and surgical outcome. <b>Spinal</b> <b>canals</b> are narrower than those of lower levels, which may compromise multiple spinal nerve roots or conus medullaris. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical features and surgical outcomes of upper lumbar disc herniations. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of 41 patients who had undergone surgery for single disc herniations at the L 1 -L 2 and L 2 - 3 levels from 1998 to 2007. The affected levels were L 1 -L 2 in 14 patients and L 2 -L 3 in 27 patients. Presenting symptoms and signs, patient characteristics, radiologic findings, operative methods, and surgical outcomes were investigated. Results: The mean age of patients with upper lumbar disc was 55. 5 years (ranged 31 to 78). The mean follow-up period was 16. 6 months. Most patients complained of back and buttock pain (38 patients, 92 %), and radiating pain in areas such as the anterior or anterolateral aspect of the thigh (32 patients, 78 %). Weakness of lower extremities was observed in 16 patients (39 %) and sensory disturbance was presented in 19 patients (46 %). Only 6 patients (14 %) had undergone previous lumbar disc surgery. Discectomy was performed using three methods: unilateral laminectomy in 27 cases, bilateral laminectomy in 3 cases, and the transdural approach in 11 cases, which were performed through total laminectomy in 10 cases and unilateral laminectomy in 1 case. With regard to surgical outcomes, preoperative symptoms improved significantly in 33 patients (80. 5 %), partially in 7 patients (17 %), and were aggravated in 1 patient (2. 5 %). Conclusion: Clinical features of disc herniations at the L 1 -L 2 and L 2 -L 3 levels were variable, and localized sensory change or pain was rarely demonstrated. In most cases, the discectomy was performed successfully by conventional posterior laminectomy. On the other hand, in larg...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess histologically {{the true}} {{content of the}} {{superior}} genial spinal foramen and to match these findings to the microanatomical canal content observed using high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the same region. METHODS: Ten human mandibular specimens were imaged using a 9. 4 Tesla MRI unit. Afterwards, eight specimens were decalcified, embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned (7 microm) for histological examination; the remaining two were embedded in methylmethacrylate and sectioned (50 - 60 microm). All sections were examined using routine light microscopy to inspect the superior genial spinal foramen region and its content. RESULTS: Histological observations of the superior genial spinal foramen confirmed {{the presence of a}} well-defined neurovascular bundle, with branches of the lingual nerve and lingual artery. The canal had an average diameter exceeding 1 mm and could thus be considered significant.
