5000|$|Law {{concluded}} that the bridge as designed if perfect in execution would not have failed in the way seen(Cochrane went further; it 'would be standing now'). The calculations assumed the bridge to be largely as designed, with all components in their intended position, and the ties reasonably evenly loaded. If the bridge had failed at lower wind loadings, this was evidence that the defects in design and workmanship he had objected to had given uneven loadings, significantly reduced the bridge strength and invalidated the calculation. Hence I consider that in such a structure {{the thickness of the}} columns should have been determined, every individual column should have been examined, and not passed until it had received upon it the mark of the person who passed it as a guarantee that it had passed under his inspection ...I consider that every bolt should have been a <b>steady</b> <b>pin,</b> and should have fitted the holes to which it was applied, that every strut should have had a firm abutment, that the joints of the columns should have been incapable of movement, and that the parts should have been accurately fitted together, storey by storey upon land and carefully marked and put together again as they had been properly fitted.|$|E
50|$|Film perforations, {{also known}} as perfs, are the holes placed in the film stock during {{manufacturing}} and used for transporting (by sprockets and claws) and <b>steadying</b> (by <b>pin</b> registration) the film. Films may have different types of perforations depending on film gauge, film format, and intended usage. Perforations are also used as a standard measuring reference within certain camera systems {{to refer to the}} size of the frame.|$|R

50|$|An {{escapement}} is {{the mechanism}} in a mechanical timepiece {{that gives the}} balance wheel pushes to keep it moving back and forth, and releases the timepiece's gears to advance a fixed amount with each swing of the wheel, thus moving the hands forward at a <b>steady</b> rate. The <b>pin</b> pallet escapement {{is similar to the}} lever escapement, which is used in quality watches, except that the horizontal jewel pallets on the lever are replaced with vertical metal pins, and the shape of the escape wheel teeth is modified.|$|R
50|$|To {{keep his}} arm, hand, fingers, microscope, graver (burin), and <b>pin</b> <b>steady</b> enough for this most {{delicate}} job of engraving, Lundberg assembled an original {{piece of equipment}} that clamped everything rigid except {{the tips of his}} fingers. Alvin H. Hankins, a jeweler and lens grinder that knew Lundberg and eventually was his employer in Seattle, was present during most of the engraving. In the early 1930s he wrote to Ripley's Believe It or Not in response to one of their cartoons (Dec. 16, 1929) that wrongly credited a Mr. Charles Baker with engraving the pin.|$|R
40|$|Aglycone flavonols {{are thought}} to {{modulate}} auxin transport in Arabidopsis thaliana via an as yet undefined mechanism. Biochemical studies suggest that flavonoids interact with regulatory proteins rather than directly with the PIN auxin efflux facilitator proteins. Auxin transport is enhanced {{in the absence of}} flavonoids (transparent testa 4 [tt 4]) and reduced in the presence of excess flavonols (tt 7 and tt 3). <b>Steady</b> state <b>PIN</b> mRNA levels in roots inversely correlate with auxin movement in tt mutants. PIN gene transcription and protein localization in flavonoid-deficient mutants appear to be modulated by developmental cues and are auxin responsive. Modulation of PIN gene expression and protein distribution by localized auxin accumulations occurs in the wild type as well. Flavonoids inhibit auxin transport primarily at the shoot apex and root tip and appear to modulate vesicular cycling of PIN 1 at the root tip. In some auxin-accumulating tissues, flavonoid increases and changes in flavonoid speciation are subsequent to auxin accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if significant differences existed in college performance and in selected areas of attitude and opinion between male upperclassmen residing in fraternities and non-fraternity male upperclassmen living in residence halls. Two samples consisting of (a) 86 upperclassmen from the residence halls and (b) 100 upperclassmen from the fraternities were selected. The data were gathered from the sample member's permanent files in the Office of the Dean of Men and from the administration of the College Student Questionnaire, Part II, to the samples. The results were subjected to statistical analysis to determine the validity of the following hypotheses: a) there is no significant difference in college grade point average for the freshman and sophomore years between those upperclassmen living in residence halls and those residing in fraternities when any differences in ability as indicated by high school grade point average and college aptitude test scores are taken into account; b) there is no significant difference on any one of the following areas, as measured by the College Student Quesionnaire, Part II, between those upperclassmen living in residence halls and those residing in fraternities: satisfaction with the faculty; satisfaction with the administration; satisfaction with major; satisfaction with students; study habits; extracurricular involvement; family independence; peer independence; liberalism; social conscience; and cultural sophistication. Findings indicated that there were statistically significant differences at the five percent level of confidence favoring the residence hall men in the areas of social conscience and satisfaction with major and at the one percent level of confidence in the area of peer independence. Significant differences favoring the fraternity upperclassmen were found in the area of extracurricular involvement at the one percent level of confidence. Analysis of other demographic data obtained from the College Student Questionnaire indicated two areas that were significantly different: (1) a significantly greater number of fraternity men were going <b>steady,</b> <b>pinned</b> or engaged; and (2) a significantly greater number of residence hall men utilized parents, jobs and loans as their main source of financial support while a greater number of fraternity men utilized scholarships, trust funds and savings...|$|R

40|$|Short range {{correlated}} uniform {{noise in}} the dispersion coefficient, inherent in many types of optical fibers, broadens and eventually destroys all initially ultra-short pulses. However, under the constraint that the integral of the random component of the dispersion coefficient is set to zero, or pinned, periodically or quasi-periodically along the fiber, {{the nature of the}} pulse propagation changes dramatically. For the case that randomness is added to constant positive dispersion, the pinning restriction significantly reduces pulse broadening. If the randomness is added to piecewise constant periodic dispersion, the pinning may even provide probability distributions of pulse parameters that are numerically indistinguishable from the statistically <b>steady</b> case. The <b>pinning</b> method can be used to both manufacture better fibers and upgrade existing fiber links. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on dynamic problems in political economy. The first essay studies motivated communication on networks. Agents have some hard information about the world and choose whether to tell their neighbors. Information received from other agents can be shared in later meetings. Agents' preferences are mis-aligned, tempting senders to lie by omission. The model yields three main conclusions. First, there is incomplete learning. Second, signals that {{are close to the}} mean are more likely to propagate. The reason is that moderate signals travel in both directions, whereas extreme signals are communicated in a predictable direction, which stifles their propagation. Third, if agents are forward-looking, concerns about informational cascades lead to segmentation: agents with close preferences hide information from each other to prevent it from traveling further. The second essay analyzes the evolution of organizations that allow free entry and exit of members, such as cities, trade unions, religious organizations and cooperatives. The organization chooses a policy, which influences the set of agents who want to become members, but current members decide policy in the next period. This generates feedback effects: an organization with a policy x may attract a population with a median-preferred policy higher than x, so a higher policy will be chosen in the next period; but the new policy will attract members wanting an even higher policy, and so on. The set of <b>steady</b> states is <b>pinned</b> down by the preference distribution; equilibrium paths converge to these steady states depending on the starting position. Unlike in models with a fixed population, a small change in the preference distribution can cause dramatic changes in the long-run policy. The third essay studies the impact of term limits on elections where biased candidates compete through ability investments and platform choice. Good politicians facing weak competition extract policy rents, which lowers welfare. Moreover, incumbents exacerbate rent extraction by deterring challenger entry. Term limits alleviate this problem by creating open elections. However, they also lower incumbent quality, so their overall impact is ambiguous. Strong limits are better when politicians are more biased, and challengers' entry cost is intermediate. by Germán Sergio Gieczewski. Thesis: Ph.
