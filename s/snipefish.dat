50|$|The Centriscidae are {{a family}} of fishes from the order Syngnathiformes which {{includes}} the <b>snipefishes,</b> shrimpfishes, and bellowfishes. A small family, consisting of only about a dozen marine species, they are of an unusual appearance, as reflected by their common names. The members of the genera Aeoliscus and Centriscus are restricted to relatively shallow, tropical parts of the Indo-Pacific, while the remaining species mainly are found in deeper parts of tropical, subtropical or southern oceans.|$|R

50|$|The <b>snipefishes</b> (genus Macroramphosus) are {{species of}} fishes found in {{tropical}} and subtropical oceans at depths down to 600 m. According to FishBase, {{they are part}} of the family Centriscidae, but some authorities split that family, in which case the genus Macroramphosus is in the family Macroramphosidae. They have long second spines on their dorsal fins and tiny mouths at the tip of their greatly elongated snouts. Their bodies are more streamlined than in the related bellowfishes. They reach a maximum length of about 20 cm, and are silvery or reddish in colour. They are sometimes found in large schools.|$|R
5000|$|The bellowfishes or bellowsfishes are fishes in {{the genus}} Notopogon {{in the family}} Centriscidae.

[...] According to FishBase, {{they are part of the}} family Centriscidae, but some authorities split that family, in which case the genus Notopogon is in the family Macroramphosidae. They have long second spines on their dorsal fins and tiny mouths at the tip of their greatly elongated snouts. Their bodies are relatively high (giving them a somewhat hunchbacked appearance), unlike the related <b>snipefishes.</b> They reach a maximum length of about 34 cm, and are silvery or reddish in colour.|$|R

50|$|The larvae {{feed upon}} {{a variety of}} {{zooplankton}} along with drifting fish eggs and other larvae. They progress to feeding {{on a wide range}} of fishes, particularly scombrids, such as mackerel and tuna, squid, and especially near oceanic islands and coral reefs, on juvenile inshore fish. Studies of stomach contents have found that smaller schooling scombrids such as frigate mackerel, bullet tuna, and skipjack tuna make up a substantial proportion of their diet. Squid and deep-sea fishes such as pomfret and snake mackerel are also important prey items in certain areas. Blue marlin have been recorded to take prey as large as white marlin, as well as yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the 100-lb range. Conversely, they are also capable of feeding on small but numerous prey such as filefish and <b>snipefish.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the Azores fish made {{up all of}} {{the diet}} and the most {{important}} species in the diet of Sphyraena viridensis was the bluejack mackerel Trachurus picturatus being found as having been preyed upon by 72.4% of the fish sampled and making up nearly two thirds of the weight of prey taken. Other species taken in this study included single examples of bogue Boops boops, ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo and axillary sea bream Pagellus acarnae, as well as an unidentified species of the Exocoetidae. Unidentofied fish remains were found in nearly 20% of the specimens sampled. In the same study the predatory behaviour of S.viridensis was observed and they are active pursuit predators of fish with one or many barracudas pursuing fish, either singling out lone prey or attacking shoals of prey fish. The pursuit was rapid and was usually over in 8-40 seconds and the more fish were involved the higher the rate of success was. In these observations other fish species than those sampled from specimens were observed as prey e.g. longspine <b>snipefish</b> Macrorhamphosus scolopax and boar fish Capros aper. It is also known to feed on cephalopods and crustaceans.In summer they form schools of up to 180 fish, although most schools number 30-40 fish, in areas where there are strong currents. These schools are predominantly made up of sub-adult fish with the smaller fish nearer to the surface and the larger, usually female, fish {{at the bottom of the}} school at depths of up to 30m. In winter the only aggregations are small groups of juveniles in shallow bays. No territorial behaviour was observed. Schooling is thought to be an anti predator defence and to facilitate mating with the smaller males being attracted to the larger females, in addition groups of barracudas were more successful in hunting prey fish than single fish. This species does not appear to mix with other barracuda species in mixed schools but there are reports of these fish associating with whale sharks in the Azores and an instance of them actively swimming towards a manta ray Mobula tarapacana.|$|E
40|$|Data from 10 {{acoustic}} surveys targeting sardine (spring and autumn), 3 acoustic surveys targeting {{blue whiting}} (spring) and 9 groundfish surveys (summer and autumn) {{were used to}} describe the distribution and relative abundance of <b>snipefish</b> (Macroramphosus spp.) off Portugal and the Gulf of Cadiz in recent years (1998 - 2003). <b>Snipefish</b> (8 - 17 cm) were regularly found off Portugal, occasionally in large concentrations, but were absent from the Gulf of Cadiz. Off northern Portugal, <b>snipefish</b> were distributed along the outer shelf and upper slope, clearly separated from sardine (the most abundant species in the inner shelf) and partially overlapping with blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), the most abundant species in the upper slope. <b>Snipefish</b> were most abundant in the outer shelf of south-western Portugal, preferentially distributed in large aggregations around the Canyon of Setubal and partially overlapping with the distribution of boarfish (Capros aper) and blue whiting (both abundant in the upper slope of south-western Portugal). Off southern Portugal <b>snipefish</b> were almost exclusively distributed in the outer shelf and were significantly smaller than in south-western (intermediate) and northern Portugal (large). Acoustic estimates of total <b>snipefish</b> biomass ranged between 176 â€“ 504 thousand tonnes within the study period, with more than half off south-western Portugal. Within the period 1998 - 2003, and despite the lack of directed fishing activity, a marked decline in abundance and a small but significant increase in mean length were observed, particularly off south-western Portugal...|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{behaviour}} of two potentially competing species, the longspine <b>snipefish,</b> Macroramphosus scolopax, and the boarfish Capros aper was examined. While both species are very abundant along the Mediterranean coast and are regularly caught by demersal trawlers, {{they are of}} no commercial value. The diets of boarfish and longspine <b>snipefish</b> were investigated from samples collected between January 2001 and May 2002. Variations in the diet with fish size and season, as well as diet overlap and diversity were explored. Mysid shrimps, amphipods and gastropods {{were the most important}} food items in the diet of longspine <b>snipefish.</b> During ontogenetic development, M. scolopax occupies different trophic levels: the diet shifts from being predominantly composed of mysids (Anchialina agilis, Lophogaster typicus, Erythrops sp., Leptomysis spp.) in the smaller longspine <b>snipefish</b> [ 6. 5 cm TL). Crustacean decapods and copepods were the most important prey in the stomachs of boarfish. Mysids (Lo. typicus), euphausiids and nematodes were present in the larger individuals (> 8 cm TL). A more generalist diet, still containing copepods, crustacean decapods, gastropods (Limacina retroversa) and a large variety of amphipods (e. g. Phtysica marina, Stenotoe bosphorana) and mysids (e. g. A. agilis, Leptomysis spp., Erythrops sp.), dominated the diet of C. aper between 2 and 8 cm TL. Diet overlap between longspine <b>snipefish</b> and boarfish was very low and the differences in stomach species diversity were explained by season and fish size...|$|E
40|$|Specimens of the <b>snipefish,</b> Macroramphosus scolopax (Linnaeus, 1758), {{from the}} middle and {{southern}} Adriatic were biometrically analyzed during the demersal communities research project, MEDITS.

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the effects}} of a square mesh codend bycatch {{reduction}} device (BRD) and turtle excluder device (TED) in the deepwater eastern king prawn (Melicertus plebejus) fishery on the southeast Queensland coast, based upon on a 10 -day research charter. The bycatch comprised 224 taxa, mainly gurnards, flatheads, sandpaper fish, hermit and charybdid crabs, mantis shrimps, sand dollars (i. e. sea urchins), dragonets, <b>snipefish,</b> carids and lizardfish. The total mean bycatch rate was comparatively low (1114. 0 g haâˆ’ 1 from the standard diamond mesh codend), mainly because of the relatively deep waters associated with the fishery. When the TED and square mesh codend BRD were used together the total mean bycatch rate was significantly reduced by 29...|$|E
40|$|Tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) and {{thornback ray}} (Raja clavata) {{are the two}} most {{captured}} elasmobranch species by the Azorean bottom longline fishery. In order to better understand the trophic dynamics of these species in the Azores, the diets of thornback ray and tope shark caught in this area during 1996 and 1997 were analyzed to describe feeding patterns and to investigate the effect of sex, size, and depth and area of capture on diet. Thornback rays fed mainly upon fishes and reptants, but also upon polychaetes, mysids, natant crustaceans, isopods, and cephalopods. In the Azores, this species preyed more heavily upon fish compared with the predation patterns described in other areas. Differences in the diet may be due to differences in the environments (e. g. in the Azores, seamounts and oceanic islands are the major topographic features, whereas in all other studies, continental shelves have been the major topographic feature). No differences were observed in the major prey consumed between the sexes or between size classes (49 âˆ’ 60, 61 âˆ’ 70, 71 âˆ’ 80, and 81 âˆ’ 93 cm TL). Our study indicates that rays inhabiting different depths and areas (coastal or offshore banks) prey upon different resources. This appears {{to be related to the}} relative abundance of prey with habitat. Tope sharks were found to prey almost exclusively upon teleost fish: small shoaling fish, mainly boarfish (Capros aper) and <b>snipefish</b> (Macroramphosus scolopax), were the most frequent prey. This study illustrates that thornback rays and tope sharks are top predators in waters off the Azores...|$|E
