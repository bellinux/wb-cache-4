5|$|After {{leading his}} state to another Sheffield Shield title and {{a win over}} England, Miller {{replaced}} Morris as the vice-captain for the tour of the West Indies that started in early 1955. Australia was looking for its first series win against any team in three years, having lost two consecutive series to England. Australia batted first in the opening Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica. Miller came to the wicket at 2/137 {{and put on a}} 224-run partnership with Harvey. Both ended with centuries and Miller scored his highest Test score of 147, striking 15fours. When Valentine and Ramadhin had conceded 100runs, he respectively <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> hands. Australia finished at 9/515. Johnson had been injured when hit in the foot by a yorker so Miller was left in charge of the team on the field with Australia one bowler short. Miller attempted to unsettle the batsmen by placing many men close to the bat in an attempt to insult their batting capabilities. He took the new ball at 5/239 and the hosts collapsed to be all out for 259. Miller had taken 2/36, and enforced the follow-on, which was questioned as paceman Ron Archer had broken down. With Australia two bowlers short, the West Indies moved to 1/114. When Weekes arrived at the crease, Miller unsettled him with delaying tactics, and he was out for one. He then placed two silly points and two silly mid-ons in an attempt to unsettle Walcott, who fell to Lindwall soon after. Miller then took two wickets and the hosts had lost three wickets in as many overs. The West Indies were bowled out and Australia won by nine wickets. Miller had taken 3/62 in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|With the Grande Armée in full retreat, another {{dangerous}} situation occurred on 29 October. With Bavaria now {{also in the}} camp of the Coalition, an Austro-Bavarian army of some 45,000 men, under General Karl Philipp von Wrede, who had fought {{under the command of}} the Emperor during the previous campaigns, tried to block the French retreat and delay the French force until the arrival {{of the rest of the}} Coalition forces. Wrede had the means necessary to achieve his goal, as he possessed a numerous artillery of about one hundred pieces and a powerful cavalry of 50 squadrons. In comparison, the French forces were much dispersed and only a few units remained cohesive and combat-capable. During the ensuing Battle of Hanau, Wrede placed his troops in front of the forest of Lamboi, through which he expected that the French would retreat. He also positioned almost all of his cavalry on the left, placing it under the command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Spleny. Despite his numeric inferiority, Napoleon sent forward a part of his men against Bavarians deployed in the forest before him, but the intervention of the Foot Guards was soon required. The Bavarians had fought alongside the French in the past and the sight of the fearsome Bearskins of French Guardsmen <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> morale and they abandoned their position in the forest after a brief fight. But, with the fire of a Bavarian grand battery upon them, the French infantry soon had to stop. Napoleon positioned General Le Noury's artillery in battery and brought in support General Drouot with the horse artillery of the Guard, as well as other pieces, constituting a grand battery of some 50 pieces that was soon able to respond adequately to the Austro-Bavarian cannonade. Nansouty, with the Guard Dragoons and Lancers, was instructed to protect this battery from the enemy and thus positioned his men behind the guns.|$|E
25|$|Following the Twenty20 Cup, Kent {{still had}} not <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> losing habit, {{although}} losing the toss against Sussex probably {{had something to do}} with their 66-run loss - they were forced to bat in poorer conditions. A loss in the C Trophy quarter-finals followed, not all that surprising given Kent's one-day form, and that meant Kent's only realistic chances of winning anything this season were in the County Championship, and after giving up 457 runs in the first innings against Surrey that looked difficult. However, they chased 232 in 35 evening overs to take 21 points and retain the lead in the Championship. In a National League match shortened to 16 overs due to rain, Kent lost to Somerset by eight wickets, and they also lost to Warwickshire in a midweek match in the National League, but beat Yorkshire in their last match of July, also a one-day game.|$|E

He was 'Sick up to here with it'... and those that heard <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset.

2500|$|Initially {{optimistic about}} the state of their defences the staff at GQG became more nervous after the fall of Sedan on 14 May. [...] Struggling to find {{reserves}} to stem the German advance the GQG officers worked longer and longer hours and relations with other units became fraught. [...] On 19 May Gamelin, who had been under pressure from president of the CSG Paul Reynaud to resign since before the offensive, was replaced by General Maxime Weygand. [...] Weygand's arrival restored some energy to GQG and improved relations with Georges but worsening results in the field and the unfolding collapse of the French army soon <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> confidence.|$|E

Krantz {{reports that}} in 1969, John Green (who owned a first-generation {{copy of the}} original Patterson film) interviewed Disney executive Ken Peterson, who, after viewing the Patterson film, asserted [...] "that their technicians {{would not be able}} to duplicate the film". Krantz argues that if Disney personnel were unable to duplicate the film, there is little likelihood that Patterson could have done so. Greg Long writes, [...] "Byrne cited his trip to Walt Disney studios in 1972, where Disney's chief of animation and four assistants viewed Patterson's footage and praised it as a beautiful piece of work although, they said, it must have been shot in a studio. When Byrne told them it had been shot in the woods of Northern California, 'They <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> heads and walked away.'" ...|$|E

"Soon, {{with the}} {{composition}} of the musical illustrations for Pictures from an Exhibition by the architect Hartmann, he reached the acme of that musical radicalism, to whose 'new shores' and to whose 'unfathomed depths' the admirers of his 'Peepshows' and 'Savishnas' had pushed him so diligently. In music for these illustrations, as Mussorgsky called them, he represented , children, Baba Yaga in her wooden house on chicken legs, catacombs, gates, and even rattling carts. All this was not done jokingly, but 'seriously'.""There was no end to the enthusiasm shown by his devotees; but many of Mussorgsky's friends, on the other hand, and especially the comrade composers, were seriously puzzled and, listening to the 'novelty,' <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> heads in bewilderment. Naturally, Mussorgsky noticed their bewilderment and seemed to feel that he 'had gone too far.' He set the illustrations aside without even trying to publish them. Mussorgsky devoted himself exclusively to Khovanshchina." ...|$|E

"Sitting in the Midday Sun" [...] was {{released}} {{during a period}} of turmoil for The Kinks—bandleader Ray Davies' marital problems with his wife Rasa came to a head nine days before the song's UK release when she left him, taking their children with her. Ray went into a state of depression; Doug Hinman wrote about his condition: [...] "a week following his wife's departure, an emotionally distraught Ray [...] admitted to hospital for suspected barbiturate poisoning. He [...] treated and released." [...] Shortly after the incident, on 15 July, The Kinks made an infamous appearance at the White City Stadium. According to a Melody Maker review of the concert, [...] "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'.... He was 'Sick up to here with it'... and those that heard <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> heads. Mick [...] just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummed on through 'Waterloo Sunset.

2500|$|By {{then other}} {{men who had}} known about the duel were {{arriving}} at the scene, including Decatur's friend and mentor, the senior officer John Rodgers. In excruciating pain, Decatur was carefully lifted by the surgeons and placed in Rodgers' carriage and was carried {{back to his home}} on Lafayette Square. Before they departed Decatur called out to Barron that he should also be taken along, but Rodgers and the surgeons calmly <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> heads in disapproval. Barron cried back [...] "God bless you, Decatur" [...] – and with a weak voice Decatur called back [...] "Farewell, farewell, Barron." [...] Upon arrival at his home Decatur was taken in to the front room just left of the front entrance, still conscious. Before allowing himself to be carried in he insisted that his wife and nieces be taken upstairs, sparing them the sight of his grave condition. A Dr. Thomas Simms arrived from his home nearby to give his assistance to the naval physicians. However, for reasons not entirely clear to historians, Decatur refused to have the ball extracted from his wound. [...] At this point Decatur requested that his will be brought forward so as to receive his signature, granting his wife all his worldly possessions, with directives as to who would be the executors of his will. Decatur died at approximately 10:30pm that night. While wounded, he is said to have cried out, [...] "I did not know that any man could suffer such pain!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th, the first {{parallel}} was successfully started at a distance of [...] from the Castle. Across the river, gabions were set up opposite San Cristobal and earth was brought up to fill them, but they were obliterated by French artillery fire in the morning. By the morning of 3 June, 16 24-pound cannons and four howitzers were emplaced against the Castle. Earlier, a battery was set up against San Cristobal but it proved to be ineffective because it was [...] distant. By using wool packs, eight-gun and five-gun batteries were finally established [...] from San Cristobal with a four-gun support battery right behind. The guns began battering Badajoz on 3 June and silenced the guns of San Cristobal. That day, the French knocked out one gun, but four more were out of action because of defects in the siege guns. The ancient pieces tended to droop at the muzzle if fired too quickly, often blew out their vents, or <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> old carriages to pieces. On the 4th, the French put a second gun out of action near the Castle, but two more were disabled by muzzle drooping and three howitzers had their carriages damaged by their own firing. On the north side, two cannons and two howitzers went out of commission because of similar problems. The bombardment continued through 5 and 6 June. The Castle proved very resistant to shot but the San Cristobal fort showed considerable damage.|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 24 February, Thiers arrived at the Tuileries and met with the King, who was in despair. He met also with Marshal Bugeaud, and learned that the army had only sixteen {{thousand}} men available; they were short of ammunition and exhausted. During the night, more barricades had appeared all over Paris. Thiers proposed withdrawing the army to Saint-Cloud, gathering his forces, and marching back into Paris with a full army (the strategy he followed in 1871 during the Paris Commune), but Marshal Bugeaud wanted to attack the barricades immediately; [...] he told the King that it would cost twenty thousand lives; [...] the King told Bugeaud that the price was too high, and called off the attack. The army columns began to disintegrate, as the soldiers joined the demonstrators. Thiers urged the King to flee to Saint-Cloud, but the King insisted on having his regular breakfast at 10:30a.m., and then put on the uniform of a Lieutenant General to review the four thousand regular soldiers and two legions of National Guards gathered in the courtyard of the Tuileries. As he rode by, the regular soldiers cheered the King, but the National Guardsmen called out [...] "Down the Ministers! Down with the system!" [...] and <b>shook</b> <b>their</b> weapons at the King. The King abruptly turned around rode back to Palace, where he sat in an armchair, head in his hands. [...] "Everything is lost," [...] he said to Theirs. [...] "I am overwhelmed," [...] Thiers responded coldly, [...] "I've known that for a long time." [...] His family urged him to remain and fight. The King turned to his marshals and generals and to Thiers and asked if there was any alternative, but they were silent. The King slowly wrote out and signed his act of abdication, changed from his uniform into civilian clothes, and left through the gardens of the Tuileries. A carriage took him out of Paris to Saint-Cloud, and soon afterwards he crossed the Channel to exile in England.|$|E
