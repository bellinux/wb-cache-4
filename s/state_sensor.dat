40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper proposes a "transduction path" {{method of analysis}} for solid <b>state</b> <b>sensors.</b> It {{is based upon the}} idea that a sensor represents a transduction path from some input measurand to an electrical output. The transduction path may consist of one or more transduction or modification principles drawn from all fields of science. Also proposed is a "transduction path diagram" which provides a graphical representation of a transduction path. Background material concerning the development and description of solid <b>state</b> <b>sensors</b> is presented. Sensor measurands are identified and categorized by energy form.

40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 79 year-old patient with megaesophagus and aphagia, who {{required}} percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding. Megaesophagus was considered the sole cause of aphagia by the referring secondary hospital. Solid <b>state</b> <b>sensor</b> videofluoromanometry (VFM) showed a substantial decrease in manometric values within the hypopharynx along with good relaxation of the upper-esophageal sphincter (UES). This led to electromyography (EMG), which showed features compatible with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG). The diagnosis of MG was confirmed by an intravenous injection of edrophonium chloride, performed under VFM monitoring. The co-existence of MG and megaesophagus rarely occurs in humans; although, most small animals, such as dogs, cats, and rodents, present with megaesophagus as an initial symptom of MG...|$|E

40|$|Nanoelectromechanical systems, or NEMS, are MEMS scaled to {{submicron}} dimensions. In {{this size}} regime, {{it is possible}} to attain extremely high fundamental frequencies while simultaneously preserving very high mechanical responsivity (small force constants). This powerful combination of attributes translates directly into high force sensitivity, operability at ultralow power, and the ability to induce usable nonlinearity with quite modest control forces. In this overview I shall provide an introduction to NEMS and will outline several of their exciting initial applications. However, a stiff entry fee exists at the threshold to this new domain: new engineering is crucial to realizing the full potential of NEMS. Certain mainstays in the methodology of MEMS will, simply, not scale usefully into the regime of NEMS. The most problematic of issues are the size of the devices compared to their embedding circuitry, their extreme surface-to-volume ratios, and their unconventional "characteristic range of operation". These give rise to some of the principal current challenges in developing NEMS. Most prominent among these are the need for: ultrasensitive, very high bandwidth displacement transducers; an unprecedented control of surface quality and adsorbates; novel modes of efficient actuation at the nanoscale, and precise, robust, and routinely reproducible new approaches to surface and bulk nanomachining. I survey each of these aspects in turn, and conclude by describing several of the exciting prospects in this new field.
