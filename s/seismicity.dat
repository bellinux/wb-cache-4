5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate <b>seismicity</b> poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much more powerful than interplate <b>seismicity</b> and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault and other faults when they were already close to rupture. Such lake-induced <b>seismicity</b> is known from reservoirs and referred to as induced <b>seismicity.</b> Alternatively, earthquakes could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions are {{not known}} to have {{occurred}} from the Anahim hotspot in historical times. However, since 2007 there have been recorded volcano tectonic earthquakes and carbon dioxide emissions {{in the vicinity of}} Nazko Cone. The lack of evidence for historic <b>seismicity</b> prior to 2007 suggests that the area is tectonically stable, making the Nechako Basin one of the most seismically inactive areas of British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Although The Volcano is {{estimated}} to have last erupted 150years ago, {{it is one of}} the five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded <b>seismicity</b> since 1985. Others include Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events) and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards. The seismic activity corresponds both with some of Canada's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} <b>seismicity</b> where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino Fracture Zone (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a {{transform}} fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E
5|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field is}} one of the 10 volcanic areas in Canada associated with recent seismic activity; the others are Castle Rock, Mount Edziza, Mount Cayley, Hoodoo Mountain, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi and Nazko Cone. Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain living magma plumbing systems, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. Beneath areas of monogenetic cinder cone activity, such as the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, the <b>seismicity</b> appears to be more dispersed. In a few cases earthquakes are clustered in time and space, suggestive of volcanic earthquake swarms.|$|E
5|$|The {{countries}} {{surrounding the}} gulf have been actively monitoring the <b>seismicity</b> there since the 1980s and {{have found a}} consistent low level of activity, but a primary characteristic of the activity {{is that there are}} multiple sequences of earthquake swarms. Three swarm events, beginning in the north and ending in the south gulf, have been observed beginning in 1983 when more than 1,000 events occurred over a three-month period near the northeastern boundary of the Elat Deep (in the northern gulf) with the largest three events approaching 5 on the Richter magnitude scale. A less pronounced swarm occurred in 1990 with the largest event reaching 4.3 in the central gulf near the Elat Deep and the Arogonese Deep. The last significant swarm happened in 1993 in the southwestern Arogonese Deep (in the southern gulf) with the highest magnitude of 6.1 and more than 300 larger than magnitude 3 in the following weeks.|$|E
5|$|While the {{government}} brought in foreign experts (yatoi) during {{the building of}} the country's modern infrastructure, the high <b>seismicity</b> in Japan proved to be an ideal laboratory setting during the establishment of the new science of seismology. In 1876, John Milne came from England to teach at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo. Following the earthquake of February 22, 1880, Milne's attention turned to seismology as a primary area of study. That earthquake also triggered the formation of the Seismological Society of Japan, which was an organization to help foreign scientists stay coordinated in their efforts. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese had their own organization (the Japan Meteorological Agency) that had taken control of an earthquake reporting system that was initially created by Milne. Ultimately, the system and the 1891 earthquake provided data by which seismologist Fusakichi Omori developed a law of decay for aftershocks.|$|E
5|$|With his students, Voight has {{analyzed}} pyroclastic flows, volcanically induced <b>seismicity,</b> volcanic debris avalanches, and {{volcanic eruption}} prediction. Voight has {{also served as}} a consultant geotechnical engineer for dams, tunnels, and nuclear power plants, helping plan engineering projects in France, India, Ireland, Somalia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, and Turkey, {{as well as in the}} United States. Voight's research interests in lava dome collapses, stratovolcanoes, monitoring of active volcanoes, and pyroclastic flows have brought him to Iceland, Indonesia, the West Indies, Italy, and Chile. Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts, Voight developed the widely used anelastic strain recovery (ASR) method for measuring stress on deep rock. With a team of geologists, he also derived the material failure forecast method (FFM), which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based on changes in the mountain's surrounding seismic and deformation data. He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Response Team, and has responded to potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile.|$|E
25|$|April 26. Volcanic <b>seismicity</b> had increased.|$|E
25|$|Tides {{may induce}} some <b>seismicity,</b> see tidal {{triggering}} of earthquakes for details.|$|E
25|$|A {{hot dry rock}} {{geothermal}} energy project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused induced <b>seismicity</b> in Basel.|$|E
25|$|Injection {{of water}} in {{enhanced}} geothermal systems may cause induced <b>seismicity.</b> Earthquakes at the Geysers geothermal field in California, the largest being Richter magnitude 4.6, {{have been linked to}} injected water.|$|E
25|$|Current plate {{boundaries}} {{are defined by}} their <b>seismicity.</b> Past plate boundaries within existing plates are identified {{from a variety of}} evidence, such as the presence of ophiolites that are indicative of vanished oceans.|$|E
25|$|Patterns of <b>seismicity</b> {{are complex}} and often {{difficult}} to interpret; however, increasing seismic activity is a good indicator of increasing eruption risk, especially if long-period events become dominant and episodes of harmonic tremor appear.|$|E
25|$|In late October 2010 the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Geological Agency (CVGHM), (Indonesian language—Pusat Vulkanologi & Mitigasi Bencana Geologi, Badan Geologi-PVMBG), {{reported}} that a pattern of increasing <b>seismicity</b> from Merapi had begun to emerge in early September.|$|E
25|$|In {{the crowded}} field of active or {{potentially}} active fault zones that have been discovered in the lower Snoqualmie Valley, the Cherry Creek fault zone is particularly notable because east of Duvall it passes through a hotspot of active <b>seismicity,</b> including the 1996 ML 5.3 Duvall earthquake.|$|E
25|$|The active fissure {{was about}} 600 metres long and {{produced}} a lava flow which peaked between 00:40 and 01:00 and {{is thought to have}} ceased by 04:00. <b>Seismicity</b> decreased during the eruption but then returned to previous levels. At 10:00 the Aviation Color Code was downgraded to Orange, signifying no hazard from an ash cloud.|$|E
25|$|The {{second stage}} began around the mid-Miocene to Quaternary and {{continues}} to the present. It is about {{ten percent of the}} Rio Grande extension; there is some evidence of the continuous rifting including young fault scarps, <b>seismicity,</b> high heat flow, and ongoing uplift as established by geodetic measurements. Mafic volcanism is related to this stage.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle, is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming, solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. This theory is supported by several types of observations, including seafloor spreading and the global distribution of mountain terrain and <b>seismicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seismic {{activity}} (earthquakes and tremors) always {{occurs as}} volcanoes awaken {{and prepare to}} erupt and are a very important link to eruptions. Some volcanoes normally have continuing low-level seismic activity, but an increase may signal a greater likelihood of an eruption. The types of earthquakes that occur and where they start and end are also key signs. Volcanic <b>seismicity</b> has three major forms: short-period earthquake, long-period earthquake, and harmonic tremor.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of Rodez {{is packed with}} geological diversity. It straddles on the ancient base of Ségala composed of acidic siliceous earths of Les Rougiers to soil consisting of red argillite, and causses composed of limestones and marls. The city was built on a conical isolated terrain, locally called Le Piton, and gradually spread to the surrounding slopes. It {{is located in a}} level 2 zone of <b>seismicity,</b> in other words at a low level.|$|E
25|$|During January 2015 the {{eruption}} continued to decline slowly although it still remained active with significant seismic activity. At the caldera {{there were still}} significant regular quakes of M4.5+ and subsidence continued. Sulphuric gases originating from {{the eruption}} continued to create a health hazard throughout Iceland. A scientific report published on 30 January featuring graphs and diagrams showing detailed information about the caldera <b>seismicity</b> and eruption {{can be found on}} the IMO website. Extrapolations from the data predict the eruption may continue into the Summer.|$|E
25|$|An {{earthquake}} (also {{known as}} a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of {{the surface of the}} Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The <b>seismicity</b> or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time.|$|E
25|$|After an ash {{explosion}} of September 1, 2006, a general {{decline in the}} overall activity of Mayon was established. The decrease in key parameters such as <b>seismicity,</b> sulfur dioxide emission rates and ground inflation all indicated a waning condition. The slowdown in the eruptive activity was also evident from the decrease in intensity of crater glow and the diminishing volume of lava extruded from the summit. PHILVOLCS Alert Level 4 was lowered to Level 3 on September 11, 2006; to Level 2 on October 3, 2006; and to Level 1 on October 25, 2006.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} unusual {{features}} at the Cascade subduction zone. Where the Juan de Fuca Plate sinks beneath the North American Plate {{there is no}} deep trench, <b>seismicity</b> (earthquakes) are fewer than expected, and {{there is evidence of}} a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American Plates. These two plates converge at 3–4centimeters per year at present. This is only about half the rate of convergence of 7million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Though these faults {{have been}} traced {{for only a}} little ways, the {{southeast}} striking anticlines they are associated with continue as far as Riffe Lake, near Mossyrock. They are also on-strike with a swarm of faults on the Columbia River, bracketing The Dalles. As {{all of these are}} thrust and reverse faults, they probably result from northeast directed regional compression. These faults also cross the Saint Helens Zone (SHZ), a deep, north-northwest trending zone of <b>seismicity</b> that appears to be the contact between different crustal blocks. How they might be connected is unknown.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of sources of uncertainty, such as {{insufficient}} knowledge of fault geometry (especially at depth) and slip rates, and there is considerable challenge in how to balance the various elements of the model to achieve the best fit with the available observations. For example, there is difficulty fitting paleoseismic data and slip rates on the southern San Andreas Fault, resulting in estimates of <b>seismicity</b> that run about 25% less than seen in the paleoseismic data. The data does fit if a certain constraint (the regional Magnitude-Frequency Distribution) is relaxed, but this brings back the problem over-predicting moderate events.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the United States Geological Survey {{under the}} Volcano Hazards Program began an {{intensive}} effort {{to monitor and}} study geologic unrest in Long Valley Caldera. The goal is to provide residents and civil authorities with reliable information {{on the nature of}} the potential hazards posed by this unrest and timely warning of an impending volcanic eruption, should it develop. Most, perhaps all, volcanic eruptions are preceded and accompanied by geophysical and geochemical changes in the volcanic system. Common precursory indicators of volcanic activity include increased <b>seismicity,</b> ground deformation, and variations in the nature and rate of gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic {{characteristics}} of site such as predominant period, amplification factor, shear wave velocity, {{standard penetration test}} values {{can be used for}} seismic microzonation purpose. Shear wave velocity measurement and standard penetration test are generally expensive and are not feasible to be carried out at large number of sites for the purpose of microzonation. Ambient Vibrations measurement (also called Microtremor) has become a popular method for determining the dynamic properties of soil strata and is being extensively used for microzonation. Microtremor observations are easy to perform, inexpensive and can be applied to places with low <b>seismicity</b> as well, hence, microtremor measurements can be used conveniently for microzonation.|$|E
25|$|Earthquake {{prediction}} is an immature science—it {{has not yet}} led to a successful prediction of an earthquake from first physical principles. Research into methods of prediction therefore focus on empirical analysis, with two general approaches: either identifying distinctive precursors to earthquakes, or identifying some kind of geophysical trend or pattern in <b>seismicity</b> that might precede a large earthquake. Precursor methods are pursued largely because of their potential utility for short-term earthquake prediction or forecasting, while 'trend' methods are generally thought to be useful for forecasting, long term prediction (10 to 100 years time scale) or intermediate term prediction (1 to 10 years time scale).|$|E
25|$|Aftershocks are {{dangerous}} {{because they are}} usually unpredictable, can be of a large magnitude, and can collapse buildings that are damaged from the main shock. Bigger earthquakes have more and larger aftershocks and the sequences can last for years or even longer especially when a large event occurs in a seismically quiet area; see, for example, the New Madrid Seismic Zone, where events still follow Omori's law from the main shocks of 1811–1812. An aftershock sequence is deemed to have ended when the rate of <b>seismicity</b> drops back to a background level; i.e., no further decay {{in the number of}} events with time can be detected.|$|E
25|$|Helena {{lies within}} the {{northern}} part of the Intermountain Seismic Belt (ISB). This area of relatively intense <b>seismicity</b> runs roughly north-south from northwestern Arizona, through Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming, before dying out in northwestern Montana. It shows a marked deflection to the northwest near Helena, where it intersects with the Lewis and Clark fault zone, a zone of older WNW-trending faults. The ISB is characterised by normal faulting of late Quaternary age, indicating active extensional tectonics, as recognised throughout the Basin and Range province to the south. The focal mechanism of the two largest earthquakes of the 1935 sequence are consistent with right lateral strike-slip faulting on faults similar in trend to two major mapped NW-SE faults, the Bald Butte and Helena Valley Faults.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} Eocene and early Miocene, the {{collision}} of the Arabian platform with Laurasia closed and eliminated the Tethys Ocean from the area {{of what is now}} Anatolia. The closure of these masses of continental crust, collapsed this ocean basin by middle Eocene and resulted in a progressive shallowing of the remnant seas, {{until the end of the}} early Miocene. Post-collisional tectonic convergence within the collision zone resulted in the total elimination of the remaining seas from East Anatolia, at the end of early Miocene, crustal shortening and thickening across the collision zone, and uplift of the East Anatolian–Iranian plateau. Accompanying this uplift was extensive deformation by faulting and folding, which resulted in the creation of numerous local basins. The north–south compressional deformation continues today as evidenced by ongoing faulting, volcanism, and <b>seismicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Studies of the Seattle Fault west of Bremerton have {{revealed}} a complexity of geological structure and faulting. Several {{studies show that}} the southernmost strand of the SF, once past Green Mountain, turns southwest, towards the Saddle Mountain and Frigid Creek faults. However, the Saddle Mountain fault zone is not quite reciprocally aligned, trending more northerly to where it encounters west-east trending faults (including the Hamma Hamma fault zone) that appear to be a westward extension of the Seattle Fault zone. This trend extends further north where the Pleasant Harbor lineament appears to terminate other westward extensions of the SFZ. Other studies have faults extending NW or WNW from the SF towards Dabob Bay; these are now recognized as part of the Dabob Bay fault zone. While some coherency is developing, the story is not complete: identified faults do not yet account for much of the region's <b>seismicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, {{improvements}} in and {{greater use of}} seismic instruments such as seismographs enabled scientists to learn that earthquakes tend to be concentrated in specific areas, most notably along the oceanic trenches and spreading ridges. By the late 1920s, seismologists were beginning to identify several prominent earthquake zones parallel to the trenches that typically were inclined 40–60° from the horizontal and extended several hundred kilometers into the Earth. These zones later became known as Wadati–Benioff zones, or simply Benioff zones, {{in honor of the}} seismologists who first recognized them, Kiyoo Wadati of Japan and Hugo Benioff of the United States. The study of global <b>seismicity</b> greatly advanced in the 1960s with the establishment of the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN) to monitor the compliance of the 1963 treaty banning above-ground testing of nuclear weapons. The much improved data from the WWSSN instruments allowed seismologists to map precisely the zones of earthquake concentration worldwide.|$|E
