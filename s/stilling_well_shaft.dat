30|$|The gauge design, if {{like that}} of a {{standard}} model a half-century earlier (Eccles 1901 a, pp 11 – 13), included a <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> that communicated with the sea through a hole 2.5  cm in diameter (Eccles 1901 b, p 9). A float in the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> was suspended on a perforated copper band that turned a wheel on the graphing device. This wheel, through gears and a cable, moved a pencil across a gridded sheet mounted on a rotating drum nearly 1.6  m long. The Karachi gauge had been operated to draw tidal fluctuations at 1 / 3 their actual amplitude (Eccles 1901 b, p 9). This same scale is marked at lower right on the marigram for November 15 to December 1, 1945 (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1).|$|R

The calculations compare favourably with the data and the model has subsequently been used for many design studies. A separate study is described where CFD predictions are used to investigate the influence of introducing energy dissipating influents (EDI), varying the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> diameter, adding Stamford baffles at the side wall or placing an influent floor baffle (McKinney baffle) below the <b>stilling</b> <b>well.</b> From the study {{it is possible to}} determine the sizes and combinations of internal baffling likely to give the best clarification performance across a range of operating conditions.

40|$|By {{receiving}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{signals that}} are reflected off the sea surface, together with directly received GNSS signals (using standard geodetic‐type receivers), {{it is possible}} to monitor the sea level using regular single difference geodetic processing. We show results from our analysis of three months of data from the GNSS‐based tide gauge at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) on the west coast of Sweden. The GNSS-derived time series of local sea level is compared with independent data from two <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges at Ringhals and Gothenburg about 18 km south and 33 km north of OSO, respectively. A high degree of agreement is found in the time domain, with correlation coefficients of up to 0. 96. The root‐mean‐square differences between the GNSS‐derived sea level and the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauge observations are 5. 9 cm and 5. 5 cm, which is lower than for the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges together (6. 1 cm). A frequency domain comparison reveals high coherence of the data sets up to 6 cycles per day, which corresponds well to the propagation of gravity waves in the shallow waters at the Kattegat coast. Amplitudes and phases of some major tides were determined by a tidal harmonic analysis and compared to model predictions. From the GNSS‐based tide gauge results we find significant ocean tidal signals at fortnightly, diurnal, semi‐diurnal, and quarter‐diurnal periods. As an example, the amplitudes of the semi‐diurnal M 2 and the diurnal O 1 tide are determined with 1 σ uncertainties of 11 mm and 12 mm, respectively. The comparison to model calculations shows that global ocean tide models have limited accuracy in the Kattegat area...|$|R

The goal is to determine local sea level with high temporal resolution. The GNSS-based tide gauge makes use of right-hand circular polarized GNSS signals that are di-rectly received and left-hand circular polarized GNSS signals that are reflected from the sea surface. An experimental setup of the GNSS-based tide gauge was operated {{in the spring of}} 2010 and data were recorded with a sampling rate of 20 Hz. We analyzed data decimated to 1 Hz using different temporal resolution between 5 and 240 seconds, and the resulting time series of local sea level were compared {{to each other and to}} results from two <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges. The comparison with the data from the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges shows a common trend. The comparison of the results from analyses with different temporal resolution show consistent results.

40|$|Parshall flume {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the sensitivity on indicated flow rate resulting from improperly located staff gauges and differing entrance conditions to the flume. An acrylic 2 ft (61 cm) Parshall flume was constructed to specified design dimensions and installed level in an 8 ft (243. 8 cm) wide testing flume at the Utah Water Research Laboratory.

The recommended radius wingwall, a 45 ° wingwall and no wingwall were also tested with and without offsets at the entrance to the flume. The laboratory tests indicated that head measurements taken at locations other than the location specified by Parshall (2 / 3 A) can produce up to 60 % errors in the flow measurement. Additionally, the lack of wingwalls and the incorrect design and installation of wingwalls cause standing waves to form in the throat of the flume which also affects flow measurement accuracies...|$|R

50|$|Turbulence, foam, steam, {{chemical}} mists (vapors), {{and changes}} in the concentration of the process material also affect the ultrasonic sensor’s response. Turbulence and foam prevent the sound wave from being properly reflected to the sensor; steam and chemical mists and vapors distort or absorb the sound wave; and variations in concentration cause changes in the amount of energy in the sound wave that is reflected back to the sensor. <b>Stilling</b> <b>wells</b> and waveguides are used to prevent errors caused by these factors.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} way to observe sea level {{is to use}} tide gauges, resulting in measurements relative to the Earth’s crust. However, {{in order to measure}} the sea-level change due to changes in ocean water volume and/or other oceanographic phenomena, all types of crustal motion at the measurement site need to be known. We present a remote sensing technique for measuring local sea level using standard geodetic-type Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. The installation consists of a zenith-looking Right Hand Circular Polarized (RHCP) antenna, receiving the direct signals, and a nadir-looking Left Hand Circular Polarized antenna, receiving the signals reflected of the sea surface. Each antenna is connected to a receiver and the antenna pair is deployed back-to-back at a coastal site. Estimating the vertical baseline between the two antennas, using standard geodetic analysis, the local sea level and its temporal variations can be determined. The advantage of this technique is that it allows to measure both sea surface height changes with relative positioning and land surface height changes, e. g., by precise point positioning of the RHCP antenna. Furthermore, the combined measurements of local sea level are automatically corrected for land motion, meaning that this installation could provide continuously reliable sea-level estimates in tectonic active regions. This GNSS-based tide gauge has been operating continuously at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) on the west coast of Sweden since September 2010. We present results from several months of operations and compare them to sea-level measurements from two <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges about 18 km south and 33 km north of OSO. We find a high degree of agreement between the time series with correlation coefficients of larger than 0. 95. The root-mean-square differences between the GNSS-derived sea level and the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauge measurements are 5. 9 cm and 5. 5 cm, which is lower than between the two <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> (6. 1 cm).

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals {{reflected}} off the sea surface {{can be used}} for remote sensing of the sea level. We present results from a GNSS-based tide gauge using standard geodetic-type GNSS receivers for receiving both the reflected and the direct GNSS signals. The local sea level is then obtained using relative geodetic processing of the carrier phase delay. We show results from our analysis of 100 days of GNSS data from the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO). The GNSS-derived sea level is compared to a weighted average of sea level observations from two <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges located 18 km and 33 km away from OSO. The comparison shows a high level of agreement with a correlation coefficient of 0. 96.

Additionally, we present a tidal analysis of the three sea level datasets and compare the derived tidal constituents both {{to each other and to}} a Regional Tide Model (RTM). From the GNSS-derived sea level we find significant ocean tidal signals with reasonable amplitudes and with most phases in between those for the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges sites.

40|$|Sea-level rise due {{to global}} warming is {{predicted}} to have a large impact on human society, especially for populations living in coastal regions and on islands. It is therefore of great importance to monitor the sea level and to increase {{the understanding of the}} local hydrodynamic and meteorological responses to a global sea-level rise. Presented in this thesis is a technique to measure local sea level using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. This GNSS-based tide gauge acquires both the directly received GNSS signals and the GNSS signals that are reflected off the sea surface, using standard geodetic GNSS receivers. With the directly received signals the installation measures land-surface height changes, whereas the reflected signals are used to measure sea-surface height changes. Both measurements are done with respect to the Earth's centre of mass. By combining these observations it is possible to estimate the local sea level, which {{is directly related to the}} volume of the ocean. Several GNSS-based tide gauge campaigns have been carried out at the Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) on the west coast of Sweden. Today the installation is still in place and continues to record GNSS data with a sampling frequency of 1 Hz. In this thesis, data from the campaigns are analysed in a post-processing mode with an in-house developed software. Sea-level estimates are produced with a temporal resolution from 5 s to 20 min and compared to independent sea-level observations from <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauges located approximately 18 km south and 33 km north of OSO. The results for three months of GNSS-derived sea level show an agreement, with respect to the <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauge sea level, with typical root-mean-square differences of better than 6 cm and correlation coefficients of higher than 0. 95. Additionally, using an ocean-tide analysis of three months of sea-level observations from the GNSS-based tide gauge, it was possible to determine several tidal components, i. e., M 2, S 2, N 2, O 2, and M 4. The amplitudes and phases show reasonable agreement with the ones derived from one year of <b>stilling</b> <b>well</b> gauge sea-level data. </p...|$|R
