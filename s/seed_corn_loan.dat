40|$|Recent agronomic {{research}} {{finds that}} economically optimal seeding densities have likely increased for many Midwestern corn farmers {{as a result}} of genetic improvements including new GM traits such as Bt corn and herbicide tolerance. We derive a per acre demand model for hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> to examine the determinants of <b>corn</b> <b>seeding</b> densities and estimate the model using a large data set of individual farmer <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> purchases. Current results identify factors other than prices affecting farmer <b>corn</b> <b>seeding</b> densities. Among these factors are the GM trait of the <b>seed</b> <b>corn,</b> measures of the local <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> market structure, <b>seed</b> purchase source and intended end use. We interpret these effects in terms of information effects—farmers with more/better access to the latest agronomic research indicating that recommended seeding densities should be increased tend to plant corn at higher densities. hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn,</b> Bt corn, herbicide tolerance, Herfindahl index, corn borer, rootworm, hyperbolic yield model, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries, Farm Management, Industrial Organization, Production Economics, D 2, D 21, Q 1, Q 12,...|$|R

A typical instance is the production of <b>seed</b> <b>corn.</b> The paper makes three contributions. First, we verify that the objective function for the problem is smooth and concave so that optimal solutions are easily computed. Second, by examining data that represents actual costs, prices, and yields encountered in the <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> industry, we gain some insight into the value that the second production period provides. Third, for a representative sample of hybrids from a major <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> producer, we show that margins could be enhanced considerably by using the model. The results of this paper will assist <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> producers in making production-scheduling decisions.

40|$|In 1957, 1567 {{acres of}} hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> were {{approved}} for certification. This was the smallest annual number of acres reported {{during the period}} 1948 through 1957. Two of the factors responsible for this decline were:(1) intensive price competition between certified grower-sellers had resulted in low prices and elimination of many certified growers, and (2) most of the certified grower-sellers had very small seed volumes and could not finance adequate advertising and sales promotion programs. The marketing problems of certified growers were discussed during {{the annual meeting of}} Nebraska Certified Hybrid <b>Seed</b> <b>Corn</b> Producers Association in March 1958 and in June 1958 the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association was formed and incorporated as a marketing cooperative of certified growers. The objectives of this study are: To describe the marketing system of hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> in Nebraska, including the channels of distribution for certified hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> and commercial hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn,</b> and the importance of the various distributors. To describe the hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> market in Nebraska with respect to: its structure, supply and demand, production, processing, and marketing cots, average seed prices, and marketing margins. To evaluate the success of the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association in resolving the marketing problem of certified hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> growers. Certified growers have been doing an excellent job of producing and processing hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn.</b> Although the quality of the certified growers’ processing operations is high, costs could be reduced by hiring custom operators to perform these operations. In addition, marketing operations of some of the certified grower-sellers have not been too effective. From the limited marketing information obtained in the survey of certified growers, there were indications that small volume (200 to 1000 bushels) certified grower-sellers still have marketing problems which were prevalent in 1957. Larger volume certified grower-sellers apparently have solved some of their marketing problems, and have been more effective than small volume certified grower-sellers in marketing their seed. The Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association, established in 1958 to market hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> for its certified grower-members, has encountered and apparently solved some of the marketing problems. However, other marketing problems remain for future solution. Since the Association has been in operation only two years, its success in resolving the marketing problems of certified grower-members cannot be substantiated at this time. Advisor: C. J.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a gravity table for separating <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> into fractions of different quality, and to correlate the physical and physiological properties of each fraction of seed corn;Five lots of <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> with five sizes (unsized, large flat, large round, small flat, and small round) were conditioned through two types of gravity table (pressure and suction type). The original sample, obtained before the gravity table separation, and four fractions (heavy, medium heavy, medium light, and light) obtained from the discharge edge of each gravity table, were analyzed for physical (bulk density, weight of 100 seeds, volume, specific gravity, terminal velocity, purity, breakage susceptibility, and pericarp injury), physiological (standard germination, cold germination, conductivity, and field emergence), and chemical composition (NIR protein, oil, and starch contents);Both gravity tables performed similarly as determined by the seed quality of various fractions. Flat <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> was better in seed quality than round <b>seed</b> <b>corn.</b> The gravity table was efficient in separating <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> into fractions of different quality along the discharge edge of the gravity table deck. However, when the initial seed quality of a lot is high, only marginal improvement in seed quality was obtained. The light seed obtained from the low side of the gravity table did not meet the seed requirement and must be discarded. The medium light fraction may be re-conditioned to recover fractions of acceptable seed quality. Bulk density was the best physical property of the <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> correlated with the physiological quality of the seed.
