25|$|The {{earliest}} {{hints of}} the practice of inoculation for smallpox in China come during the 10th century. A Song dynasty (960–1279) chancellor of China, Wang Dan (957–1017), lost his eldest son to smallpox and sought a means to spare the rest of his family from the disease, so he summoned physicians, wise men, and magicians from all across the empire to convene at the capital in Kaifeng and <b>share</b> <b>ideas</b> on how to cure patients of it until a divine man from Mount Emei carried out inoculation. However, the sinologist Joseph Needham states that this information comes from the Zhongdou xinfa (種痘心法) written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang, centuries after the alleged events.|$|E

25|$|Bachelet's first {{political}} crisis came in late April 2006, when massive {{high school student}} demonstrations — unseen in three decades — broke out throughout the country, demanding a rise of quality levels in public education. In June 2006, she sought to dampen the student protests by setting up an 81-member advisor committee, including education experts from all political backgrounds, representatives of ethnic groups, parents, teachers, students, school owners, university rectors, people from diverse religious denominations, etc. Its purpose was to propose changes to the country's educational system {{and serve as a}} forum to <b>share</b> <b>ideas</b> and views. The committee issued its final report in December 2006. In August 2009, she signed the education reform bill into law, which created two new regulatory bodies: a Superintendency on Education and a Quality Agency.|$|E

Malcolm said that [...] "about 60 or 70 song ideas" [...] were developed, but Angus stated that most were discarded {{because they were not}} [...] "representative of how we are". Angus also said that the first attempt to sequence the album resulted in a track list comprising eleven songs, [...] "but as the days went by each band member voted for a new track, and then another, and other one" [...] so they decided to include all the recorded tracks.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, after 27years {{of living}} in Kuala Lumpur, Lat moved back to Ipoh with his family. Aside from {{retreating}} slightly from the cartooning scene, {{he wanted to be}} close to his old kampung and let his children experience life in a small town or village; he had married in 1977, and the couple have four children—two daughters and two sons. [...] Lat said that raising his children has helped him cope with the pressures of his fame and made him realise that he might be losing touch with the new generation of Malaysians who have different tastes in cartoons. [...] His wife helps him in his work, scanning his completed cartoons and emailing them to the newspaper offices in Kuala Lumpur. [...] Lat still draws with his usual pens and inks, avoiding the use of computers except to read his emails. [...] In 2011–12, he is to join other artists from around the world in Italy for the Civitella Ranieri Fellowship programme.

500|$|Letters to Pennant {{from the}} parson-naturalist Gilbert White form {{the first part}} of White's 1789 book, The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne. It is almost certain that the men were {{introduced}} by Gilbert's brother Benjamin White, Pennant's publisher; Gilbert seized on the opportunity to correspond, as a way of overcoming the intellectual isolation of Selborne in the absence of suitable learned societies at which he could read papers and <b>share</b> <b>ideas.</b> He knew that Pennant, with little skill or inclination as a field naturalist, was gathering observations to publish in his books; he quickly determined that he would make his own use of the correspondence, and kept copies of every letter he sent to Pennant. White was more careful than Pennant, and was sometimes critical; for example, in 1769 he objected that the goatsucker did not only make its sound while flying as Pennant asserted, so it was wrong to suppose that the noise must be made by the air beating against its [...] "vastly extended mouth". Pennant accepted White's criticisms graciously. Unfortunately Pennant's letters to White have been lost: White's Natural History begins with 44 of White's letters to Pennant, of which the first nine were never posted; the remaining 35 letters are dated between 4 August 1767 and 30 November 1780, covering topics as varied as whether swallows hibernate or migrate (letter 10), ring ousels (letter 20), whether peacock trains are really tails (letter 35), and thunderstorms (letter 44).|$|E

40|$|Post-liberalism is a theologically derived {{argument}} for the recovery of <b>shared</b> <b>ideas</b> of the good to the centre of politics, policy and practice. Only this, they claim, will individualism, social fragmentation, and the consequent reliance on the twin logic {{of the state and}} market. Its greatest strength and weakness is its reliance on a thick theological narrative which seems unsuited to a pluralist world. In a bid to overcome this issue, post-liberals have recently started to drop god-speak from their discourse. The result is a morally empty {{argument for}} communitarianism. This paper encourages a post-liberal turn to community development, in a bid to recover the <b>shared</b> <b>ideas</b> of the good without resorting to cultural oppression. According to this model, discovering <b>shared</b> <b>ideas</b> of the good becomes a deliberative process, inclusive of all faiths and none, and all political hues...|$|R
