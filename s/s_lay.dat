40|$|This study {{considers}} the fourteenth-century Middle English romance Sir Orfeo {{from a new}} critical perspective; it examines the poem within its generic context as a Breton lay. An analysis of Sir Orfeo {{that takes into account}} the rhetorical style and conventional motifs and topoi of the Breton lay helps us interpret what most modern readers agree is an artful but enigmatic poem. Linguistic evidence as well as corroborative allusions from other romances suggest that Sir Orfeo is likely a close translation of its Old French antecedent, the Lai d 2 ̆ 7 Orphev. Although the Lai d 2 ̆ 7 Orphev is no longer extant, one might deduce some of its characteristics by referring to its nearest generic relations, the twelfth-century Breton lays of Marie de France. By comparing Marie 2 ̆ 7 s Lanval and Le Fresne with their Middle English translations, Sir Landevale and Lav le Freine, we might recover some of the characteristics shared by Sir Orfeo and its antecedent. For example, Sir Orfeo, like Marie 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lays,</b> explores the internal anatomy of love and the consequences of lovers 2 ̆ 7 inappropriate behavior. Like Marie 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lays,</b> too, Sir Orfeo is characterized by an economical poetic style that relies on formulaic language and rhetorical constructions to create images that are emblematic of complex ideas or internal experience. Such correspondences help us to interpret problematic passages and images in Sir Orfeo. ^ Acknowledging the Lai d 2 ̆ 7 Orphev 2 ̆ 7 s legacy in the composition of Sir Orfeo also emphasizes the significance of the poem 2 ̆ 7 s sources. Although most scholars assume Sir Orfeo is a retelling of the Latin myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, few recognize the contribution of Celtic analogues to the tale. In fact, Celtic myth contributes details to Sir Orfeo that align it with twelfth-century French chivalric romances and their emphasis on the tension between public and private concerns, as exemplified in the conflict between Orfeo 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities as king and his desire to be with his wife. While Sir Orfeo retains its distinctive Middle English characteristics, many of its narrative cruces may be clarified by inspecting them within the context of twelfth-century French generic conventions. ...|$|R

I examine the knowledges required by women to seek out favorite stars' films on VHS and VCD, as well as the sites of such consumption, which combined in the production of what I tentatively term a trans-cult-ural fan subjectivity that was at once cultish in its intensity and desire for ownership, as well as transcultural in its performance by fans...|$|E

Reflectance spectrometry which extends into the ultraviolet (UV) allows measurement of such coloration independent of our visual system.

We found that throat reflectance strongly contrasted against the granite background of the lizards 2 ̆ 7 habitat. The throat may act as a signal via the head-bobbing and push-up displays of C. ornatus. Dorsal coloration provided camouflage against the granite background, particularly in females. C. ornatus was sexually dichromatic for all traits examined including throat UV reflectance which is beyond human visual perception. Female throats were highly variable in spectral reflectance and males preferred females with higher throat chroma between 370 and 400 nm.

Using the diaries of the institution 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lay</b> superintendents from 1800 through 1850, it explores the interactions among families, staff, and patients as they turned the theoretical idea of 2 ̆ 2 moral treatment 2 ̆ 2 into a form which might best meet their real, day-to-day needs. This thesis argues that the dominant metaphor of the institution as 2 ̆ 2 family, 2 ̆ 2 a metaphor typical of most early nineteenth century institutions, provided a compelling rationale {{for the use of}} the Asylum by families who committed their relatives their. Yet, in day-to-day practice, such a metaphor proved untenable.

Their initiatives, more so than just those of physicians to put down the challenge posed by a lay vision of moral treatment, contributed to what has been termed the 2 ̆ 2 medicalization 2 ̆ 2 of care at the Friends Asylum. ...|$|E
40|$|Irving Fisher's {{encounter}} with the Quantity theory of Money began in the 1890 s, during the debate about bimetallism, and reached its high point in 1911 {{with the publication of}} The Purchasing Power of Money. His most important refinement of the theory, derived from his recognition of bank deposits as means of exchange, was to treat their out of equilibrium recursive interaction with inflation as integral to it. This treatment underlay both his 1920 s work on the business cycle as a "dance of the dollar" and his advocacy of subjecting monetary policy to a legislated price stability rule, initially to be based on his "compensated dollar" scheme. Fisher's failure to recognize the onset of the Great Depression even as it was happening was directly related to his faith in the quantity theory's seeming implication that price level stability in and of itself guaranteed the continuation of prosperity, while his subsequent work on the debt deflation theory of great depressions initially failed to repair the damage that this failure did to his reputation, and to that of the quantity theory. In the 1930 s Fisher nevertheless remained an active supporter of various schemes to reflate and then stabilize the price level.

40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the benefits of}} early arrival date of migratory birds, a hidden and often ignored component of males 2 ̆ 7 fitness is the higher chance of early-arriving birds to obtain extra-pair fertilizations. Here we investigated how extra-pair paternity might affect the relationship between male arrival date and number of fertilizations in a model study system, the European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. For this purpose, we sampled and genotyped breeding pairs, unpaired males and offspring (including embryos from unhatched eggs when possible) of a Dutch pied flycatcher population. Detailed information on arrival date of males, egg laying date of their social mates and nest success was also recorded. Early-arriving males had early-laying females and males with early-laying females had a higher probability of siring extra-pair eggs and obtain more fertilizations. However, male arrival date alone did not correlate with the probability to gain extra-pair paternity and neither {{to the amount of}} fertilized eggs. Both early- and late-arriving males had a higher probability of losing paternity in their own nest compared to birds with an intermediate arrival date. Finally, late-arriving males were more likely to remain unpaired but, interestingly, a few of these birds obtained paternity via extra-pair copulations. Because earlier arrival date did not lead to more extra-pair fertilizations and because such relationship seems to be driven mainly by the female 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>laying</b> date, we conclude that the contribution of extra-pair paternity to the overall fitness benefits of early male arrival date is relatively small...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of religion at the institutional level of international development, and specifically at the World Bank Group (WBG). The phrase ‘dynamics of religion’ describes the interplay of three elements of religion {{at work in the}} international development sphere. The secular dynamics of religion are characterized by the subordination of religious actors and interests to other development structures and priorities. The sacral dynamics of religion are characterized by the primacy of religious actors and interests to shape the development agenda and/or contest development priorities. The integrated dynamics of religion are characterized by a balance of secular and sacral dynamics making it difficult (and often unnecessary) to distinguish between them. These conceptual elements form {{the dynamics of}} religion model that can be applied to analyze multiple contexts and levels of international development. In recent years the WBG has broadened its development approach and created an explicit space for engaging with religious actors. The model is thus employed to identify secular, integrated and sacral dynamics that helped bring religion into the policy domain of the WBG in the 1980 s and 1990 <b>s,</b> <b>laying</b> the foundation for the ‘faiths and development’ initiatives that followed under the Wolfensohn presidency. Such an approach expands our knowledge of religious agency by situating and differentiating the religious influences on WBG development ideology. It also normalizes the role of religious actors within a pluralist view of the WBG as a domain of multiple, open and competing groups. Each insight holds value for ongoing analysis and policy making on religion and international development at the institutional level...|$|R
