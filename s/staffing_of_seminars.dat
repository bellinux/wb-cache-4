40|$|Bargaining {{power has}} long been a popular subject among farmers and farm organizations. Its {{popularity}} undoubtedly reflects farmers 1 continuing concern with their economic position relative to other sectors of the economy. Bargaining power is accepted as an important policy objective by major farm organizations who otherwise agree on few farm program proposals. To explore bargaining power more fully, a series <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>seminars</b> was sponsored by the Center for Agricultural and Economic Adjustment during the spring of 19 61. Papers presented at the seminars are contained in this publication. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Staff time {{in higher}} {{education}} is an expensive resource. As staff-student ratios become less favourable the problem <b>of</b> <b>staffing</b> <b>seminar</b> or tutorial work with students intensifies. Is it inevitable that group sizes must be increased? A seminar with more than ten or twelve students, however, probably ceases to function in an effective sense {{for many of the}} students: larger numbers intimidate the more introverted student from participating, {{and the role of the}} lecturer as a kind of chairperson tends to become more prominent, taking responsibility away from the individual student. Alternative learning methods are beng devised to cope with this problem, including a range of teaching strategies for introducing new material and obtaining the active participation of students in discussion (e. g. Boud, 1981; Habeshaw, Habeshaw, and Gibbs, 1984; Miall, in press). One radical solution would be to dispose <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> input entirely for seminar work, requiring students to manage their own seminar groups. It is this alternative that I describe in the present paper. I offer an assessment of a unit in which most of th...|$|R
