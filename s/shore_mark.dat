40|$|The {{novels of}} Caryl Phillips have most {{commonly}} been approached from post-colonial theoretical perspectives, a trend which appears entirely appropriate given their recurrent themes of immigration, ethnic discrimination {{and the legacy}} of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. However, the analysis below contends that the publication of A Distant <b>Shore</b> <b>marked</b> a change of direction in Phillips's oeuvre towards a less formally experimental but thematically more cosmopolitan form of writing that conspicuously sets out to subvert and redefine the idea of 'home'. Using the critical frameworks of Avtar Brah, Paul Gilroy and Jacques Derrida, the discussion will illustrate how Phillips critically re-imagines the notion 'home' in order to signify an inclusive space of cosmopolitan conviviality and openness...|$|R

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] hydrobiological surveys {{over the period}} 1988 - 2002 perpendicular to the central California coast indicate strong coupling between physical circulation and biological production. An equatorward-flowing jet about 100 - 200 km from <b>shore</b> <b>marked</b> the inshore edge of the California Current. This "CC Jet" had its highest valocities during late winter and spring. The jet divided inshore, biologically productive waters from offshore, low-production waters. Mean flow in the inshore waters is poleward. However, this flow is interrupted in late spring and summer by a surface-enhanced, equatorward-flowing, coastal upwelling jet. The upwelling jet coincides with maxima of nutrients, chlorophyll-a and primary production. Annual variability in the inshore zone is related to (1) vertical pycnocline movements associated with geostrophic adjustments to accelerations of the California Current system, and (2) coastal upwelling. In offshore waters, the annual cycle accounted for {{a small fraction of}} the variability, indicating the dominance of eddies and meanders in this zone (J. Geophys. Res. 92 (1987) 12947). The offshore regime was mesotrophic to ogliotrophic, with a subsurface chlorophyll-a maximum above the nutricline. Considerable subduction may occur under the California Current jet and be an important process in the export of biogenic material to the deep sea...|$|R

40|$|Davis <b>Shores</b> <b>Marker,</b> St Augustine, FL. This marker {{is located}} at the {{intersection}} of Anastasia Blvd and Alcazar St. (on State highway A 1 A) in St Augustine, Florida. It was sponsored by the City of St. Augustine and the Florida Department of State. The text on the marker reads as : 2 ̆ 2 Until the 1920 s the northwest corner of Anastasia Island was a swampy lowland with occasional peaks of high ground. In 1925, wealthy Florida land developer D. P. Davis, purchased the lowlands and raised them in a massive 1, 500 acre dredge and fill operation. Davis designed and subdivided the new land to provide for 50 miles of streets, 100 miles of sidewalks and curbs, parks, plazas, two 18 hole golf courses, a casino, Roman pool, yacht club, hotel, apartments, residences and business districts. Its distinctive curving street patterns, wide boulevards, unusual triangulated lots in a garden-like setting exhibit key elements of the most influential city planning movements of that time: the City Beautiful, Picturesque and Garden City movements. While many lots were sold, Florida´s Land Bust of 1926 ended Davis´ dream. Only eleven Mediterranean Revival style structures were built: six houses, four apartments, and a sales office for the Davis Corporation. By 1927, the newly completed Bridge of Lions led to a depressed area. Not until the prosperous post-World War II years did Davis Shores see revived interest and rapid growth. Today, Davis Shores still retains much of the original design and most of its 1920 s structures. 2 ̆ 2 [URL]...|$|R
