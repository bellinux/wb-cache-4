40|$|A {{pairwise}} additive potential, which approximately reproduces {{the free}} energy density for the elastic deformations of a nematic liquid crystal, originally proposed by Gruhn and Hess, {{has been investigated}} by simulating the three Freedericksz transitions {{as well as that}} of the <b>Schadt-Helfrich</b> <b>cell.</b> The pair potential depends on the three elastic constants K- 1, K- 2 and K- 3 for the splay, twist acid bend deformations, respectively. The results of the simulations are compared with the analytical solutions obtained from continuum theory in order to test the accuracy of the model potential at a quantitative level. This comparison is also made for different temperatures to explore the influence of director fluctuations on the elastic behaviour...|$|E
