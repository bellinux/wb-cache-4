Collecting this allows the goat to restart the game with various {{modifiers}} in play, such as changing the goat model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to the goat that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are <b>scattered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sandbox, such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where the goat character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody {{of the concept of}} Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and Hell that were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (ingame this was actually a small protest of people holding nonsensical or obscene signs).|$|E
5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are <b>scattered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|Flowers and coins, {{as well as}} stars, are <b>scattered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game's stages. These are totaled {{at the end of}} {{each stage}} and a score is given {{depending}} how many of each were collected (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels. (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game) Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original. The fire breathing ability is retained though: Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball with his tongue. This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini-games and doors that would be closed otherwise.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} first {{pointed out}} by Tully and Fisher between the luminosity of spiral galaxies and their maximum rotation velocity, {{as measured by the}} 21 cm line-width, continues {{to be one of the}} best methods available to measure relative distances. At infrared wavelengths, <b>the</b> observational <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> this relation is typically 0. 35 to 0. 50 magnitudes, permitting relative distance estimates with an accuracy of <b>about</b> 20 percent. <b>The</b> Malmquist bias in a magnitude-limited sample is 1. 38 σ ², and while the solution to the general problem is complex, it is clear that reducing <b>the</b> <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Tully-Fisher relation by even a factor of two would make a large difference in our ability to determine the local velocity field from distances and velocities of individual galaxies. In this dissertation we discuss the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation at infrared wavelengths, and look for ways to reduce that dispersion through the inclusion of additional observational parameters. The data for this study are derived from a CCD survey of 244 spiral galaxies in twenty clusters falling in the redshift range 3, 000 to 11, 000 km s⁻¹. From surface brightness profiles and elliptical aperture photometry, we obtained isophotal and total magnitudes at B, R, and I, isophotal diameters, mean and nuclear surface brightnesses, and a concentration parameter indicative of the bulge-to-disk ratio. These quantities were then combined with colors and HI-content measures taken from the literature in a search for correlations with Tully-Fisher residuals. None of the trial second-parameters resulted in a substantial decrease in <b>the</b> <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fiducial Tully-Fisher relation. An examination of the properties of the cluster samples shows that many of the clusters exhibit considerable substructure. While it is possible that the implied depth effects are important to <b>the</b> <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> magnitude/line-width relation, calculated lower limits to the dispersion in depth turn out to be rather small...|$|R

25|$|The pelvic fins have rounded {{tips and}} gently curved {{trailing}} margins. The whip-like tail measures {{about twice the}} length of the disc and bears one or two long stinging spines with up to 88 serrations. A narrow fin fold runs beneath the tail and ends well before the tail tip. Large juveniles and adults have a row of large, sharp thorns running along the midline of the back from behind the eyes to the tail spine, and thorns of various sizes are also <b>scattered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dorsal surface of the disc. The tail behind the spine is densely covered by stout thorns. This species is a uniform dark brown or gray to black above and whitish below. The longer tail, presence of thorns, and absence of white dots atop the disc differentiate this species from the short-tail stingray (D. brevicaudata), another giant stingray that shares its range.|$|E
25|$|Arcade mode is {{the main}} {{multiplayer}} section of TimeSplitters 2. It can normally be played with up to four players with each player using {{a division of the}} television's screen. However, with a System Link, up to sixteen players can participate. System link was not included with the GameCube version. When a player is killed, he or she is respawned at a random location on the map with full health. Weapons, armour, and other items that enhance players' abilities are placed in several preset positions <b>scattered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> map.

40|$|We {{examine the}} X-ray {{luminosity}} scaling relations of 31 nearby galaxy clusters from the Representative XMM-Newton Cluster Structure Survey (REXCESS). The objects are selected only in X-ray luminosity, optimally sampling the cluster luminosity function. Temperatures range from 2 to 9 keV, {{and there is}} no bias toward any particular morphological type. To reduce measurement scatter we extract pertinent values in an aperture corresponding to R 500, estimated using the tight correlation between (the product of gas mass and temperature) and total mass. The data exhibit power law relations between bolometric X-ray luminosity and temperature, and total mass, all with slopes that are significantly steeper than self-similar expectations. We examine the possible causes for the steepening, finding that structural variations have little effect and that the primary driver appears to be a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. <b>Scatter</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. <b>The</b> natural logarithmic <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> raw X-ray luminosity-temperature relation is about 70 per cent, and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> X-ray luminosity- relation it is 40 per?cent. Systems with more morphological substructure show similar <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> scaling relations than clusters with less substructure, due to the preponderance of cool core systems in the regular cluster subsample. Cool core and morphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual space with respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematically at the high luminosity side, the latter lying systematically at the low luminosity side. Simple exclusion of the central regions serves to reduce <b>the</b> <b>scatter</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scaling relations by more than a factor of two. The scatter reduces by a similar amount {{with the use of the}} central gas density as a third parameter. Using as a total mass proxy, we derive a Malmquist bias-corrected local luminosity-mass relation and compare with other recent determinations. Our results indicate that luminosity can be a reliable mass proxy with controllable scatter, which has important implications for upcoming all-sky cluster surveys, such as those to be undertaken with Planck and eROSITA, and ultimately for the use of the cluster population for cosmological purposes. <br/...|$|R
