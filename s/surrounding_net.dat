50|$|The {{public policy}} <b>surrounding</b> <b>net</b> {{metering}} {{is a political}} issue between solar customers and solar energy installers vs. utility companies. In over 40 states, utilities are forced to buy the excess energy generated by home- or business-based solar panels (or other renewable energy sources located on-site) at rates set by state regulators. The issue centers around {{the rate at which}} the utility must buy back excessive energy. Under net metering arrangements, most utilities prefer to buy back power at the retail rate, which is the rate charged to customers, rather than the wholesale rate, which is the rate the utilities pay power generators for electricity. The retail rate is lower and reflects what customers pay.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, fishing {{operations}} had a deleterious {{effect on the}} conditions in the area due to increased number of fishermen (many from outside the area) also adopting unacceptable practices for fishing such as dynamite, beach seines and kigumi fishing, where corals are broken deliberately to force fish out into the <b>surrounding</b> <b>net.</b> Local poisonous weed called “Utupa” also aggravated the problem. Studies also indicated that the traditional “dago” system of temporary fishing camp during the fishing season was replaced by permanent settlements, which caused serious damage to the coral reefs of the bay. In order to control these activities, local villagers started operating patrols in the fishing zones, such as in Fumbal peninsula, with proactive support of the Commission of Natural Resources. Though these operations failed to be effective due to inadequate knowledge of such operations, it resulted in the eventual creation of the MBCA.|$|E

On January 26, 2015 popular blogging site Tumblr placed links to group Fight For The Future, a net neutrality advocacy group. The website displayed a countdown to the FCC vote on Title II on February 26, 2015. This was part of a widespread internet campaign to sway congressional opinion and encourage users to call or submit comments to congressional representatives. Net neutrality advocacy groups such as Save the Internet coalition and Battle for the Net responded to the 2015 FCC ruling by calling for defense of the new net neutrality rules.|$|E

Professional fishing, carried out from August to December 1996, uses FADs (Fish Attracting Devices) and <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets.</b> 2087 juvenile specimens of dolphinfish from the Ionian and southern Tyrrhenian seas, the Strait of Sicily and the Balearic islands were sampled. A small number of adult fish (39), which are not usually caught in <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets,</b> was sampled in the swordfish long-line by-catch. The gonads of the young fish were analysed monthly to establish the stage of development of the ovaries or testes, {{during the first few}} months of life. The gonads of the adult fish, sampled in the months of June-September only, were all mature. The specimens caught between October and December presented maturity stage V in the case of the females and I in the case of the males, indicating the end of the reproductive period. The gonado-somatic index (GSI) and condition factor (CF) were calculated for both genders. The trend of the GSI confirms the presence of immature specimens as regards the juvenile fish; the low value of GSI was obtained for the adults, probably associated with the post-reproduction conditions found in the October-December period. Most of the gonads sampled during the months between August and December belonged to young specimens born in early summer. This is confirmed by the juvenile stages (FL 2. 5 to 4. 3 cm) caught with plankton nets in the Strait of Messina area in July...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{media and}} public discourses <b>surrounding</b> <b>net</b> neutrality, with particular attention to public utility philosophy, from a critical perspective. The article suggests that further public education about net neutrality would be beneficial. The first portion of this paper provides {{a survey of the}} existing literature <b>surrounding</b> <b>net</b> neutrality, highlighting the contentious debate between market-based and public interest perspectives. In order to contextualize the debate, an overview of public utility philosophy is provided, shedding light on how the Internet can be conceptualized as a public good. Following this discussion, an analysis of mainstream media is presented, exploring how the media represents the issue of net neutrality and whether or not the Internet is discussed through the lens of public utility. To further examine how the net neutrality debate is being addressed, and to see the potential impacts of media discourses on the general public, the results of a focus group are reported and analyzed. Finally, a discussion assesses the implications of the net neutrality debate as presented through media discourses, highlighting the future of net neutrality as an important policy issue...|$|E

40|$|An {{economically}} important, small-scale fishery operates {{during the}} winter months in Mallorca. Using a special <b>surrounding</b> <b>net</b> that is hauled over the sand and gravel bottoms of bays at depths reaching 30 m, it primarily targets Aphia minuta and Pseudaphya ferreri, but other goby species and juveniles of the Pagellus spp are also caught. Similar fisheries are operated on the Spanish coast and in Italy. This fishery is run with specific licenses, equipment controls, and closed seasons (based on species availability). In cooperation with local fishermen, the administration has in recent years established a daily quota for sustaining the sales prices 22 of the species caught. A management plan was set up in 2013 in accordance with European Union rules to ensure the sustainability of the fishery.

40|$|The {{dolphinfish}} (Coryphaena hippurus) performs seasonal migrations into {{adjacent waters}} of Japan, {{where it is}} exploited by several fisheries. The annual dolphinfish landings in Japan have tended to decrease in recent years. Between 1993 and 1995, the mean annual catch was 9962 metric tonnes. This total catch corresponded to the following fishing methods: set net fishery 24. 9 %, skipjack pole and line fishery 21. 2 %, <b>surrounding</b> <b>net</b> fishery (which is mainly comprised of the shiira-zuke fishery) 12. 9 %, longline fishery 10. 2 %, other angling fisheries 10. 3 %, and other fisheries 20. 5 %. In the shiira-zuke fishery, fishermen catch dolphinfish and other fishes gathering around bamboo rafts (called tsukegi) with a purse seine net. Major fishing grounds of this fishery are situated in the western Japan Sea and off the south Pacific Japanese coast. The use of floating FADs to create productive fishing areas is of ecological interest. In this paper we describe this fishery, and review the biological characteristics of dolphinfish with regard to ecology and fishing conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we {{describe}} the dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) fishery off Tunisian waters (central Mediterranean). Dolphinfish is fished from late August to early December, with the main catches in September-October, using fish aggregation devices and <b>surrounding</b> <b>nets.</b> A total of 260 boats are devoted to this fishery along the whole Tunisian coast, with an average annual catch of around 300 metric tonnes. The main fishing areas and ports are located on the central-eastern coast, which concentrates around 70 - 75 % of fishing effort and landings. Both the sesonality of the fishery and the length composition of the catches, with a clear increase in mean size during the fishing period (from 26. 0 cm fork length in August to 44 cm fork length in December), {{are similar to those}} reported in other Mediterranean areas...|$|R

Taxa, number, biomass and sizes of fishes caught with both types of gear around fish aggregation devices were compared. From 63 hauls with the experimental net, we caught 11370 fishes belonging to 17 families and 26 species. In contrast, 816 fishes belonging to 7 species and 5 families were collected from 39 commercial hauls.

40|$|Floating fish {{aggregating}} devices (FADs) {{have long}} been used to attract fish in NW Sicily since antiquity. Recently, a number of changes {{have been made to}} the type of material employed to construct FADs, with the aim of increasing their effectiveness. In this paper we compare the catches made at eight experimental floating FADs (polypropylene ropes frayed at the ends) with those obtained at eight traditional FADs in the Gulf of Castellammare. A total of 672 samples were collected during summer and autumn in 1995 and 1996 at the 16 FADs using a <b>surrounding</b> <b>net.</b> Visual observations of fishes associated with the FADs were also conducted to obtain qualitative information about the spatial distribution of species. A total of 1632 specimens weighing 144 kg and belonging to eight species were caught during the survey. Seriola dumerili, Caranx crysos, C. rhonchus and Coryphaena hippurus were the most frequent and abundant species accounting for 96 % of the total catch. Average fish abundance and weight, characterised by high variance, were significantly higher at the sites with experimental FADs than at the sites with traditional FADs. S. dumerili was the only species with higher catches around the experimental FADs. Some spatial and temporal variations in fish abundance and size were also detected. Younger individuals of S. dumerili were observed to show high affinity for the experimental FAD tufts...|$|E
40|$|Network {{neutrality}} is {{a widely}} debated policy issue {{that has the potential}} to alter the dynamics of accessing online content. The main focus of the debate revolves around analyzing whether broadband internet access market should be regulated under strict net neutrality rules that impose a total ban upon the contested practices of blocking, throttling and paid prioritization, or if a light-touch regulatory approach will better foster its dynamics. The increased regulation that the market is currently undergoing is controversial, given that the challenges that are threatening to disrupt the market are largely theoretical, thereby challenging its implementation. Although ISPs use traffic management techniques that leave them with ample margin to engage in potential abusive practices at different levels of their infrastructure, this seems unlikely to occur and in any case is mitigated by their countervailing interest. Therefore, it is argued in this research paper that according to the policy goals sought by policymakers and regulators, the recently implemented net neutrality rules both in Europe and America will have a pervasive effect that will unwittingly bring about unwanted consequences; such as being a deterrent to broadband investment or innovation. Light-touch regulation is thus proposed as a more suitable approach, given that net neutrality appears to be an investment and competition problem, not a regulatory issue. Minimal regulation will provide greater incentives for the further development of the market, leading to a trade-off that will be determined by the market and not by interventionist policies, maximizing total welfare. After analyzing the main issues <b>surrounding</b> <b>net</b> neutrality, an innovative conceptualization of the broadband internet market will be suggested; namely high-income fee to funding infrastructure. In this approach is stressed the two-folded nature of the market, seeking to procure a cost-efficient allocation of broadband investment, whereby the different competing interests are reconciled...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Net {{care and}} repair {{behaviours}} {{are essential for}} prolonging the durability of long-lasting insecticidal nets. Increased net durability has implications for protection against malaria as well as cost savings from less frequent net distributions. This study investigated behaviours and motivations for net care and repair behaviours in Senegal {{with the aim of}} informing social and behaviour change communication (SBCC) programmes, using the Health Belief Model as a framework. Methods Data were collected from 114 participants in eight regions of Senegal. Participants were eligible for the study if they were at least 18  years old and if their household owned at least one net. These respondents included 56 in-depth interview respondents and eight focus groups with 58 participants. In addition, the qualitative data were supplemented with observational questionnaire data from a total of 556 sleeping spaces. Of these spaces, 394 had an associated net. Results Reported net care and repair behaviours and motivations varied substantially within this sample. Children and improper handling were seen as major sources of net damage and respondents often tried to prevent damage by storing nets when not in use. Washing was seen as an additional method of care, but practices for washing varied and may have been damaging to nets in some cases. Participants mentioned a sense of pride of having a net in good condition and the uncertainty around when they could expect another net distribution as motivations for net care. Net repair appeared to be a less common behaviour and was limited by the perspective that net degradation was inevitable and that repairs themselves could weaken nets. Conclusion These findings can be understood using the Health Belief Model framework of perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and cues to action. This model can guide SBCC messages <b>surrounding</b> <b>net</b> care and repair to promote practices associated with net longevity. Such messages should promote the benefits of intact nets and provide tools for overcoming barriers to care and repair...|$|E
