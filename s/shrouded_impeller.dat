The main hull or gunwale contains five intercommunicating chambers, which {{are separated by}} internal baffles and valves. This means that a single leak will not result in loss of pressure throughout the boat, and that air can be bled between chambers to compensate for loss in one. Two additional chambers, located below the gunwale on either side and called [...] "speed skags," [...] provide cushioning for the boat's occupants and additional buoyancy in case of pressure loss in the hull. The final chamber is an inflatable keel tube which runs {{the length of the}} craft and gives the bottom of the hull a [...] "V" [...] shape, imparting directional stability and additional shock absorption. A wooden [...] "transom" [...] board at the stern provides a mounting point for the outboard engine(s). The deck (floor) is composed of four interlocking aluminum plates, which are fixed to the [...] "thrust board" [...] at the bow end and the transom at the stern. This rigid structure, spanning the entire internal area of the boat, prevents the hull from collapsing or [...] "taco-ing" [...] under power.A ready-for-use craft includes an outboard engine (two in some configurations); removable aluminium deckplates or roll-up slatted decking; paddles; a bow line for securing the docked boat and a [...] "righting" [...] line which is used to flip the boat in the event of capsizing. At the bow of the boat are storage bags for equipment (foot pumps, extra lines, etc.) and a special fuel bladder, which can be of either 6- or 18-gallon capacity and which feeds the engine via a flexible hose. Deflated and rolled up, the boat and all necessary equipment can easily fit into the bed of a small pickup. Most military CRRC's use a [...] two-stroke engine with a pumpjet propulsor, which consists of a <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller.</b> This design reduces the risk of serious injury to personnel in the water when compared to the traditional open propeller.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the effects of leading edge shapes {{on the strength of}} centrifugal compressor compeller, the <b>shrouded</b> <b>impellers</b> of a large centrifugal compressor were introduced for finite element analysis. In the present study, the geometric models of 3 <b>shrouded</b> <b>impellers</b> were established in Solidworks 2007, and then numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS. Through visualization of the computational result of the impellers with a square leading edge, a semi-circular leading edge and a elliptical leading edge, it was clarified by comparison that different leading edge shapes had significant influences on the compressor strength.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} two-stage unshrouded impeller turbopump to replace the current three-stage reusable launch vehicle engine <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller</b> hydrogen pump has been evaluated {{from the standpoint of}} turbopump weight reduction and overall payload improvement. These advantages are a by-product of the higher tip speeds that an unshrouded impeller can sustain. The issues associated with the effect of unshrouded impeller tip clearance on pump efficiency and head have been evaluated with one-dimensional tools and full three-dimensional rotordynamic fluid reaction forces and coefficients have been established through time dependent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the whole 360 degree impeller with different rotor eccentricities and whirling ratios. Unlike the <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller,</b> the unshrouded impeller forces are evaluated as the sum of the pressure forces on the blade and the pressure forces on the hub using the CFD results. The turbopump axial thrust control has been optimized by adjusting the first stage impeller backend wear ring seal diameter and diverting the second stage backend balance piston flow to the proper location. The structural integrity associated with the high tip speed has been checked by analyzing a 3 D-Finite Element Model at maximum design conditions (6 % higher than the design speed).

40|$|The {{ratio of}} rocket engine thrust to weight is a {{limiting}} constraint in placing more payload into orbit {{at a low}} cost. A key component of an engine's overall weight is the turbopump weight, Reducing the turbopump weight can result in significant engine weight reduction and hence, increased delivered payload. There are two main types of pumps: centrifugal and axial pumps. These types of pumps can be further sub-divided into those with shrouds and those without shrouds (unshrouded pumps). Centrifugal pumps can achieve the same pump discharge pressure as an axial pump and it requires fewer pump stages and lower pump weight than an axial pump. Also, with unshrouded centrifugal pumps (impeller), the number of stages and weight can be further reduced. However. there are several issues with regard to using an unshrouded impeller: 1) there is a pump performance penalty due to the front open face recirculation flow; 2) {{there is a potential}} pump axial thrust problem from the unbalanced front open face and the back shroud face; and, 3) since test data is very linu'ted for this configuration, there is uncertainty in the magnitude and phase of the rotordynamics forces due to the front impeller passage. The purpose of the paper is to discuss the design of an unshrouded impeller and to examine the design's hydrodynamic performance, axial thrust, and rotordynamics performance. The design methodology will also be discussed. This work will help provide some guidelines for unshrouded impeller design. In particular, the paper will discuss the design of three unshrouded impellers - one with 5 full and 5 partial blades (5 + 5). one with 6 + 6 blades and one with 8 + 8 blades. One of these designs will be selected for actual fabrication and flow test. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to help design and optimize the unshrouded impeller. The relative pump performance penalty is assessed by comparing the CFD results of the unshrouded impeller with the equivalent <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller</b> for a particular design. Limited unshrouded - versus - <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller</b> data from the J- 2 pump is used to anchor the CFD. Since no detailed impeller blade force data is available, axial thrust and rotordynamic force predictions are based on the CFD model. For the axial thrust, the impeller front flow passage axial force is integrated from the CFD results and compared to the equivalent <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller</b> axial force. For the rotordynamics forces, the fluid reaction forces are computed from unsteady flow CFD results using a moving boundary method; the rotor- shaft is moved at several whirl-to-speed frequency ratios to extract the rotordynamics coefficients...|$|E

Velocity fields have also been computed from Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model using a commercial CFD code. For the considered flow rates, the qualitative agreement between measured and computed velocity profiles is very good. Overall, the average relative difference between these velocity profiles is around 5 %.

The absolute velocity, relative velocity, and turbulence kinetic energy levels were measured. The flow field within the impeller passages for the shrouded case was notably more uniform than for the unshrouded case. In addition, the turbulence kinetic energy within the passages was substantially lower. The efficiency of the shrouded pump was, however, lower than the unshrouded version. This was attributed primarily to losses due to leakage in the clearance region between the impeller shroud and the pump casing; a rather large passage was necessary to permit optical access.

The problem, in this case, concerns a <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller,</b> with the exception that the secondary, or leakage, passage is totally isolated from the primary-flow passage. The difference between this and the pump problem is that the former is analytically of the simple 'seal-like' configuration, with two (inlet and exit) flow-permeable stations, while the latter constitutes a double-entry / double-discharge flow problem. In all cases, the problem is that of a rotor clearance gap. The problem here is that of a rotor excitation {{in the form of a}} cylindrical whirl around the housing centerline for a smooth annular seal. In its centered operation mode, the rotor is assumed to give rise to an axisymmetric flow field in the clearance gap. As a result, problems involving longitudinal or helical grooves, in the rotor or housing surfaces, go beyond the code capabilities. Discarding, for the moment, the pre- and post-processing phases, the bulk of the computational procedure consists of two main steps. The first is aimed at producing the axisymmetric 'zeroth-order' flow solution in the given flow domain. Detailed description of this problem, including the flow-governing equations, turbulence closure, boundary conditions, and the finite-element formulation, was covered by Baskharone and Hensel. The second main step is where the perturbation model is implemented, with the input being the centered-rotor 'zeroth-order' flow solution and a prescribed whirl frequency ratio (whirl frequency divided by the impeller speed). The computational domain, in the latter case, is treated as three dimensional, with the number of computational planes in the circumferential direction being specified a priori. The reader is reminded that the deformations in the finite elements are all infinitesimally small because the rotor eccentricity itself is a virtual displacement. This explains why we have generically termed the perturbation model the 'virtually' deformable finite-element category. The primary outcome of implementing the perturbation model is the tangential and radial components, F(sub theta) (sup *) and F(sub r) (sup *) of the fluid-exerted force on the rotor surface due to the whirling motion. Repetitive execution of the perturbation model subprogram over a sufficient range of whirl frequency ratios, and subsequent interpolation of these fluid forces, using the least-square method, finally enable the user to compute the impeller rotor dynamic coefficients of the fluid/rotor interaction. These are the direct and cross-coupled stiffness, damping, and inertia effects of the fluid/rotor interaction...|$|E
40|$|Small {{centrifugal}} compressors {{are more and}} more widely used in many industrialsystems because of their higher efficiency and better off-design performance comparing to piston and scroll compressors as while as higher work coefficient perstage than in axial compressors. Higher efficiency is always the aim of the designer of compressors. In the present work, the influence of four partsof a small centrifugal compressor that compresses heavy molecular weight real gas has been investigated in order to achieve higher efficiency. Two parts concern the impeller: tip clearance and the circumferential position of the splitter blade. The other two parts concern the diffuser: the pinch shape and vane shape. Computational fluid dynamics is applied in this study. The Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes flow solver Finflo is used. The quasi-steady approach is utilized. Chien's k-e turbulence model is used to model the turbulence. A new practical real gas model is presented in this study. The real gas model is easily generated, accuracy controllable and fairly fast. The numerical results and measurements show good agreement. The influence of tip clearance on the performance of a small compressor is obvious. The pressure ratio and efficiency are decreased as the size of tip clearance is increased, while the total enthalpy rise keeps almost constant. The decrement of the pressure ratio and efficiency is larger at higher mass flow rates and smaller at lower mass flow rates. The flow angles at the inlet and outlet of the impeller are increased as the size of tip clearance is increased. The results of the detailed flow field show that leakingflow is the main reason for the performance drop. The secondary flow region becomes larger as the size of tip clearance is increased and the area of the main flow is compressed. The flow uniformity is then decreased. A detailed study shows that the leaking flow rate is higher near the exit of the impeller than that near the inlet of the impeller. Based on this phenomenon, a new partiallyshrouded impeller is used. The impeller is shrouded near the exit of the impeller. The results show that the flow field near the exit of the impeller is greatly changed by the partially <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller,</b> and better performance is achievedthan with the unshrouded impeller. The loading distribution on the impeller blade and the flow fields in the impeller is changed by moving the splitter of the impeller in circumferential direction. Moving the splitter slightly to the suction side of the long blade can improve the performance of the compressor. The total enthalpy rise is reduced if only {{the leading edge of the}} splitter ismoved to the suction side of the long blade. The performance of the compressor is decreased if the blade is bended from the radius direction at the leading edge of the splitter. The total pressure rise and the enthalpy rise of thecompressor are increased if pinch is used at the diffuser inlet. Among the fivedifferent pinch shape configurations, at design and lower mass flow rates the efficiency of a straight line pinch is the highest, while at higher mass flow rate, the efficiency of a concave pinch is the highest. The sharp corner of the pinch is the main reason for the decrease of efficiency and should be avoided. The variation of the flow angles entering the diffuser in spanwise direction is decreased if pinch is applied. A three-dimensional low solidity twisted vaned diffuser is designed to match the flow angles entering the diffuser. The numerical results show that the pressure recovery in the twisted diffuser is higher than in a conventional low solidity vaned diffuser, which also leads to higher efficiency of the twisted diffuser. Investigation of the detailed flow fields shows that the separation at lower mass flow rate in the twisted diffuser is later than in the conventional low solidity vaned diffuser, which leads to a possible wider flow range of the twisted diffuser...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} utilize the fossil {{resources}} on the Norwegian continental shelf, technology and expertise {{have proven to be}} of great importance and hence, essential for further exploration and development of new resources. A key element in this matter is the subsea wet gas compression technology which enables the transport of well stream directly to a land based treatment system, or more remote processing facilities offshore. Compression of gas at the seabed is a significant technology advance no one has previously made. The technology of subsea gas compression {{is one of the most}} important measures to deliver increased volumes from existing gas fields as well as developing resources in more remote and vulnerable areas. Due to the need of expertise and development of subsea installations, in order to meet the demand for fossil fuels and be competitive in a constantly increasing market, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) has built an experimental rig to test a wet gas compressor. The rig is unique and important to analyze the basic mechanisms and occurrence of instabilities related to wet gas compression. Both the literature review and the experimental work presented here are performed in order to visualize and document instabilities related to the phenomena surge and stall. Experimental data in this master thesis are obtained from a one- stage wet gas centrifugal compressor with an axial direct inlet. The stage involves a <b>shrouded</b> <b>impeller,</b> a vaneless diffuser and a volute. The compressor is a part of an open loop facility that is located at NTNU in Trondheim. The test rig is designed to operate with different amounts of liquid in the gas with gas volume fractions (GVF) and gas mass fractions (GMF) down to correspondingly 0. 95 and 0. 5. Applications in LabView were made and designed to analyze the raw data from the pressure sensors and pitot tubes in order to post-process and represent the data in a graphical manner. Log files from a total of seven scientific experiments with dry- and wet gas were documented and analyzed to identify the impeller outlet angle and achieving a more precise identification of wet gas surge initiation and instability precursor. The steady state flow angle experiments revealed a stringent increase in flow angle with decreasing volume flow, for both the dry gas test of 10000 and 9000 rpm, with maximum corresponding flow angles of 81. 5 and 86 degrees. A sudden rise in flow angle gradient was found to occur at a volume flow of 0. 95 m 3 /s and 0. 8 m 3 /s for 10000 rpm and 9000 rpm, respectively, due to the volute causing a shift change from deceleration to acceleration performance, at the respective volume flows. Flow angle measurements of dry gas were further validated and compared with Matlab and CFD simulation revealing coincident trends. The performed wet gas tests were associated with a greater uncertainty than dry gas, due to the influence of liquid. However, the wet gas curves showed distinct trends with lower discharge angles across the spectrum compared to the case for dry gas measurements. The transient surge identification test was conducted on 7500 rpm with alternating GMF in the range from 0. 6 to 0. 42. The pressure characteristic revealed the first sign of intermittent behavior at a volume flow of 0. 26 m 3 /s prevailing sudden stringent static pressure fluctuations. The corresponding frequency spectrum for dynamic pressure sensors shows that the critical disturbance occurs, and is enhanced at low frequencies causing the initiation of surge at a volume flow of 0. 27 m 3 /s. A pitot tube set-up for identification of surge onset was evaluated and compared to the measurements conducted by a static pressure-, a differential pressure- and a high responsive dynamic pressure sensor. The detection tube indicated a possible precursor to surge by prevailing change and high fluctuations in the stagnation pressure. Observation through the impeller inlet showed that an annular backflow ring was formed with decreasing volume flow. The first observation of the ring shape was done for a volume flow of 0. 3 m 3 /s, followed by larger developments and a chaotic flow path with complete backflow for volume flow lower than 0. 25 m 3 /s. </p...|$|E
40|$|LectureRecent {{designs of}} high and medium {{pressure}} centrifugal compressors show a well-behaved response to forced vibration and an adequate margin to self-excited vibration. This can only be achieved by an extensive rotor dynamic analysis and wide practical experience. A number of sophisticated computer codes to calculate the response and the stability of complex rotors are widely used. One problem with the application of these programs is the realistic estimation of data for aerodynamic excitation. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to discuss the different types of excitation that occur in a multistage centrifugal compressor with <b>shrouded</b> <b>impellers</b> and to evaluate their importance with respect to lateral vibrations. The main source for self-excitation is found to be the labyrinth seals. A simple one-dimensional aerodynamic theory to calculate the destabilizing lateral forces of the labyrinths is presented. It is shown that the tangential velocity of the leakage gas strongly influences the excitation. Simple devices which may be installed in nearly any compressor reduce the excitation by reducing the fluid rotation in the labyrinth annulus. Stability tests for a number of different centrifugal compressors have been carried out on a test bed. The stability limits have been determined by increasing the pressure level at constant speed until subsynchronous vibration occurs. The measured stability limits agree well with those theoretically predicted using calculated labyrinth data...|$|R
40|$|Centrifugal pump {{performance}} characteristics are vital {{in determining the}} ability of a prototype left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to meet the physiological circulation requirements of the cardiovascular system. These characteristics influence the static hydraulic forces encountered by the pump impeller, which determine the required load stiffness of suspension type bearings to minimize impeller touchdown. Performance investigations were conducted on an LVAD design while characterizing the impeller static hydraulic forces of various impeller/volute configurations. The pumps were inserted into a complete systemic and pulmonary mock circulation rig configured to provide suitable nonpulsatile or simulated pulsatile left heart failure environments. The single volute and closed <b>shroud</b> <b>impeller</b> configuration exhibited lowest radial (0. 01 N) and axial (3 N) force at nonpulsatile design flow conditions, respectively. Normal hemodynamic conditions of 5. 1 L/min at 94 mmHg were re-established upon inserting the device into the left heart failure environment, where the pump operated along the nonpulsatile characteristic curve for 2200 rpm. The operational limits on this curve were dictated by the required pressure differential across the pump during systolic and diastolic periods. The reduction of left atrial pressure (25 to 8 mmHg) indicated the alleviation of pulmonary congestion. The ability for the LVAD to support circulation in a left heart failure environment was successfully demonstrated in the mock circulation loop. The impeller hydraulic force characteristics attained will aid the bearing designer to select the best volute and impeller configuration to minimize impeller touchdown in magnetic, hydrodynamic or mechanical type bearing applications...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of inversion has been made with mixer designs {{similar to those used}} industrially for metals extraction in mixer-settler equipment. The impellers were fitted with retreat, curved blades. Double <b>shrouded,</b> centrally located <b>impellers</b> (with and without impeller blades on the shrouds) and a single <b>shrouded</b> bottom located <b>impeller</b> were compared. The impeller diameters were 177 mm. The mixing tank was an unbaffled closed tank of square cross-section (300 x 300 mm).
