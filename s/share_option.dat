[...] If they stick to this line it will be almost {{impossible for him to}} secure the votes needed to capture Eircom. Deadlock looms.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to obtain an understanding as to the true economic nature of employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> and the problems surrounding the accounting thereof. The main conclusion {{of this study is}} that employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> should be expensed in the income statement as and when the employee's services are performed. The reason is that employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> are valuable financial instruments which the employer has used to compensate the employee for his services. It was also concluded that exercise date accounting and classification of outstanding employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> as liabilities on the balance sheet is the most appropriate accounting treatment. Such accounting treatment trues up the accounting of employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> with that of cash-settled share appreciation rights, which are economically equivalent transactions. The measurement of employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> should be based on their fair value using an option-pricing model adapted for the specific features of employee <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> AccountingThesis (M.

40|$|Employee {{stock options}} scheme (ESOS) {{is a call}} option on the {{ordinary}} share of a company, issued {{as a form of}} non-cash compensation or as an incentive tool. ESOS gives an employee the right to buy shares at a fixed price for a defined number of years into the future. The trend toward broad-based <b>share</b> <b>options</b> may come to an end as companies are scaling back due to the changes in accounting standards. Similarly, companies in Malaysia, especially in the banking industry which originally offered <b>share</b> <b>options</b> to their employees are now pulling back this scheme. Does the movement to scale back <b>share</b> <b>options</b> affect employees’ motivation? This is an empirical question which this paper intends to explore. It is hope that the commercial banks will reconsider offering ESOS in rewarding their employees if the research finding indicates that it plays a significant role in motivating employees...|$|R

40|$|This study {{represents}} a first attempt in the UK literature to split total pay into salary, annual bonus and <b>share</b> <b>options</b> {{for the purpose}} of empirically verifying how each is related to executive performance. As predicted from earlier studies on total pay, salaries were found primarily determined by firm size. Contarary to prior research, however, our findings suggest a pronounced link does exist between performance and pay over both the short- and long-term. This is manifested particularly by the magnitude of the coefficient estimates found between changes in shareholders return and changes in executive <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> This finding strongly suggests that the leverage executives achieve, on average, in their rewards as share prices increase may well be substantial; a finding that has not been captured in previous research on executive remuneration and which is of considerable relevance to the current corporate governance debates.
