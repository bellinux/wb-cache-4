40|$|Abstract. Place {{research}} underscores a {{need for}} social learning. Social learning about place is appropriate in a preparatory phase prior to initiating a formal planning process. Doing so enables land-use planners to begin public dialogue at a point that appreciates landscapes and builds a positive base to grow relationships among stakeholders. Sharing stories of place allows emotions {{to come to the}} surface and become known. Planning processes have traditionally avoided explicit inclusion of emotion, and have excluded any knowledge that comes from their public expression. Emotions are best understood when they are shown through a living of the emotions at the moment of representation. Sharing stories about place requires social scientists and planners to expand the traditional roles of their craft to include a showing of emotions. Several scholars have recommended the need to create dialogue forums that encourage the representation of emotions within working relationships. The following challenges are explored within “learning circles ” in three different land-use planning contexts: (1) <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>forums</b> need to be structured in ways that allow participants to feel safe and comfortable sharing stories about place; (2) <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>forums</b> need to value emotional expression regarding people’s attachment to places; and (3) <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>forums</b> need to recognize that sharing place meanings holds promise to create new public values for a landscape. Place research underscores {{a need for}} social learning. Place research recognize...|$|R

40|$|MM Thesis 2011 ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} how change management improved planning for infrastructure and compliance with policy requirements in KZN DOH. Infrastructure plays a critical role in the roll out of service delivery. This was an exploratory study in which in-depth interviews were conducted with officials and consultants. This study found that, resistance to change was experienced at all levels. <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>forums</b> were established to address resistance to change. Regular communication was maintained. Leadership reinforced rules for infrastructure planning. Change management improved infrastructure planning. Planning is integrated and coordinated between various Directorates and no projects are undertaken outside the agreed plans. The study recommends that commitment and ‘buy-in’ of senior management must be displayed early and throughout the process. <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>forums</b> created must be maintained. The tools for infrastructure planning must be adopted formally into the department. Ongoing training must be provided for new and existing staff...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{adverse effects}} of climate change on Ethiopia’s agricultural sector are a major concern, particularly given the country’s dependence on agricultural production. Securing Ethiopia’s economic and social well-being in the face of climate change requires that policymakers and stakeholders work together to integrate climate change adaptation into the country’s development process. Three <b>stakeholder</b> discussion <b>forums</b> held in 2006 in Addis Ababa, Awassa, and Bahir Dar as part of the project, “Food and Water Security under Global Change: Developing Adaptive Capacity with a Focus on Rural Africa,” were attended by representatives of the government, civil society, business sector, and local communities. The forums elicited information to enable policymakers to make more informed decisions related to climate change adaptation. The forums complemented ongoing efforts to develop the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA), which is overseen by a steering committee representing government, nongovernment, academic, and research institutions. Under NAPA, multidisciplinary technical working groups have been formed to assess the country’s vulnerability to the adverse consequences of climate change, gauge current adaptation efforts, and identify ways in which public agencies could assist in minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change. In addition, two national and eight regional workshops were conducted involving nearly 500 participants with various areas of expertise. Like the <b>stakeholder</b> <b>forums,</b> the workshops solicited information to create greater awareness of climate change, assess the extent of the area’s vulnerability, and help identify adaptation options. This brief is based on a paper that presents findings from the <b>stakeholder</b> discussion <b>forums,</b> as well as NAPA’s technical working groups and workshops. These meetings explored stakeholders’ perceptions of vulnerability to climate change and considered ways in which adaptation measures could be further integrated into Ethiopia’s development process.

50|$|This program {{supports}} {{better health}} through improved {{water resources management}} and expanded access to clean water and sanitation services. With a ridge to reef approach, partners improve water resource management from watershed sources, along rivers, through cities, and to coastal reefs. In the upper watershed, the program promotes forest management, biodiversity conservation, and land use planning to protect a steady, year-round source of clean water. Further downstream, the program strengthens municipal water utilities to improve and expand piped water and sanitation services to communities. <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>forums</b> link upstream and downstream communities to build consensus on water and waste management issues. Marginalized urban communities also benefit from the introduction of safe drinking water through Air Rahmat, a home chlorination product being introduced to the market through a public-private partnership.|$|R
40|$|From 1980 to 2000, the Mondego estuary (Portugal) {{suffered}} {{dramatic changes}} due to eutrophication, {{leading to a}} decline in seagrass beds and changes in community structure, namely a decline in species richness and replacement of herbivores by detritivores. Because the conservation status of the estuary was being compromised, a restoration project was implemented in 1998 in order to restore the original natural seagrass habitat. This project included several restoration/management measures, including the protection of the remaining seagrass patches and improvement of the hydraulic conditions through modifying sluice opening regimes, thereby reducing the nutrient loading in the southern arm of the estuary. In addition, several <b>stakeholder</b> <b>forums</b> were convened to inform local people of the ecological and economic importance of the area.
