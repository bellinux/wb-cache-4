500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and Brown, and was filmed in August 2012. On August 29, 2012 Brown released an image from the shoot, showing himself seated {{on the floor of}} an abandoned room in an unbuttoned jacket. On September 11, 2012 Brown released a similar image, tweeting, [...] "'Don't Judge Me' video coming soon!". The video premiered on Vimeo on September 27, 2012. It begins with Brown walking through the desert, while intercut scenes of himself sitting in front of a couch (with his girlfriend, played by Runa Lucienne, sleeping behind him) are shown. As the chorus begins for the first time, Brown is seen catching a ride from an army truck. He eventually arrives at an army base to prepare for a [...] "suicide mission", which involves him riding a spacecraft into outer space to save the world from an alien ship invading Earth. A news reporter at the base (Brown's girlfriend) runs to him with the question, [...] "People are <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> suicide mission, why are you doing this?" [...] Brown replies, [...] "I'm doing a service for my country and my planet. If that means saving the people I love and I care about, then that's what I'll do." [...] As the spacecraft takes off, tears run down Brown's face before the spacecraft crashes into the alien ship, killing him. Brown and his girlfriend are then shown, hugging on the couch.|$|E
500|$|At this moment, cries {{are heard}} from the Knights (""): a flying swan has been shot, and a young man is brought forth, a bow {{in his hand and}} a quiver of {{matching}} arrows. Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> holy place. He asks him outright if he shot the swan, and the lad boasts that if it flies, he can hit it ("") Gurnemanz tells him that the swan is a holy animal, and asks what harm the swan had done him, and shows the youth its lifeless body. Now remorseful, the young man breaks his bow and casts it aside. Gurnemanz asks him why he is here, who his father is, how he found this place and, lastly, his name. To each question the lad replies, [...] "I don't know." [...] The elder Knight sends his squires away to help the King and now asks the boy to tell what he does know. The young man says he has a mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Sorrow) and that he made the bow himself. Kundry has been listening and now tells them that this boy's father was Gamuret, a knight killed in battle, and also how the lad's mother had forbidden her son to use a sword, fearing that he would meet the same fate as his father. The youth now recalls that upon seeing knights pass through his forest, he had left his home and mother to follow them. Kundry laughs and tells the young man that, as she rode by, she saw Herzeleide die of grief. Hearing this, the lad first lunges at Kundry but then collapses in grief. Kundry herself is now weary for sleep, but cries out that she must not sleep and wishes that she might never again waken. She disappears into the undergrowth.|$|E

50|$|On August 6, 1956 Edward J. Fitzgerald, {{owner of}} WGSM in Huntington, NY took control. The sale {{approved}} by the Federal Communications Commission and a bankruptcy court judge; the price was assumption of WGBB’s debt. And the FCC waved its duopoly rule which prohibited ownership of overlapping signals <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> way to be sure creditors would be paid. Fitzgerald guided the station’s music policy back to standards away from current hits and especially doo-wop which was being played on the popular Night Train evening music show hosted by Lee Donahue and then Alan Fredericks. Soon after taking over Fitzgerald invested in a Collins 300G transmitter boosting WGBB’s output to 250 watts. In 1956 WGBB was the only remaining 100 watt station in the New York area and one of a just handful in the entire country. It was said that Carman had asked the FCC not to grant a power increase because of the substantial investment. It was also rumored that Carman rejected an FCC proposal to outfit WGBB with a new frequency and a power increase to 50 thousand watts to fill the need for another major coastal signal. Staffers, disheartened by these unusual choices, knew that Carman and program director Ada Cheesman {{did not have the}} competence or assets to accomplish such a transformation.|$|E
