5|$|Illyrian was {{spoken in}} the northwest, {{and to the}} {{northeast}} Thracian and Dacian. These three languages, all Indo-European, are sometimes thought to be earlier forms of Albanian. From his exile in Tomis on the Black Sea (present-day Constanța, Romania), the Augustan poet Ovid learned Getic and Sarmatian, and noted that Greek was <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> a markedly Getic accent. Inscriptions from Tomis in the Imperial period are generally Greek, with Thracian personal names and religious references.|$|E
5|$|American {{businessman}} and philanthropist Armand Hammer, {{well known to}} the Soviet Union for his financial pursuits and humanitarian ties, left Los Angeles for Armenia on board a Boeing 727 loaded with 2,300 pounds of medical supplies that were provided by the American Red Cross. Hammer, known for his decades of work with the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, had <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> Gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him $1 million in relief funds. Half of those funds were from World Vision International, a California-based relief and development umbrella organization, {{and the other half}} were his own personal donation. The flight also carried Robert Seiple (president of World Vision) and a UCLA doctor who had worked {{in the aftermath of the}} 1985 Mexico City earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E

5|$|Hours earlier, Lucan had again {{called his}} mother, at about 12:30am. He {{told her that}} he would be in touch later that day, but {{declined}} to speak with the police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning. Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder, and <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand-Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand-Kydd at his country house near Leighton Buzzard and told him about the letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them. After reading them, and noting that they were bloodstained, he took them to Ranson.|$|E
5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled Touch Down. The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to do some work. McCulloch was initially sceptical because he had not <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> Sergeant since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea some thought. Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was not upset about this as he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} of The Hills begins with Whitney Port {{becoming}} Lauren's boss, after being promoted within Teen Vogue. On their first day returning to work, Lauren informs Whitney of false speculation regarding a sex tape involving {{herself and her}} ex-boyfriend Jason Wahler. Lauren comments that she has not <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> Heidi since she moved into an apartment with Spencer, and the women become suspicious of her possible involvement with the rumors. Meanwhile, Heidi and Spencer are planning their housewarming party; Spencer plans on inviting several of his friends, while Heidi was only planning on inviting Lauren, Whitney, and Audrina Patridge. Visiting Audrina at Epic Records unannounced, she delivers invitations for Audrina and Lauren. Audrina accepts the invitations, although later tells her co-worker that she believes that Heidi and Spencer were speaking badly of Lauren and were responsible for spreading the sex tape rumors.|$|E

5000|$|Eichelbaum {{interpreted}} his {{terms of}} reference such {{that he did not}} interview anyone who had been directly involved with the case. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> any of the children. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> the children's parents, some of whom regularly visited the Civic Crèche [...] He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> the children's evidential interviewers. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> any of the crèche workers. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> Ellis's mother. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> Peter Ellis. He did not <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> the oldest complainant, one of seven children upon whose evidence Ellis was convicted. Several months after the trial had ended, the child stated that she had not been sexually abused. Eichelbaum did not seek advice from academics within New Zealand universities when appointing experts for his inquiry. The only people with whom Eichelbaum discussed the matter of the selection of the experts were Justice Ministry officials and Thomas Lyon, a USA law professor. In 1999 Lyon criticised the direction and relevance of research undertaken by experts nominated by Ellis's counsel. Lyon's critique was cited approvingly in the Crown's submission to the ministerial inquiry.|$|R

5|$|When God Writes Your Love Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story {{in his book}} If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.|$|E
5|$|By 2011, {{several of}} the {{strippers}} JC's Girls members had <b>spoken</b> <b>with</b> in San Diego had begun attending a Bible study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper leave the sex industry and gain unrelated employment. In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could {{spend more time with}} her family, handing the leadership of the organization to Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher gave up her co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a Bible study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization.|$|E
