500|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 {{called for}} the {{disarmament}} of militia with the Taif agreement {{at the end of}} the Lebanese civil war. Hezbollah denounced, and protested against, the resolution. The 2006 military conflict with Israel has increased the controversy. Failure to disarm remains a violation of the resolution and agreement as well as subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Since then both Israel and Hezbollah have asserted that the organization has gained in military strength. A Lebanese public opinion poll taken in August 2006 shows that most of the Shia did not believe that Hezbollah should disarm after the 2006 Lebanon war, while the majority of Sunni, Druze and Christians believed that they should. The Lebanese cabinet, under president Michel Suleiman and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, guidelines state that Hezbollah enjoys the right to [...] "liberate occupied lands."

2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} released {{footage of}} a captured RQ-170 on 8 December. The captured drone {{appeared to be}} largely intact, except for minor damage on its left wing. Dan Goure, {{an analyst at the}} Lexington Institute, stated the largely intact airframe ruled out the possibility of an engine or navigational malfunction: [...] "Either this was a cyber/electronic warfare attack system that brought the system down or it was a glitch in the command-and-control system". On 8 December, a senior U.S. official, <b>speaking</b> <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> of anonymity, told the Washington Post that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that [...] "We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire." [...] A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained [...] "virtually intact," [...] given the high altitude from which it is thought to have crashed. After examining the video on 8 Dec, US officials confirmed that the drone was genuine, even though some civilians had initially expressed doubt. Bill Sweetman, an author with an interest in military planes, speculated that the Iranians did not shoot down the plane (citing the lack of burn marks, holes, or outward damage) or hack into the system, postulating that a system failure downed the plane, and that the plane could be intact from what is known as a [...] "flat spin" [...] or [...] "falling leaf departure".|$|E
2500|$|On 11 July 2012, Ynetnews {{reported}} that {{on that day}} the Iron Dome system was deployed in the greater Eilat area {{as a part of}} an IDF survey meant to test it in various areas across Israel.

Three weeks beforehand, two Katyhusha rockets were fired into southern Israel, and according to The Jerusalem Post the IDF believes that they originated from the Sinai. According to the report, IDF assessments are that they were either fired by a Palestinian rocket cell from Gaza—affiliated either with Hamas or Islamic Jihad—or by Bedouin freelancers who work for them. The launches followed an earlier one in April 2012, when at least one Katyusha rocket was fired from the Sinai to Eilat. Ynetnews reported that according to a military source, following these rocket attacks, the IDF decided not to take any chances and calibrated the system to the region's topography, before finally deploying it. The system's deployment was coordinated with local communities and the City of Eilat, in order to prevent public panic.|$|E

5000|$|The Chapman {{approach}} has been applied {{in a variety of}} ways since its original report, varying substrates, oxidants, and other aspects (and so synthesis of carpanone has subsequently been achieved by [...] "quite a few research groups"); the actual mechanism of Pd(II) action is likely more complex than the original conjecture, and there is evidence that the mechanism, broadly <b>speaking,</b> depends <b>on</b> actual <b>conditions</b> (specific substrate, oxidant, etc.). Various groups, including the laboratories of Steve Ley, Craig Lindley, and Matthew Shair, have succeeded in extending the Chapman method to solid-supported synthesis, i.e., phenolic starting materials on polymeric supports, thus allowing the generation of libraries of carpanone analogs.
