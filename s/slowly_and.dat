5|$|One {{strategy}} is to minimise actual motion, as when predators such as tigers stalk prey by moving very <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids the need to camouflage motion.|$|E
5|$|Slow second movement, {{in a key}} {{different}} from the tonic, and in A–B–A (ternary) or A–B–A–B–A form. The main sections (A and B) are contrasted in key and character, A is slow and meditative; B is more intense and animated. The movement begins and ends <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> quietly.|$|E

5|$|A large {{army was}} {{assembled}} <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> marched into Scotland. Not only was no pitched battle ever attempted, but the king {{did not try}} and besiege Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. Henry's army left {{at the end of}} the summer after only a brief stay, mostly camped near Leith (near Edinburgh) where it could maintain contact with its supply fleet. The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and is historically notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above. To what extent deep-water coral reefs provide a safe nursery area for juvenile fish has not been established, {{but they may be}} important for many cold-water species.|$|E
5|$|Etz Ahayem, was {{established}} in 1912 by Ladino speaking Sephardi Jews, particularly from Rhodes. The congregation grew <b>slowly,</b> <b>and</b> completed construction of its first building in 1927. In 1962 the congregation {{moved to a new}} building, but by the 1990s it had dwindled, as children of congregants moved away from Montgomery, and the synagogue had difficulty finding rabbis to lead it.|$|E
5|$|From September 9 to September 11, Ophelia fluctuated in strength, being {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm only to regain hurricane intensity three more times; during this time it moved very <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> erratically in a northeasterly direction. The NHC continued to struggle to predict Ophelia, with the forecasts generally calling for a landfall {{on the east coast}} of the United States. The forecasters indicated there was a possibility that Ophelia could strengthen further to Category 3 strength, though they felt this was unlikely. On September 12, the storm completed a clockwise loop, then adopted a more north-westerly motion towards North Carolina, while still moving only <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> fitfully. It dropped below hurricane strength again when the inner core of convection collapsed, possibly due to passing over cooler water that it upwelled earlier in its track. Ophelia then regained hurricane strength over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. After the collapse of the inner core of convection, the hurricane acquired an unusually large eye over 115miles (185km) across and soon reached its peak strength with 85mph (140km/h) winds. The northern and western eyewall passed over the coastal areas of North Carolina throughout September 14–15, but the strongest winds remained offshore.|$|E

5|$|Offshore, Ismael {{produced}} {{waves of}} up to 30feet (9m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were unprepared for the hurricane, which was expected to move more <b>slowly,</b> <b>and</b> as a result 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26million in damage (1995USD, $ USD). The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000people homeless. Moisture from the storm extended into the United States, causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of August 8, 2009, the US Coast Guard {{maintained}} a two-mile safety zone from the Holland Tunnel to the Lincoln Tunnel, requiring vessels to move <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> stay within 400yards of the Manhattan side while passing through the area. The safety zone was maintained by the Coast Guard cutter Penobscot Bay.|$|E
5|$|Principe Amedeo {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenale di La Spezia in August 1865, and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 15 January 1872. Fitting-out work proceeded very <b>slowly,</b> <b>and</b> the ship was finally completed on 15 December 1874. Obsolescent {{by the time she}} was completed, Principe Amedeo primarily served in the Italian colonial empire, which Italy had begun acquiring in the 1880s. She occasionally took part in training maneuvers with the main Italian fleet throughout her career.|$|E

5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by superb fairywren {{males have}} been recorded. The 'sea horse flight', {{named for its}} seahorse-like undulations, is one such display. During this exaggerated flight, the male—with his neck extended and his head feathers erect—tilts his body from horizontal to vertical, and descends <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> springs upwards by rapidly beating his wings after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display {{may be seen as}} a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E
5|$|Since the RCL {{is still}} covalently {{attached}} to the protease via the ester bond, the S to R transition pulls protease from the top {{to the bottom of}} the serpin and distorts the catalytic triad. The distorted protease can only hydrolyse the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> so the protease remains covalently attached for days to weeks. Serpins are classed as irreversible inhibitors and as suicide inhibitors since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single protease, and can only function once.|$|E

5|$|The missionaries {{were forced}} to proceed <b>slowly,</b> <b>and</b> could not do much about {{eliminating}} pagan practices, or destroying temples or other sacred sites, unlike the missionary efforts {{that had taken place}} in Gaul under St Martin. There was little fighting or bloodshed during the mission. Paganism was still practised in Kent until the 630s, and it was not declared illegal until 640. Although Honorius sent Felix to the East Angles, it appears that most of the impetus for conversion came from the East Anglian king.|$|E
5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can be {{attributed}} to a deepening low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core low off the coast of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve <b>slowly,</b> <b>and</b> Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E
