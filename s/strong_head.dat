Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that Carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams. They calculated that the neck musculature {{was strong enough to}} absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed <b>strong</b> <b>head</b> blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck.|$|E

The structure of the Constitution is similar to the Russian Federation: for example, the office of the President has powers analogous to those granted to the President of Russia. Overall, the Constitution sought to preserve the statehood of Belarus from pro-Russian unity movements, provide a <b>strong</b> <b>head</b> of state that could cure the ailments Belarus would endure in the post-Soviet era, and lay out a compromise between the political factions in Belarus.|$|E

Out of a total of about 219 men who had left Baja California, little more than 100 survived. The survivors established the Presidio of San Diego on May 14, 1769. Mission San Diego de Alcala was established on July 16, 1769.

500|$|The Dorniers were {{supported}} by German fighter aircraft that had been sent out {{in advance of the}} main strike.

Some 30 Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) flew close escort. The bombers were travelling slowly, forcing the fighters to lower their flaps to stay with the bombers, which made them sitting ducks. They crossed the coast at Folkestone at 11:36. Fighters from II.Lehrgeschwader 2 (Demonstration Wing 2) were also to form part of the escort. They flew in advance of the main force to drop [...] bombs and then resume their role as fighters. The <b>strong</b> <b>head</b> wind slowed the Dorniers, which meant that the Germans took even longer to reach the target while burning up the Bf 109s' limited fuel supplies.

[...] Experiencing <b>strong</b> <b>head</b> winds and rough water, Cowles, the Oxford bow man, suffered serious damage to his oar, nullifying further contribution to the race. [...] Described by an Oxford undergraduate watching the race: [...] "suddenly Oxford staggered and stood still in a mass of foam: the bow-oar, Cowles, had struck the top of a big wave in feathering and broken his blade clean off."

Twelve competitors continued powering to the finish, enjoying a 1’ lead with 20 kilometres to go. After Cordon and Jiang dropped out of the front group, nine ladies could start considering the stage win. One after the other, the five Orica-AIS girls tried to break away but were caught on each attack. It came down to a sprint, captured by Wild, ahead of Trixi Worrack and Ellen van Dijk. Chloe Hosking captured a fine fourth spot on the line, keeping command of the overall standings.
