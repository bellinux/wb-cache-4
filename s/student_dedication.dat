Amongst measures to improve student retention, grants and bursaries promote equity by making financial assistance available for study purposes to children of low-income families. Within the framework of the Spanish government's University Strategy 2015 programme, the purpose behind the introduction of study bursaries was to provide economically disadvantaged social groups with access to, and the possibility of completing, higher education studies. From a study of 642 undergraduate students awarded a study bursary in the 2010 - 11 cohort at the University of Barcelona, a profile of the study bursary holders and their academic performance during their first year at university was defined. The projected results indicate that study bursaries lead to higher levels of <b>student</b> <b>dedication</b> in the pursuit of study and that they offset the difficulties faced by students from low-income families...|$|E

40|$|Student Community Services (SCS) {{is one of}} the {{compulsory}} {{subjects for}} university students in Indonesia. SCS is one form of <b>student</b> <b>dedication</b> to the community. Student seeks to facilitate and motivate communities to implement development in accordance with the knowledge and skill they acquired in the school. The aim of this research is to describe the role of SCS as a tool of civic education. This research is a qualitative study. The data were collected by literature reviews, observations, and in-depth interviews. The analysis of data used an interactive model of Miles and Huberman (1984). SCS aims to: (1) train students in applying science, technology, arts, and culture they acquired in college to solve the problems that exist in the community, (2) train and develop soft skills and character of students, (3) train students to understand the condition of the people in both rural and urban areas, so that students have a sensitivity and concern for the people who need assistance, (4) prepare future leaders in favor of honesty, justice, and truth, (5) train students in solving development problems in community, (6) train students in planning, implementing, and evaluating a program in the community, and (7) explore the various conditions of the community as a feedback to the university in the development of college assignment. SCS activity is a real university contribution to the community, industry, local government and community groups who wish to be economically and socially independent. SCS can instill the values of social responsibility to students with the hope they will participate in community development to create social harmony. Therefore, SCS {{can be used as a}} tool for civic education. Some challenges and difficulties encountered in this program including: (1) the complexity of the local bureaucracy; (2) low community participation; (3) incompatibility between programs and issues; (4) human relations between students and the community; and (5) comprehensive assessment system...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Objectives of the Study The study {{attempted}} {{to accomplish the}} following: 1. Document the fundamental or conservative nature of early American higher education, especially the nine colonial colleges, and verify its seemingly irrepressible progression toward liberalism. 2. Determine the nature of variables associated {{with the process of}} liberalization. 3. Isolate one variable, i. e. student values, and note its relationship to campus atmosphere and its potential in the liberalization process. 4. Complete a statistical study of student values designed {{to determine whether or not}} liberal arts programs have students with significantly different values than those of religious studies programs. Research Procedures A values instrument,the Value Micro-Analysis Inventory,was designed specifically for use in the Bible institute, the Bible college and the Christian liberal arts college. The Inventory was developed, modified, field tested and validated by the researcher. Copies of the values inventory were mailed to participating institutions and tables of random numbers were used in random sampling of the student populations. A total of 599 usable copies, or 43. 6 percent of those distributed, were returned from all institutions and 13. 0 percent of the total population of all institutions was represented by usable copies returned. Of the total returned, 1 Z percent or 8 Z were not usable copies. The first analysis was designed to determine whether or not there was a difference, at the. 05 percent level of significance, between the mean value scores of religious studies students and liberal arts students in the Bible college as measured by the VM -AI. A composite of data from three Bible colleges was used in Analysis I. The second analysis was designed to determine whether or not there was a difference, at the. 05 percent level of significance, in the mean value scores of five student categories represented by students with majors or minors in, a) Bible institute, religious studies, b) Bible college, religious studies, c) Bible college, liberal arts, d) Christian liberal arts college, religious studies and e) Christian liberal arts college, liberal arts as measured by the VM-AI. One Bible institute, three Bible colleges and one Christian liberal arts college were included in the study. The data were processed at the Oregon State University Computer Center. Conclusions The F statistic, using the one-way analysis of variance, indicated there was no difference, at the. 05 level of significance, between the mean value scores of students in both Analysis I and Analysis II of the statistical study. The study tends to indicate that the addition. of liberal arts programs does not involve students with values differing significantly from those of students in religious studies programs and that institutions with more comprehensive liberal arts programs do not attract a student body with significantly different values than schools with little or no liberal arts. Caution must be exercised in generalizing beyond the five institutions participating in the study because of a number of variables affecting student values and campus atmosphere. Variables affecting generalization are those of faculty composition, subscription to, and practice of, a Christian philosophy of education, entrance requirements for students, administrative procedures and a required core of at least 45 credits of Bible and theology. It is important that subjective as well as objective criteria and valuations be utilized in curriculum determinations related to, or requiring, the measurement and understanding of student values and campus atmosphere including vital Christian fellowship, spiritual atmosphere and <b>student</b> <b>dedication</b> to non-materialistic enterprise...|$|E

40|$|This study explores how {{the unique}} history, culture, {{and traditions of}} Texas A&M University shape students? {{perceptions}} and understandings of diversity and diversity programs. I examine these issues through participant observation of Texas A&M?s football traditions and in-depth, semi-structured interviews {{with members of the}} student body. In response to increased media scrutiny, public pressure, and scholastic competition, the current administration has embraced a number of aggressive initiatives to increase diversity among members of the student body. The collision between decades of tradition and the administration?s vision for the future has given rise to tension between members of the student body and the administration, which I argue is due, at least in part, to the culture that began developing at Texas A&M {{during the middle of the}} twentieth century as students began reacting to the prospect of change. I conclude that this historical and cultural context continues to impact modern campus life through <b>students?</b> <b>dedication</b> to tradition. In addition, I suggest that current students tend to assign different meanings and values to the concepts of both tradition and diversity than either faculty members or administrators do, creating tensions that have not been comprehensively examined or understood within the context of the Texas A&M community. Based on these findings, I suggest that proponents of diversity can improve the diversity project at Texas A&M University by giving students more responsibility for diversity programs, emphasizing the process (rather than the results) of diversification, attempting to eradicate all forms of intolerance and injustice on campus, and insisting on a policy of mutual respect...|$|R
50|$|Kuk Sool Won uniforms {{include a}} belt which {{indicates}} rank {{and length of}} study. Gradations are designated by divisions termed Geup 급 (or Kup) at the student level and by degrees termed Dahn 단 at the expert (or instructor) level. Various colors are used for the belts to illustrate the Geup grades while black {{is used for the}} Dahn degrees. Additionally, the Geup grades count down (12th & 11th kup = white belt, 10th & 9th kop = yellow belt, etc.) while the Dan degrees count up (cho dahn = 1st degree, ee dahn - 2nd degree, sahm dahn = 3rd degree, etc.). As there are two Geup grades for each colored belt, individual schools may opt to affix stripes of the next colored belt level on a student's belt to further indicate this rank achievement. This practice is most notably seen at the black/brown belt level to indicate the number of tests taken for their Dahn ranking, as several tests are mandatory before advancement is granted. Black/Brown Belt (or black belt candidacy) is an intermediary stage where the student is required to gain a minimum of 6-10 black stripes, over the minimum required 2 years of training and 2 years of testing, before advancing to Cho Dahn or 1st Degree. Advancement from Huin Ddi to Cho Dahn, i.e. white belt to black belt, depends largely on the <b>student's</b> <b>dedication</b> and practice and thus achieving the rank of 1st Degree Black Belt could take anywhere from 4 to 6 years.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{problems}} {{identified in}} the literature on teacher retention and resilience include (a) a gap in understanding factors influencing urban teacher retention; (b) lack of clarity on multiple factors swaying teachers 2 ̆ 7 decisions to remain despite challenges; (c) overlapping definitions of teacher retention, attrition, and resilience; and (d) absence of a theoretical framework for a potential relationship between retention and resilience. This embedded-case study sought to identify factors influencing effective teachers 2 ̆ 7 decisions to remain in an urban setting and to examine the role of teachers 2 ̆ 7 resilience, retention, and effectiveness with respect to this decision. Fourteen core-area secondary teachers, identified through criterion reference sampling by National Board Certification status and administrators 2 ̆ 7 assessment of characteristics derived from studies on effective urban teaching, participated in a focus group and individual interviews and supplied archival data. Line-by-line coding and data grouping revealed that (a) passion for <b>students,</b> <b>dedication</b> to reflection, a sense of spiritual calling, and dedication to social justice influenced both retention and resilience; (b) professional development increased resilience but had little influence on the decision to remain; and (c) teacher community influenced resilience at varying levels. The findings indicate a relationship between retention and resilience, yet they are not synonymous, suggesting caution when using resilience studies to create retention models. Outcomes suggest professional development that emphasizes reflection on one 2 ̆ 7 s purpose and practice and the linkage of reflection, pedagogical changes, and student achievement.

40|$|In {{drawing a}} {{conclusion}} for this study, {{care must be}} taken in generalizing findings since the population of students and teachers investigated were limited to certain levels in the different schools and countries. This study recognized some complexity of the factors underlying the status of school gardening instruction and activities in Germany, Nigeria and the U. S. as inadequate time for decision-making in the process of gardening, motivation of teachers and students. This was seen as the major impediments that influenced the status of gardening in the three countries. However, these factors were considered to have affected students’ mode of participation in the school gardening projects. This research finding suggests that the promotion and encouragement of students in gardening activities will promote vegetable production and increasing the numbers of practical farmers. Gardening has the potential to create opportunities for learning in an environment where children are able to experience nature first hand and to use the shared experience for communication (Bowker & Tearle, 2007). Therefore, the need for students to be encouraged to participate in gardening programs as the benefit will not only reduce the rate of obesity currently spreading among youths, but will contribute to the improve knowledge on science subjects. To build a network between community, parents and schools, a parent’s community approach should be used as the curriculum. The community approach will tighten the link between schools; community members, parents, teachers and students. This will help facilitate a better gardening projects implementation. Through a close collaboration, teachers and students will be able to identify issues affecting communities and undertake action learning in collaboration with community organizations to assess community needs and plan the implementation strategies as parents are part of the community. The sense of efficacy is a central factor in motivational and learning processes that govern educational improvement, standard and performance on complex tasks of both teachers and <b>students.</b> <b>Dedication</b> and willingness are the major stimulator and achievement of a project. Through a stimulator and provision of incentives and facilities, schools can achieve the best in project development. Teachers and principals should be aware that students are the lever for achieving the set goals in schools. Failure to understand what students need will result in achieving zero result. Therefore, it is advised that schools focus more on how to lure students to work through proper collaboration with the parents and community members. Principals and teachers should identify areas where students need to be corrected, helping them to correct the problem will enable them be committed in the schools’ programs...|$|R
