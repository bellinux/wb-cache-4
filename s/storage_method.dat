5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy <b>storage</b> <b>method</b> to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical inertia is {{the basis}} of this <b>storage</b> <b>method.</b> When the {{electric}} power flows into the device, an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc. Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time. This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces. The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic, however, tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} reasons for using superconducting {{magnetic}} energy storage instead of other energy <b>storage</b> <b>methods.</b> The most important advantage of SMES is that the time delay during charge and discharge is quite short. Power is available almost instantaneously and very high power output can be provided {{for a brief period}} of time. Other energy <b>storage</b> <b>methods,</b> such as pumped hydro or compressed air, have a substantial time delay associated with the energy conversion of stored mechanical energy back into electricity. Thus if demand is immediate, SMES is a viable option. Another advantage is that the loss of power is less than other <b>storage</b> <b>methods</b> because electric currents encounter almost no resistance. Additionally the main parts in a SMES are motionless, which results in high reliability.|$|R

2500|$|Superconducting {{magnetic}} energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a [...] superconducting coil which has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. A typical SMES system includes three parts: superconducting coil, power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is charged, the current will not decay and the {{magnetic energy}} can be stored indefinitely. The stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil. The power conditioning system uses an inverter/rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) power to direct current or convert DC back to AC power. The inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2–3% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses {{the least amount of}} electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip efficiency is greater than 95%. The high cost of superconductors is the primary limitation for commercial use of this energy <b>storage</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cassava {{has gained}} {{increased}} industrial, economic and nutritional importance over the years, {{because of the}} multifarious uses of the starch-rich roots. Several <b>storage</b> <b>methods</b> have been proposed for cassava roots due to the physiological deterioration that sets in 2 - 3 days after harvesting, followed by microbial deterioration 3 - 5 days thereafter. Nigeria is the largest producer of cassava in the world; with 80 % of the production from rural farmers who cannot practice modern <b>storage</b> <b>methods.</b> Furthermore, gari (a major fermented product of cassava root) {{is an important component}} of cassava production in Africa. It is therefore imperative to quantify the effects of traditional <b>storage</b> <b>methods</b> being practiced by the farmers on the yield of gari and the chemical composition of cassava roots. Four traditional <b>storage</b> <b>methods</b> (polyethylene bags, jute bags, trench and plastic storage boxes containing sawdust) were used to store fresh cassava roots for 14 days. The roots were evaluated at 7 day intervals for moisture, ash, crude fibre, carbohydrate, pH, TTA, cyanogenic potentials and yield of gari. The result revealed a varied impact of the <b>storage</b> <b>methods</b> on the chemical composition of the root over the holding period. The moisture, carbohydrate, cyanogenic potentials and yield of gari reduced while the ash and crude fibre increased as the holding period increases. The moisture content reduced significantly from 66. 52 % to 60. 15, 61. 97, 63. 26, and 64. 17 % for samples stored in polyethylene bag, jutebag, trench and storage box respectively. Th...|$|R
2500|$|Research {{is being}} done testing various {{activated}} carbons' ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. [...] The porous material acts like a sponge for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons {{have been able to}} achieve bonding energies of 5–10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work {{or in the case of}} hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel cell. Gas storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas <b>storage</b> <b>method</b> because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on board compression tanks in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in the area of research and development of nano-porous carbon materials. All of the goals are yet to be satisfied but numerous institutions, including the ALL-CRAFT program, are continuing to conduct work in this promising field.|$|E
