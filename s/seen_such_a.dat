5|$|The {{trial was}} held at the Assizes in the small rural market town of Buckingham. More used to the trials of local poachers and sheep thieves, Buckingham had never before <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> spectacle. The town was {{inundated}} with journalists and the merely curious. Byrne was charged with manslaughter. Tom Cribb, Reuben Martin, Thomas Reynolds, and George Cooper were charged with aiding and abetting manslaughter. With such illustrious names as Cribb's, Jackson's and Spring's involved, the trial had the potential to turn into a huge establishment scandal. People of all classes had bet hundreds of pounds on the outcome of the boxing match. Despite being banned, prize fighting enjoyed huge public support and patronage from levels up to the younger male members of the Royal family, some of whom Jackson had taught to box. The support received by Byrne at his trial is testimony to the wealth of his backers. The establishment rallied to his support; Byrne was represented by three barristers and five solicitors, and twelve witnesses journeyed from London to give evidence on his behalf.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after arrival}} at Munich in 1913, where Bruno Walter (from Vienna) had succeeded Mottl, Erb {{appeared}} as Loge in Das Rheingold. He completely rethought the part, dispensing with Briesemeister's flaming and dancing impersonation. Walter realised {{he was a}} thinking artist, and the Press had 'not <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> Loge since Bayreuth'. He sang this role (his 42nd) for 12 years at the Munich Festivals. In a September 1913 double-bill Caruso sang Canio at Munich but left Turiddu to Erb. He now sang Erik, Tannhäuser, Loge, Pinkerton and Cavaradossi. His dramatic skills were admired as Achilles in Gluck's Iphigeneia in Aulis, and he sang Graf Adolar in Weber's Euryanthe. In 1914, when Parsifal was first freely given in Germany, {{he was the first}} Munich Parsifal, bringing spiritual and religious insight.|$|E

The mayor of one of the towns affected by Igor, Sam Synard, remarked that [...] "We've never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> violent storm before." [...] More than 50 families involved in the storm-induced destruction were relocated to evacuation shelters. Electricity was gradually restored to residents; by six days after the hurricane's passage, a few hundred had yet to regain power.|$|E

In May 2014 Benin, Chad, Cameroon and Niger joined Nigeria in a united effort to combat Boko Haram in the {{aftermath}} of the 2014 Chibok kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls. In April 2016, over 500 people in ten villages in predominantly Christian areas in Agatu were murdered by Fulani herdsmen. A visiting Nigerian Senator reported that all the primary and post-primary schools, health centres, worship centres as well as the police station in the area were destroyed. The UNHCR representative said in 20 years of work, she had [...] "never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> level of destruction".|$|E
500|$|Lewis became {{interested}} in making a film about hustlers because (despite there being films about hustlers dating back more than three decades) he had never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> film. In Lewis's own words, [...] "When I started, there were no hustler movies and now there's a whole genre." [...] His original concept for Skin & Bone {{was that it would}} be a series of 70 one-minute shots. Lewis changed his mind about the concept following some improvisation with actor B. Wyatt in creating the Harry character. Much of the film was improvised. After a year of filming improvisation sessions, Lewis wrote some scripted material to provide some story structure. Shooting took several years to complete because the film was almost entirely self-financed.|$|E
500|$|The {{new version}} of the song was {{recorded}} on February 1, 2010, in a session lasting 14 hours. Eighty-five musicians were reportedly involved in the song's recording, which was held in the same place as the original, at Henson Recording Studio on La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles, California. Also similar to the 1985 process, some of the participating musicians were already in Los Angeles to attend an awards ceremony: the 52nd Grammy Awards. Jones said of the recording session, [...] "It was a big challenge. It takes a serious army and serious emotional architecture. I've never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> diverse group of people, and they came for the right reasons." [...] The recording process brought together diverse artists, with the oldest being 83-year-old Tony Bennett and the youngest being 9-year-old Ethan Bortnick.|$|E

500|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, California, Hugh McElhenny {{attended}} its George Washington High School, where he set state high school records in {{the high and low}} hurdles and broad jump, and ran the 100-yard dash in 9.8 seconds. [...] He won both hurdles and the long jump at the 1947 CIF California State Meet. [...] After graduating, he attended Compton Junior College (now El Camino College Compton Center), where he was a standout on Compton's undefeated football team in 1948 that won the Junior Rose Bowl. That year, he had a 105-yard kickoff return touchdown in a game played at the University of Mexico. Already being considered one of the best players in football, McElhenny drew high praise; Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon remarked he had [...] "never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> combination of speed and size."

500|$|Burt's {{defense of}} Kurt from a slur by Finn in [...] "Theatricality" [...] was called [...] "one of the {{heaviest}} scenes Glee has ever delved into" [...] by Eric Goldman of IGN. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called the scene [...] "utterly heartbreaking and lovely". He added, [...] "it {{was an amazing}} moment for Glee, capped off by the simple gesture of Burt grabbing his son's shoulder {{in an act of}} support. Mike O'Malley is completely Emmy-worthy. We've never seen a character like this before on television or <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> relationship between a father and son." [...] Poniewozik wrote, [...] "Mike O'Malley, as always, made me believe that Burt was not speaking out of some false enlightenment but out of a desire to protect his family and a struggle to do the right thing."

500|$|During 1884, the 44-year-old Tchaikovsky {{began to}} shed the unsociability and restlessness that had plagued him since his {{abortive}} marriage in 1878, and which had {{caused him to}} travel incessantly throughout Russia and Western Europe. In March 1884, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which carried with it hereditary nobility, and won Tchaikovsky a personal audience with the Tsar. The Tsar's decoration was a visible seal of official approval, which helped Tchaikovsky's rehabilitation from the stigma associated with the conditions of his marriage. This rehabilitation may have been cemented in the composer's mind {{with the success of}} his Third Orchestral Suite at its January 1885 premiere in St. Petersburg, under Hans von Bülow's direction. Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck: [...] "I have never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> triumph. I saw the whole audience was moved, and grateful to me. These moments are the finest adornments of an artist's life. Thanks to these it is worth living and laboring." [...] The press was likewise unanimously favorable.|$|E

500|$|Painter Maqbool Fida Hussain {{found his}} muse in Madhuri Dixit after {{watching}} the part of Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! where [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana" [...] is performed. He went on to watch the film 67 times. About Dixit's dance in the song Hussain confessed, [...] "That movement of the hips is out of this world. I have never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> dancer, and I have seen the best. Her words are transformed into body language." [...] He painted a series of paintings inspired from Dixit. Madhuri as Menaka with Vishwamitra, Madhuri as Radha with Nand Lala, Madhuri playing tennis at Wimbledon were some of those paintings. The Menaka painting was inspired from the famous painting of apsara Menaka as painted by Raja Ravi Verma. Another painting also showed Dixit with Meryl Streep leaning over a bridge in Madison County and Clint Eastwood on horseback below. The painting Nautanki showed Dixit with a backless blouse turning behind like the step in [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", however this time sporting a nine yards Maharashtrian saree.|$|E
500|$|During Governor Shelby's term, the General Assembly {{had passed}} laws {{requiring}} that the governor, auditor, treasurer, {{and secretary of}} state live in Frankfort and allocating a sum of 100 pounds to rent living quarters for the governor. Shortly after Garrard took office, the state commissioners of public buildings reported to the legislature that it would be more financially sensible to construct a house for the governor and his large family than to rent living quarters for them for the duration of his term. On December 4, 1796, the General Assembly passed legislation appropriating 1,200 pounds for the construction of such a house. The state's first governor's mansion was completed in 1798. Garrard incited considerable public interest when, in 1799, he commissioned a local craftsman to build a piano for one of his daughters; most Kentuckians had never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> grand instrument, and a considerable number of them flocked to the governor's mansion to see it when it was finished. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark also relates that Garrard's addition of carpeting to the mansion [...] a rare amenity at the time [...] drew many visitors and was described by one as [...] "the envy and pride of the community".|$|E
500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer {{to the kinds of}} things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have never <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E

500|$|Horace William Shaler Cleveland {{executed}} {{the plans}} within {{the limitations of}} the financial setbacks from the fire (including the loss of tax rolls) and the 1873 depression. [...] Olmsted's vision for Washington Park was generally realized. However, since spending for the park was diverted after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. [...] The loss of financial backing and difficulty in levying taxes after the fire meant that a water park could not be built on the property. [...] From 1897 until the 1930s the park housed an impressive conservatory and ornate sunken garden designed by D. H. Burnham & Co. at 56th Street and Cottage Grove. [...] The Washington Park Conservatory, like those of other city parks such as Humboldt and Douglas Parks, was torn down in the 1930s due to limited resources {{as a result of the}} Great Depression. [...] This left Lincoln Park and Garfield Park as Chicago's main Conservatories. [...] One of the earliest improvements was the [...] "South Open Green," [...] a pastoral meadow with grazing sheep, also used as a ball field. Architect Daniel H. Burnham's firm designed the 1880 limestone round stables, the 1881 refectory, and the 1910 administrative headquarters for the South Park Commission. [...] Other early attractions to the park included riding stables, cricket grounds, baseball fields, a toboggan slide, archery ranges, a golf course, bicycle paths, row boats, horseshoe pits, greenhouses, a rose garden, a bandstand, a small zoo featuring six alligators, and a lily pond. [...] The lily pond (pictured left) was a particularly enticing attraction because few had <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> site. Today, the administrative building houses DuSable Museum of African American History. [...] The park has retained its environmental appeal with continuing visionary support of the Burnham Plan which supported the maintenance of a park system.|$|E
