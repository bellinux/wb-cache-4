5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient. Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E

50|$|Designed by Philip Sutherland, the {{building}} {{was considered one of}} the most modern libraries of its time, with several innovative features. The building was fireproof, had cork floors and acoustic ceiling tiles to <b>deaden</b> <b>sound,</b> and had a built-in humidifying unit and a centralized vacuum cleaner.|$|R
25|$|The Mk2 also {{received}} numerous updates {{including a new}} revised A/C HVAC system, six airbags standard across the range to enhance safety and improved <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> to all models to give a more refined, quiet ride.|$|E
25|$|The BAe 146 {{is powered}} by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502 {{turbofan}} engines, which are fixed on pylons underneath the aircraft's high wing. The ALF 502 {{was derived from the}} Lycoming T55 turboshaft powerplant that powers the Chinook heavy transport helicopter. Notably, the ALF 502 had a very low level of operational noise, much lower than most other competing aircraft. This was achieved largely {{through the use of a}} geared turbofan engine; the gearbox allows the fan blade tip speed to stay below the speed of sound dramatically reducing the aircraft noise. Additionally other <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> measures include a high bypass ratio compared to contemporary aircraft and additional sound damping layers built into the engine.|$|E

6000|$|... "Your {{ears are}} cheats," [...] {{returned}} the old man, who, {{from the moment}} his own organs {{had been able to}} catch the distant sounds, stood like a statue made to represent deep attention:--"the leaps are too long for the buffaloe, and too regular for terror. Hist! now they are in a bottom where the grass is high, and the <b>sound</b> is <b>deadened!</b> Ay, there they go on the hard earth! And now they come up the swell, dead upon us; they will be here afore you can find a cover!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{acoustic}} performance of suspended ceilings has improved {{dramatically over the}} years, with enhanced sound absorption and attenuation. This is sometimes achieved by adding insulation known as Sound Attenuation Batts (SABs), more {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "sound batts", above the panels to help <b>deaden</b> <b>sounds</b> and keep adjacent rooms quieter.|$|R
60|$|From {{the time}} they began their work, every pains had been taken to <b>deaden</b> <b>sounds.</b> The blanket hung across the passage had acted as a muffler, to some extent; but a piece of cloth had always been tied over the hammer heads of the axes, to prevent the sharp clinking sounds of the blows on the chisels, or stone, being heard.|$|R
500|$|Nevertheless, {{soon after}} Concorde began flying, a Concorde [...] "B" [...] model was {{designed}} with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with {{leading edge slats}} to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds, {{with the objective of}} expanding the range to reach markets in new regions. It featured more powerful engines with <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> and without the fuel-hungry and noisy afterburner. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593. This would have given [...] additional range and a greater payload, making new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|MY10: {{versions}} of the VE were released in September 2009. New 3.0-litre and 3.6-litre V6s have been introduced, featuring Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) and coupled to a new six-speed automatic transmission (see above). These revised powertrains are marketed as part of Holden's EcoLine range. Visually, all SIDI versions are distinguished by relocated and additional EcoLine badging. 3.0-litre versions now utilise twin exhaust outlets. Updated cars also gain a recalibrated suspension setup and an extra ball-joint in the rear suspension (previously introduced on the Sportwagon); the result is increased tautness and improved handling in models fitted with 18 and 19-inch diameter wheels. These cars are also equipped with a larger [...] rear stabiliser bar. Additional engine bay <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> and a new muffler have resulted in reduced noise, vibration, and harshness. Elsewhere, the fitment of lighter low rolling-resistance tyres aids fuel consumption by minimising friction.|$|E
500|$|The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower {{was opened}} in 1909, the {{culmination}} of a long building project by N. LeBrun and Sons to hold Metropolitan Life's growing headquarters staff, 2,800 strong by 1909. At [...] high and with 50 stories, it became the world's new tallest building. Metropolitan Life intended the skyscraper to promote the company's image, and the building was surrounded by publicity. The tower featured on the front of prominent magazines such as Scientific American, {{as well as on the}} sides of corn flake boxes, coffee packets, and cars. The tower was loosely modeled on the Venician St Mark's Campanile, and featured extensive Early Renaissance-style detailing, with the more modern additions of huge clock faces, electric floodlights for night-time illumination, and an observation deck at the top. Contemporary architects Everett Waid and Harvey Corbett described how the building had [...] "the latest ideas in ventilation, air conditioning, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> artificial lighting, intercommunicating pneumatic tubes, telephones, call bells, unit operating clock systems [...] special elevator and escalator installations". The design won critical acclaim within the American architectural profession.|$|E
5000|$|An {{astragal}} {{is commonly}} used to seal between a pair of doors. The astragal closes the clearance gap created by bevels on one or both mating doors, and helps <b>deaden</b> <b>sound.</b> The vertical member (molding) attaches to a stile on one {{of a pair of}} either sliding or swinging doors, against which the other door seals when closed. Exterior astragals are kerfed for weatherstripping.|$|R
60|$|Jocelyn {{followed}} his example {{a few minutes}} later, and Katharine purposely joined him on the way out. She led her companion to the corner where her steamer chair had been placed, and motioned him to sit by her side. They were on the weather side of the ship, with a slight breeze in their faces and a canopy over their heads which <b>deadened</b> <b>sound.</b> She leaned a little forward.|$|R
6000|$|As we have said, peace, liquidity, luminosity, softness, {{and warmth}} prevail everywhere, and the fog, or rather, the silvery haze--for it is dry and warm {{as well as}} bright--has the {{peculiar}} effect of <b>deadening</b> <b>sound,</b> so that the quiet little noises of ship-board rather help than destroy the idea of that profound tranquillity which suggests irresistibly to the religious mind the higher and sweeter idea of [...] "the peace of God." ...|$|R

6000|$|In the {{meantime}} Gustavus, with the Blue and Yellow Swedish Brigades, stormed {{that part of}} the wall defended by Butler with his Irishmen. These fought with extreme bravery, and continued their resistance until almost every man was killed, when the two brigades burst into the town, the White Brigade storming the wall in another quarter. Twice the Imperialist drums beat a parley, but their <b>sound</b> was <b>deadened</b> by the roar of musketry and the boom of cannon from wall and battery, and the uproar and shouting in every street and house. The Green Brigade, under its commander, maintained its regular order, pressing forward with resistless strength. In vain the Austrians shouted for quarter. They were met by shouts of--"Remember New Brandenburg!" ...|$|R
60|$|The trumpet {{with which}} the calling is done is simply a piece of birch bark, rolled up {{cone-shaped}} with the smooth side within. It is fifteen or sixteen inches long, about four inches in diameter at the larger, and one inch at the smaller end. The right hand is folded round the smaller end for a mouthpiece; into this the caller grunts and roars and bellows, {{at the same time}} swinging the trumpet's mouth in sweeping curves to imitate the peculiar quaver of the cow's call. If the bull is near and suspicious, the <b>sound</b> is <b>deadened</b> by holding the mouth of the trumpet close to the ground. This, to me, imitates the real sound more accurately than any other attempt.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} looked around him appraisingly. The two were dining {{at one of}} the newest and most fashionable {{restaurants}} in Berlin. The room itself, although a little sombre by reason of its oak panelling, was relieved from absolute gloom by the lightness and elegance of its furniture and appointments, the profusion of flowers, and the soft grey carpet, so thickly piled that every <b>sound</b> was <b>deadened.</b> The delicate strains of music came from an invisible orchestra concealed behind a canopy of palms. The head-waiters had the correct clerical air, half complacent, half dignified. Among the other diners were many beautiful women in marvellous toilettes. A variety of uniforms, worn by the officers at different tables, gave colour and distinction to a tout ensemble with which even Norgate could find no fault.|$|R
50|$|A stripped-out {{interior}} {{devoid of}} power windows or seats, rear seats, air conditioning, cruise control, <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> or a stereo system (optionally fitted) and new racing-bucket front seats {{were part of}} the package. The trunk hood was made of aluminum, the chassis was seam welded and <b>sound</b> <b>deadening</b> was deleted. Wheels were made of magnesium and the glass was thinner in the doors and rear window. The Carrera RS is approximately 345 pounds (155 kg) lighter than the US version Carrera 2 model. Also available were a heavier Touring variant (with <b>sound</b> <b>deadening,</b> power seats (optional), undercarriage protection and power windows) and an N/GT racing variant with a stripped, blank metal interior and a roll cage. They also came with optional lights on the visors.|$|E

60|$|With {{wonderful}} distinctness Jane Withersteen {{heard her}} own clear voice. She heard the water murmur {{at her feet}} and flow on to the sea; she heard the rushing of all the waters in the world. They filled her ears with low, unreal murmurings--these <b>sounds</b> that <b>deadened</b> her brain and yet could not break the long and terrible silence. Then, from somewhere--from an immeasurable distance--came a slow, guarded, clinking, clanking step. Into her it shot electrifying life. It released the weight upon her numbed eyelids. Lifting her eyes she saw--ashen, shaken, stricken--not the Bishop but the man! And beyond him, from round the corner came that soft, silvery step. A long black boot with a gleaming spur swept into sight--and then Lassiter! Bishop Dyer did not see, did not hear: he stared at Jane {{in the throes of}} sudden revelation.|$|R
60|$|Strangely shaken {{and frightened}} Lane {{lay down in}} the dark. The {{partition}} between his room and Rose's {{might as well have}} been paper for all the <b>sound</b> it <b>deadened.</b> He could have escaped that, but he wanted to be near her.... And he listened to Rose's moans in the darkness. Lane shuddered there, helpless, suffering, realizing. Then the foreboding silence became more dreadful than any sound.... It was terrible for Lane. That strange cold knot in his breast, that coil of panic, seemed to spring and tear, quivering through all his body. What had he known of torture, of sacrifice, of divine selflessness? He understood now how the loved and guarded woman went down into the Valley of the Shadow for the sake of a man. Likewise, he knew the infinite tragedy of a ruined girl who lay in agony, gripped by relentless nature.|$|R
50|$|Shortened joists {{are said}} to be crippled. The term rim joist is rare before the 1940s in America; it forms the edge of a floor. The {{outermost}} joist in half timber construction may be of a more durable species than the interior joists. In a barn, loose poles above the drive floor are called a scaffold. Between the joists, the area called a joist-bay, and above the ceiling in some old houses is material called pugging, which was used to <b>deaden</b> <b>sound,</b> insulate, and resist the spread of fire.|$|R

60|$|In {{another minute}} Harry {{heard the door}} slam, and then he felt himself being carried {{steadily}} along, his weight being as nothing to the smuggler. Not a word was spoken {{between the two men}} on their way down to the shore. Presently Harry felt by the <b>deadened</b> <b>sound</b> of the footsteps, and by the more uneven motion, that he was being carried over the sandy slopes down {{to the edge of the}} sea, and through the canvas he could hear the loud roar of the waves, which were now breaking violently.|$|R
60|$|The {{instant he}} blew her candle out, {{she dropped the}} china candlestick, in a {{paroxysm}} of terror. It fell, and broke, with a <b>deadened</b> <b>sound,</b> {{on one of the}} many portfolios lying on the floor about her. He had hardly time to hear this happen, before the dumb moaning, the inarticulate cry of fear which was all that the poor panic-stricken girl could utter, rose low, shuddering, and ceaseless, in the darkness--so close at his ear, that he fancied he could feel her breath palpitating quick and warm on his cheek.|$|R
60|$|Egoism, nor meanness of mind, is {{not wanting}} on either side. Surely {{not on the}} Girondin side; where in fact the {{instinct}} of self-preservation, too prominently unfolded by circumstances, cuts almost a sorry figure; where also a certain finesse, to the length even of shuffling and shamming, now and then shews itself. They are men skilful in Advocate-fence. They have been called the Jesuits of the Revolution; (Dumouriez, Memoires, iii. 314.) but that is too hard a name. It must be owned likewise that this rude blustering Mountain has a sense in it of what the Revolution means; which these eloquent Girondins are totally void of. Was the Revolution made, and fought for, against the world, these four weary years, that a Formula might be substantiated; that Society might become methodic, demonstrable by logic; and the old Noblesse with their pretensions vanish? Or ought it not withal to bring some glimmering of light and alleviation to the Twenty-five Millions, who sat in darkness, heavy-laden, till they rose with pikes in their hands? At least and lowest, one would think, it should bring them a proportion of bread to live on? There is in the Mountain here and there; in Marat People's-friend; in the incorruptible Seagreen himself, though otherwise so lean and formularly, a heartfelt knowledge of this latter fact;--without which knowledge all other knowledge here is naught, and the choicest forensic eloquence is as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. Most cold, on the other hand, most patronising, unsubstantial is {{the tone of the}} Girondins towards 'our poorer brethren;'--those brethren whom one often hears of under the collective name of 'the masses,' as if they were not persons at all, but mounds of combustible explosive material, for blowing down Bastilles with! In very truth, a Revolutionist of this kind, is he not a Solecism? Disowned by Nature and Art; deserving only to be erased, and disappear! Surely, to our poorer brethren of Paris, all this Girondin patronage <b>sounds</b> <b>deadening</b> and killing: if fine-spoken and incontrovertible in logic, then all the falser, all the hatefuller in fact.|$|R
