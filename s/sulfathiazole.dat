50|$|The {{objective}} for pharmaceutical cocrystals {{is to have}} {{properties that}} differ from that expected of the pure API’s without making and/or breaking covalent bonds.Among the earliest pharmaceutical cocrystals reported are of sulfonamides. The area of pharmaceutical cocrystals has thus increased {{on the basis of}} interactions between API’s and cocrystal formers. Most commonly, API’s have hydrogen-bonding capability at their exterior which makes them more susceptible to polymorphism, {{especially in the case of}} cocrystal solvates which can be known to have different polymorphic forms. Such a case is in the drug <b>sulfathiazole,</b> a common oral and topical antimicrobial,which has over a hundred different solvates. It is thus important in the field of pharmaceuticals to screen for every polymorphic form of a cocrystal before it is considered as a realistic improvement to the existing API. Pharmaceutical cocrystal formation can also be driven by multiple functional groups on the API, which introduces the possibility of binary, ternary, and higher ordered cocrystal forms. Nevertheless, the cocrystal former is used to optimize the properties of the API but can also be used solely in the isolation and/or purification of the API, such as a separating enantiomers from each other, as well and removed preceding the production of the drug.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} the susceptibility of strains of viridans streptococci and enterococci to <b>sulfathiazole,</b> aureomycin, bacitracin, penicillin, and streptomycin; and to determine whether their susceptibility to these agents was related to other biochemical properties. Since previous work had indicated that trained sulfathiazole-resistant viridans streptococci acquired properties similar to those characteristic of enterococci, it followed that strains trained to resistance to penicillin, streptomycin, aureomycin, and bacitracin should also be compared in biochemical properties to naturally-resistant enterococci. Investigation of cross-resistance among these strains seemed of further importance because of its possible clinical applications. A study of the interrelationship between susceptibility and other biochemical properties commonly used for the identification of the organisms might produce several useful results. Mew and better tests for identification might be discovered, possible agents for trial in treatment of the changed organisms might be indicated, and possible changes in organisms subjected to the chemotherapeutic agents might be anticipated. Finally, it was of interest to compare all changes in both the parent and the trained resistant strains for a possible explanation of the increased resistance. Gale had found larger amounts of free glutamic acid in strains of staphylococci naturally resistant to <b>sulfathiazole</b> than in susceptible strains, if the young cells were examined. Less glutamic acid was found in penicillin-resistant cells. He did not examine cells resistant to other antibiotics. Therefore, the glutamic acid content of cells trained to resistance to <b>sulfathiazole,</b> penicillin, streptomycin, and aureomycin was determined in this study. The work was carried out in two parts. First, the biochemical properties and susceptibility to <b>sulfathiazole,</b> aureomycin, bacitracin, penicillin, and streptoaycin was determined for 40 strains of viridans streptococci and enterococci. Thirty-seven strains of the organisms were isolated from pathological material and 3 strains were used as controls, one Streptococcus fecalis (A. T. C.
