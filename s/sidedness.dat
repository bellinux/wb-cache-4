40|$|International audienceColour <b>sidedness</b> is a dominantly {{inherited}} phenotype {{of cattle}} {{characterized by the}} polarization of pigmented sectors on the flanks, snout and ear tips. It is {{also referred to as}} 'lineback' or 'witrik' (which means white back), as colour-sided animals typically display a white band along their spine. Colour <b>sidedness</b> is documented at least since the Middle Ages and is presently segregating in several cattle breeds around the globe, including in Belgian blue and brown Swiss. Here we report that colour <b>sidedness</b> is determined by a first allele on chromosome 29 (Cs(29)), which results from the translocation of a 492 -kilobase chromosome 6 segment encompassing KIT to chromosome 29, and a second allele on chromosome 6 (Cs(6)), derived from the first by repatriation of fused 575 -kilobase chromosome 6 and 29 sequences to the KIT locus. We provide evidence that both translocation events involved circular intermediates. This is the first example, to our knowledge, of a phenotype determined by homologous yet non-syntenic alleles that result from a novel copy-number-variant-generating mechanis...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{the concept of}} market <b>sidedness</b> with excess option demand (changes in open interest) to solve the empirical challenge of separating directional from uninformed trading motives in widely available, unsigned options data. Our measure of options market <b>sidedness</b> persistently predicts the sign and strength of stock returns. Trading strategies conditional on the measure are highly profitable. For instance, when the measure indicates positive (negative) information, out-of-the-money calls (puts) generate returns of 27 % (32 %) over roughly four weeks. Risk-adjusted returns of a long-short equity strategy yield more than 2 %. An increase in directionally informed demand predicts a decrease in option liquidity and increases in pricing inefficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{public health}} {{significance}} {{of this study is}} to provide researchers and clinicians interested in the study and treatment of Otitis Media with effusion (OME) with a better understanding of the associations between covariates and antibiotic treatment with the resolution of OME, which in turn will inform the decision-to-treat process. In a secondary analysis of the data from a series of three efficacy trials, we focus on the roles of laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral disease) and <b>sidedness</b> (right vs. left ear) as prognostic factors. The D&A trial compared the efficacy of decongestant and antihistamine (D/A) to placebo, the ABI trial was similar but compared amoxicillin (with and without to D/A) to placebo, and the ABII trial compared the efficacy of 2 promising antibiotics to amoxicillin. Each trial assessed subjects for OME at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. The prevalence of OME at each time point was described by laterality and <b>sidedness.</b> McNemar's test showed no evidence that left and right ears differ with respect to prevalence rates at 2 or 4 weeks (OR = 1. 106 and OR = 0. 858, respectively). Transition matrices of changes in OME status from 0 to 2 weeks and 2 to 4 weeks described the dependence of prior effusion status on a subject's current OME status. Multinomial regression was used to assess baseline covariates associated with prevalence and transitions of effusion status at each time point. We identified statistically significant prognostic factors of OME, including duration of effusion. Our analyses showed no differences in either prevalence of OME or in transitions of effusion status attributable to <b>sidedness.</b> A Chi Square Goodness-of-Fit test at each timepoint rejected the hypothesis of independence, p < 0. 001. An ear-level GEE analysis demonstrated that effusion status of a contralateral ear was a significant predictor of effusion in the other ear (OR = 1. 44, p < 0. 001). There was no significant effect of <b>sidedness</b> (p = 0. 86) and bilateral disease does not resolve at the rate predicted by unilateral resolution. This reanalysis using correlated data methods augments the initial findings by further examining <b>sidedness</b> and documenting transitions over time...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with analyzing the <b>sidedness</b> of action of various determinants which alter the rate of ouabain binding to human red blood cell ghosts. Thus, ouabain binding promoted by orthophosphate (Pi) and its inhibition by Na are shown {{to be due to}} inside Pi and inside Na. External K inhibits Pi-promoted ouabain binding and Nao acts to decrease the effectiveness of Ko. Similarly, inside uridine triphosphate (UTPi) stimulates the rate of ouabain binding which can be antagonized by either Nai or Ko acting alone. The actions of Nai and Ko are different when ouabain binding is promoted by Pi and UTPi compared to inside adenosine triphosphate (ATPi). With ATPi, the ouabain binding rate is only affected when Nai and Ko are both present. Possible differences in the mechanism of action of K and Na on Pi-and UTP- promoted binding are discussed in the light of their <b>sidedness</b> of action...|$|E
