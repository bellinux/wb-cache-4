The approach admits both parametric and nonparametric forms through the use of normalized kernels to represent each latent layer. The outcome is a fully convex formulation that is able to capture compositions of trainable nonlinear layers to arbitrary depth. ...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a structured support vector regression framework by extending the max-margin principle to incorporate spatial correlations among neighboring pixels. The objective function in our framework considers both label information and pairwise features, helping to achieve better cross-smoothing over neighboring nodes. With the bundle method, we effectively reduce the number of constraints and alleviate the adverse effect of outliers, leading to an efficient and robust learning algorithm. Moreover, we conduct a thorough analysis for the loss function used in structured regression, and provide a principled approach for defining proper loss functions and deriving the corresponding solvers to find the most violated constraint. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art regression approaches on various testbeds of synthetic images and real-world scenes...|$|R
40|$|Embeddings of {{languages}} {{into one another}} are useful in studying their relative power and, sometimes, finding languages that are universal in some sense. Examples include Turing-reducibility for studying computability, poly-time reductions for subrecursive languages [14], and structure-preserving embeddings for expressiveness [4, 5, 13, 12]. To further a search for languages suitable for “domain-specific embedded languages ” and “active libraries, ” [7, 3] we propose stage-preserving embeddings {{as a tool to}} study languages in which some evaluation or simplification is guaranteed to take place at compile-time. Such guarantees can be wielded to realize domain-specific optimizations. We prove sufficient conditions for a language to be “stage-universal, ” in the sense that there is a stage-preserving embedding of any staged language into it. Assume a class {{of languages}} that are all being compiled to the same implementation language LM — the subscript M here <b>standing</b> for <b>machine.</b> A compiler for some source language LA is a partial map φA: LA ⇀ LM; partial because for many interesting staged languages (e. g., C++, MetaML [15]) the compiler may not terminate.

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{the use of}} meta-languages {{to provide}} an {{effective}} representation scheme for Machine Learning. This proposal is supported by both:- {{a demonstration of the}} benefits that meta-languages can bring to Inductive Logic Programming, and- the successful and widespread use of meta-languages in other search intensive areas of Artificial Intelligence, such as planning. 1 Introduction A typical Machine Learning setting involves a teacher selecting a target concept from a concept space, and providing a learner with a labelled training sample of examples of this concept. Each example is drawn from an example space, and is labelled positive if it {{is an example of the}} target concept, or negative otherwise. In response, the learner searches a hypothesis space 1 to find a hypothesis of the target concept. This selection is influenced by bias which both restricts the size of the hypothesis space, and allows a learner to judge between competing hypotheses. To build such a learning system we must choose the most suitable language to represent the concept, example and hypothesis spaces. Many different choices have been suggested, sparking a long <b>standing</b> debate within <b>Machine</b> Learning...|$|R
