40|$|Three {{species of}} vestimentiferans are found at {{hydrothermal}} vents on the East Pacific Rise (EPR). Tevnia jerichonana is an earlycolonist and Riftia pachyptila {{has the greatest}} biomass in established vent assemblages, but the role of Oasisia alvinae, a small species that occurs sporadically, is unknown. Anecdotal evidence suggests that O. alvinae maybe abundant in the microhabitat underneath mussels. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} early T. jerichonana colonists mayfacilitate settlement of the late colonist R. pachyptila. To address potential mechanisms for the successional sequence and to explore the role of O. alvinae, we examined the effects of the presence of vestimentiferan (R. pachyptila and T. jerichonana) tubes and mussel (Bathymodiolus thermophilis) <b>shell</b> <b>cover</b> on recruitment of vestimentiferans on basalt blocks deployed at 9 50 0 N, 104 17 0 W on the EPR. A molecular assaywas used to identifyindividuals to species since theywere too small to be identified morphologically. Although colonists in both experiments belonged to all three species of vestimentiferans, onlya few were T. jerichonana. Colonization of vestimentiferans did not increase in the presence of vestimentiferan tubes. The presence of mussel <b>shell</b> <b>cover</b> did not influence the proportions of R. pachyptila and O. alvinae, or the total number of colonists. Because the experimental blocks in this studywere placed within dense clumps of R. pachyptila, we suggest that, while T. jerichonana maybe an important cue for vestimentiferans settling at new vents, adult R. pachyptila also can act as a settlement cue for larvae.

40|$|The {{eastern oyster}} (Crassostrea virginica) in New Hampshire’s Great Bay Estuary has {{declined}} in the past decades, with local populations reduced due primarily to disease, excessive siltation, and past over-harvest. The loss of filtering oysters results in diminished ecological benefits for water quality, nitrogen control, and other services that healthy oyster populations provide. In support of management objectives to restore oyster populations, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the University of New Hampshire (UNH) have combined for a fourth consecutive year of scaled-up methods to rebuild reefs and oyster populations. Since 2009, we have “planted” dried shell, primarily surf-clam and oyster mix, on channel bottom as a hard substrate foundation to recruit spawn from nearby native populations. Constructed areas are amended with laboratory raised and volunteer-grown “spat-on-shell” from remotely set larvae to supplement recruitment. In 2012, despite limited funding, we successfully constructed and seeded two new acres of reef adjacent to native oysters {{in the mouth of}} Squamscott River, Newmarket. Results were somewhat below target for <b>shell</b> <b>cover</b> and live oyster density but natural recruitment was strong and encouraging for future reef development. Overall, we restored {{about a quarter of a}} million new oysters to the estuary.

The inhibition of 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total volatiles and hexanal by defatted almond at 2 % (w/w) during a 7 - day storage period ranged from 8 - 88, 38 - 90 and 57 - 90 %, respectively. Since defatted almond products exhibited antioxidant properties, their crude extracts in ethanol were prepared at 70 °C for 30 min. The total phenolic contents of ethanolic extracts of brown skin and green shell extracts were 10 - and 9 -times {{higher than that}} of the whole seed. Antioxidant activities of whole seed extract (WSE), brown skin extract (BSE) and green shell extract (GSE) of almond were evaluated using Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay, β-carotene-linoleate model and bulk stripped corn oil systems. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA scission and human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation by WSE, BSE and GSE was monitored. Different free radical trapping assays were used to investigate the free radical-scavenging activity of the extracts. TEAC assay revealed that the antioxidant capacities of BSE and GSE were 13 - and 10 - times greater than that of seed extracts at the same extract concentration. These extracts were then tested at 100 and 200 ppm phenolics as quercetin equivalents. Retention of β-carotene in a β-carotene-linoleate model system by WSE, BSE and GSE was 84 - 96, 74 - 83 and 71 - 93 % respectively, as compared to 2 % retention in the control. In a bulk stripped corn oil system, GSE performed better than BSE and WSE in inhibiting the formation of both primary and secondary oxidation products. In a cooked comminuted pork model system GSE and BSE inhibited formation of TBARS, total volatiles and hexanal more effectively than WSE. The scavenging activity of the superoxide radical by almond seed, skin and <b>shell</b> <b>cover</b> extracts at 100 and 200 ppm was 76, 89 and 97 % (100 ppm), and 85, 95 and 99 % (200 ppm), respectively. The corresponding reduction of hydrogen peroxide concentration was 59, 63 and 66 % (100 ppm), and 86, 91 and 91 % (200 ppm), respectively. The hydroxyl radical-scavenging capacities at 100 and 200 ppm were 16 and 42 % for WSE, 57 and 100 % for BSE and 40 and 56 % for GSE, respectively. A 100 % scavenging activity of the DPPH radical was achieved by both BSE and GSE at 100 and 200 ppm levels. WSE scavenged 21 and 73 % of the DPPH radical at 100 and 200 ppm, respectively. A total DNA retention was given by GSE at 50 ppm level against peroxyl-induced strand scission, whereas BSE and WSE reached the same at 100 ppm. On the other hand, for hydroxyl radical induced DNA strand scission, a total protection was exerted by all three almond extracts at 50 ppm level against both non-site specific and site-specific strand scission. BSE performed effectively in preventing copper-induced oxidation of human LDL cholesterol compared to WSE and GSE. All three almond extracts exhibited excellent metal chelating efficacies.

40|$|Oyster {{mortality}} and subsequent degradation of shell matrices may influence associated epibiota by modifying processes of filtration and biodeposition and by changing habitat structure. In the Hawkesbury River, NSW, Australia, QX disease devastated aquaculture {{populations of the}} native Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, and threatened wild populations. To ascertain effects of this oyster mortality on associated epibiota, we compared epifaunal communities occupying 100 % oyster <b>shell</b> <b>cover</b> among 5 sites along the estuary, ranging from 25 ppt salinity and live oyster density of 96 ± 13 m− 2, to 32 ppt salinity and live oyster density of 3187 ± 233 m− 2. Epifaunal richness was greatest closest to the estuarine mouth, where live oyster abundance was greatest. Epifaunal abundance, by contrast, generally increased with distance upstream, as oyster matrices were increasingly dominated by the shells of dead oysters. To ascertain the role of live and dead oysters as habitat providers, we carried out a manipulative experiment {{to test the hypothesis}} that the epifaunal assemblages that settle over a 4 month period will significantly differ among constructed matrices comprised of live, whole dead and/or degraded (single valve) oysters. Treatments containing a component of single valves, which increase the availability of interstitial spaces and provide greater surface area for attachment, supported the greatest numbers of epibiota. Matrices comprised solely of live oysters supported fewest species and numbers of organisms. Results demonstrate that death and degradation of oysters alter the structure of associated communities, even where 100 % cover of shell matrix is maintained. These results have important ramifications for management strategies and retaining estuarine biodiversity in the event that disease such as QX causes local oyster extinctions...|$|E

40|$|Cold-season filling using much coarser sediments {{than the}} native caused {{dramatic}} suppression of beach macroinvertebrates, demonstrably degrading habitat value for foraging shorebirds. As a dual consequence of persistent steepening of the foreshore, which translated to reduction in habitat area by 14 - 29 %, and disturbance-induced depression of invertebrate densities on filled beaches, abundances of Donax spp. and haustoriid amphipods averaged less than 10 % of control levels. Donax spp. is the biomass dominant {{and a key}} prey for higher trophic levels. Haustoriids lack pelagic larvae. Recovery on filled beaches was not initiated by either taxon during the March-November sampling. Emerita talpoida, {{an order of magnitude}} less abundant than Donax spp. on control beaches, exhibited a pattern of initial depression on filled beaches but recovered by mid summer. Polychaetes, mostly the small Scolelepis squamata, experienced a warm-season bloom of equal magnitude on filled and control beaches. Summertime recruitment of predatory ghost crabs appeared inhibited on filled beaches, perhaps by persistent shell hash. Intertidal <b>shell</b> <b>cover</b> on filled beaches averaged 25 - 50 % in mid summer as compared to 6 - 8 % on control beaches. Largely in response to prey depression, but perhaps also to surface shell armoring and/or coarsening of sediments, shorebird (mostly sanderling) use plummeted by 70 - 90 % on filled beaches until November. Thus, despite likely adaptations to natural sediment dynamics, the high intensity of sediment deposition, cumulative spatial scope (10. 8 km), and unnaturally coarse shelly character of the Bogue Banks beach nourishment resulted in a perturbation that exceeded biotic resistance and degraded the trophic transfer function of this highly productive habitat for at least one warm season. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In this work, 8 {{different}} solvents/mixtures {{have been}} tested for the extraction of antioxidants from by-products derived from the industrial processing of almonds (skin or seed coating, brown hull, and green <b>shell</b> <b>cover</b> or mesocarp). The oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC) {{as well as the}} phenolics content of the extracts has been determined. The extracting solution methanol/HCl (1000 : 1, v/v) was the most effective for the almond skin and shell, whereas, for the hull, it corresponded to acetone/water (50 : 50, v/v), resulting in ORAC Fluorescein values of 0. 467, 1. 45 and 0. 0504 mmol of Trolox/mg, respectively. At the same time, the mixtures acetone/water exhibited the highest content of total polyphenols and proanthocyanidins for the three by-products studied. Finally, results have shown that the by-products derived from almond processing, in particular, the skin and shell, posses a similar antioxidant capacity to that of grape by-products which are currently used in the development (or production) of antioxidant products.

40|$|The {{roles of}} the sexes in the New Zealand Fairy Term (Sterna nereis davisae) during {{reproduction}} were investigated over the 1997 / 1999 seasons at Mangawhai and Waipu, Northland, North Island New Zealand. Factors which may affect the behaviour of the birds were investigated including time of season, time of day, weather conditions {{and the state of}} the tide. As in other terns, the contributions of the male and the female Fairy Tern to reproduction were relatively equal. Courtship feeding, however, appears to be a male-specific behaviour, and the male feeds the chick more than the female when there is a single chick. The level of care of eggs and chicks at night by the female, and of the fledged young by the male, is unclear, but could alter the overall contribution to breeding by the two sexes. In the first season, wind speed caused less absence from young, while time of day and time of season (week) affected incubation, and parental activities. Egg manipulation for management purposes at Mangawhai altered the birds' behaviour, the female being less attentive during the day and it increased the amount of time birds sat on the nest. The state of the tide affected the feeding of young, with increased feeding three hours after low tide. This may be site-dependent because the Mangawhai Fairy Terns also foraged at high tides. Fairy Terns were highly aggressive towards Harriers, Black-backed Gulls and people, particularly when they had young. Fairy Terns also responded aggressively within 75 m, the birds at Waipu responding more often because a number of other birds nested in, and passed over, the area. The Fairy Terns preferred highly elevated nest sites, with low vegetation cover, and a high percentage of <b>shell</b> <b>cover.</b> These features characterise nest sites of a number of terns. DNA analysis suggests that copulation behaviour, but not morphology, is adequate evidence for sexing adult Fairy Terns. The sex ration of nine juveniles was five males: four females. The number of adults caught was too small to calculate an adult sex ratio. This study has implications for future management of Fairy Terns. Eggs at the same development stage should be placed under foster parents, fences should be placed 180 m from the nest or chicks, and sparsely vegetated and shell covered areas should be protected and maintainted. Weather conditions, the time of day, and observed absences should be considered before removing eggs from the field. More blood samples are needed for parental and taxonomic studies...|$|E

40|$|Molten salts (MS) in the 580 °C range {{could be}} used to store excess energy from solar power {{stations}} and possibly from nuclear or coal. The energy can be stored up to a week in large containers at elevated temperature to generate eight hours of electricity to be used at night or during peak demand hours. This helps to reduce the fluctuation experienced at thermal solar power stations due to weather conditions. Our research supported by Office of Naval Research (ONR), presents a survey of salts to be used in molten salt technology and the design of large steel and hybrid molten salt storage shells. The physical characteristics of these salts such as density, melting temperature, viscosity, electric conductivity, surface tension, thermal capacity and cost are discussed. Cost is extremely important given the large volumes of salt required for energy storage at a commercial power station. Formulas are presented showing the amount of salt needed per required megawatts of stored energy {{depending on the type of}} salt. The estimated cost and the size of tanks required and the operating temperatures are presented. Recommendations are made regarding the most efficient type of molten salt to use. Commercial thermal solar power stations have been constructed in the US and overseas mainly in Spain for which molten salt is being considered. A field of flat mirrors together with collection towers are presently used in some designs and parabolic troughs used in others to produce electricity commercially. Two designs of tanks for the storage of excess energy from thermal solar power plants using molten salts (MS) at 580 °C is presented. Energy can be stored up to a week in large containers to generate eight hours of electricity for use at night or to reduce weather related fluctuation at solar thermal energy plants. The research presented in this thesis shows detailed designs of cylindrical shells for the storage of high temperature molten salts. One storage shell consists of an inner stainless steel layer designed to resist corrosion and an external steel structural layer to contain the large pressures resulting from the molten salt with a steel bottom. The other storage shell consists of an inner stainless steel layer and an external reinforced concrete structural layer with a steel bottom. Both cylindrical tanks are 54 feet high and has an 80 foot diameter, with the salt level at a height of 42 feet. Given the heat of the molten salt and the size of the tank, designs include a flat <b>shell</b> <b>cover</b> supported on stainless steel columns and a semispherical utility access dome at the center. Considerations are made for the reduction of strength of steel at elevated temperatures. Layers of external insulation materials are used to reduce heat loss in the storage shells. Designs also present a 120 foot diameter posttensioned concrete foundation with 20 feet high steel side walls for the storage tank for the containment of molten salts in case of an accident.
