This study investigated the daily dietary Se intake of residents in Shadi, a town located 72 km northeast of Enshi City, to assess the risk of human <b>selenosis</b> in the high Se area. Foods consumed typically by the local residents and their hair samples were analyzed for total Se concentration. Concentrations of Se in different diet categories were as follows: cereals: 0. 96 ± 0. 90 mg kg− 1 DW in rice and 0. 43 ± 0. 55 mg kg− 1 DW in corn; tuber: 0. 28 ± 0. 56 mg kg− 1 in potato and 0. 36 ± 0. 12 mg kg− 1 in sweet potato; vegetables: ranging from 0. 23 ± 1. 00 mg kg− 1 in carrot to 1. 57 ± 1. 06 mg kg− 1 in kidney bean; animal proteins: 1. 99 ± 1. 11 mg kg− 1 in chicken and egg. Based on the food Se concentrations and the daily per-capita consumption, the estimated daily Se intake in Shadi was 550 ± 307 µg per capita.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe Brazilian Amazon {{region has}} {{selenium}} (Se) -rich soil, which {{is associated with}} higher Se levels in populations fed locally grown produce. Brazil nuts are {{a major source of}} dietary Se and are included with meals offered to children enrolled in public preschool in Macapá. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine Se intake and status of these children. MethodsThe Macapá group consisted of 41 children from a public preschool who received 15 to 30  g of Brazil nuts 3  d/wk. The control group included 88 children from the nearby city of Belém who did not receive Brazil nut–enriched meals. In both groups, school meals comprised ≥ 90 % of the children's total food consumption. Selenium was assessed using hydride generation quartz tube atomic absorption spectroscopy in plasma, erythrocytes, nails, hair and urine. Dietary intakes (macronutrients and Se) were evaluated using the duplicate-portion method. ResultsBoth groups received inadequate intakes of energy and macronutrients. Selenium intake was excessive in both groups (155. 30 and 44. 40  μg/d, in Macapá and Belém, respectively). Intake was potentially toxic in Macapá on days when Brazil nuts were added to meals. Although biomarkers of Se exposure exceeded reference levels in the Macapá group, no clinical symptoms of Se overload (<b>selenosis)</b> were observed. ConclusionsThe inclusion of Brazil nuts in school meals provided to children with already high dietary Se intakes increased Se levels and may result in an increased risk for toxicity.

40|$|A {{number of}} papers have been {{published}} concerning the effect of chronic selenium poisoning on growth, food consumption, reproduction, and pathology of several species of laboratory animals (1, 2, 3). Little is known about the-effects of chronic <b>selenosis</b> on the blood constituents (except hemoglobin), par-tially because of the limited quantity of blood which can be taken from small laboratory animals such as the rat, rabbit, and cat. Therefore it seemed ad-visable to {{study the effects of}} chronic selenium poisoning on the blood picture of larger animals. Dogs were selected for this purpose as convenient sources of blood samples sufficiently large to be analyzed for most of the commonly de-termined constituents. Dogs are also large enough to furnish, at autopsy, samples of various organs and tissues large enough to be analyzed for selenium. The second part of this study was undertaken to determine the effect of ar-senic when fed to dogs receiving a ration which contained selenium. It had been found that arsenic would prevent or counteract the effects of selenium in rats (4, 5, 6).

40|$|Selenium (Se) is an {{essential}} element and a well-known anti-oxidant. In the Lower Tapajos River region of the Brazilian Amazon, biomarkers of Se range from normal to very high. The local traditional diet includes important Se sources such as Brazil nuts, chicken, game meat and certain fish species. Some studies have reported alterations in keratin structure, gastrointestinal problems and paresthesia in populations with high Se intake. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate cutaneous and garlic odor of the breath signs and sentinel symptoms of Se toxicity (<b>selenosis)</b> in relation to Se status in communities along the Tapajos River. Participants (N = 448), aged 15 - 87 years, were recruited from 12 communities. Se concentrations were measured in blood (B-Se) and plasma (P-Se) by ICP-MS. A nurse performed an examination of the hair, nails, skin and breath for signs of Se toxicity. Interview-administered questionnaires were used to collect information on socio-demographics, medical history and possible symptoms of Se toxicity. In this population, the median levels of B-Se and P-Se were 228. 4 mu g/L (range 103. 3 - 1500. 2 mu g/L) and 134. 8 mu g/L (range 53. 6 - 913. 2 mu g/L) respectively. Although B-Se and P-Se surpassed concentrations considered toxic (B-Se: 1000 mu g/L (U. S. EPA, 2002)), no dermal or breath signs or symptoms of Se toxicity were associated with the biomarkers of Se status. In the present study population, where Se intake is mostly from traditional diet, there is no evidence of <b>selenosis.</b> These findings support the need to re-assess Se toxicity considering factors such as the chemical form of Se exposure, route of exposure (inhaled versus ingested), co-exposures to toxic elements such as mercury.

40|$|Selenium is an {{essential}} micronutrient that functions as an antioxidant. Yet, at higher concentrations, selenium is pro-oxidant and toxic. In extreme cases, exposures to excess selenium can lead to death or <b>selenosis,</b> a syndrome characterized by teeth, hair and nail loss, and nervous system alterations. Recent interest in selenium as an anti- tumorigenic agent has reemphasized the {{need to understand the}} mechanisms underlying the cellular consequences of increased selenium exposure. We show here, that in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, selenium has a concentration range in which it functions as an antioxidant, but beyond this range it exhibits a dose- and time-dependent lethality. Oxidation-induced fluorescence emitted by the dye, carboxy-H 2 DCFDA, indicative of reactive oxygen species formation was significantly higher in animals after a brief exposure to 5 mM sodium selenite. Longer-term exposures lead to a progressive selenium-induced motility impairment that could be partially prevented by coincident exposure to the cellular antioxidant–reduced glutathione. The C elegans glrx- 21 gene belongs to the family of glutaredoxins (glutathione-dependent oxidoreductases) and the glrx- 21 (tm 2921) allele is a null mutation that renders animals hypersensitive for the selenium-induced motility impairment, but not lethality. In addition, the lethality of animals with the tm 2921 mutation exposed to selenium was unaffected by the addition of reduced glutathione, suggesting that GLRX- 21 is required for glutathione to moderate this selenium-induced lethality. Our findings provide the first description of selenium-induced toxicity in C elegans and support its use as a model for elucidating the mechanisms of selenium toxicity...|$|E

Nevertheless, selenium toxicity (<b>selenosis)</b> causes problems for humans such as abnormalities of the nervous system, gastrointestinal problems and hair loss. Thus, this study was performed {{with the aim of}} bacterial biosorbent isolation in order to remove selenium contaminant from wastewater. Materials and methods: In this research, at first using modified Luria- Bertani agar (mLBA) medium with certain concentration of sodium selenate salt, isolation of bacterial isolates was done from three collected wastewater and sludge samples from Khouzestan industrial factories. After determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), the sorption capacity and the percentage of metal removal efficiency (%RE) were investigated by atomic absorption spectrophotometer using metabolically active and inactive samples belonging to an efficient isolate. Identification was performed by morphological, biochemical and molecular methods. Results: Among 73 attained bacterial isolates at the first stage, 8 selenate oxyanion resistant isolates were gathered. Among these, AMS 1 -S 8 isolate with MIC= 600 ­mM and MBC= 1200 ­mM were selected for more studies. Attained results in sorption mechanism determination stage showed that the sorption capacity in metabolically active sample is more than the inactive samples. Based on the identification results, it is revealed that this isolate belongs to the Enterobacter genus. This isolate is deposited as accession JQ 965667 in the GeneBank database. Discussion and conclusion: The results showed that active biomass of selected isolate, have most sorption capacity and %RE and among the other isolates, have high partial resistance against selenate. Therefore, it can be a relatively ideal option for the bioremediation of polluted environments...|$|E
40|$|Selenium (Se) is an {{essential}} trace element for humans. About 70 % of the regions in China, including most of the Tibetan Plateau, are faced with Se deficiency problems. Turnip is mainly distributed around the Tibetan Plateau {{and is one of}} the few local crops. In the present study, we compared the absorption and translocation differences of Se (IV) selenite and Se (VI) selenate in turnip. The results showed that Se treatment, either by soil addition (0. 2 – 2 mg Se kg− 1 dry soil) or by foliar spraying (50 – 200 mg L− 1 Se), could significantly increase the Se concentrations in turnips, and 0. 5 mg Se (IV) or Se (VI) kg− 1 dry matter in soils could improve the biomasses of turnips. Moreover, turnip absorbed significantly more Se (VI) than Se (IV) at the same concentration and also transferred much more Se (VI) from roots to leaves. Based on the Se concentrations, as well as the bioconcentration factors and translocation coefficients, we considered that turnip might be a potential Se indicator plant. Subsequently, we estimated the daily Se intake for adults based on the Se concentrations in turnip roots. The results indicated that Se (IV) should be more suitable as an artificial Se fertilizer for turnips, although the levels found in most samples in this study could cause <b>selenosis</b> to humans. In addition, we also estimated the optimum and maximum Se concentrations for treating turnips based on the linear relations between Se concentrations in turnip roots and Se treatment concentrations. The results provided preliminary and useful information about Se biofortification in turnips...|$|E
40|$|In {{southern}} Africa, coal is {{a relatively}} abundant and cheap fossil fuel which is {{a major source of}} energy and a huge income generator. Although coal has found a lot of use, it is an anthropogenic source of trace element emissions and although these trace elements (TEs) may occur in parts per million, mass consumption of coal during utilisation results in the release of large quantities of potentially harmful TEs to the environment. With reported diseases like arsenism, minamata disease and <b>selenosis</b> (Zheng et al., 1999) from coal combustion emissions, it is important to regulate TE emissions. Due to global perception, the following TEs were chosen for consideration: As, B, Be, Co, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se and V (which were analysed by ICP-MS) and Hg (which was analysed using an automatic Hydride Generation-Flow Injection Mercury System). There is limited data on TEs in African coals and whilst no TE control legislation exists, Pb in petrol is currently being regulated in South Africa. Important factors such as the mode of occurrence of TEs and their associations with other minerals in coal influence, or affect, the fate of TEs release during coal utilisation. Three run-of-mine (ROM) belt cut coal samples were supplied by Hwange Colliery and two South African samples were used for comparison. The coal samples were subjected to density fractionation and sequential leaching. Mineral matter was determined using XRD and coal petrography was used to consider the organic components. Comparisons of the ROM coals with average global and mean South African values were carried out. Generally, TEs like Cd, Sb and Se in ROM samples of both coalfields appear consistent with published SA data and global average values, whilst values of Hg and Mn in all the coal samples are above the global and SA average values. Density fractionation data show most TEs are concentrated in higher density fractions, hence showing an association with minerals over organic matter. Most TEs in Zimbabwean coals seem to show a strong correlation with mineral matter which should be able to be removed prior to coal utilisation during efficient beneficiation practises...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review article is to {{demonstrate}} the close parallelism of daily requirements, biological activity and minimum and maximum tolerable levels of selenium for animals and man. In addition, the carcinogenic/anticarcinogenic properties of selenium are discussed and a postulate of how these dichotomous effects may occur in accordance with selenium-induced immunomodulation is presented. A review of pertinent literature pertaining to the biological action of selenium in animals and man, including deficiency, toxicity, carcinogenicity and effects on immunity, is included to support these concepts. The predominant biochemical action of selenium in both animals and man is {{to serve as an}} antioxidant via the selenium-dependent enzyme, glutathione peroxidase, and thus protect cellular membranes and organelles from peroxidative damage. The signs and symptoms of selenium deficiency closely simulate each other for animals and man. Severe deficiency is characterized by cardiomyopathy while moderate deficiency results in less severe, myodegenerative syndromes such as muscular weakness and pain as well as a variety of other selenium-associated diseases. Clinical manifestations of many of these disorders require contributory factors, such as stress, to precipitate symptoms which are documented for animals and implicated for humans. Current evidence suggests that a daily selenium consumption for man of approximately 30 micrograms is necessary to prevent the selenium-deficient syndrome, Keshan disease, while approximately 90 micrograms/day/adult should be the minimum daily requirement for optimum biological performance. Recognizing that humans in several countries do not meet the proposed minimum daily requirement of 90 micrograms, several compelling reasons are presented in deriving this minimal daily nutritional intake. <b>Selenosis</b> can occur in laboratory animals, livestock, and humans following long-term exposure to selenium concentrations as low as 5 mg selenium/kg of diet (5 ppm). The selenium-induced lesions for all species are similar, which once again illustrates a positive corollary for selenium effects in both animals and man. From compilation of available data, the maximum tolerable level for selenium in man could be considered in the range of 1000 to 1500 micrograms/day. This is in contrast to the currently recommended maximum human tolerable level of 500 micrograms/day. The amount of selenium that can be tolerated, however, is dependent upon individual biological variation, nutritional status and general state of health. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Many {{elements}} {{which are}} essential to human and other animal health in small doses can be toxic if ingested in excess. Selenium (Se), a naturally occurring metalloid element is found in all natural materials on earth including rocks, soils, waters, air, plant and animal tissues. Since the early 1930 ’s, it has been recognised that Se toxicity causes hoof disorders and hair loss in livestock. Se was also identified as an essential trace element to humans and other animals in the late 1950 ’s. It forms a vital constituent of the biologically important enzyme glutathione peroxidase which acts as an anti-oxidant preventing cell degeneration. Se deficiency has been implicated in the aetiology of several diseases including cancer, muscular dystrophy, muscular sclerosis and cystic fibrosis. Se can be assimilated in humans through several pathways including food, drinking water and inhalation of Se-bearing particles from the atmosphere. In the majority of situations, food {{is the most important}} source of Se, as levels in water are very low. The narrow range between deficiency levels ( 900 pg per day) makes it necessary to carefully control the amount of Se in the diet. In China, Se deficiency has been linked to an endemic degenerative heart disease known as Keshan Disease (KD) and an endemic osteoarthropathy which causes deformity of affected joints, known as Kaschin-Beck Disease. These diseases occur in a geographic belt stretching from Heilongjiang Province in north-east China to Yunnan Province in the south-west. In the period between 1959 and 1970, peak KD incidence rates exceeded 40 per 100 000 (approximately 8500 cases per annum) with 1400 - 3000 deaths recorded each year. Incidence rates have since fallen to less than 5 per 100 000 with approximately 1000 new cases reported annually (Levander, 1986). Se toxicity (<b>selenosis)</b> resulting in hair and nail loss and disorders of the nervous system in the human population, has also been recorded in Enshi District, Hubei Province and in Ziyang County, Shanxi Province. China possesses one of the best epidemiological databases in the world on Se-related diseases which has been used in conjunction with geochemical data to demonstrate a significant geochemical control on human Se exposure. However, the precise geographical areas at risk and the geochemical controls on selenium availability have yet to be established...|$|E
40|$|Selenium (Se) is an {{essential}} mineral in the animal body for effective metabolism and health reasons. It can also have toxic effects if ingested in amounts exceeding the body’s metabolic requirements for extended periods (Underwood and Suttle, 1999). Its processes are not fully understood due to its intricate metabolism and its variable responses {{in the presence of}} other heavy metals (Rosenfeld, and Beath, 1964; Diplock, 1970 : and Georgievskii, et al., 1982). Arthur and Beckett (1989) and Echevarria, et al. (1986) noticed that both the deficiency and toxicity of Se affects a wide range of enzymes and metabolic processes. It may thus affect many pathways due to the changes in hormonal concentrations. Se has been observed in the groundwater of livestock across different regions of South Africa at concentrations exceeding the recommended guideline ranges (Casey and Meyer, 2001 : Casey et al., 1998; Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, 1996). The respective water was classified as potentially hazardous in some instances and unacceptable in others. It may help cause several health and reproduction problems in livestock and wildlife (Elsenbroek et al., 2003). The marginal difference between adequacy and toxicity of Se in the animal body led to investigations into the effect of the total dissolved solids (TDS) content of the water on the selenium status and its effect on production parameters of mutton sheep over a ten-week period. The guideline limit for Se in drinking water is 0, 05 mg / L (DWAF, 1996) with a target water quality range of 0, 02 mg / L (WRC, 2004). Se was supplemented at 0, 7 mg / L during the trial and TDS was given at 3000 mg / L. Animals not receiving Se were less productive than those that received Se. Those that received both Se and TDS grew as well as those supplemented only with Se, but were more efficient. They seemed to accumulate less Se in the blood. Their excretory mechanisms and the functioning of their homeostatic controls against both Se deficiency, at first, and at a later stage against chronic <b>selenosis,</b> were more suitable. Further research exposing the animals for a longer time period and in an extensive production system would assist in quantifying these results. Dissertation (MInst.

40|$|Selenium is an {{essential}} element for humans, animals and some species of microorganisms. The biological function of selenium shows dual characteristics. The selenium content range between toxic and deficient concentration is very narrow. The present paper discusses the geographical distribution of two forms (total and water-soluble) of selenium in topsoil (plough layer for cultivated soils, eluvial horizon for natural soils) and evaluates its relationship with some human health problems in China. Topsoil samples, 354 in total, including 156 natural and 198 cultivated soils of 21 main soil types were collected. The total Se concentration in soil samples was determined with DAN (diaminonaphthalene) -fluorescence spectrophotometer method. Soil water-soluble Se concentration was determined with the same method after extraction with water (water/soil = 5 : 1). The {{results showed that the}} geometric and arithmetic means of total Se concentration in soil, for all samples, were 0. 173 mg/kg and 0. 239 mg/kg, respectively, with the lowest value being 0. 022 mg/kg and the highest being 3. 806 mg/kg. For the cultivated soil, the geometric mean of total Se was 0. 188 mg/kg, its arithmetic mean was 0. 269 mg/kg and higher than those in the natural soil, 0. 154 mg/kg and 0. 206 mg/kg, respectively. The geometric and arithmetic means of water-soluble Se in soil for all the samples were 4. 0 and 6. 4 mug/kg, the lowest 0. 6 mug/kg and the highest value being 109. 4 mug/kg. For the cultivated soils, the average concentration of water-soluble Se was 4. 3 mug/kg, similar to that of natural soil, they are and 4. 4 mug/kg by geometric mean. Two sequences of the soil types, arranged separately in the concentration of total Se and water-soluble Se, are different and this demonstrates that the proportions of the two forms of selenium existing in various soils are different. The percentages of water-soluble Se to total Se in different types of soils varied from 1. 07 to 6. 69 %. However, generally the laterite and other subtropic soil still have relatively high absolute water-soluble Se contents because of their higher total Se contents. A very significant correlation between total Se and water-soluble Se has been found in cultivated soil with a correlation coefficient of 0. 58 (P < 0. 01). The relationships between soil Se and human endemic diseases Keshan disease, Kashin-Back diseases and <b>selenosis</b> have been discussed. The reference criteria for evaluating Se deficiency and Se excess in soil were suggested. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
