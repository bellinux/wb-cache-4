An extremely brief review of random sampling basics is given that discusses the UNIFORM random number function {{and the use of}} the special SAS functions INT, CEIL, and FLOOR to select random samples in the data step. Data step code for selecting unrestricted random samples is given and explained. Data step code for selecting Bernoulli samples and two different approaches to selecting a simple random <b>sample</b> <b>without</b> <b>replacement</b> are presented and discussed. Simpler ways to select simple random <b>samples</b> <b>without</b> <b>replacement</b> using PROC SORT and PROC RANK are illustrated and examples given. An alternative to selecting a random sample in the data step is to use PROC SURVEYSELECT in SAS/STAT. The syntax for the SURVEYSELECT procedure is given and statements needed for selecting unrestricted and simple random samples are explained. The meaning and use of different options available using PROC SURVEYSELECT are examined.

In this example, X is the random variable whose outcome is k, the number of green marbles actually drawn in the experiment. This situation is illustrated by the following contingency table: ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The Polya {{posterior}} is a noninformative Bayesian procedure {{which can}} be used when little or no prior information is available. The Polya posterior is related to the Bayesian bootstrap of Rubin (1981). See also Lo (1988). One advantage of the Polya posterior is that it has a stepwise Bayes justification and leads to admissible procedures. For further discussion of the Polya posterior see Ghosh and Meeden (1997). In this note we will show how the Polya posterior can be adapted to two-stage cluster sampling. We will consider the simple case where there are N clusters or primary sampling units. Each cluster consists of M subunits or second stage sampling units. We assume that first a random <b>sample</b> <b>without</b> <b>replacement</b> of n clusters are selected from the N clusters. Then within each selected cluster a random <b>sample</b> <b>without</b> <b>replacement</b> of m subunits is chosen. In section two the twostage Pol...|$|R

40|$|For {{the problem}} of model choice in linear regression, we {{introduce}} a Bayesian adaptive sampling algorithm (BAS), that <b>samples</b> models <b>without</b> <b>replacement</b> from the space of models. For problems that permit enumeration of all models BAS is guaranteed to enumerate the model space in 2 p iterations where p {{is the number of}} potential variables under consideration. For larger problems where sampling is required, we provide conditions under which BAS provides perfect <b>samples</b> <b>without</b> <b>replacement.</b> When the <b>sampling</b> probabilities in the algorithm are the marginal variable inclusion probabilities, BAS may be viewed as sampling models “near ” the median probability model of Barbieri and Berger. As marginal inclusion probabilities are not known in advance we discuss several strategies to estimate adaptively the marginal inclusion probabilities within BAS. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm using simulated and real data and show that BAS can outperform Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The algorithm is implemented in the R package BAS available at CRAN...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the members}} of the {{population}} come in three kinds, say [...] "blue" [...] "red" [...] and [...] "black", the number of red elements in a sample of given size will vary by sample and hence is a random variable whose distribution can be studied. That distribution depends on the numbers of red and black elements in the full population. For a simple random sample with replacement, the distribution is a binomial distribution. For a simple random <b>sample</b> <b>without</b> <b>replacement,</b> one obtains a hypergeometric distribution.|$|R

Next, at each time step, we select an agent to initiate a collaboration with probability p_i proportional to its activity, p_i= η a_i, where η is a rescaling parameter that we fix by imposing that ∑_i p_i is equal to the number of collaboration event empirically observed per day.|$|R

(For comparison, when sampling with replacement, observation of a particular value has no effect on how likely it is to observe that value again.) Note also that in a Pólya urn model, successive acts of measurement over time have less and less effect on future measurements, whereas in <b>sampling</b> <b>without</b> <b>replacement,</b> the opposite is true: After a certain number of measurements of a particular value, that value will never be seen again.|$|E
