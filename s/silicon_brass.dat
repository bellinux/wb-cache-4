40|$|Free-machining brass {{containing}} 2 – 3 % of lead is {{a preferred}} industrial material as it shows excellent machinability where low cutting forces, short chips and reduced tool wear are attained. However this addition of lead, a highly toxic and hazardous material, leads {{to health and}} environmental issues. Alternative lead-free brasses are known for poor chip control and accelerated tool wear. The current study focuses on wear mechanisms of uncoated and coated cemented carbide tools when high-speed machining lead-free CuZn 21 Si 3 P <b>silicon</b> <b>brass.</b> The study shows that severe crater formation on the rake is the dominant tool failure mode. Microscopy observations indicate the diffusion wear mechanism {{to be driven by}} diffusion of cobalt binder into the chips and minor cross-diffusion of copper and zinc. Loss of the binder in cemented carbide is accompanied by adhesive pluck-out of WC grains. As a way to hinder the loss of Co, the diffusion preventing capacity of a-C:H diamond like carbon and (Ti,V,Zr,Nb,Hf,Ta) N nitride coating were tested. SEM, EDX and TEM data show that formation of amorphous SiO 2 and stoichiometric β-SiAlON stable layers was observed on the nitride coating, thus preventing diffusional tool wear. O-rich and N-rich glassy amorphous layers in Si-Al-O-N system with ZnS inclusions were found on the DLC coating. Partial delamination of the DLC coating and removal of the glassy phases resulted in localized crater formation associated with diffusional wear...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{refinement}} {{behavior of}} copper alloys cast in permanent molds was investigated. This {{is one of the}} least studied subjects in copper alloy castings. Grain refinement is not widely practiced for leaded copper alloys cast in sand molds. Aluminum bronzes and high strength yellow brasses, cast in sand and permanent molds, were usually fine grained due to the presence of more than 2 % iron. Grain refinement of the most common permanent mold casting alloys, leaded yellow brass and its lead-free replacement EnviroBrass III, is not universally accepted due to the perceived problem of hard spots in finished castings and for the same reason these alloys contain very low amounts of iron. The yellow brasses and Cu-Si alloys are gaining popularity in North America due to their low lead content and amenability for permanent mold casting. These alloys are prone to hot tearing in permanent mold casting. Grain refinement is one of the solutions for reducing this problem. However, to use this technique it is necessary to understand the mechanism of grain refinement and other issues involved in the process. The following issues were studied during this three year project funded by the US Department of Energy and the copper casting industry: (1) Effect of alloying additions on the grain size of Cu-Zn alloys and their interaction with grain refiners; (2) Effect of two grain refining elements, boron and zirconium, on the grain size of four copper alloys, yellow brass, EnviroBrass II, <b>silicon</b> <b>brass</b> and silicon bronze and the duration of their effect (fading); (3) Prediction of grain refinement using cooling curve analysis and use of this method as an on-line quality control tool; (4) Hard spot formation in yellow brass and EnviroBrass due to grain refinement; (5) Corrosion resistance of the grain refined alloys; (6) Transfer the technology to permanent mold casting foundries; It was found that alloying elements such as tin and zinc do not change the grain size of Cu-Zn alloys. Aluminum promoted b phase formation and modified the grain structure from dendritic to equiaxed. Lead or bismuth reduces the size of grains, but not change the morphology of the structure in Cu-Zn alloys. The grain size of the Cu-Zn-alloy can be reduced from 3000 mm to 300 mm after the addition of aluminum and lead. Similar effects were observed in EnviroBrass III after the addition of aluminum and bismuth. Boron refined the structure of yellow brasses in the presence of iron. At least 50 ppm of iron and 3 ppm of boron are necessary to cause grain refinement in these alloys. Precipitation of iron from the melt is identified as the cause of grain refinement. Boron initiates the precipitation of iron which could not be explained at this time. On the other hand zirconium causes some reduction in grain size in all four alloys investigated. The critical limit for the zirconium was found to be around 100 ppm below which not much refinement could be observed. The mechanism of grain refinement in the presence of zirconium could not be explained. Grain refinement by boron and iron can remain {{over a long period of}} time, at least for 72 hours of holding or after remelting few times. It is necessary to have the iron and boron contents above the critical limits mentioned earlier. On the other hand, refinement by zirconium is lost quite rapidly, some times within one hour of holding, mostly due to the loss of zirconium, most probably by oxidation, from the melt. In all the cases it is possible to revive the refinement by adding more of the appropriate refining element. Cooling curve analysis (thermal analysis) can be used successfully to predict the grain refinement in yellow brasses. The precipitation of iron in the liquid metal causes the metal to solidify without undercooling. Absence of this reaction, as indicated by the time-temperature (t-T) and its first derivative (dt/dT) curves, proved to be an indicator of refinement. The viability of the technique as an on-line quality control tool was proved in two foundries. The method can also correctly predict the onset of fading. The corrosion resistance of the grain refined alloys was measured in two solutions having different hydrogen activities, pH 6 and pH 8, and compared with the base alloys. Potentiodynamic polarization and long term weight loss experiments were conducted to evaluate the corrosion resistance. Cu-Zn alloys were evaluated for dezincification. In general, the grain refined alloys performed marginally better than the base alloys...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{research}} and development on the femtosecond laser has shown {{that it is a}} powerful tool for high preci-sion micromachining. However, femtosecond laser-material interaction is fast and complex due to its ultrashort pulse dura-tion. As the laser-induced plasma possesses useful information to understand the physical mechanism of laser processing, we investigate the optical emission during femtosecond laser material processing. Laser-induced plasma spectra of <b>brass,</b> <b>silicon</b> and tin were captured using a fibre optic spectrometer. Key parameters of the plasma such as plasma temperature and electron density were estimated based on the spectral details. These results may serve as a necessary basis of further re-search into the development of on-line monitoring techniques for the optimisation of the femtosecond laser processing...|$|R
40|$|Various {{techniques}} are currently {{used to produce}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on various materials. Many of these techniques use metallic interlayers, such as Ti or Si, to improve the adhesion of a DLC coating to a ferrous substrate. An alternative processing route would be to use plasma source ion implantation (PSII) to create a carbon composition gradient in {{the surface of the}} ferrous material to serve as the interface for a DLC coating. The need for interlayer deposition is eliminated by using a such a graded interfaces PSII approach has been used to form adherent DLC coatings on magnesium, aluminum, <b>silicon,</b> titanium, chromium, <b>brass,</b> nickel, and tungsten. A PSII process tailored to create a graded interface allows deposition of adherent DLC coatings even on metals that exhibit a positive heat of formation with carbon, such as magnesium, iron, brass and nickel...|$|R
50|$|The {{silicon content}} {{leads to a}} {{strengthening}} of the metal matrix. The appearance is similar to ordinary <b>brass.</b> <b>Silicon</b> tombac has good friction bearing characteristics and is corrosion resistant but is not resistant to ammonia atmosphere. The strength properties are largely retained at application temperatures up to 200 °C.It is a special alloy {{in terms of the}} combination of casting process and casting temperature. In most cases, parts made of silicon tombac, are produced through the high pressure die casting process, which is normally specialized on metals with relatively low melting temperatures. But in this case the temperature melting range of silicon tombac is in the area of 950 to 1000 °C, which is relatively high for casting into permanent moulds. The advantage is the productivity of this highly automated casting process. The disadvantage is the temperature stress of the surface of the permanent mould, so that the lifetime of these moulds is limited.|$|R

This heterogenous state of wetting {{in which the}} water is in contact with both the solid surface and the entrapped air is not stable. Diffusion of air into the surrounding water leads to gradual reduction in the size and numbers of the air bubbles. The sustainability of the entrapped air on such surfaces is important for many underwater applications in which the surfaces have to remain submersed for longer time periods.

Irrespective of the texture, both the size and the number of air pockets were found to decrease with time gradually and eventually disappear. In an attempt to reverse the diffusion we explore the possibility of using electrolysis to generate gases at the textured surfaces.
