50|$|The Model 28 Receiving Selector, {{also known}} as the LRS, {{converts}} incoming serial teletypewriter signals into parallel-wire intelligence. This equipment is capable of operating at 60, 75 or 100 words per minute and operates on a five-level <b>start-stop</b> <b>code,</b> with an option for six-level <b>start-stop</b> <b>code.</b> This unit is equipped with two types of contacts - code reading and timing contacts. The Model 28 Receiving Selector, equipped with a standard 115 VAC 60 Hz synchronous motor, is 8 inches high, 8.5 inches wide and 9.75 inches deep and weighs 16.5 pounds.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{completed}} the hardware design of STM 32 F 103 system circuit, infrared code learning module, human body infrared sensor module, indoor {{temperature and humidity}} sensor module, completes the software design of learning air conditioning remote control code, indoor temperature and humidity sensor module, also completes the energy-saving controller hardware and software debugging. Finally, this paper takes split type air conditioning units {{in a conference room}} as the control object (including indoor lighting system) to complete the energy-saving controller in air conditioner electrical system design, installation and debugging, completes the air conditioning start-stop and infrared temperature control code learning test. The test results show that energy-saving controller has realized infrared automatic perception of human activity, machine <b>start-stop</b> <b>code</b> self-learning and temperature settings and other functions...|$|E
