40|$|For low-Reynolds number shear-flows of neutrally-buoyant suspensions, the {{shear stress}} is often modeled using an {{effective}} viscosity that depends {{only on the}} solid fraction. As the Reynolds number (Re) is increased and inertia becomes important, the effective viscosity also depends on the Reynolds number itself. The current experiments measure the torque for flows of neutrally-buoyant particles in a coaxial-cylinder rheometer for <b>solid</b> <b>fractions,</b> ϕ, from 10 % to 50 % and Reynolds numbers based on particle diameter from 2 to 1, 000. For experiments for Reynolds of O(10) and <b>solid</b> <b>fractions</b> less than 30 %, the effective viscosity increases with Reynolds number, in good agreement with recent numerical simulations found in the literature. At higher <b>solid</b> <b>fractions</b> over the same range of Re, the results show a decrease in torque with shear rate. For Reynolds numbers greater than 100 and lower solids concentrations, the effective viscosity continues to increase with Reynolds number. However, based on comparisons with pure fluid measurements {{the increase in the}} measured effective viscosity results from the transition to turbulence. The particles augment the turbulence by increasing the magnitude of the measured torques and causing the flow to transition at lower Reynolds numbers.

Determination of rigidity and shear strength with respect to <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> for each alloy revealed two transition points, identified in the literature as coherency and maximum packing <b>solid</b> <b>fraction,</b> where changes in shearing mechanism occurred. Coherency occurred between 0. 18 and 0. 21 <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> for the 7 %Si alloys and between 0. 24 and 0. 27 for the 4 %Si alloys. Maximum packing occurred between 0. 33 and 0. 35 <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> for the 7 %Si alloys and between 0. 44 and 0. 47 for the 4 %Si alloys. For a given <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> after coherency, the shear strength increased when the silicon content was increased. This was due to the effect of silicon where the 4 %Si alloys have a globular, rosette-like microstructure, while the 7 %Si alloys have a larger grain size and a more irregular dendritic morphology. After the maximum packing <b>solid</b> <b>fraction,</b> an increase in copper content resulted in increased strength for a given <b>solid</b> <b>fraction.</b> This is hypothesised to be caused by a correspondingly lower temperature for the same <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> with increasing copper content, leading to a more rigid dendritic network.

40|$|A {{mechanistic}} {{understanding of}} the relationship among the granule composition, individual granule property, downstream robust processing, and the final tablet attributes is critical for rational development of a quality tablet. However, in the dry granulation literature, milled granules that are polydisperse in <b>solid</b> <b>fraction,</b> size, and shape are extensively used for compaction studies. Thus, the effect of an individual granule property or an individual component on the compaction properties of dry granules was not adequately separated. To advance the mechanistic {{understanding of the}} effect of dry granulation on tensile strength of tablets, individual granule properties such as size, <b>solid</b> <b>fraction,</b> and granule composition need to be decoupled, precisely controlled, and independently varied. To accomplish this, in this thesis, small cylindrical biconvex compacts of powder were used as model dry granules for compaction studies, which have the advantage of being monodisperse in both size and <b>solid</b> <b>fraction.</b> In addition, size and <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> of monodisperse granules and their composition were independently varied and precisely controlled. The novel use of monodisperse granules brings a new perspective on understanding the compaction properties of deformable dry granules. The effect of granule size and <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> on tensile strength of tablets was deconvoluted using monodisperse granules as well as milled granules of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). A strong linear relationship (with negative slope) exists between the tablet tensile strength and granule <b>solid</b> <b>fraction.</b> In contrary to popular perception, granule size has no statistical impact on the tablet tensile strength. A smooth or rough fracture surface of tablets prepared from low or high <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> granules, respectively indicates differences in fracture of the tablets. ^ Subsequently, a novel method was developed to map the fracture surfaces of tablets. The proportion of intra-granular versus extra-granular fracture of tablets was quantified by image analysis. Low <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> granules deform extensively, neighboring granule surfaces intermingle closely, and produce homogeneous tablet matrices. At a high deformation potential (defined as, tablet <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> - initial <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> of the packed granule bed), tablets fracture indiscriminately both intra-granularly (fracture of individual granules) and extra-granularly (separation of neighboring granules). In contrast, at a low deformation potential, tablets preferentially fracture extra-granularly. The proportion of intra-granular fracture {{is a function of the}} deformation potential only. Tensile strength of tablets increase nearly linearly with the deformation potential and the slope of the linear relationship is larger for higher tablet <b>solid</b> <b>fraction.</b> At or below the critical deformation potential the tablet structure is not coherent and it does not fracture intragranularly. ^ Calibration of the Drucker Prager Cap (DPC) model parameters provides a means for a deeper understanding of the impact of dry granulation, granule SF, and granule composition (MCC/mannitol ratio) on the compaction properties of granules. MCC of any granulation status requires the same in-die compaction stress state for densification to a given tablet <b>solid</b> <b>fraction.</b> Only cohesion of materials and tensile strength of tablets are a strong linear function of MCC granule <b>solid</b> <b>fraction.</b> However, properties such as cohesion and diametrical tensile strength go through a maximum as the mannitol level increases in the binary granules, and clearly do not follow the linear mixing rule. Other properties either approximately follow the linear mixing rule (e. g., hydrostatic yield strength, young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus and Poisson’s ratio) where some interactions between the constituents are present, or not sensitive to the composition (e. g., internal angle of friction). In general, the properties of a multicomponent system may not be precisely estimated from the properties of individual components, simply by using the linear mixing rule. ...|$|R

The slurry viscosity is shear-rate and time dependent provided the semisolid microstructure consists of solid spheroids surrounded by liquid.

On the contrary, the reduction efficiency will be very small if the <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> is larger. In this case, the volume contraction in the core area due to the solidification will not be compensated any more...|$|R
40|$|Thixoforging {{is a type}} of {{semi-solid}} {{metal processing}} at high <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> (0. 5 <fs< 1), which involves the processing of alloys in the semi-solid state. 7075 alloy {{has been used as a}} feedstock for thixoforming in order to investigate thixoformability of a high performance aluminium alloy at high <b>solid</b> <b>fraction.</b> The microstructure in semi-solid state consists of fine spheroidal solid grains surrounded by liquid. Thixo behaviour allows laminar flow that avoids macro-porosity and other casting defects and gives better mechanical properties; so we can reduce the weight of functional parts. Higher <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> of 7075 alloy is less sensitive to temperature, avoids metal splash at high speed, allows laminar flow at high speed and gives a good smooth surface without stick-slip phenomenon. The process is quicker with less energy and so the production rate increases and the tool has longer life. However, high <b>solid</b> <b>fraction</b> promotes freezing flow because of faster solidification and the lack of liquid phase. This freezing flow creates solid/liquid segregation and increases the forming force...|$|R
