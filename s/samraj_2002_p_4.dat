Despite our dependence on immigration for labour market growth, studies repeatedly highlight the increasing marginalization and poverty of immigrants.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a heuristic investigation of mixed methods organized around {{three pairs of}} opposing standpoints: methods (qualitative vs. quantitative), paradigms (constructivist vs. post positive), and inquiry approaches (dialectical vs. pragmatic). There is a movement today to embrace mixed methods of research and evaluation, mixing qualitative and quantitative methods of gathering and interpreting data. Mixed methods proponents hail this development as one way to end the historic paradigm wars (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). They envision mixed methods research as building a bridge of cooperation between qualitative and quantitative research. This metaphor seems fitting because of its popularity among mixed method supporters, (i. e., Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998, p. 167). Bridges are neither inherently good nor bad, but they are inherently change agents. They are built to change the status quo, to make passage across something easier. It is a powerful and apparently ubiquitous metaphor in mixed method research; sometimes implicit, as in the following example: While federal legislation today “exalts scientific evidence as the key driver of education policy and practice ” (Feuer, Towne, & Shavelson, <b>2002,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>4)</b> there is a “legitimate ” role for qualitativ...|$|R

40|$|Extract] The United Nations {{designated}} the 1990 s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). This drove a shift towards {{an emphasis on}} mitigation-awareness and preparedness. The aim was to identify vulnerability and to reduce it. During the International decade this shifted to a preference to identify and enhance strengths, specifically resilience. The outcome was the strategy of building hazard resilient communities. Despite IDNDR, loss of life and economic costs from natural hazards have continued to increase. Mitigation has been pushed by both political and economic necessities. A response in Australia was to identify and quantify economic costs (BRS, 2001), followed by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG, 2002) review, a high-level review to establish mitigation priorities. The COAG review requires mitigation {{at all levels of}} government, and puts responsibility on planners as well as requiring an enhancement of resilience through civil responsibility, education and warnings. "Take action to ensure more effective statutory State, Territory and local government land use planning, development and building control regimes that systematically identify natural hazards and include measures {{to reduce the risk of}} damage from these natural hazards. " "Reduce the problem of public infrastructure repeatedly damaged by natural disasters through cost-effective mitigation measures to make infrastructure more resilient. [...] .

William Wallace, III (Uncle Bill Wallace, personal interview, 2002) explains in the textbook, World Communities, that the origin of the name La‘ie comes from two Hawaiian words: “the first being lau, meaning leaf and the second being ie, referring to the ie vine of the red-spiked climbing pandanus tree ” (Allen, et al., <b>2002,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>4).</b> Hawaiian mythology tells that the ie vine is sacred to the god Kane, the procreator, and the goddess of hula, Laka. Indeed, the ahupua‘a of La‘ie, prior to Western contact, provided rich resources with its many lo‘i kalo (taro terraces) and its ocean (ke kai) filled with marine life. In historical times, it also provided sanctuary as a pu‘uhonua, a sacred place where fugitives could seek safety from their pursuers. Since 1864, when Brigham Young sent Francis A. Hammond and George Nebeker to Hawai‘i to locate a settlement for the Mormon community, La‘ie has become the gathering place for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS). 3 On February 12, 1955, a place was set aside to build a four-year university, and on September 26, 1955, in temporary facilities, Church College of Hawai‘i (CCH) opened its doors to young learners throughout the Pacific Basin.

40|$|Mutually respectful student-teacher {{relationships}} {{are central to}} improving educational experiences in the middle years. As much research continues to confirm, teachers relating well to their students {{remains one of the}} most significant factors in generating positive academic and social outcomes. Developing these sorts of relationships, however, necessarily involves problematising the traditional power inequities that exist between teachers and students. This chapter explores this premise and identifies ways that teacher practice, through a tendency to be mobilised around relations of domination and control, can constrain learning outcomes by suppressing students' sense of legitimacy and agency. Drawing on data and findings from two Australian studies, we bring these issues to life through detailing students' concerns about their relationships with their teachers. Given '[the first imperative of some teachers when teaching boys appears to be 'controlling' rather than teaching them' (Lingard et al. <b>2002,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>4),</b> our focus in this chapter is on boys' experiences of schooling in the Middle Years. We do not wish to silence or marginalise girls' experiences, but the boys' voices featured here are most useful in making visible the constitutive nature of authoritative and coercive school and classroom relations (Davies 2000). As an issue of power and control, we explore these relations within the context of boys' investments in dominant constructions of masculinity. Drawing on the dimension of Supportive Classroom Environment, within the Productive Pedagogies framework (The State of Queensland 2001), the chapter concludes with a discussion of a number of ways in which schools might take these issues forward to establish more genuinely equitable and positive student-teacher relationships...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the way in}} which several private firms in Colombia have deployed Corporate Social Responsibility programmes via peacebuilding initiatives, as in a gift-exchange scheme. These initiatives often have taken place in different regions of the country regardless of the geopolitical influence armed groups have on them. Whereas the Colombian government and FARC guerrillas have started peace-talks since 2012, many areas are still vulnerable to the reproduction of violence. The national –however non-state– campaign ""Soy Capaz"" led by 120 big companies, reveal a deep interest from within the private sector to engage in peacebuilding as part of its corporate strategy. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe how peace initiatives by the private sector could be interpreted as a gift-giving relationship between corporate firms and government officials, institutions, and the Colombian society as a whole. Higher corporate expansion and regional consolidation, national and international positive reputation, increased leverage in government decision-making and policy-making, and a greater consumption of goods and services, are possible outcomes among other benefits that could be expected in exchange for these peace initiatives led from and by the private sector. However, the question Mauss already posited in his search for “a rule of legality and self-interest”, a “power residing in the object” (<b>2002,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>4),</b> suggests a possible underlying and even deeper interest behind these initiatives. The very nature of this gift –its embedded asymmetry for reciprocation, its morality and its spirituality– creates affect within a population desirous of peace and reconciliation. However, the seriousness and scope of such venture coming from the Colombian private sector are still an issue to be clarified. #SoyCapaz; Business; Corporate gift; CSR; Peacebuilding; Private secto...|$|R
30|$|At its core, {{the study}} of {{motivation}} is simply the pursuit to understand why people behave as they do, or to understand “the reasons underlying behavior” (Guay et al. 2010, p. 712). There are many theories of motivation. Content theories such as those by Maslow (1943), Alderfer (1972), Herzberg (1966), and McCelland (1985) deal with “what” motivates people; their individual needs and goals. Process theories such as expectancy theory by Vroom (1964), goal theory by Locke and Latham (1990), and equity theory by Adams (1963) attempt to explain how and why motivation happens. Reinforcement theories, such as those rooted in Skinner’s (1953) behaviorism, attempt to explain how outcomes influence behavior. In the field of workplace motivation, Scholl (2015) describes motivation as “the force that energizes, directs, and sustains behavior.” This definition includes three aspects that help to guide the inquiry to explain {{the amount of energy}} an individual puts into a task, the direction of one’s effort based on choice and conflict, and finally, the issue of persistence and consistency of behavior. Pintrich and Schunk (<b>2002,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>4)</b> define motivation as “the process whereby goal-directed activity is instigated and maintained.” This definition forms the basis upon which other nuances of goal-directed behavior are studied. This foundation is particularly important when analyzing sustained motivation, as was done by Hernandez et al. (2013), in a longitudinal study with racially and ethnically diverse STEM discipline university students. After following over 1000 students for 3  years, monitoring both the individual and environmental factors and the influence that these factors had upon students’ individual and longitudinal regulation of goals and resulting academic performance, the findings in this particular study supported the hypothesis that students do indeed align their goals to the context of STEM academic learning, and this adaptation influences their performance and ultimately their success and persistence in STEM.|$|R

40|$|The term ‘phrasal vocabulary’ {{refers to}} multi-word expressions, that is, idioms, {{templates}} or “strings of words, which {{appear to be}} processed without recourse to their lowest level of composition” (Wray, <b>2002,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>4).</b> Formulaicity constitutes an essential feature of language production and comprehension, and phrasal vocabulary plays {{a central role in}} everyday language usage. This research study replicates the experimental design carried out in the study Acquiring phrasal vocabulary by Kuiper, Columbus, & Schmitt (to appear), which used a cloze procedure to test three main hypotheses: a) There are significant differences between the degree of acquisition of formulaic language items by native and non-native speakers of English; b) The frequency of usage of the head-verbs contained in verb plus complement formulaic sequences is positively correlated with the acquisition of such sequences; and, c) Phrasal vocabulary is age graded. In the present study the target language is Spanish instead of English. In addition, available evidence suggests that cultural integration seems to be linked to the acquisition of formulaic language. Thus, a questionnaire intended to measure the participants’ cultural integration level to the target language community was developed. The results of this study supported the predictions that the amount of formulaic language acquired by native speakers is positively correlated with age, and that non-native speakers’ phrasal vocabulary is significantly less extensive than that of native speakers. Most importantly, the results also showed a significant effect of verb frequency on the participants’ acquaintance with the formulaic sequences tested. However, the prediction that cultural integration would be positively correlated with the number of correct answers in the cloze test for both groups was not supported. Extending to the Spanish language the results reported by Kuiper, Columbus, & Schmitt supports the argument that the processes of acquisition of formulaic language across diverse linguistics systems function in a very similar way (Corpas Pastor, 2003). A better comprehension of the mechanisms by which speakers acquire formulaic language may significantly {{contribute to the development of}} an appropriate methodology to teach phrasal vocabulary to second language learners...|$|R

The project process is defined as three distinct parts: 1. Scholarship and research. 2. Model-building and website creation. 3. Deployment, testing and evaluation. To support this, the project included the following sub stages: An informal needs analysis generated by reflection on practice. A survey of contemporary typeface classification systems, type education literature and online resources for typographic study. The building of animated and three-dimensional prototype models. The creation of a database of 100 historically significant typeface designs. The sourcing of samples, references, images and the gathering of reproduction permissions from designers, institutions and foundries whose work features in the database. The writing, editing, design and launch of the website at [URL] Peer feedback and review. An evaluation study of the website with students at AUT University in Auckland, New Zealand. A series of revisions to the website structure and presentation. The writing up of the research process and findings. I chose this topic as {{the direct result of}} my experiences teaching typography at AUT University and other tertiary institutions. The need for graphic design students to demonstrate competencies in typography (as a sub-discipline of graphic design) has always been present, but has been fore grounded over the last two decades; however, a recent PhD thesis on the subject has argued that traditional delivery of print-based typographic knowledge no longer serves undergraduate requirements for today's divergent screen-based media (Yee, 2006, p. 11). This has been accompanied by a significant {{rise in the number of}} available typefaces (Cahalan, 2004, p. 62). Unfortunately the means with which to study them has not kept pace with these developments (Dixon, <b>2002,</b> <b>p.</b> <b>4).</b> Changes occurring within the type manufacturing industry and the wider field of creative industries during the last two decades have made the historical, background context of typography harder to comprehend from an undergraduate point of view. Students complain that they are under-resourced for information (in their preferred research medium) about the typefaces they must demonstrate care and deliberation in choosing. From experience gained in observing an online-learning pilot scheme in 2005, I elected to develop an online reference resource designed for self-directed research of typographic history as a complement to the existing tuition of typographic applications face-to-face in the classroom. While the project offers a useful example of how practice-led research can augment a teaching situation, and is concerned with the promotion of student-centred and self-directed learning at AUT University, this is not its only objective as a public-access location on the internet.
