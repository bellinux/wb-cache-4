A patient is often tachycardic (rapid heart beat) with a narrowing {{of the difference}} between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The body attempts to compensate with peripheral vasoconstriction. Skin may <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> pale and be cool to the touch. The patient may exhibit slight changes in behavior. Volume resuscitation with crystalloids (Saline solution or Lactated Ringer's solution) is all that is typically required. Blood transfusion is not typically required.|$|E

Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E

Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
2500|$|Defense {{attorney}} Jose Baez told jurors {{his biggest}} {{fear was that}} they would base their verdict on emotions, not evidence. [...] "The strategy behind that is, if you hate her, if you think she's a lying, no-good slut, then you'll <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at this evidence in a different light", he said. [...] "Itold you {{at the very beginning}} of this case that this was an accident that snowballed out of control... What made it unique is not what happened, but who it happened to." [...] He explained Casey Anthony's behavior as being the result of her dysfunctional family situation. At one point as Baez spoke, Ashton could be seen smiling or chuckling behind his hand. This prompted Baez to refer to him as [...] "this laughing guy right here". The judge called a sidebar conference, then a recess. When court resumed, he chastised both sides, saying both Ashton and Baez had violated his order that neither side should make disparaging remarks about opposing counsel. After both attorneys apologized, the judge accepted the apologies but warned that a recurrence would have the offending attorney excluded from the courtroom.|$|E

2500|$|An episode takes {{approximately}} {{one year to}} complete; Neely states that six or seven episodes may be produced simultaneously, all at various stages. Animation is done at Titmouse, Inc. in Los Angeles. When asked about the slideshow presentation of his animated shorts {{in an interview with}} The College Hill Independent, Neely felt that the approach was not [...] "an aesthetic choice, it was sort of the only thing I was able to do. I'm not an animator." [...] He stated that, out of [...] "ignorance and not having a whole lot of options", he hand-drew each frame on paper and scanned them into a computer; he felt the restrictions [...] "really paid off and I enjoyed the form. ... But, it never was something I felt I was needing to defend or stick to, or that it represented me artistically." [...] Other changes to the art style from the shorts were dictated by animation director, Mike L. Mayfield. Weidenfeld stated that Mayfield [...] "was instrumental in turning Brad's original style into what we had the first season." [...] Among them were the addition of pupils which, according to Weidenfeld, some of Neely's fans were unhappy over. Neely states that [...] "I had a long run of drawing those Orphan Annie style of eyes. That worked well for print. But as soon as things move, the characters <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like zombies." ...|$|E
