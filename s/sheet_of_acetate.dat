2500|$|Kouble and Craig {{compared}} direct {{methods and}} indirect methods of bite mark analysis. In the past, the direct method compared {{a model of}} the suspect’s teeth to a life-size photograph of the actual bite mark. In these experiments, direct comparisons were made between dental models and either photographs or [...] "fingerprint powder lift-models." [...] The [...] "fingerprint powder lift" [...] technique involves dusting the bitten skin with black fingerprint powder and using fingerprint tape to transfer the bite marks onto a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetate.</b> Indirect methods involve the use of transparent overlays to record a suspect’s biting edges. Transparent overlays are made by free-hand tracing the occlusal surfaces of a dental model onto an acetate sheet. When comparing the “fingerprint powder lift” technique against the photographs, the use of photographs resulted in higher scores determined by {{a modified version of the}} ABFO scoring guidelines. The use of transparent overlays is considered subjective and irreproducible because the tracing can be easily manipulated. On the other hand, photocopier-generated overlays where no tracing is used is considered to be the best method in matching the correct bite mark to the correct set of models without the use of computer imaging.|$|E
50|$|Originally, stereoplotters {{recorded}} {{the path of}} the flying light spot by directly scribing the path on a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> or polyester coated with an opaque lacquer, which could be photographed to make the topographic map printing plates. If mistakes were made during contour tracing, the operator would daub some lacquer on the incorrect trace, allow it to dry and then try flying the light spot again. Current systems that use digital capture techniques allow simple erasure of part of the faulty data vector in computer memory, whereupon digitizing can resume. The digital database is then combined in a graphics program with annotations and symbols, ultimately being used to produce the map printing plates with a photoplotter.|$|E
50|$|Models {{were issued}} {{on a monthly}} basis and the range grew quickly to include {{vehicles}} of all types. Gradually the models became more sophisticated with the addition of such features as 'Glidamatic' spring suspension and a detailed interior on the Renault Floride (222) in October 1959, and the fibre-optic style 'Trans-o-Lite' illuminating lights system first seen on the Superior Ambulance on Cadillac Chassis (437) in October 1962. The early type of interior which was known as 'vac-formed', was produced by stretching a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> over a mould by means of a vacuum, and lasted for three years until being replaced by the crisper, more detailed injection-moulded type first seen in the Thames 'Airborne' caravan (420) in February 1962.|$|E

50|$|Cel shading or toon shading {{is a type}} of non-photorealistic {{rendering}} {{designed to}} make 3-D computer graphics appear to be flat by using less shading color instead of a shade gradient or tints and shades. Cel-shading is often used to mimic the style of a comic book or cartoon and/or give it a characteristic paper-like texture. There are similar techniques that can make an image look like a sketch, an oil painting or an ink painting. It is somewhat recent, appearing from around the beginning of the twenty-first century. The name comes from cels (short for celluloid), the clear <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>acetate,</b> which are painted on for use in traditional 2D animation.|$|R

McCay had the cels photographed at the Vitagraph studios. The film was naturalistically animated, and made use of dramatic camera angles that would have been impossible in a live-action film.|$|R
50|$|Silk screens {{are created}} by {{printing}} a black outline on a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> clear <b>acetate,</b> such as with an ink jet printer, then burning the image onto a frame holding a polyester sheet on which a plastic-like emulsion has been applied. Exposing the emulsion to light causes the emulsion to dry or “fix,” while the emulsion directly underneath the black lines on the acetate remain soft and unfixed. When the silk screen is “washed out” by a hose, or even power-washed, the emulsion directly under the black outline of the image is vacated, leaving a porous outline. The black line, semi-liquid can now be pushed, usually with a squeegee, through the porous outline onto a piece of tile. Good silk screens are extremely useful in that, once created, the pattern can be applied repeatedly to many tiles, of course, even changing the colors for any given project.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains a}} series of images which should be printed and cut {{out to make a}} simple cardboard version of a medieval astrolabe. The resulting astrolabe is a simplified and modernised version of that described in Geoffrey Chaucer’s c. 1391 Treatise on the Astrolabe, and has been constructed following the prescription described in Eisner (1975, 1976 a, 1976 b). The diagrams in this document have been produced using PyXPlot. § Instructions Pages 2, 3 and 5 should be printed out onto paper, or more preferably onto thin card. Page 4 should be printed onto a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> transparent <b>acetate.</b> The two sides of the Mother (pages 2 and 3) should be glued rigidly back-to-back, perhaps sandwiching a piece of rigid card.

The Label and the Rule should be placed on either side of the astrolabe: the Rule, marked out with a declination scale, should be placed over the Plate and the Rete, whilst the Label should be placed on the back of the Mother. The whole construction may then be fastened together by placing a split-pin paper fastener through the centre. For more information, please visit...|$|R
50|$|Several Wacom models, {{including}} the Intuos4 and Bamboo, were criticized for the drawing surface's roughness, which caused the small pressure-sensitive 'nib' to wear down, and become slanted or scratchy {{in the same}} way as pencil lead, albeit more slowly. This could also cause the surface to become smoother where it is used more, resulting in uneven slick and non-slick areas. As the nibs were only short lengths of plastic, it was possible for a user wanting a more durable nib to improvise a replacement from a short length of nylon 'wire' (approx 0.065 inches or 1.7mm diameter) like that found in grass trimmer or 'weed-eater' refills, suitably straightened by hand and smoothed (rounded off) at one end with abrasive paper. Additionally, a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> glass or <b>acetate</b> can be placed over the drawing surface to avert surface or nib damage {{in the same way}} as screen protectors are used on phones, although in the case of glass this may induce a—usually modest—parallax error when tracing.|$|R

40|$|Acid-base balance was studied before, {{during and}} after {{hemodialysis}} on four patients of terminal renal failure {{who are on the}} maintenance hemodialysis with the Kiil type artificial kidney twice and 16 hours per week. Hemodialysis was carried out using dialysate containing <b>acetate</b> <b>of</b> various concentration. 1) Blood pH: With increase <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> in dialysate, alkalemia was noted at the end of hemodialysis. When dialysate containing 37 or 39 mEq/L <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> was used, predialytic alkalemia was present and was more enhanced at the end of dialysis. When dialysate containing 33 or 35 mEq/L <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> was used, predialytic value was almost normal. 2) PCO 2 : Predialytic and postdialytic PCO 2 were well balanced regardless acetate content. Predialytic PCO 2 rose according to the increase <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> content and reached the nearly normal range. 3) Actual bicarbonate: At the end of hemodialysis, acidosis was well improved regardless the acetate content. It was 23. 8 ± 2. 4 mEq/L when dialysate with 35 mEq/L <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> was used, and hyperbasemia was noted when dialysate with 37 or 39 mEq/L <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> was used. On the other hand hypobasemia was noted to such an extent as 23. 1 ± 1. 2 mEq/L of PCO 2 when dialysate with 33 mEq/L <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> was used. 4) Base excess: Predialytic hypobasemia was noted when dialysate containing 33 mEq/L <b>of</b> <b>acetate.</b> When other dialysates were used, predialytic value was within normal range.

Isocitrate lyase enzyme protein was isolated for this purpose by specific immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. After 4 h in the dark, in the presence <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> the rate <b>of</b> increase of isocitrate lyase activity was 75 times that in the absence <b>of</b> <b>acetate.</b> Incorporation <b>of</b> [35 S]methionine into isocitrate lyase was 140 times greater in the presence <b>of</b> <b>acetate.</b> Incorporation <b>of</b> [35 S]methionine into the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction overall was about five times as fast in the presence <b>of</b> <b>acetate.</b> These data are not consistent with an increased turnover of isocitrate lyase enzyme molecules, sufficient {{to account for the}} low rate {{of increase}} of isocitrate lyase activity in the absence <b>of</b> <b>acetate.</b> The greater rate of enzyme synthesis in the presence <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> must therefore be due to some effect of this metabolite on the processing or translation of isocitrate lyase mRNA...|$|R

40|$|Total {{synthesis}} <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> from CO 2 by Clostridium acidiurici during fermentations of hypoxanthine {{has been}} shown to involve synthesis of glycine from methylenetetrahydrofolate, CO 2, and NH 3. The glycine is converted to serine by the addition of methylenetetrahydrofolate, and the resulting serine is converted to pyruvate, which is decarboxylated to form acetate. Since CO 2 is converted to methylenetetrahydrofolate, both carbons <b>of</b> the <b>acetate</b> are derived from CO 2. The evidence supporting this pathway is based on (i) the demonstration that glycine decarboxylase is present in C. acidiurici, (ii) the fact that glycine is synthesized by crude extracts at a rate which is rapid enough to account for the in vivo synthesis <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> from CO 2, (iii) the fact that methylenetetrahydrofolate is an intermediate in the formation of both carbons <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> from CO 2, and (iv) the fact that the alpha carbon of glycine {{is the source of the}} carboxyl group <b>of</b> <b>acetate.</b> Evidence is presented that this synthesis <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> does not involve carboxylation of a methyl corrinoid enzyme such as occurs in Clostridium thermoaceticum and Clostridium formicoaceticum.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{that a number}} of the central effects of ethanol are mediated via ethanol metabolites: acetaldehyde and acetate. Ethanol is known to produce a large variety of behavioral actions such anxiolysis, narcosis and modulation of locomotion. Acetaldehyde contributes to some of those effects although the contribution <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> is less known. In the present studies rats and mice were used to assess the acute and chronic effects <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> after central or peripheral administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the comparison between central (intraventricular, ICV) and peripheral (intraperitoneal, IP) administration of acute doses <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> on locomotion. CD 1 male mice were used to study acute IP effects <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> on locomotion, and also the effects of chronic oral consumption <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> (0, 500 or 1000 mg/l, during 7, 15, 30 or 60 days) on ethanol- (1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 or 4. 5 g/kg, IP) induced locomotion, anxiolysis and loss of righting reflex (LORR). In rats, ICV acetate (0. 7 - 2. 8 μmoles) reduced spontaneous locomotion at doses that, in the case of ethanol and acetaldehyde, had previously been shown to stimulate locomotion. Peripheral acute administration <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> also suppressed locomotion in rats (25 - 100 mg/kg), but not in mice. In addition, although chronic administration <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> during 15 days did not have an effect on spontaneous locomotion in an open field, it blocked ethanol-induced locomotion. However, ethanol-induced anxiolysis was not affected by chronic administration <b>of</b> <b>acetate.</b> Chronic consumption <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> (up to 60 days) did not have an effect on latency to, or duration of LORR induced by ethanol, but significantly increased the number of mice that did not achieve LORR.

The vasorelaxant effects <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> in {{arginine vasopressin}} (AVP) -contracted rat tail artery strips {{were examined in}} order to study mechanism of action. Dose–dependent relaxation by acetate {{was found in the}} clinically important range of 4 to 16 mM. Relaxation was not due to complexing of ionized calcium, persisted after mechanical removal of the endothelium, and was not altered by pretreatment with indomethacin. Although acetate also inhibited contraction by alpha- 1 and alpha- 2 agonists, the relaxant effect was not altered by destruction of sympathetic nerve terminals using 6 -hydroxydopamine. The degree of relaxation in this model by various anions correlated with their lyotropic properties; however, the vasorelaxant effect <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> exceeded that which would be expected {{on the basis of its}} position in the lyotropic series. The vasorelaxant effect <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> was shared by other short–chain fatty acids that can be conjugated with coenzyme A (CoA), such as propionate and malonate. In contrast, a much lesser or absent relaxant effect was found with nonfatty–acid precursors of acetyl CoA, such as pyruvate, lactate, and alanine. The vasorelaxant effect <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> was abolished by pretreatment with DIDS, an inhibitor of organic anion uptake, suggesting that cellular uptake <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> is essential to its vasorelaxant action. The results suggest that the relaxant effect <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> in vascular smooth muscle is non-specific, is not mediated by prostaglandins, does not depend upon the presence of either endothelium or the sympathetic nervous system, and may be due to metabolism <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> to acetyl CoA with attendant conversion of ATP to AMP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{production}} of valuable biological products from sugars via fermentation is of {{importance in the}} chemical industry. One key parameter by which processes are evaluated is the product carbon yield on substrate. In the normal growth of heterotrophic organisms on fermentable sugars, some carbon is lost as CO 2. In the production <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> from hexose or pentose sugars, homoacetogens using the reductive acetyl CoA pathway have a theoretical yield <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> on glucose <b>of</b> 3. We hypothesized that the addition of enzymes necessary for fixation of the lost CO 2 would enhance the theoretical carbon yield <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> in the dark in organisms without the reductive acetyl CoA pathway. Using computational flux balances of central metabolism of Escherichia coli, we show that {{the addition of the}} enzymes for the reductive pentose phosphate (Calvin Benson Bassham) cycle increases the theoretical yield <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> from glucose or xylose. An even more significant increase in the theoretical carbon yield <b>of</b> <b>acetate</b> was obtained by adding the reactions for the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (rTCA), matching that of homoacetogens.
