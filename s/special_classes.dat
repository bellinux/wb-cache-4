5|$|The most {{competitive}} undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many {{students to take}} preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. Many private cursinhos have <b>special</b> <b>classes</b> focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making them very expensive. It is common to find students admitted in Medicine, Engineering and other programs {{after several years of}} preparatory courses.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>special</b> <b>classes</b> {{of protein}} {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E
5|$|Wild Brumbies {{are also}} used in the Brumby catch and handle event in stockman’s {{challenge}} competitions, where riders are required to catch a free running Brumby from their horse within a time limit of a few minutes. Sectional points are awarded for the stockman’s challenge for care and skill in catching the Brumby {{and their ability to}} teach them to lead. These demanding challenges for riders are held in New South Wales at Dalgety, Tamworth and Murrurundi plus The Man From Snowy River Challenge in Corryong, Victoria. Several New South Wales show societies, including Walcha, Bellingen and Dorrigo, hold <b>special</b> <b>classes</b> for registered Brumbies at their annual agricultural shows.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> {{cars from}} Ridge Racer (PSP) have been {{modified}} for this release and categorised into two tiered categories with four cars each. <b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 1 denotes cars embodying more traditional supercar designs and appearances, while <b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 2 {{is made up}} of radical or novelty designs that boast the highest top speeds attainable in the game. Specifically, the 'Kamata Angelus' (<b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 1) is now a more traditional supercar design, similar in appearance to the Angel car from Ridge Racer Revolution, and no longer powered by jet engines. The 'Soldat Crinale' (<b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 1) appears similar to its previous incarnation; while the Pac-Man car (<b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 2) now resembles a miniature aircraft in design (with Pac-Man himself depicted as piloting it), and is no longer powered by propellers. The New Rally-X car has been removed entirely and replaced by the 'Danver DigDug Hijack' (<b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 1); a large, super-charged Pickup truck. The 'Yamasa Raggio' (<b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 2), which appeared in the 2006 Tokyo Auto Salon as a heavily modified Honda NSX, is unique to Ridge Racer 2 and also appears in a [...] "prize" [...] movie that is unlocked after completion of the game's [...] "EX tour". The car was later made into a Tomica die-cast toy car for limited release. The three other <b>special</b> <b>class</b> cars are the Age Angelus Kid (<b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 2), Age Crinale Kid (<b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 2), and the Terrazi Drangonsaber Wild Gang (<b>Special</b> <b>Class</b> 1).|$|R
