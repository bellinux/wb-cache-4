5|$|The Spanish ships sought {{shelter from}} the British north of Trafalgar in Conil Bay, the {{entrance}} to which was protected by a large rocky ledge. Irresistible and Emerald negotiated this obstacle at around 14:30 and engaged the Spanish ships, which were anchored in the Bay. The Spanish ships surrendered at approximately 16:00. Eighteen Spaniards were killed and 30 wounded during the fighting; one Briton was killed and one wounded. The remaining crew of <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> avoided capture by cutting her cables and drifting her on shore so they could flee on foot. The British managed to drag <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> off the beach but, badly damaged, she sank at sea.|$|E
5|$|Individual F. aurea {{trees are}} common on dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> in Costa Rica, {{since they are}} often spared when forest is {{converted}} to pasture. In interviews, farmers identified the species as useful for fence posts, live fencing and firewood, and as a food species for wild birds and mammals.|$|E
5|$|La Lagunita is {{the site}} of the San Constantino and <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> Romanian Orthodox Church. The {{building}} is an architectural work from the 16th century, brought from Romania, made completely from oak and fir woods, and detailed with more than 40,000 individually placed and carved tiles. It is one of only 15 churches of its type remaining in the world, and one of only two outside of Romania, the other being in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The British commander, Captain George Martin, {{succeeded in}} chasing the Spanish vessels into the rocky Conil Bay, where they {{surrendered}} {{after a brief}} engagement in which the Spanish suffered significantly higher casualties than the British. One of the Spanish ships, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> was subsequently wrecked on the shore, while the other, the Ninfa, was captured and later recommissioned into the Royal Navy. The treasure carried on board the frigates, however, had been removed by a Spanish fishing boat before the battle and so did not fall into British hands.|$|E
5|$|Arjona was {{a talented}} {{basketball}} player {{who played for}} Leones de Marte and TRIAS. He toured Central America {{as a member of}} the Guatemala national basketball team. Until recently, he held the record for the most points scored (78) in a single game by a Guatemalan. He also taught at a primary school (called <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> III), where he claimed to have spent six hours giving lessons and the rest of the day playing soccer. This earned him a visit from a Ministry of Education representative, who was sent to evaluate his pupils. The representative found that the students' education was actually above average. In 1988, he became the basketball coach of a boys' school (called Instituto Don Bosco).|$|E
5|$|On 3 November, Nürnberg, Scharnhorst, and Gneisenau steamed into Valparaiso, Chile to {{resupply}} their {{coal and}} other supplies. They {{were limited to}} 24hours per international law, which also allowed only three warships in any neutral port at a time; the other two cruisers, Leipzig and Dresden, {{had to return to}} Mas a Fuera. After regrouping at Mas a Fuera, Spee had decided to raid British shipping routes in the South Atlantic. On 21 November, the East Asia Squadron put into St. Quentin Bay to coal; the crews piled up coal on the ships' decks to allow them to steam {{all the way to the}} Port of <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> where Spee had arranged for colliers out of Montevideo to meet them on 5 December.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00 on 26 April 1797, the 74-gun ship of {{the line}} HMS Irresistible under Captain George Martin and the 36-gun frigate HMS Emerald under Captain Velterers Cornewall Berkeley were sailing at the {{southern}} edge of Jervis' (now known as Earl St. Vincent) fleet. While cruising close to the Spanish coast two unknown ships were sighted. Martin immediately ordered his ships to give chase and the strangers fled with Martin's vessels in pursuit. The new arrivals were two Spanish 34-gun frigates, the <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> and Ninfa, bound to Cádiz from Havana with a cargo of silver specie. The captains of these Spanish ships had unwittingly sailed into the midst of the blockade fleet the previous night, but had had a fortunate encounter with a Spanish fishing vessel which had warned them of the danger. Acting quickly, the captains off-loaded their treasure into the fishing boat with instructions to carry it safely into Cádiz.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish captains, {{recognising}} {{that they}} were outmatched by the larger British vessels, attempted to shelter in Conil Bay, a rocky stretch of coastline {{near the village of}} Conil de la Frontera to the north of Cape Trafalgar. At 14:30 they were discovered by Martin's ships, which had to carefully negotiate a large rock formation known as the Laja de Cape Rocha which protected the head of the bay. With this obstacle successfully behind them, Irresistible and Emerald attacked the anchored Spanish frigates broadside to broadside. The action lasted an hour and a half, with the Spanish ships taking much the worst of the damage. At 16:00, both battered Spanish vessels surrendered, although as the British ships launched boats to take possession of their prizes, the crew of <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> hacked through the anchor cables and allowed their ship to drift onto the rocky shoreline where they disembarked and escaped inland.|$|E
25|$|The Greek Orthodox Church has a {{presence}} in <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena.</b>|$|E
25|$|The coastal peoples {{continued}} {{the traditions of}} their predecessors on the <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> peninsula. They include the Machalilla, and later the Chorrera, who refined the ceramicism of the Valdivia culture.|$|E
25|$|Santa Paula {{and sister}} ship Santa Rosa survived {{the war and}} were {{returned}} to the Grace Line with Santa Paula being returned on 30 April 1947. Santa Lucia and <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> were sunk during war service.|$|E
25|$|The Las Vegas is {{the first}} known culture in Ecuador. They lived on the <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> Peninsula {{on the coast of}} Ecuador between 9000–6000 BC. The {{skeletal}} remains and other finds show evidence the culture once flourished in the area. Scientists have classified three phases of cultural development. The earliest people were hunter-gatherers and fisherman. At approximately 6000 BC the culture {{were among the first to}} begin farming (bottle gourd, Lagenaria siceraria, and an early type of maize, Zea mays L.) The best known remains of the culture are The Lovers of Sumpa. These human remains and other items can be seen at Museo Los Amantes de Sumpa y Centro Cultural in <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Valdivia Culture {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} settled {{cultures}} recorded in the Americas. It emerged from the earlier Las Vegas culture and thrived on the <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> peninsula near the modern-day town of Valdivia, Ecuador between 3500 BC and 1800 BC.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the first}} farmers in Ecuador were the Las Vegas culture of the <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> Peninsula/, who, in {{addition}} to making use of the abundant piscine resources, {{also contributed to the}} domestication of several beneficial plant species, including squash. They engaged in ritual burial and intensive gardening.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, the Benedictine monks (O.S.B.) from Subiaco Abbey (Arkansas) {{established}} a monastery near <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> Belize. By 1999, 23 Benedictines {{had served in}} Belize, but the monastery was then closed for lack of numbers. The fine buildings and property were bequeathed to the Diocese and in 2013 re-opened as St. Benedict Diocesan Seminary.|$|E
25|$|After several failed {{attempts}} at colonization of {{the portion of}} the New World now known as the United States, the Spanish succeeded in 1565 with the establishment of St. Augustine, the first city in the United States. Small settlements spread northward along the eastern coast into Georgia and the Carolinas. The northern-most post was <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> in what is now South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{artifacts}} {{discovered in}} Ecuador are stone implements discovered at 32 Cotton Pre-ceramic (Paleolithic) archaeological {{sites in the}} <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> Peninsula. They indicate a hunting and gathering economy, and date from the Late Pleistocene epoch, or about 11,000 years ago. These Paleo-Indians subsisted on the megafauna that inhabited the Americas at the time, which they hunted and processed with stone tools of their own manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Pre-Columbian Ecuador {{included}} numerous indigenous cultures, who thrived {{for thousands}} of years before the ascent of the Incan Empire. Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador {{is one of the oldest}} cultures in the Americas. The Valdivia culture in the Pacific coast region is a well-known early Ecuadorian culture. Ancient Valdivian artifacts from as early as 3500 BC have been found along the coast north of the Guayas Province in the modern city of <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena.</b>|$|E
25|$|On April 11, {{the police}} took Serafín {{and the four}} other {{suspects}} to <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> and asked Serafín to show the police where Kilroy's and others' remains were kept. That afternoon, they were forced at gunpoint to spend several hours digging up the graves. Once Kilroy's corpse had been exhumed, the police observed that his legs were missing; Serafín explained that the amputations were not a procedure of the ritual, but were done to simplify burial.|$|E
25|$|By murdering Kilroy, Constanzo {{prompted}} {{the downfall of}} his cult. He attracted international attention and forced the Mexican government to focus their efforts on bringing him and those involved to justice. On April 11, 1989, the day the bodies were exhumed from <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> Constanzo fled to a Holiday Inn in Brownsville before flying from McAllen, Texas to Mexico City, where he had an apartment. He escaped with Aldrete, Martín Quintana Rodríguez, Omar Francisco Orea Ochoa, and Álvaro de León Valdés ("El Duby").|$|E
25|$|Hunter gatherers {{began to}} occupy the central valley of the state around 7000 BCE, but {{little is known about}} them. The oldest archaeological remains in the seat are located at the <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> Ranch in Ocozocoautla whose finds include tools and weapons made of stone and bone. It also {{includes}} burials. In the pre Classic period from 1800 BCE to 300 CE, agricultural villages appeared all over the state although hunter gather groups would persist for long after the era.|$|E
25|$|Lakes in {{the state}} include the Laguna del Sol and Laguna de la Luna in the Nevado de Toluca, the lake in the crater of the Cerro Gorde. Atexcapan Lake in Valle de Bravo, San Simón Lake in Donato Guerra, San Pedro Lake and Concepcion de los Baños Lake and Tepetitlan Lake in San Felipe del Progreso, Acuitzilapan Lake at the food of Jocotitlan volcano, El Rodeo Lake near Xonacatlán, Xibojay and <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> Lakes in Jilotepec and Huapango Lake in Timilpan.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture employs 55% of the {{population}} of the municipality growing corn, beans, peanuts, sesame seed, sorghum, watermelon, cucumbers, squash, papaya and other food stuffs. Livestock raised here includes cattle, pigs and domesticated fowl. About five percent of {{the population}} is involved in fishing. Twenty percent is dedicated to commerce with only five percent dedicate to tourism which is limited to the beach communities of Mazunte, San Agustinillo, Aragón, Ventanilla, the Chacahua estuary, La Laguna, Barra Tilapa, Escobilla, Barra del Potrero, Tilzapote, Agua Blanca, <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> and Boca Barra de Valdeflores.|$|E
25|$|Fearing another raid, {{and with}} the Spanish {{settlements}} on the American West coast being overstretched, undermanned and underarmed; a crisis followed. Menéndez even conferred with the Council of the Indies in Seville (who received confirmation of St. Augustine's destruction by July) and Philip II, that all concentration should be {{in one place and}} that being at St. Augustine. Mendendez despite objections got his way and as a result Parris Island and <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> were abandoned. This marked the end of the permanent Spanish presence in what today is South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{portion of}} the present route to be designated {{as part of the}} state highway system was the section between Terlingua and Study Butte which was assigned in September 1939 as part of a spur to SH 227. This spur continued on to connect with the main highway at the present junction of the north end Old Maverick Road and the road to Panther Junction within Big Bend National Park. SH 227 at the same time was newly designated as a road from <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> Canyon to Panther Junction via the Old Maverick Road and then to Persimmon Gap and Marathon along the present US 385.|$|E
25|$|Although Spain, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands all had {{competing}} {{claims to}} the region, none of these prevented the English from becoming the first European power to colonize successfully the Mid-Atlantic coastline. Earlier attempts {{had been made by}} the Spanish in what is now Georgia (San Miguel de Gualdape, 1526–27; several Spanish missions in Georgia between 1568 and 1684), South Carolina (<b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> 1566–87), North Carolina (Joara, 1567–68) and Virginia (Ajacán Mission, 1570–71); and by the French in South Carolina (Charlesfort, 1562–63). Farther south, the Spanish colony of Spanish Florida, centered on St. Augustine, was established in 1565, while to the north, the French were establishing settlements in what is now Canada (Charlesbourg-Royal briefly occupied 1541–43; Port Royal, established in 1605).|$|E
25|$|The gangsters drove Kilroy {{through the}} back {{streets of the city}} and past an {{industrial}} area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out as they drove Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a dirt road that stretched between two corn fields. When they got to the private ranch known as <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and fed him bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Contanzo and his men came to see him. They wrapped his face and mouth with duct tape and walked him through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.|$|E
25|$|On 10 February 1995, {{a pair of}} Mirage F1JAs, piloted by Maj. Raúl Banderas and Capt. Carlos Uzcátegui, were {{directed}} over five targets approaching the combat zone in the Cenepa valley. After making visual contact, the Mirages fired their missiles, claiming two Peruvian Su-22Ms shot down, while a Kfir claimed a further A-37B Dragonfly. Sources in Peru, however, deny {{the claim that the}} Sukhois Su-22Ms were shot down by Ecuadorian aircraft, stating that one was shot down by Ecuadorian anti-aircraft artillery fire during a low flying ground-attack mission, while the second was lost because of an engine fire. Banderas served as Commander of the Ecuadorian Air Force between May 2014 and February 2016, while Uzcátegui died in a training accident in 2002 at Salinas air base, in the <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> Province.|$|E
25|$|After the {{excavation}} concluded, the suspects had unearthed 15 mutilated bodies, all males, including Kilroy's, {{who had been}} killed over a period of nine months. Kilroy's corpse was officially identified after the Brownsville police matched his dental records with the teeth found at the scene. Investigators concluded that most of the victims were rival drug dealers of Constanzo and not random sacrificial victims of the cult. Only three out of the 15 bodies were never identified. At <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> the Mexican police also seized 110kg (243 lb) of marijuana, 108 grams of cocaine, 12 firearms including three submachine guns, and 11 vehicles, some equipped with telephones. Inside an iron pot, investigators discovered remains of human brain, a goat's head, chicken feet, a turtle, several herbs, a horseshoe, and coins mixed with animal blood. They found no signs of cannibalism.|$|E
25|$|Martínez Salinas, on {{the other}} hand, stated that {{he was forced to}} confess because he was a {{neighbor}} at <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> and driver of the Hernández family. He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he had ever met Constanzo, he stated that he had seen him in person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but never talked to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when {{he was looking for a}} car piece for his vehicle. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that he had never heard Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she had talked about her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or talked to him about it.|$|E
25|$|When {{the police}} interrogated Serafín separately, {{he confessed to}} aiding in Kilroy's murder and that other people were killed {{over the course of}} several months at <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena.</b> Serafín then {{identified}} Constanzo and Aldrete as the heads of the group. He said that Constanzo had ordered the slayings as part of a sacrificial ritual. Constanzo believed that by sacrificing his victims, those doing the sacrifice were ensured strength, abundance, and immunity from law enforcement and injury. Specifically, he said that Kilroy was chosen at random because Constanzo had ordered his men to find a white, Anglo male (Spanish: gringo) to sacrifice. He said that Kilroy was killed by Constanzo with a machete blow and that his body was buried at the ranch. Serafín agreed to take the police to the exact spot where Kilroy was buried, which was marked by a wire piece coming out of the dirt. He stated that the wire was attached to Kilroy's spinal cord so they would be able pull out the bones and wear them as necklaces after the body decomposed.|$|E
25|$|The ranch where Kilroy {{was murdered}} in Matamoros, <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> was owned by Brigido Hernández. He was not a {{follower}} of Constanzo and was not charged with any crimes in the U.S. or Mexico. In the 1970s, the ranch served as a drug smuggling base for the Hernández family on the U.S.-Mexico border. Brigido's son Saúl Hernandez Rivera reportedly headed the operation by working with Colombian drug counterparts. According to the U.S. government, Saúl was responsible for importing between 454 and 907kg (1,000 to 2,000 lb) of marijuana per week. The drugs were passed through the Brownsville corridor and sent to Houston for further distribution. In 1987, however, Saúl was shot dead by the Gulf Cartel outside a bar in Matamoros, forcing his brother Elio {{to take over the}} drug business. His sudden death prompted his family, including Elio and his brothers Serafín Sr. and Ovidio, to grow closer to rituals and eventually become members of Constanzo's cult. Elio reportedly offered Constanzo half of his family's drug proceeds in exchange for his criminal contacts and supernatural protection for his family.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, she {{published}} an autobiography where she detailed how she met Constanzo and the group, her experiences {{when she was}} allegedly taken hostage by Constanzo, her mistreatment by authorities, and her versions of the story. Aldrete claimed she visited Constanzo in Mexico City and was then taken hostage after Constanzo decided to not let her go because he believed that {{she would go to}} the police and tell them where they were hiding. She claimed that Constanzo {{and the rest of the}} group were unaware of the killings that occurred in Matamoros until they found out that the police was looking for them, but went into hiding nonetheless because they feared for their lives. She detailed her alleged mistreatments in jail, and how she underwent beatings, psychological torture, rape, and an unfair trial. Her version of Constanzo's death was different than the official one; she stated that Constanzo was executed by the police when they raided the apartment. She also questioned the police's decision to burn down the shack in <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> since it was crucial for the investigation and probably contained the fingerprints of the murderers.|$|E
25|$|Spanish explorers {{traveling}} inland in the 16th century met Mississippian culture {{people at}} Joara, a regional chiefdom near present-day Morganton. Records of Hernando de Soto attested to {{his meeting with}} them in 1540. In 1567 Captain Juan Pardo led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed Cuenca. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena</b> on Parris Island, South Carolina, then a center of Spanish Florida. In the spring of 1568, natives killed {{all but one of}} the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and archaeological findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the press in 2014, Serafín and Martínez Salinas gave their versions of the story and proclaimed their innocence. Serafín stated that the Federal Judicial Police commander Juan Benítez Ayala found Serafín guilty because he was related to Elio and Ovidio. He said he was not arrested at the ranch, but rather at Elio's in-law's house in Matamoros. He said he grew up in Houston and moved to Brownsville for college, and that he was in Matamoros visiting his family when he was taken by the police. Serafín said he had been tortured by the Mexican and U.S. police in Matamoros to confess his participation in Kilroy's murder and in the killings at <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena.</b> He said he was allegedly beaten and told that he and his family would be killed if he spoke English during his declaration. He said he was a student of Texas Southmost College and knew who Aldrete was, but had not a relationship with her. Serafín also stated that he had never met Constanzo and had no idea his family ranch was a gathering place for his cult. He said that he had never dug up the bodies and had been taken to the ranch after the bodies were already exhumed.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} {{municipality}} is basically flat, {{with a number of}} small ponds and lakes such as <b>Santa</b> <b>Elena,</b> San Clemente, Hierbabuena, La Soledad, El Toril, Los Árboles, San Jacinto, Cuendo, La Redonda, La Gorupa and Pasteje. There are also fresh water springs such as Las Fuentes, which supplies the municipal seat with its potable water. In areas without springs or ponds, there are wells, the largest of which is called Mavaro at the Lic. Andres Molina Enriquez Technical School. The climate is classified as temperate and semi humid with rains in the summer. The average annual temperature is 13.2°C, with high reaching about 31°C and lows to 4°C. There can be frosts in late December and early January with the occasional snow, especially on the volcano. Tree species in the area include pine, oyamel, holm oak, cedar, eucalyptus and willow, but most trees are located on the volcano. The valley area is mostly farmland with some areas of grass, nopal cactus and other arid area plants. There are a large number of wild herbs, many of which are used for cooking and medicine. Most flowers in the area are cultivated. Wildlife includes rabbits, coyotes, bobcats, skunks, opossum, armadillos, squirrels, bats and foxes. Bodies of water often contains carp.|$|E
