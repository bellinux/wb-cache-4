5000|$|The 4L60-E {{family of}} {{transmissions}} use 2 shift solenoids, initially called <b>Shift</b> <b>Solenoid</b> A & <b>Shift</b> <b>Solenoid</b> B, later changed {{to comply with}} OBD II (On Board Diagnostics revision 2) regulations to 1-2 <b>Shift</b> <b>Solenoid</b> & 2-3 <b>Shift</b> <b>solenoid.</b> By activating and deactivating the solenoids in a predetermined pattern by the PCM, 4 distinct gear ratios can be achieved. The <b>shift</b> <b>solenoid</b> pattern, also {{sometimes referred to as}} solenoid firing order, is as follows; ...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 1987 G4A-EL {{included three}} <b>shift</b> <b>solenoids,</b> a lockup solenoid, a vane-type pump, and a throttle cable. It was redesigned for 1988 {{and used in}} the Ford Probe the next year under the 4EAT-G name by Ford.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{electronic}} {{automatic transmissions}} are still fundamentally hydraulic. This requires precise pressure control. Older automatic transmission designs only use {{a single line}} pressure control solenoid which modifies pressure across the entire transmission. Newer automatic transmission designs often use many pressure control solenoids, and sometimes allow the <b>shift</b> <b>solenoids</b> themselves to provide precise pressure control during shifts by ramping the solenoid on and off. The shift pressure affects the shift quality (too high a pressure will result in rough shifting; too low a pressure will cause the clutches to overheat) and shift speed.|$|R
50|$|Common {{issues with}} the TK {{throughout}} the model run were Holden's use of an unusual all-plastic thermostat housing design on the engine, which could fail and split apart due to repeated stress and heat cycles. The ABS system is known for electrical faults and failure of the ABS system to operate if the warning light illuminates. Front tire wear was high in the early 2006 models due to factory suspension camber settings, which were revised by 2008. Automatic transmission TK cars were also {{the subject of a}} recall due to internal <b>shift</b> <b>solenoids</b> not allowing the car to shift higher than 3rd gear.|$|R
50|$|This input {{is used to}} {{determine}} whether to activate the <b>shift</b> lock <b>solenoid</b> to prevent the driver selecting a driving range with no foot on the brake. In more modern TCUs this input is also used {{to determine}} whether to downshift the transmission to increase engine braking effect if the transmission detects that the vehicle is going downhill.|$|R
40|$|We {{focus on}} the irreducibility of wavelet representations. We present some {{connections}} between the following notions: covariant wavelet representations, ergodic <b>shifts</b> on <b>solenoids,</b> fixed points of transfer (Ruelle) operators and solutions of refinement equations. We investigate the irreducibility of the wavelet representations, in particular the representation associated to the Cantor set, introduced in [13], and we present several equivalent formulations of the problem...|$|R
40|$|Results {{of studies}} and {{simulation}} of a cooler with helical magnetic field and emittance exchange proposed in [1] are presented. Investigation of transverse and longitudinal nonlinear e#ects is performed {{and used for}} a choice of the cooling channel parameters. The main solenoid of 72 m length has field strength 5 T. Transverse helical field has amplitude 0. 3 T and period 1. 8 m. A possibility to generate this field {{by means of an}} inclination or <b>shift</b> of the <b>solenoid</b> sections is considered. With LiH wedge absorbers the cooler provides decrease of longitudinal emittance by factor 0. 87. Transmission reaches 83 % being 10 % less in comparison with the same channel without emittance exchange. Longitudinal perturbation due to transverse magnetic field is responsible for this degradation. A possibility to weaken this e#ect by entering of energy-transverse momentum correlation in the beam is discussed. 1 Introduction Complete linear theory of ionization cooling on spiral orbit is pr [...] ...|$|R
