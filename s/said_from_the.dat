5|$|Beshear faced heavy {{deficits in}} polls against McConnell {{throughout}} {{the general election}} campaign. McConnell also raised twice {{as much money as}} Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell <b>said,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the five}} {{required}} daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims {{are not the}} majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (adhan), although {{it is supposed to}} be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan as it is a recommended practice or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> minaret even if a mosque has one.|$|E
500|$|Yomiuri Giants club {{representative}} Hidetoshi Kiyotake {{has expressed}} dislike of the system, because it enables Major League Baseball to poach players from Japan. By using the posting system, he says, Japanese teams {{make a profit}} in the short term, but by allowing Japan's best players {{to be sold to}} MLB, NPB teams and Japanese baseball suffer in the longer term. When Giants pitcher Koji Uehara asked to be posted in 2005, Kiyotake denied his request, saying: [...] "We don't recognize the posting system. I've <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning that this is out of the question." ...|$|E

500|$|Calle 13 {{once again}} became {{the subject of}} debate when the duo {{traveled}} to Cuba in March 2010, to perform in front of the American embassy in the country. Before the show, a political prisoner had died in a hunger strike in protest of the Cuban government, and Cuban exiles in Miami criticized the group for performing at such a time. Residente defended the performance, noting that it had been inaccurately reported and that [...] "we said things that no artist had <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stage, like 'here the people are in charge, and the government has to obey.'" [...] These events had a major impact on Residente's lyrical style and the subjects he planned to discuss on the new album: [...] "What's making me more mature is not about my age, it's about what I'm seeing and living. I'm not saying things carelessly anymore. I'm thinking before I say them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lack of {{an interim}} report upset some Synod fathers. [...] The small groups, which include lay men and women, elected their own chairmen and moderators.

2500|$|William Stevenson, who {{had access}} to the Royal Court and the Royal Family, wrote the {{biography}} The Revolutionary King in 2001. An article in Time said the idea for the book was suggested by Bhumibol. Critics noted that the book displayed intimate knowledge about personal aspects of Bhumibol. However, the book was unofficially banned in Thailand and the Bureau of the Royal Household warned the Thai media about even referring to it in print. An official ban was not possible as it was written with Bhumibol's blessing. The book was criticised for factual inaccuracies, disrespecting Bhumibol (it refers to him by his personal nickname [...] "Lek"), and proposing a controversial theory explaining the mysterious death of King Ananda. Stevenson said: [...] "The king <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning the book would be dangerous for him and for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 Navetta and Lombardo joined Stevenson for {{a reunion}} {{performance}} by the Descendents' original power trio lineup at Stevenson's Stockage festival in Fort Collins, Colorado. According to Lombardo, they also recorded some songs for a potential future release: [...] "We recorded some of my songs in 2006 at The Blasting Room. In 2002 we recorded {{a whole bunch of}} songs, mostly Frank's songs. He was a great songwriter. He had such a unique EQ out of his amp. When we recorded later in 2008, we did some more of my songs, but Frank wasn't there for that. We tried to recreate that unique Frank sound. I'd like to think of these as songs that if the Descendents had stayed together, this is what we would have sounded like. Those are in Bill's hands. Milo has <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> get-go that he would record it, but he hasn't yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even before {{translation}} of the Book of Mormon was completed, Smith and Cowdery began baptizing several converts to the new faith [...] These adherents referred to themselves as the Church of Christ ( [...] ; [...] ). In June 1829, in response to concerns by Cowdery, Smith dictated a revelation commanding Cowdery to [...] "build up my church", based upon the theological principles Smith had been dictating, he <b>said,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> golden plates [...] Possibly in conformance with this revelation, some time later in 1829 Cowdery said he received his own revelation, called the Articles of the Church of Christ, about [...] "how he should build up his church & the manner thereof" [...] Cowdery was described in his revelation as [...] "an Apostle of Jesus Christ" [...] Similarly, several of the other Twelve Witnesses to the Book of Mormon were described by people of the Palmyra area as [...] "apostles" [...] or [...] "elders" [...] in this new faith, and beginning in August 1829 {{some of them were}} given missions to preach the gospel.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Buemi revealed he attempted to brake as late as possible to prevent Vergne from overtaking him {{at the start of}} the race but had used more electrical energy than expected when he established an advantage. He stated that he lost some time under full course yellow conditions but when Vergne retired, he [...] "was having a nice time, as he was putting me under pressure." [...] Buemi believed the victory would not have happened if his team had not made repairs to his car's powertrain in their technical headquarters in Viry-Châtillon. However he felt his team deserved the victory more than him due to them overcoming the preceding year's problems with track conditions. López <b>said</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the season, his car was good, but was not yet experienced enough to be competitive. However, he stated his team [...] "worked hard" [...] in the event at a track which he liked and felt it played a role in his second-place result. Third-place finisher Heidfeld stated it felt [...] "great" [...] to have achieved his second consecutive podium result, and that it was [...] "another exciting race", and his team were more competitive than they were in Monaco. He said it was [...] "a great result" [...] for Mahindra, and that they would not stop until they had achieved their objective of securing their first victory.|$|E
