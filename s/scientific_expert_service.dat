40|$|<b>Expert</b> <b>Services</b> like consulting, legal {{advisory}} {{and software}} design {{play a significant}} and growing role in the developed economies. In operations management (OM), the term “Professional Services” is frequently {{used to refer to}} these offerings. The literature on <b>Expert</b> <b>Services</b> proposes that these services are different from other types of services and require a different OM approach. However, recent empirical research calls into question some of the OM assumptions about <b>Expert</b> <b>Services</b> and their delivery processes. Some empirical and theoretical studies also suggest that individuals’ expertise is fundamental to making these delivery processes more efficient and effective. For these reasons, operations management researchers are calling for more robust models to explain the nature of <b>Expert</b> <b>Services.</b> This thesis therefore focuses on understanding <b>Expert</b> <b>Services</b> delivery processes and explores in detail the role individuals’ expertise plays in them. To reach its goals, this PhD by publication uses evidence from three <b>Expert</b> <b>Service</b> providers to compose three papers that contribute towards a better understanding of these service delivery processes. The three papers deal, respectively, with the characteristics of <b>Expert</b> <b>Services</b> delivery processes, with the nature and implications of customer involvement in the delivery process and with the development of new <b>expert</b> <b>services.</b> Combined, the insights from the three papers draw attention to the managerial implications of having expertise as a key productive resource. The outcomes of the papers also create means to refine and revisit OM concepts in relation to how <b>Expert</b> <b>Services</b> are developed and delivered. This research therefore contributes to the OM knowledge of <b>Expert</b> <b>Services,</b> addressing some of the recent calls for research in the area. This thesis also sets out an agenda for future research that can further increase our understanding of these offerings and create means to improve their delivery processes...|$|R

40|$|Policies and {{management}} for the Wadden Sea, like {{for so many}} other nature areas, {{have to find a}} balance between important natural values {{on the one hand and}} economic functions on the other hand. <b>Scientific</b> <b>experts</b> play an important role in these processes. In the case of the Wadden Sea, <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> have been involved in the development of trilateral ecological targets for the Wadden Sea as well as in the implementation of these targets in the Netherlands as took place in the controversial decision making processes regarding cockle fisheries and gas mining. Drawing on concepts and insights from policy analysis and science and technology studies, this article analyses the different roles <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> play in these policy processes. We show how the role of science shifts from an accommodating role in policy development to a role as advocacy in controversial policy implementation processes. The article concludes with some implications for organising effective science¿policy interactions in the field of nature conservation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{international}} standard-setting. Using the HACCP food safety standard {{as the basis}} of discussion, this paper considers the influence of <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> on the regulatory process. What is usually referred to as the diffusion or dissemination of soft or voluntary standards is here explained in terms of transferability of a regulatory concept. It is the ability of <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> to transform practices into a universal concept and, conversely, to develop technologies for users which translate the concept into practice, that explains why this reference has travelled so well across countries, industry sectors and historical periods. <b>Scientific</b> <b>experts</b> played a translating role between standard-setters and groups of practical users. This highlights the counter-intuitive distribution of power in standard-setting: while experts dominate the development of generic rules, official rule-makers (such as governments) assert their authority by developing alternative technologies for the appropriation of the standard by users and, sometimes, allow the latter to deviate from experts' universal concepts where these are shown to be problematic...|$|R

However, the GPS data processing field heavily relies on foreign-produced software and there is almost no development of user-oriented technology. Therefore, in this study, it was attempted to build an <b>expert</b> <b>service</b> that enables non-experts to use high-precision GPS data processing. As a result, an <b>expert</b> <b>service</b> that can maximize user convenience simply by entering the minimum required information for GPS data processing was developed, and the <b>expert</b> <b>service</b> was verified by relative positioning processing of the observation data of satellite control point provided by National Geographic Information Institute and observation data obtained by GPS survey.

30|$|Generally, the {{existing}} financial mechanisms and legislature {{of a country}} do not lead to an efficiently operating expert community. We must use special approaches. International experience shows that a special type of contract is needed {{to increase the efficiency}} of expert activities, i.e., contracts for <b>expert</b> <b>services</b> and <b>expert</b> research work. The underlying {{reason for this is that}} <b>expert</b> <b>services</b> are significantly different from other services. First, an order for an <b>expert</b> <b>service</b> may appear spontaneously and rapidly. Second, there are substantially greater uncertainties in the intellectual property, effectiveness, reliability, creativity, utility, riskiness, responsibility, conscientiousness, independence, trust, emotionality, rating assignment, and so on.|$|R
