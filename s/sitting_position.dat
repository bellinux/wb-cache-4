Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E

5|$|Another {{featured}} preliminary match involved Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho in a singles match. At Backlash, Michaels defeated Batista (with Jericho as {{the special}} guest referee) in an Interpromotional match. During the match, Michaels countered a Batista Bomb attempt, a powerbomb move {{in which the}} wrestler drops into a <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> as they slam their opponent down to the mat, and appeared to have legitimately injured his left knee. On the April 28 episode of Raw, Jericho claimed that Michaels faked his knee injury {{to allow him to}} defeat Batista at Backlash, a claim that Michaels denied. The following week, it was announced that Jericho would face Michaels in a singles match at Judgment Day. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Jericho offered his apologies to Michaels for accusing him of feigning an injury, as well as giving Michaels the opportunity to back out of their match. Michaels revealed that he did indeed fake his knee injury. Four days later, on the May 16 episode of SmackDown, Batista commented that he would hurt Michaels, scripted into the storyline, for faking his injury.|$|E
5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard.

The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground through most of the ride. In the station, riders board the train sitting down. After the train is locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the <b>sitting</b> <b>position</b> for the next round of riders.|$|E

Ordinary-type wheelchairs and office chairs adjustable to postural change were utilized, and differences in sitting environments were evaluated. The results indicated that postural change activities did not significantly vary, although there were minor variations. However, office chairs had lower values of maximum sitting pressures than wheelchairs. In addition, the physical motion activities for office chairs were relatively low, indicating that the Actigraph could be useful for evaluating sitting environments...|$|R

5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a <b>sitting</b> <b>position.</b> Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on healthy human subjects to determine HR-LVET (Heart Rate-Left Ventricular Ejection Time) regression relations in different postures, including tilt, and during isometric exercise. The subjects were tested in the resting state in supine and <b>sitting</b> <b>positions,</b> during isometric handgrip in supine and <b>sitting</b> <b>positions</b> and during 70 deg headup tilt. The recordings included a bipolar electrocardiogram and a right external carotid pulse curve. Comparison of the HR-LVET relation for the conditions under analysis revealed differences among the respective regression equations, which {{can be explained by}} the well-established differences in stroke volume and ejection rate among these states. These differences appear to account for the fact that under conditions in which stroke volume variations should be the major determinant, slopes will be similar but intercepts will vary. Since substantial differences among intercepts are observed, caution should be exercised whenever the intercept factor is used to predict LVET for HR...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} autonomic heart rate (HR) modulation, under resting conditions in relation to body posture, in sedentary young adults. Methods: Twenty young healthy and sedentary men aged 22. 6 Â± 2. 5 years participated in the study. The HR and R-R intervals (in ms) of the electrocardiogram (EKG) were obtained in real time using the modified DII derivation, with the volunteers at rest in the supine and <b>sitting</b> <b>positions,</b> for 15 minutes. The R-R data were analyzed in the time domain, {{by means of the}} RMSSID, RMSM and pNN 50 (%) indices; and in the frequency domain, by means of spectral analysis and fast Fourier transforms (FFT), using low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands expressed as normalized units and as the LF/HF ratio. The statistical analysis consisted of the Spearman test for correlation analyses and the Wilcoxon test for paired samples, with significance of Î±= 5 %. Results: In the time domain, the RMSSD and pNN 50 indices demonstrated statistically significant differences between the supine and <b>sitting</b> <b>positions</b> (p 0. 05). In the frequency domain, the LF and HF bands and the LF/HF ratio demonstrated statistically significant differences between the supine and <b>sitting</b> <b>positions</b> (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The results demonstrated that by changing the posture, autonomic adjustments were produced to the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems with regard to HR control.

40|$|Background: Forward head is {{a common}} {{postural}} fault of the cervical spine that can be assessed using the photogrammetry method. This is a valid, popular and feasible clinical method. Although forward head is primarily a sagittal plane postural fault, deviations in other planes may result in measurement errors when photos are captured from only one side. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether forward head assessment by photogrammetry taken from the right (Rt) or left (Lt) sides of the body would differ. Methods: One hundred thirty two healthy adults were assessed from standing and 90 were assessed from <b>sitting</b> <b>positions.</b> In addition, 41 patients with mechanical neck pain were assessed from standing and 56 from <b>sitting</b> <b>positions.</b> Three profile photos were captured from each side in standing and <b>sitting</b> <b>positions.</b> Photos were then digitized before they were analyzed using the kinovea software to measure the craniovertebral (CVA) and gaze angles. Results: In healthy adults, the CVA was not significantly different across sides (p> 0. 05) whereas the gaze angle was different regardless of the testing position (p 0. 05), whereas the gaze angle did not differ regardless of the testing position (p > 0. 05). Conclusion: Measurement of CVA and gaze angles in sitting and standing is not consistent across sides, depending on the population tested. Assessors should be conservative and consider taking photos from both sides to assess the severity of forward head position using the photogrammetric method...|$|R
