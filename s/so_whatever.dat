5|$|The reason no {{successful}} rescue {{was ever}} effected {{lies in the}} remoteness of the Hebrides from the anglophone world in the early 18th century. No reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776. Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve {{one of their own}} is remarkable. The Kirk hierarchy, for example, made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet they could easily have done <b>so.</b> <b>Whatever</b> the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested, John Chiesley's daughter evidently did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.|$|E
25|$|After joining al Qaida, {{he became}} an {{explosives}} expert and was assigned to obtain the bomb components in Dar es Salaam according to convicted fellow Embassy bombing conspirators Mohammed Sadiq Odeh and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed. This role was {{complicated by the fact}} that Ghailani could not drive <b>so</b> <b>whatever</b> purchases were too large or heavy for his bicycle such as oxygen and acetylene tanks would have to be picked up by another person in a car. Ghailani was in Nairobi, Kenya by August 6, 1998, where he is thought to have rented a room at the Hilltop Hotel used for meetings by the bombers and flew to Karachi on a Kenya Airways flight before the bombs exploded. At some time in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he married an Uzbek and had children.|$|E
25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And <b>so</b> <b>whatever</b> shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

I am here {{to make sure that}} the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And <b>so</b> <b>whatever</b> I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic". Also In 2005, he told The New York Times that [...] "global warming exists, and we have to do something about it." ...|$|E

Some people are timeless and Aishwarya will be there for another 20 years". About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film is that I think I understand the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director.

Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of this goes back to advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so just think that one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever you want your son or daughter, or even your 13-year-old little sister to see, keep that in mind.' <b>So,</b> <b>whatever</b> I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine. These girls {{are going to have to}} explain to their kids one day why mommy's ass and vagina are all over the place." [...] Her rival Miesha Tate criticized Rousey's comments as [...] "hypocritical", arguing that Rousey's comments about ring girls constituted a double standard.|$|E
2500|$|The album has {{received}} mixed reviews from the Turkish media. Some journalists defended Tarkan saying that critics should {{be engaged in}} discussing his music rather than his dressing style, which characterized most of the publicism that appeared {{in connection with the}} release. Columnist Tuna Serim pointed out in one of her articles that there was a definite hunt for Tarkan news in the Turkish media, channels were ready to change their original schedules to feature Tarkan-related news, which are considered to be of primary importance. She also pointed out that the release of a music video is not given primary coverage in television news programmes in any country, while the release of [...] "Vay Anam vay" [...] was featured and discussed in the news programmes in Turkey. Cengiz Semercioğlu of Hürriyet thinks that there is an [...] "anti-Tarkan lobby" [...] in the domestic press, which might have resulted {{from the fact that the}} singer keeps a certain distance from the yellow press, <b>so</b> <b>whatever</b> he does, the press is going to tear into pieces with criticism. In other journalists and critics' opinion this is the worst album he has ever made, repeats himself and there is nothing original in it. There was one critic who refused to comment on the album or even to listen to it. Others do not otherstand what other critics find unacceptable in the album.|$|E

[...] "It always ends up being something completely different." [...] On October 6, 2010, Clarkson hosted an impromptu session on the social networking site Twitter to update fans regarding {{the status of the}} album. Clarkson tweeted [...] "We've almost completed the album. We're gonna have way too many songs to pick from," [...] later adding that she hoped to release it in early 2011.

She's experienced stuff, <b>so</b> <b>whatever</b> she's going through right now — fun, good, the bad, the ugly — we want to put on that record." [...] During {{an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Clarkson remarked that unlike her previous records, such as My December (2007) and her previous single, [...] "Already Gone" [...] (2009), the recorded songs for Stronger didn't manage to spark a single conflict with her label RCA Records upon the album's release; she remarked [...] "Usually on most albums, I'll fight and be like 'No, this has to be a single.' There's no real fighting on this. The label and I, we all love them." [...] Clarkson remarked that Stronger was her best album to record.
