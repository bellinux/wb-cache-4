40|$|Experimental studies {{indicate}} that laxatives may induce epithelial damage. In addition, some laxatives induce the release of prostaglandins. Epithelial cell damage and release of prostaglandins are two pathways by which epithelial cell proliferation could be influenced. Furthermore, fermentable laxatives like lactulose may influence large intestine cell proliferation by the trophic effect of the fermentation products such as short-chain fatty acids. For these reasons an in vivo study in rats was performed to compare the short- and long-term effect of sennosides, bisacodyl, <b>sodium</b> <b>picosulfate</b> and lactulose on epithelial cell proliferation in the ileum and large intestine. Cell proliferation was examined by the BrdUrd labelling technique after 2, 6 and 12 weeks of continuous treatment. Studies in control animals show that the Labeling Index (LI) is higher in the cecum compared with other segments of the colon, and higher in the ileum than in the colon. Treatment with sennosides, bisacodyl and <b>sodium</b> <b>picosulfate</b> does not influence the LI in the ileum and induces no statistically significant increase of the LI when the treated groups are compared with the control group. The proliferative pattern along the crypts remains unchanged with all the laxatives throughout the study.

The most commonly involved potentially inappropriate medications were zopiclone, digoxin and <b>sodium</b> <b>picosulfate.</b> There was an association seen between having a higher number of medications prescribed and having one or more potentially inappropriate medication. Conclusion Potentially inappropriate medications are prevalent among older people with cognitive impairment living in Northern Sweden. It is important to continuously evaluate the need for potentially inappropriate medications in this patient group, in order to prevent adverse drug reactions, especially among those who have a higher number of medications prescribed...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to {{evaluate}} the laxative effects of fermented rice extract (FRe) on rats with loperamide-induced constipation. FRe (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) was administered orally once per day for six days following 1 h loperamide treatment. The laxative effects of FRe were compared with those of <b>sodium</b> <b>picosulfate</b> (S. picosulfate). Following the induction of constipation in the rats, a marked decrease was observed in the fecal pellet number and water content discharged over 24 h, the surface mucus thickness in the colonic lumen, intestinal charcoal transit ratio, thickness of the colonic mucosa and the number of mucus-producing cells, while an increase was observed in the number of fecal pellets remaining in the colonic lumen and their mean diameter, as compared with the normal vehicle control rats. These condi-tions were significantly alleviated following the administration of the three doses of FRe when compared with the loperamide control group. However, the alleviating effects were lower than those of S. picosulfate, with the exception of the intestinal charcoal transit ratio. Similar effects on the intestinal charcoal transit ratio were detected for the three doses of FRe when compared with the S. picosulfate-treated rats. In conclusion, the results indicated that FRe exhibits a laxative effect without causing diarrhea, as compared with sodium picosulfate; thus, FRe may be effective as a complementary medicine in patients suffering from lifestyle-induced constipation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The ideal {{preparation}} regimen for pediatric colonoscopy remains elusive, {{and available}} preparations continue {{to represent a}} challenge for children. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and acceptance of 4 methods of bowel cleansing before colonoscopy in children. METHODS: This randomized, investigator-blinded, noninferiority trial enrolled all children aged 2 to 18 years undergoing elective colonoscopy in a referral center for pediatric gastroenterology. Patients were randomly assigned to receive polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 with simethicon (PEG-ELS group) or PEG- 4000 with citrates and simethicone plus bisacodyl (PEG-CS+Bisacodyl group), or PEG 3350 with ascorbic acid (PEG-Asc group), or <b>sodium</b> <b>picosulfate</b> plus magnesium oxide and citric acid (NaPico+MgCit group). Bowel cleansing was evaluated according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale. The primary end point was overall colon cleansing. Tolerability, acceptability, and compliance were also evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients were randomly allocated to the 4 groups. In the per-protocol analysis, PEG-CS+Bisacodyl, PEG-Asc, and NaPico+MgCit were noninferior to PEG-ELS in bowel-cleansing efficacy of both the whole colon (P =. 910) and colonic segments. No serious adverse events occurred in any group. Rates of tolerability, acceptability, and compliance were significantly higher in the NaPico+MgCit group. CONCLUSIONS: Low-volume PEG preparations (PEG-CS+Bisacodyl, PEG-Asc) and NaPico+MgCit are noninferior to PEG-ELS in children, representing an attractive alternative to high-volume regimens in clinical practice. Because of the higher tolerability and acceptability profile, NaPico+MgCit would appear as the most suitable regimen for bowel preparation in children.

40|$|The author {{presents}} an improved {{method of preparation}} for colonoscopy that involved no dietary limitation on the patient until {{the day of the}} examination and that was shown by a randomized questionnaire evaluation to earn good patient tolerance and acceptance. Patients were given 10 mg of cisapride and 75 mg of <b>sodium</b> <b>picosulfate</b> before sleep on the day preceding the examination, and 50 g of magnesium citrate powder (MP) in 1, 200 mL lukewarm water before the examination. It was divided into 600 -mL portions and ingested slowly during two 30 -minute periods. Ninety-five percent of patients classified the taste of a magnesium citrate powder laxative as palatable in the questionnaire given immediately after the procedure. Concerning the quantity, 79. 4 % replied that it was tolerable, 17. 3 % considered it somewhat excessive, and 3. 3 % replied that it was barely tolerable. No patient classified it as intolerable. Symptoms after taking laxatives and lukewarm water such as abdominal pain, nausea and abdominal fullness were observed in 3. 8 %, 4. 4 % and 5. 6 %, respectively, whereas there were no symptoms in 79 % of patients. Body weight and serum K level showed a tendency to decrease, whereas the serum Mg level showed an increase before and after colonoscopy. The quality of colonic cleansing evaluated by colonoscopy was excellent, good, or fair in a total of 93. 3 %. No adverse effects were observed. It was concluded that this method is a clinically beneficial and well-tolerated preparation for colonic examinations. KEY WORDS: colonoscopy, colon preparation, no dietary restrictio...|$|E

Although rare, hypermagnesemia has been reported in patients consuming Mg 2 +-containing cathartics, especially patients who are elderly and have renal impairment. Methods: Data were analyzed from two prospective, Phase III, randomized, assessor-blinded, active-control, multicenter, pivotal studies that investigated split-dose/day-before P/MC. Serum Mg 2 + and creatinine clearance (CrCl) were measured at screening, on the day of colonoscopy, and 24 – 48 hours, 7 days, and 4 weeks after colonoscopy; electrocardiograms also were obtained at these time points. Results: In total, 304 patients received split-dose P/MC and 294 patients received day-before P/MC. Only 10 % of the patients had serum Mg 2 + above the upper limit of normal (1. 05 mmol/L) on the day of colonoscopy. There was a slight inverse correlation between CrCl and Mg 2 + levels on the day of colonoscopy; however, even at the lowest CrCl, serum Mg 2 + remained below clinically significant levels of 2. 0 mmol/L. Increases in serum Mg 2 + were transient, with levels returning to baseline within 24 – 48 hours, regardless of renal function. No patients with elevated Mg 2 + experienced a corrected QT (QTc) interval > 500 milliseconds or a QTc interval increase of ≥ 60 milliseconds from baseline. P/MC had no impact on PR or QRS interval. Conclusion: P/MC produces little impact on serum Mg 2 + levels with no clinically significant effect on cardiac conduction in patients, including those with mild-to-moderate renal impairment.
