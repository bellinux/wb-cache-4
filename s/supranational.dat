5|$|It {{would create}} the world's first <b>supranational</b> institution.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years passed}} {{between the first}} {{publication}} of Scouting for Boys {{and the creation of}} the current largest <b>supranational</b> Scout organization, WOSM, and millions of copies had been sold in dozens of languages. By that point, Scouting was the purview of the world's youth, and several Scout associations had already formed in many countries.|$|E
5|$|The Authority's {{principal}} innovation was its <b>supranational</b> character. It had a broad area {{of competence}} to ensure {{the objectives of the}} treaty were met and that the common market functioned smoothly. The High Authority could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods were left to member states; and Opinions, which had no legal force.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian Commission was {{established}} as the <b>supranational</b> governing {{body of the}} Eurasian Economic Space on 1 January 2012. The Commission was modelled on the European Commission. Its headquarters are in Moscow. The commission monitors subordinate branches and advisory bodies. Its departments were greatly expanded on 1 January 2015, {{and the number of}} international employees increased from 150 to 1,200.|$|E
5|$|The European Commission {{derives from}} one of the five key {{institutions}} created in the <b>supranational</b> European Community system, following the proposal of Robert Schuman, French Foreign Minister, on 9 May 1950. Originating in 1951 as the High Authority in the European Coal and Steel Community, the Commission has undergone numerous changes in power and composition under various presidents, involving three Communities.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Council has been characterised by the rise in power of the Parliament, with which the Council has had to share its legislative powers. The Parliament has often provided opposition to the Council's wishes. This has in some cases led to clashes between both bodies with the Council's system of intergovernmentalism contradicting the developing parliamentary system and <b>supranational</b> principles.|$|E
5|$|The {{union of}} Russia and Belarus, a <b>supranational</b> confederation, was {{established}} in a 1996–99 series of treaties that called for monetary union, equal rights, single citizenship, and a common foreign and defense policy. However, {{the future of the}} union has been placed in doubt because of Belarus's repeated delays of monetary union, the lack of a referendum date for the draft constitution, and a dispute over the petroleum trade.|$|E
5|$|By March 1962, the trilateral {{talks in}} Geneva had shifted to 18-party talks at the UN Disarmament Conference. On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international supervision, and required on-site inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without supervision by a <b>supranational</b> body.|$|E
5|$|The Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 (later {{known as}} Europe Day) {{occurred}} after two Cabinet meetings, when the proposal became French government policy. France was thus the first government {{to agree to}} surrender sovereignty in a <b>supranational</b> Community. That decision {{was based on a}} text, written and edited by Schuman's friend and colleague, the Foreign Ministry lawyer, professor Paul Reuter with the assistance of economist Jean Monnet and Schuman's Directeur de Cabinet, Bernard Clappier. It laid out a plan for a European Community to pool the coal and steel of its members in a common market.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{selling point}} of Front Mission was its {{storytelling}} approach. Taking {{place during the}} 21st and 22nd centuries, the series revolves around military conflicts and political tension between powerful <b>supranational</b> unions and their member states. Although the Front Mission video games use self-contained, standalone stories, these tie into a greater overarching storyline that encompasses the entire series. In combination with the stories from its other media, the series possesses a level of storytelling depth and continuity comparable to a serial drama.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to <b>supranational</b> organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|The European Council officially {{gained the}} status of an EU {{institution}} after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, distinct from the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers). Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in Paris and Bonn respectively). They were informal summits {{of the leaders of}} the European Community, and were started due to then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of <b>supranational</b> institutions (e.g. the European Commission) over the integration process, but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the Hague summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the European Political Cooperation) taking integration beyond economics.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} {{is listed}} on Annex 1 (Highly Migratory Species) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and on Annex 1 of the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS; {{also known as}} the Bonn Convention) Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding. This species benefits from bans on shark finning instituted by several nations and <b>supranational</b> entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Although the Animals Committee of the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. In March 2013, the porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of CITES, allowing for increased regulation in the international trade of this species.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Switzerland {{became a}} full {{member of the}} United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely {{recognised}} state without full UN membership. Switzerland is {{a founding member of}} the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter <b>supranational</b> bodies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{degree of}} {{self-regulation}} occurs whereby {{banks and other}} financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral {{organizations such as the}} International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of <b>supranational</b> financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E
5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a <b>supranational</b> Community.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{separate}} <b>supranational</b> groupings of countries exist, and membership {{in some of}} these groupings may involve multinational agreements and treaties in which member countries agree to some degree of reciprocity regarding voting rights. Some individual countries are members of more than one <b>supranational</b> groupings, and some <b>supranational</b> groupings of countries are members of other <b>supranational</b> groupings of countries.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{operates}} {{through a}} hybrid system of <b>supranational</b> and intergovernmental decision-making.|$|E
25|$|Condolences, {{expressions}} of shock, support, solidarity and sympathy were offered by many national governments and <b>supranational</b> bodies.|$|E
25|$|International law {{can refer}} to three things: public {{international}} law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of <b>supranational</b> organisations.|$|E
25|$|Various {{states and}} <b>supranational</b> bodies have {{condemned}} {{the use of}} military and mercenaries against Libyan civilians during the Libyan Civil War, an allegation that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi denies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market and international finance, a world currency, <b>supranational</b> currency, or global currency refers to a currency that is transacted internationally, with no set borders.|$|E
25|$|European social-democrats {{strongly}} support Europeanism and <b>supranational</b> integration, {{although there is}} a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this left-wing nationalism to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by free-trade agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards <b>supranational</b> organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.|$|E
25|$|The Commission is {{increasingly}} working together towards common objectives. Some 20 per {{cent of the}} funds managed by ESA now originate from the <b>supranational</b> budget of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of India {{maintains}} an ongoing {{dialogue with the}} <b>supranational</b> Institutions of the European Union which is separate from the bilateral relations with sovereign member States of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{globalization}} {{may ultimately}} reduce {{the importance of}} nation states. <b>Supranational</b> {{institutions such as the}} European Union, the WTO, the G8 or the International Criminal Court replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.|$|E
25|$|Leaderships of 49 {{countries}} and five <b>supranational</b> bodies expressed abhorrence {{of the attack}} and condolences for families and for France. US President Barack Obama labelled the attack as possible terrorism, as did German Chancellor Angela Merkel.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{founding}} member of the Mercosur block, having Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela as partners. Since 2002 the country has emphasized its key role in Latin American integration, and the block—which has some <b>supranational</b> legislative functions—is its first international priority.|$|E
25|$|Fascism in {{the early}} 1920s was {{influenced}} by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and <b>supranational,</b> rational and anti-rational. Fascism was founded during World War I by Italian national syndicalists who drew upon left-wing organizational tactics and right-wing political views.|$|E
25|$|The CIS has few <b>supranational</b> powers but aims to be {{more than}} a purely {{symbolic}} organization, nominally possessing coordinating powers in the realms of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security. It has also promoted cooperation on cross-border crime prevention. Furthermore, eight of the nine CIS member states participate in the CIS Free Trade Area. Three organizations are under the overview of the CIS, namely the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Union (alongside subdivisions, the Eurasian Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Space, which comprises territory inhabited by over 180 million people), and the Union State. While the first and the second are military and economic alliances, the third aims to reach a <b>supranational</b> union of Russia and Belarus with a common government, flag, currency, etc.|$|E
25|$|This {{important}} {{case law}} appears {{to confirm the}} role of the EC as centralised regulator to European nation-states as regards air pollution control. It places a <b>supranational</b> legal obligation on the UK to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution, furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} {{speakers}} is given first to member states, then observer states and <b>supranational</b> bodies. Any other observers entities {{will have a}} chance to speak at the end of the debate, if they so choose. Speakers will be put on the list in the order of their request, with special consideration for ministers and other government officials of similar or higher rank. According to the rules in place for the General Debate, the statements should be in one of the United Nations official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and will be translated by the United Nations translators. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to facilitate translation and to be presented at the podium. Speeches are requested to be limited to five minutes, with seven minutes for <b>supranational</b> bodies.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, {{tensions}} {{began to}} show, with France seeking to limit <b>supranational</b> power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an {{agreement was reached}} and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively {{referred to as the}} European Communities. Jean Rey presided over the first merged Commission (Rey Commission).|$|E
25|$|Evidently, India {{was facing}} an {{economic}} crisis. At this point, {{the government of}} India sought funds from the <b>supranational</b> International Monetary Fund, which, while assisting India financially, imposed several conditions regarding India's economic policy. In effect, IMF-dictated policy meant that the ubiquitous Licence Raj had to be dismantled, and India's attempt at a state-controlled economy had to end.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrorist}} attack in Burgas, Bulgaria, was denounced by governments and <b>supranational</b> organizations worldwide. Bulgaria's EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva expressed her shock and sadness; Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and conveyed his condolences over the attack; Foreign Minister Nikolay Mladenov condemned the attack {{but said that}} it would be a mistake to prematurely jump to conclusions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} variations of the idea, including a possibility {{that it would be}} administered by a global central bank that would define its own monetary standard or that it would be on the gold standard. Supporters often point to the euro {{as an example of a}} <b>supranational</b> currency successfully implemented by a union of nations with disparate languages, cultures, and economies.|$|E
