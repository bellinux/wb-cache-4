In this work, the charge separation and recombination in single ZnO In 2 S 3 and In 2 <b>S</b> 3 CuSCN <b>interfaces</b> {{as well as}} the complete ZnO In 2 S 3 CuSCN structure were studied by time resolved microwave photoconductivity. Photoconductivity transients were measured for different thicknesses of the In 2 S 3 light absorbing layer, under variation in the exciting light flux and before and after annealing of the ZnO nanorods at 450 C.

This paper demonstrates how an XML-based ADL (xADL 2. 0) can be extended to model detailed, meaningful interface specifications, and is used as part of a simple prototype to demonstrate how they form an integral part of an architectural description, paying particular attention to interface-level constraints.

Lehrstuhl für KommunikationsnetzeWithin the {{continuous}} evolution of wireless communications, new and ambitious requirements are {{planned to be}} met by next generation of mobile communications. In order to achieve those requirements, new technologies and mechanisms that work well over broadband frequency, like OFDM and OFDMA, need to be investigated, developed and tested in simulators. New cellular systems designs are based on exploiting instantaneous channel conditions, improving the system performance. Due to this, system level simulations must support a Physical Layer (PHY) abstraction which accurately predicts the instantaneous performance of the link layer. In order to accomplish this, a new link-to-system (L 2 <b>S)</b> <b>interface</b> has been developed and implemented in OpenWNS, a system level simulator for evaluation of OFDM systems developed at RWTH, Aachen. This interface is mainly realized {{through a set of}} mapping mechanisms, used to provide a BLER given a received coded block SINR.

40|$|International audienceThe CIGSe/In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>interface</b> {{is known}} to be highly diffuse because of the {{migration}} of Cu from the CIGSe into the In 2 S 3. Most of the analytical techniques allowing the determination of composition profiles throughout this interface involve ion etching either during the samples preparation or during data acquisitions. In the present work, we have explored the potential of the Raman scattering for the characterization of such interfaces. This technique is non destructive and provides information on both the composition and the structure of the materials that are probed. Three CIGSe/In 2 S 3 structures have been investigated; the parameter varying being the substrate temperature during the In 2 S 3 deposition. For the first time we could demonstrate that at high temperature, the CuInS 2 Cu-Au phase is formed at the CIGSe/In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>interface.</b> Furthermore, the thickness of the ordered defect compound at the CIGSe surface increases with the deposition temperature.

The Chlorobium spp. and T. roseopersicina were found throughout the anoxic water, which ranged in temperature from - 0. 5 C to - 2. 2 C, but did not form discrete layers at the O 2 and H 2 <b>S</b> <b>interface.</b> The growth zone, however, of the Chlorobium spp. was delineated by the presence of light and H 2 S and was restricted to less than 3 m below the O 2 and H 2 <b>S</b> <b>interface.</b> R. palustris was found in oxic and anoxic water.
