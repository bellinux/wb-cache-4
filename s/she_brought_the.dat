Samus describes the events of her , and how she encountered a Metroid larva, which hatched from an egg and immediately imprinted upon her, believing her to be its mother. <b>She</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> larva to Ceres Space Colony, where scientists believed that they could harness its power. Just after she left the colony, she received a distress call and returned to find the scientists dead and the larva stolen by Ridley—the leader of the Space Pirates. Samus escapes from the space colony when its self-destruct sequence is activated, and follows Ridley to the planet Zebes. There, she searches for the stolen larva in a network of caves, and finds that the Space Pirates rebuilt and expanded their base on Zebes.|$|E

25|$|With {{a common}} enemy, Guerrero began {{accompanying}} LayCool, interfering in their matches and favoring them in scripted booking decisions such as making herself the referee in McCool's Women's Championship rematch with James where <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> title back to McCool. With James {{out of the}} picture, their lingering rivalry with Phoenix flared up when Phoenix saved Tiffany from a LayCool beatdown on March 12. The following week, Tiffany and Phoenix defeated LayCool in a standard tag match. This led to a 10 Diva Tag Team match at WrestleMania XXVI which LayCool helped win after Guerrero pinned Kelly Kelly with a Frog Splash. Phoenix gained revenge by defeating them again alongside Tiffany. On WWE Superstars, LayCool and Guerrero cut a promo in which they mocked Phoenix for not fitting their image of what a Diva should be, and Guerrero placed Phoenix in an 'intergender' match against Layla, which Phoenix won, despite heavy interfering from McCool and Guerrero. LayCool later gained a measure of revenge by defeating Phoenix and a briefly returned James, after which they taunted Phoenix's perceived bad looks by smothering her in make-up. At the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, McCool defended her Women's Championship against Phoenix in an Extreme Makeover match, where cosmetics products were legal as weapons. Phoenix won the title from McCool despite support from Layla and Guerrero.|$|E

500|$|Marshall's wife, Lois, {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in charitable activities in Washington and spent considerable time working at the Diet Kitchen Welfare Center providing free meals to impoverished children. In 1917 she became acquainted with a mother of newborn twins, {{one of whom was}} chronically ill. The child's parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son's condition. Lois formed a close bond with the baby, who was named Clarence Ignatius Morrison, and offered to take him and help him find treatment. She and Marshall had been unable to have children, and when <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> baby home, Marshall told that she could [...] "keep him, provided he did not squall". Marshall grew to love the boy and wrote that he [...] "never walked the streets of Washington with as sure a certainty as he walked into my heart", and, as the boy grew older, that he was [...] "beautiful as an angel; brilliant beyond his years; lovable from every standpoint".|$|E
500|$|In 1886 {{she became}} the {{director}} of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, in which her father had served on the board as vice president for years. It was the country's largest art school for women, where she was, according to Henry Adams, [...] "a pioneering advocate of advanced education for women." [...] Sartain implemented life-drawing classes at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, using draped male and nude women models, which was uncommon for women artists at the time. She created a professional program that was built upon technical and lengthy training and high standards. The women were taught to create works of art based upon three-dimensional and human forms. She trained women who taught art. Through her efforts, <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> level of instruction at the school to that of a French academy and {{similar to that of the}} Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Industrial design schools for women were often considered purveyors of lower forms of art, but Sartain believed that good art was defined more by the artist's capabilities than the medium and that the same aesthetic principles used to judge fine art could be applied to commercial art. She was responsible for introducing important faculty members such as Robert Henri, Samuel Murray and Daniel Garber to the school. Sartain was an established, national authority on art education and art for women by 1890.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "If you had to pick one defining moment, {{it would have to}} be Beyoncé’s baby bump.

[...] A critic of Essence magazine concluded that [...] " [...] performance of 'Love on Top' at the 2011 VMAs [...] will surely be one of the year's most memorable pop culture moments."

To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.

2500|$|Ballet {{began in}} 15th-century Renaissance Italy. [...] The foot {{positions}} and steps {{that make up}} classic ballet were created by Renaissance dance masters in the 1400s. [...] Wealthy Italian nobles staged elaborate court dances to celebrate events such as weddings or the birth of an heir. The choreographers of these Renaissance spectacles became known as ballet masters. One of the earliest ballet masters, Domenico da Piacenza, wrote dance manuals describing the steps, with diagrams of the figures and patterns created by the movements, which allowed the dances to be recreated in other courts throughout Europe. [...] He used the word [...] "ballo", the Italian word for dance, to describe his choreography.

2500|$|The Mishnah (following [...] ) {{taught that}} a sin-offering {{of a bird}} preceded a burnt-offering of a bird; and the priest also {{dedicated}} them in that order. Rabbi Eliezer taught that wherever an offerer (because of poverty) substituted for an animal sin-offering the offering of two birds (one of which was for a sin-offering {{and the other for}} a burnt-offering), the priest sacrificed the bird sin-offering before the bird burnt-offering (as [...] instructs). But {{in the case of a}} woman after childbirth discussed in [...] (where a poor new mother could substitute for an animal burnt-offering two birds, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering), the bird burnt-offering took precedence over the bird sin-offering. Wherever the offering came on account of sin, the sin-offering took precedence. But here (in the case of a woman after childbirth, where the sin-offering was not on account of sin) the burnt-offering took precedence. And wherever both birds came instead of one animal sin-offering, the sin-offering took precedence. But here (in the case of a woman after childbirth) they did not both come on account of a sin-offering (for in poverty she substituted a bird burnt-offering for an animal burnt-offering, as [...] required her to bring a bird sin-offering in any case), the burnt-offering took precedence. (The Gemara asked whether this contradicted the Mishnah, which taught that a bird sin-offering took precedence over an animal burnt-offering, whereas here <b>she</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> animal burnt-offering before the bird sin-offering.) Rava taught that [...] merely accorded the bird burnt-offering precedence in the mentioning. (Thus, some read Rava to teach that [...] lets the reader read first about the burnt-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first. Others read Rava to teach that one first dedicated the animal or bird for the burnt-offering and then dedicated the bird for the sin-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first.) ...|$|E
