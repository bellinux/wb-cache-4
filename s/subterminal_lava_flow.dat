40|$|A {{new model}} for the {{evolution}} of the martian volcano Alba Patera is constructed. Numerous digitate channel networks on the flanks of the volcano are interpreted to be carved by sapping due to the release of nonjuvenile water from unconsolidated flank deposits. The particle size of these deposits is estimated to be 3 - 10 microns, which, together with theoretical modelling of the disperison of explosively derived volcanic materials, leads {{to the conclusion that the}} flank deposits on Alba Patera are low-relief pyroclastic flows. The recognition of numerous late-stage summit and <b>subterminal</b> <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> thus makes Alba Patera a unique martian volcano that is transitional between the older pyroclastic-dominated highland paterae and the more recent effusive central-vent volcanoes such as the Tharsis Montes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lava</b> <b>flow</b> {{simulations}} help {{to better}} understand volcanic hazards and may assist emergency preparedness at active volcanoes. We demonstrate that at Fogo Volcano, Cabo Verde, such simulations can explain the 2014 – 2015 <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> crisis and therefore provide a valuable base to better prepare for the next inevitable eruption. We conducted topographic mapping {{in the field and}} a satellite-based remote sensing analysis. We produced the first topographic model of the 2014 – 2015 <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> from combined terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and photogrammetric data. This high-resolution topographic information facilitates <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> volume estimates of 43. 7  ±  5. 2  ×  10 6  m 3 from the vertical difference between pre- and posteruptive topographies. Both the pre-eruptive and updated digital elevation models (DEMs) serve as the fundamental input data for <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> simulations using the well-established DOWNFLOW algorithm. Based on thousands of simulations, we assess the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> hazard before and after the 2014 – 2015 eruption. We find that, although the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> hazard has changed significantly, it remains high at the locations of two villages that were destroyed during this eruption. This result is of particular importance as villagers have already started to rebuild the settlements. We also analysed satellite radar imagery acquired by the German TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite to map <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> emplacement over time. We obtain the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> boundaries every 6 to 11 days during the eruption, which assists the interpretation and evaluation of the <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> model performance. Our results highlight the fact that <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> hazards change as a result of modifications of the local topography due to <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> emplacement. This implies the need for up-to-date topographic information in order to assess <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> hazards. We also emphasize that areas that were once overrun by <b>lava</b> <b>flows</b> are not necessarily safer, even if local <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> thicknesses exceed the average <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> thickness. Our observations will be important for the next eruption of Fogo Volcano and have implications for future <b>lava</b> <b>flow</b> crises and disaster response efforts at basaltic volcanoes elsewhere in the world...|$|R
