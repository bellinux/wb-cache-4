40|$|Development and {{population}} growth in Latin American countries with steep slope farming are likely to further increase pressures on water and land resources. A methodology was developed for assessing water availability and use under different development pathways at a watershed scale to determine whether water security is a potential problem, and if so, under what conditions {{it is likely to}} occur. This methodology makes use of a GIS-based spatial water budget model for simulating stream water availability, water use and <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> on a daily basis at a watershed scale. Here, we analysed water availability under three plausible development scenarios for the 3246 ha Cabuyal River watershed in southwest Colombia in the year 2025 : Corporate Farming (CF), Ecological Watershed (EW), and Business as Usual (BU). Simulated average river flows at the watershed outlet were, respectively, 874, 796 and 925 l s? 1 for the CF, EW and BU scenarios. The contribution of base flow to river flow (base flow index) was on average, 80. 8, 85. 6 and 77. 9 %, respectively, for the three scenarios. The watershed had the potential to meet the anticipated increase in water use under each explorative scenario. However, dams were necessary to store irrigation water in the CF scenario, otherwise over 60 % of the available water would have been used during the dry season. Such a high figure raises concerns about effects on aquatic and riparian ecology, concentrations of potential contaminants, water reserves for especially low rainfall years, and the watershed resilience to meet temporarily higher water needs during the day. Analyses indicated that current water-use conflicts in the watershed can be resolved if irrigation water supply is separated from drinking water supply. This study helped reduce some of the complexity associated with the interdependencies between land and water resources, the impact of using them, and spatial linkages within the watershed. Results of this study can be used for teaching local stakeholders about basic landscape responses and helping multi-institutional alliances to become proactive and to guide development to the benefit of local communities.

40|$|This thesis reviews {{a series}} of river basin {{ecosystem}} restoration/enhancement projects carried out {{under the direction of}} three individual southern Ontario conservation authorities in their respective river basins. The three authorities are the Grand River Conservation Authority, the Maitland Valley Conservation Authority, and the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority. A review from the published literature dealing with river basins, ecosystems, and environmental management supports the analysis of restoration projects. The criterion by which the literature articles were selected was that they have relevance to the type of environmental issues that are common to the river basins in the study areas. Comparisons made between the three conservation authorities’ restoration efforts are based on the investigation and assessment of a sample of four published restoration projects on file at each of the authorities’ head offices. A five component conceptual framework was used to analyze each of the twelve projects. The accumulated assessment data formed the basis for comparison. There are some observations and conclusions to be drawn from this thesis. The evolution of the conservation authorities’ approach to ecosystem restoration has occurred in response to the development of new knowledge, changes in public attitudes, changes in government policies, and changes in available operating resources. Although all conservation authorities operate within a similar mandate, they exercise enough individual autonomy to address their individual basin’s specific issues. The conservation authorities have demonstrated their resilience in response to current deep governmental financial constraints by recruiting volunteers, e. g. for the development of their sub-watershed and watershed plans. Nearly all of their sub-watershed plans are administered through public stewardship organizations. They have successfully solicited funds from organizations that allot financial grants for environmental causes, e. g. for the Grand River forestry plan. Ecosystem restoration is one of several conservation authority responsibilities. It represents a major advance in their operational evolution from their core mandate of soil and water conservation, <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> and water quality, through applying the ecosystem approach at the sub-watershed level, and toward basin-wide management plans, e. g. GRCA’s Grand River forestry plan, and MVCA’s Maitland Watershed Partnerships project. No doubt, the river basin {{has been shown to be}} the logical geographical area in southern Ontario on which to base conservation management strategies. Individual conservation authorities have accumulated over fifty years experience in successful management of environmental issues at the river basin level, through which they have gained a body of knowledge about their individual river basin that must surpass that held by any other organization. Such experience should qualify them for taking on an expanded role in crucial ecosystem restoration issues like those associated with groundwater, wetlands, waste management, public stewardship, and the development of ecosystem management strategies...|$|E

The rank-based non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to detect trends in annual <b>stream</b> <b>flow.</b> The results showed no significant trend for the period 1956 to 2000. However, change-point analysis showed that a significant change in annual <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> occurred around 1990, and hence the stream-flow data can be divided into two periods: 1956 - 1990 and 1991 - 2000.
