5|$|The two output ports have a 90° phase {{difference}} (-i to −1) and <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a 90° hybrid.|$|E
5|$|This remnant (RX J0852.0-4622) {{had been}} found in front (apparently) of the larger Vela Supernova Remnant. The gamma rays from the decay of titanium-44 showed that it must have {{exploded}} fairly recently (perhaps around 1200 AD), but there is no historical record of it. The flux of gamma rays and x-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 600 ly). If <b>so,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a surprising event because supernovae less than 200 parsecs away are estimated to occur less than once per 100,000 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{likelihood}} is maximized when p=2/3, and <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the maximum}} likelihood estimate forp.|$|E
50|$|Note: The United States {{intended}} to sell land to private parties, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a temporary right.|$|R
25|$|Some critics {{argued that}} French red wines would age {{better than the}} California reds, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> tested.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>this</b> book <b>was</b> released, The Fabulous Five book series did {{not release}} any more books, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the end.|$|R
25|$|Later on, the {{material}} {{is similar to that}} of Susa III (Proto-Elamite level), <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> where the Proto-Elamite horizon at Sialk is located, as is also evidenced by the discovery here of some Proto-Elamite clay tablets.|$|E
25|$|Many op-amps have {{back to back}} diodes {{between their}} inputs. Op-amp inputs usually follow each other <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> fine. But {{comparator}} inputs are not usually the same. The diodes can cause unexpected current through inputs.|$|E
25|$|So we {{can think}} of the {{category}} of real vector bundles on X as sitting inside the category of sheaves of OX-modules; this latter category is abelian, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> where we can compute kernels and cokernels of morphisms of vector bundles.|$|E
50|$|The CART {{race that}} weekend was {{cancelled}} due to track incompatibility, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the only race completed that weekend.|$|R
50|$|Mining ceased {{in early}} 1960. Guano sold for about $100 a ton then, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not a {{profitable}} venture.|$|R
50|$|Seagoon: Mrs Dale's...?? Heavens -- {{would the}} BBC stop at nothing? <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> how {{they kept the}} masses from thinking.|$|R
25|$|No map {{from the}} sphere {{to the plane}} can be both {{conformal}} and area-preserving. If it were, {{then it would be}} a local isometry and would preserve Gaussian curvature. The sphere and the plane have different Gaussian curvatures, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> impossible.|$|E
25|$|For {{a change}} of pace he did a musical, <b>So</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> Paris (1955), then it was back to more typical fare: Six Bridges to Cross (1955), as a bank robber; The Purple Mask (1955), a swashbuckler; The Square Jungle (1955), a boxing film.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to anisotropy {{in the electric}} polarizability (electric susceptibility), anisotropy in the magnetic polarizability (magnetic permeability) can also cause birefringence. However, at optical frequencies, values of magnetic permeability for natural materials are not measurably different from µ0, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not a source of optical birefringence in practice.|$|E
5000|$|An Erith Timber Dryer (most wagons {{were made}} of wood at <b>this</b> time <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> used to prepare the timber).|$|R
25|$|Saumoneau {{had been}} a strong {{supporter}} of the Third International before 1920, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a significant rightward shift in her views.|$|R
6000|$|Goose-grease on your heels! <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{what your}} first party and your first beau and your first moonlit romance ended in! ...|$|R
25|$|In {{their book}} 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology (2011), Scott O. Lilienfeld and colleagues have written that the {{ganzfeld}} being a reliable technique {{is far from}} being resolved. They concluded that ESP has not been successfully demonstrated in experiments for over 150 years <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> hardly encouraging.|$|E
25|$|Some solar cookers, {{especially}} solar ovens, {{take longer}} to cook food than a conventional stove or oven. Using solar cookers may require food preparation start hours before the meal. However, it requires less hands-on time during the cooking, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> often considered a reasonable trade-off.|$|E
25|$|RKO {{agreed to}} loan {{him out to}} Stanley Kramer and Carl Foreman, who had admired Child of Divorce, to make <b>So</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> New York (1948) for the Kramer Company at Columbia. Back at RKO Fleischer made a thriller based on a story by Foreman, The Clay Pigeon.|$|E
50|$|These mapping {{settings}} {{needed a}} dynamic storage facility <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> created using a Microsoft Access database initially, later upgraded to SQL Server.|$|R
50|$|After the Norman Conquest, {{the area}} came within {{the domain of}} Tonbridge Castle, one of 4 boroughs to do <b>so.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> the South Borough.|$|R
50|$|The First Vienna Award did {{not fully}} satisfy the Hungarians, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{followed}} by twenty-two border clashes between November 2, 1938 and January 12, 1939.|$|R
25|$|C is self-dual. In {{fact the}} {{elements}} of the closure of C are just set of all squares x2 in E, the dual cone is given by all a such that (a,x2) > 0. On the other hand, (a,x2) = (L(a)x,x), <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the positivity of L(a).|$|E
25|$|If a team loses {{resource}} at {{the start}} of an innings (left hand image below), then this is simple. For example, if the first 20 overs of an innings are lost, then 30 overs and 10 wickets are remaining, which is 75.1% in the Standard Edition, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the resource available.|$|E
25|$|The {{line end}} {{clearance}} distance of 28 nm essentially forces pitches {{to be at}} least 56 nm for EUV single exposure bi-directional patterning. 7nm node minimum metal pitch is already at 40 nm or below, while gate pitch can also be below 56 nm, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an indication that multiple patterning would be needed even for EUV at 7nm.|$|E
50|$|Tlepolemus was {{definitely}} satrap of Carmania {{after the second}} partition, and Diodorus places him as satrap at the first partition, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> probably the case.|$|R
60|$|Archie <b>was</b> deeply concerned. <b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the {{explanation}} of that mysterious disaster, that weird tragedy which had puzzled the sporting press from coast to coast.|$|R
6000|$|... "This crowns all!" [...] says Alan. [...] "Well, and I'm glad I came to Dunkirk. And <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> your business, was it? Halvers, I'm thinking?" ...|$|R
25|$|DeHaven's musical talents {{supplemented}} {{her acting}} abilities. Besides being {{cast as a}} singer in many of her films, including I'll Get By, <b>So</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> Paris and The Girl Rush, and performing numbers in many of her movies, DeHaven sang with the bands of Jan Savitt and Bob Crosby and at one time had her own nightclub act.|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} the notion of a {{topology}} is shown by {{the fact that there are}} several equivalent definitions of this structure. Thus one chooses the axiomatisation suited for the application. The most commonly used is that in terms of open sets, but perhaps more intuitive is that in terms of neighbourhoods and <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> given first.|$|E
25|$|Floating charges {{take effect}} in equity only, and {{consequently}} are defeated by {{a bona fide}} purchaser for value without notice of any asset covered by them. In practice, as the chargor has power to dispose of assets subject to a floating charge, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> only of consequence in relation to disposals that occur after the charge has crystallised.|$|E
50|$|Makhtesh Gadol (Large Makhtesh) At {{the time}} of naming, Makhtesh Ramon <b>was</b> uncharted and <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{thought to be the}} largest makhtesh, at 5km by 10km.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{locomotive}} {{was given}} a power classification, e.g. [...] "3F". However, many different classes {{would have the same}} power classification <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not helpful for identifying classes.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> decided upon, and Ozma, {{as soon as}} the Lion was unfastened {{from the}} chariot, at once mounted the beast's back and said she was ready.|$|R
