5|$|In October 1885, the Halifax Wood Fibre Company {{built the}} first {{sulphide}} pulp mill in Canada, {{which at the time}} was the Dominion of Canada, at East River, Sheet Harbour. Since the discovery of the <b>sulphite</b> process happened earlier in 1866, the news had traveled to William Chisholm, who was a lumber manufacturer in Halifax. He decided to try the <b>sulphite</b> method out for himself {{at the head of the}} East River. He had 60,000 acres (24,281 hectares, or 242km2) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers. The mill closed in January 1891, due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States. The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community.|$|E

On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide {{was applied to the}} hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of <b>sulphite</b> and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of <b>sulphite</b> (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E
40|$|S- 33 {{solid-state}} NMR {{is reported}} from some model crystalline sulphides, sulphates, <b>sulphites</b> and thiosulphates. This {{is the first}} report of S- 33 NMR signals of the latter two species from a solid. Good quality spectra, which have distinct, well separated shift ranges can be identified for all these groupings, except for <b>sulphites</b> and, hydrogen <b>sulphites</b> whose resonances are very broad. Nonetheless the presence of <b>sulphites</b> and hydrogen <b>sulphites</b> can be confirmed from their characteristic sharp, intense time domain echoes. S- 33 MAS NMR is also applied {{to a range of}} dry and hydrous silicate glasses with similar to 1 wt% 99 at% S- 33 -enriched sulphur. It is clear that in all these glasses sulphate is present, and in mixed cation systems there is some evidence of preferential association of sulphate with a specific cation. In a dry potassium silicate glass sample two resolved S- 33 resonances are observed, a sulphate, and the second from thiosulphate. Hence solid state S- 33 NMR is shown to be a feasible probe that can be applied to this problem that can readily distinguish different sulphur species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|An {{important}} factor {{for assessing the}} quality of food is their microbial contamination. This Bachelor thesis deals with the microbiological quality of dried apples. Bachelor thesis {{is based on the}} assumption that the use of <b>sulphites</b> has influence of the content of microorganisms. The aim is therefore determine their number, the influence of use of <b>sulphites</b> on their content, eventually evaluate other effects of <b>sulphites</b> on dried apples. Consuming food without additives is a trend of current time. If we are talking about dried fruit, additives are <b>sulphites,</b> which prevent primarily darkening of apples, they are used like preservatives, but they are allergen. So that is the reason why are Bio apples often coveted. In the practical part were compared apples which were not sulphurized, apples which were sulphurized and Bio apples, which were made in Severofrukt a. s., Trávčice. It was used six samples of each type. In all samples were determinated total amount of microorganisms - CPM, amount of coliform bacterias, Escherichia coli, yeasts and molds. Assessment was performed on Petrifilms from NOACK Company. Samples were also sent to be compared to acredited labaratories. Next thing, which was done, was examination, if the use of <b>sulphites</b> has any other effects on dried apples. All of samples fulfilled requirements of the Decree. In any of samples were not proven coliform bacteries or E. coli. According to analyzes Bio apples had the highest content of undesirable microorganisms. The total amount of microorganisms at them was in the average 11 000 KTJ/g. Sulphurized apples were less contamined than aplles, which were not sulphurized. The difference was almost about one half. This shows, that the use of <b>sulphites</b> has a positive influence on the content of microorganisms. And with the use of sensory evaluation was proved, that the use of <b>sulphites</b> has inluence on a colour of dried apples...|$|R

25|$|The {{sulphur dioxide}} {{additive}} {{commonly used in}} wine is not harmful in the amounts used but its effects are feared among asthmatics: it can cause the onset of a crisis (Difficulty breathing). For others {{there is no real}} allergic reaction. Symptoms such as difficulty breathing, migraine, or stomach heat sensation may indicate an intolerance. A reaction caused by a deficiency of <b>sulphite</b> oxidase (the enzyme that breaks down Sulphur Dioxide) is very rare. Studies are underway to investigate whether some of the symptoms attributed to Sulphur Dioxide could not come from another molecule present in the wine.|$|E
25|$|The {{winemaker}} can {{soak the}} skins of white grapes and practice maceration if {{the quality of}} the grapes is good. Pre-fermentation Maceration is generally performed at a controlled temperature to delay the onset of fermentation. This technique improves the extraction of varietal aromas and their precursors which are mainly located in the skin. Acidity decreases as does the ratio of Colloids (large pectin type molecules) and aging potential. To be implemented, this process requires a perfect de-stalking, moderate crushing and <b>sulphite</b> to protect the wort from oxidation. The duration (typically 5 to 18 hours at 18°C) depends on the variety, the temperature of maceration, the maturity of the grape, and {{the quality of the}} soil.|$|E
25|$|Maturing {{can be done}} in a vat. It takes {{little time}} to clarify and to prepare the {{packaging}} (bottling or Bag-In-Box) but this may be extended by maturing of lees. This type of maturing consists of regularly adding fine lees in suspension in the wine. The dead yeast is used for the fine lees which digests itself (autolysis) giving the wine volume and body to support the fruitiness. This operation is called Bâtonnage or stirring and is traditionally done with a stick to agitate the lees {{at the bottom of the}} barrel. This technique needs to be well controlled, however, otherwise the wine may take on a Goût de réduit (Reduced taste) due to the activity of reductase <b>sulphite</b> from the yeast. This operation {{can be done in}} vats, as in Muscadet, barrels as in Burgundy and many chardonnays, or bottles as in champagne.|$|E

40|$|The meso-hydrobenzoin <b>sulphites</b> (94 - 96) {{have been}} {{prepared}} and in each case the stereo-isomers separated. Pyrolysis of these cyclic <b>sulphites</b> gave mixtures of aldehyde and ketone. For any pair of <b>sulphites</b> the product ratio {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the stereochemistry of the S-O bond, a greater yield of ketone being produced when the S-O is syn to a hydrogen on the heterocyclic ring. This is thought to be due to abstraction of the hydrogen by the syn S-O to form the enol of a ketone. The differences between the aldehyde to ketone ratios for a series of S-O isomers, where the aryl substituent changes, has been rationalized in terms of the mmigratory aptitude of the aryl group. The product ratios obtained when the unsubstituted (31), 1 -methyl (33), 2 -methyl (42) and 1, 2 -dimethyl (45) alkenes are oxidized by KMnO 4, performic acid and iodine-silver acetate-water are discussed. The products from these oxidations are substituted cyclohexane- 1, 2 -diols (46 - 57; 60 - 63). The cyclic <b>sulphites</b> of these diols {{have been prepared}} and the isomers separated. Pyrolysis of the cyclic <b>sulphites</b> produced aldehyde and (or) ketones. The products result from a 1, 2 -hydride, methyl or methylene shift. In only one case was a cis- 1, 2 -hydride shift observed, implying a considerable degree of charge separation in the transition state. The major product aries from a 1, 2 -hydride shift where a favourable conformation is available...|$|R

25|$|John Wood of Marsden {{came from}} Manchester in 1819 and bought {{existing}} woollen mills which he expanded. These were the Howard Town mills. Francis Sumner was a Catholic whose family had connections with Matthew Ellison, Howard's agent. He built Wren Nest Mill. The Sidebottoms built the Waterside Mill at Hadfield. In 1825, John Wood installed the first steam engine and power looms. Sumner and Sidebottom followed suit {{and the three}} mills, Wren Nest, Howardtown and Waterside, became very large vertical combines (a vertical combine was a mill that both spun the yarn and then used it to weave cloth). With the other major families, the Shepleys, Rhodes and Platts, they dominated the dale. In 1884, the six had 82% of the spinning capacity with 892,000 spindles and 13,571 looms. Glossop was a town of very large calico mills. The calico printing factory of Edmund Potter (located in Dinting Vale) in the 1850s printed 2,500,000 pieces of printed calico, of which 80% was for export. The paper industry was created by Edward Partington who, as Olive and Partington, bought the Turn Lee Mill in 1874 to produce high-quality paper from wood pulp by the <b>sulphite</b> method. He expanded rapidly with mills in Salford and Barrow-in-Furness. He merged with Kellner of Vienna and was created Lord Doverdale in 1917. He died in 1925; his factories in Charlestown created nearly 1,000 jobs.|$|E

2500|$|Wayagamack was {{successful}} until the Great Depression when the paper market collapsed. The island property {{was taken over}} by Consolidated Paper Corporation Limited in 1931, but they showed little interest in it and put it up for sale. Offers came from Canadian, American, British, French and Belgian parties. In July 1937, an offer was received from a consortium of Dutch and German capitalists who intended to build a <b>sulphite</b> mill and wanted a steady supply of pulpwood and access to Canadian capital. In the autumn of that year, a team of German surveyors travelled to the island to examine its timber and export potential. When this story broke in the Montreal Gazette of 2 December 1937, it caused an immediate controversy since the story claimed that the survey team was really made up of Adolf Hitler's agents and that most were naval, military and fortifications experts. Despite the substantial offer, the promise of thousands of new jobs, and {{the fact that there were}} no legal methods to block the sale, the suspicions remained. A committee was set up to investigate the affair but concluded that [...] "there was no evidence to indicate that the project has other than a commercial purpose".

NDP leader Carole James assigned Trevena to be the official critic to the Employment and Income Assistance ministry, headed by BC Liberal Claude Richmond. She supported the 2005 review of welfare rates in which she advocated for earning exemptions and opposed the ministry providing welfare recipients with [...] "free socks, T-shirts and travel mugs" [...] in exchange for authorizing direct deposits of welfare cheques into a bank account. She chastised Richmond after an internal survey of ministry employees reported very morale and revealed he was ignoring staff recommendations. On local issues, Trevena lobbied the government to intervene in the bankruptcy of a Port Alice pulp mill. While the mill was 87 {{years old at the time}} and required equipment upgrades and environmental remediation, it also comprised 80% of Port Alice's tax base and was one of only a few mills in the world that produced specialty products using dissolving <b>sulphite</b> pulp; the province eventually directed $800,000 to Port Alice to cover the loss of the 2005 property taxes, facilitated the sale of the mill to a Swiss investment company for $1, and provided $7.5 million for site remediation. When another mill was facing closure (Elk Falls sawmill in February 2008), Minister of Forests Rich Coleman declined to offer provincial assistance but recognized Trevena for her efforts helping keep the Port Alice mill open. Trevena backed the creation of the North Coast Trail through Cape Scott Provincial Park, but opposed efforts at developing private accommodations in the park. During the debate over whether the Vancouver Island Health Authority should build a new hospital or renovate existing facilities in Campbell River and Comox, Trevena campaigned in support of renovating the existing hospitals. When the Health Authority chose to build a new $306-million, 230-bed facility near Courtenay instead, Trevena lobbied Minister of Health George Abbott not to approve the decision, and continued to publicly campaign in support of the renovations.

Lobsters treated with 4 % of a commercial formula based on <b>sulphites</b> were used for control purposes. The treatment with 4 -hexylresorcinol-based formulations delayed the increase in K-value and total volatile bases, while evolution of pH and trimethylamine was similar regardless of the treatment. No relation was found between biochemical and microbiological indexes. Regarding microflora, although commercial <b>sulphites</b> slightly slowed the growth of seafood spoiler organisms, as Shewanella putrefaciens and luminescent colonies, these organisms were not found in a very high number (∼ 6 log cfu/g) {{at the end of}} storage. Moreover, the formulation containing 4 -hexylresorcinol 0. 1 % appeared to stimulate the growth of lactic acid bacteria.
