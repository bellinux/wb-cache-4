BHOOSHAN SHARMA Department of Plant Pathology, Indira Gandhi Agricultural University, Raipur 492 006 ABSTRACT: The effect of prevailing environmental conditions on <b>spawn</b> <b>run,</b> pin head formation and biological efficiency of Pleurotus djamor was studied continuously for 9 months from February-October 2003 on Paddy, Wheat and Mustard straw. July month took minimum time (6. 75 to 8. 5 days) for <b>spawn</b> <b>run</b> and 10. 5 to 11. 5 days for pin head formation {{and gave the}} highest biological efficiency (45. 2 to 46. 0) on all the three substrates. However, February and March months took more period for <b>spawn</b> <b>run</b> and pin head initiation and yield was less. No <b>spawn</b> <b>run</b> was observed in months of April, May and June. Correlation coefficient analysis showed negative correlation with maximum, minimum and average temperature. It was negative and significant only for the period for <b>spawn</b> <b>run</b> and pin head formation in case of wheat and mustard substrates. Correlation coefficient for biological efficiency was negative and non- significant with maximum, minimum and average temperature in case of paddy and wheat straw substrate, however, mustard straw showed positive and non-significant relationship with minimum temperature. Key words: Environmental conditions, months, yield, Pleurotus djamor Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus spp.) is commonly called as Dhingri in India because of its oyster like shape. The genus has about 38 well recognized species out of which 25 have been reported from India, of which 12 are cultivated {{in different parts of}} the country. Its cultivation can be done on a number of agricultural wastes and organic waste materials. Different mushrooms require different climatic conditions for their mycelial growth and fruiting. Most of the mushrooms species have unique ability to degrade cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin of different agro-wastes and organic-waste materials and utilize them to produce edible biomass of high nutritive value. Mushroom constitutes low calorie diet havinq high amount of protein, vitamins and minerals. In general, mushroom fruit body on dry weight basis contains 55...|$|E

40|$|Tidal cycles are {{important}} cues for many marine and near-shore animals. Birds that typically feed at the water’s edge during daytime low tides are rarely present on beaches at night. However, {{we found that}} several species of diurnal birds reliably attended and preyed upon the nocturnal <b>spawning</b> <b>runs</b> of a marine fish, Leuresthes tenuis, the California Grunion (Teleostei: Atheriopsidae) {{on the shores of}} Malibu Lagoon State Beach (MLSB), Los Angeles County, California, USA. Avian hunters of California Grunion included Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax, Great Blue Heron Ardea herodias, Snowy Egret Egretta thula, and Western Gull Larus occidentalis. <b>Spawning</b> <b>runs</b> of California Grunion are synchronized by tides within a narrow window of time, two hours following the semilunar high tides of full and new moons. These silverside fish aggregate en masse predictably, and further increase their vulnerability by fully emerging from the water while spawning. This allows the birds to capture California Grunion terrestrially. On nights when <b>spawning</b> <b>runs</b> of California Grunion could potentially occur, birds were present on MLSB, often before the fish began to run onto shore. Number of birds was high for the nights of likely runs whether after full or new moons, whether or not the fish appeared, but not on other nights. We suggest that birds rely on tidal cues to anticipate <b>spawning</b> <b>runs</b> of California Grunion, not the amount of moonlight or the actual presence of fish on shore. Shorebirds were more likely to forage at night at sites close to their upland roosting and nesting areas than at sites with less upland habitat.

The <b>spawn</b> <b>run</b> period on the compost bags for the strains ranged from 40 - 48 days. Plewotus citrinopileatus strain PCB showed very poor and patchy {{growth and the}} mycelium never fully colonised the substrate. This indicates that the different strains of the mushrooms utilize the given substrate at different rates. The time for first appearance of mushrooms ranged from 4 to 35 days. With the exception of P. burundii strain HK- 51, which produced only one flush, all strains produced at least three flushes. Pleurotus eous strain Kapak, the highest yielding strain produced six flushes. With all the strains flush 1 gave the highest yield of 63. 9 g, and flush 6 the lowest yield of 0. 9 g.

40|$|In {{recent years}} green mould (Trichoderma aggressivum) has {{presented}} big problems to the Dutch mushroom industry. T. aggressivum infects compost {{at a very}} early stage and in the Dutch situation infection most likely takes place at the compost yard. Even though compost producers in the Netherlands are very keen to prevent green mould problems, occasionally still a number of crops get infected. Therefore {{there is a need for}} a reliable method that allows early detection of Trichoderma green mould. Although qPCR methods have been developed for quantitation of T. aggressivum, these cannot be used for detection in compost. In the Netherlands <b>spawn</b> <b>run</b> is performed in bulk at the compost yards and is referred to as phase 3 composting. During this process, spawned compost is incubated in tunnels and ventilated with large volumes of air to control compost temperature. During this process the compost is inaccessible for sampling. Literature data showed that Agaricus bisporus and T. aggressivum use volatiles to affect each other’s growth rate. We tested the possibility to detect Trichoderma green mould using the volatiles that are emitted during <b>spawn</b> <b>run.</b> This eventually could lead to a sophisticated non-invasive detection method of T. aggressivum in the process air of the tunnels, without the need to sample inside the tunnel during <b>spawn</b> <b>run.</b> For this we compared volatiles that are produced in non-infected compost with volatiles that are produced in infected compost. In our experimental model, 300 g of phase 2 compost, is spawned and inserted in aerated glass vessels. Compost is colonised at an air temperature of 24 °C. After 7, 10 and 14 days of <b>spawn</b> <b>run,</b> process air is sampled both in infected and non-infected cultures and analysed by coupled gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). During this 14 -day period white mushroom mycelium develops in the non-infected compost. In the infected compost the compost turns black with occasional tufts of white mycelium and green spores. Volatile blends that are produced during normal compost colonisation (when Agaricus bisporus interacts with Scytalidium thermophilum and other micro flora present in compost) differ from those produced during colonisation of T. aggressivum infected compost. Some of the volatiles appear to be specific for T. aggressivum infected compost. Next to this also consistent differences in the overall pattern of volatile production are seen. Infections with T. harzianum, T. atroviride, an Aspergillus species, or Smokey mould (Penicillium citreonigrum) produce different volatile patterns. Significant differences between the volatile blends of infected and non-infected compost are visible after 7 days of compost colonisation. In commercial practice of phase 3 composting, tunnels are likely to be partially infected. On-going research is directed at studying larger amounts of compost that is only partially infected...|$|E

30|$|The {{influence}} of substrate water potential (ψ) {{on the growth}} and fruiting of three genotypes of shiitake (Lentinula edodes) was investigated. A slight reduction ofψ (− 0.5 MPa) stimulated mycelial and colony growth on liquid, agar, and sawdust-based substrates.L. edodes {{has been found to}} grow well at aψ around − 0.5 MPa, which corresponds to a moisture content around 55 %. A small decrease inψ at the final vegetative growth phase had positive effects on flush quantity. The substrateψ was significantly affected by the interaction between genotypes and <b>spawn</b> <b>run</b> time. Theψ of well-colonized mature substrate was − 0.7 MPa before and − 4.OMPa after the fruiting. Theψ rose again to − 0.7 MPa during rapid absorbance of water by soaking, and this rise was repeated during the second and third flushes. It is suggested that the water-holding capacity of a substrate is related to culture maturity. Excellent water-providing capacity (higherψ) is expected in the substrate of well-matured cultures with a high density of mycelial colonization.|$|E

Activity was far {{greater in the}} dark {{in all but the}} sexually mature animals, reflecting behaviour in the field. A circadian rhythm was also observed in the heart rate during periods of inactivity, and this was correlated with an increase in ventilatory frequency or amplitude.

At 15 °C, the mean basal oxygen consumption of G. australis caught immediately after they had left the sea and embarked on the <b>spawning</b> <b>run</b> (45 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1) was less than in young adults about to commence their marine feeding phase (64 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1), but greater than in large ammocoetes (26. 5 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1). Basal oxygen consumption fell progressively during the spawning-run of to 33 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1 after 5 months and 25 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1 after 10 months, before rising to 35 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1 after 15 months when the animals were approaching sexual maturity.

Increases in bacterial population density at pinning were greater in the peat-based mixtures, which contained industrial waste materials, than in peat alone. Peat mixtures containing these alternative materials are therefore favourable substrates for bacterial growth. The DGGE profiles for pasteurised casing materials reflected their ability to rapidly re-establish the original bacterial community.
