40|$|In an {{increasing}} number of applications highly dynamic electrical drives, characterized by high quality torque control, are demanded. Direct torque control (DTC) for AC machines, permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) or induction machines, can provide this accurate and fast torque control. When applying DTC the change of the stator flux linkage vector is controlled, based on torque and flux errors. As such the estimation of the stator flux linkage is essential for a DTC drive. Furthermore the quality of the estimation directly determines the capability of the drive. In the literature several possible solutions for the estimation of the stator flux linkage are proposed. However, a comprehensive comparison between these solutions is not present. This paper gives an overview of several techniques for the estimation of the stator flux linkage for DTC in PMSMs. The theoretical advantages and disadvantages of the methods are outlined. After a short discussion on the effects of erroneous estimations the results from simulations for the different methods are reviewed. It is shown that, despite their simplicity <b>stabilized</b> <b>voltage</b> model methods can offer good performance.

Each subject was exposed to the electric current with the voltage of 5, 8 and 10 V using a self-made <b>stabilized</b> <b>voltage</b> supply. Electrodes were mounted to forearm in a distance of 1 cm and the measurements of electric current intensity were performed in 10 second intervals for 1 minute using a M- 3800 multimeter.

Based on the mean values of our measurements a characteristic of resistance changes in the skin were calculated indicating that these changes show features of a decreasing logarithmic function. Conclusions: The changing skin resistance generates changes in the electric current intensity upon constant voltage value. If a constant value of electric current flow has to be obtained in the skin, the current source should enable the correction of voltage supply parallel to the resistance changes...|$|E

Poor and instability of power supply delivery in Nigeria necessitated {{the need for a}} device that can stabilize voltage, protect equipment from damages and also provide power to the loads in the absences of electricity from the utility mains. This need motivated the design of a power stabilizer (UPSz). Method of Pulse with modulation (PWM) was adopted. This method is capable of modulating a varying input to a stabilized output. Two input sources were considered; a fluctuating 220 V volt mains supply and a constant 12 V battery. The 12 V battery was rectified to provide an AC power supply to the load {{in the absence of the}} utility mains. The control circuit ensured a stabilized output voltage from input range of 140 V to 260 V AC power supply which is about ± 40 V to the usual supply voltage from the utility mains of 180 V- 220 V in Nigeria. Appropriate protection circuits were incorporated against surges to which ensured the safety of home/office appliances. A variac was used to obtain various AC voltage levels during the testing.
