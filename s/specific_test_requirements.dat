Our results showed that categorical and coordinate spatial judgements on imagined stimuli rely on the activation of a set of cortical areas, centred upon the superior parietal lobule (SPL) bilaterally. These regions, together with other parietal and prefrontal areas, showed a pattern of relative lateralization, with the left hemisphere being mainly activated during the categorical task and the right in the coordinate task.

The Computer Module interfaces with the other three modules and performs the automatic control and data processing for the test station. Automatic positioner control, manual positioner control, and manual antenna pattern measurements are provided by the Control Module. The Source Module radiates a continuous or pulsed electromagnetic wave from the tapered end of the anechoic chamber.

The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic role of the pleural effusion/serum (CHOL, LDH, and protein) ratios in the differentiation between exudate and transudate pleural effusion. As a part of the investigation, 135 serum and pleural effusion samples were collected from patients with accumulated plural effusion. Prior to testing, 5 mL of venous blood and 20 mL of pleural effusion samples were prepared in accordance with <b>specific</b> <b>testing</b> <b>requirements.</b> Exudative pleural effusions were observed in 95 (70. 4 %) samples, of which 64 (67. 4 %) belonged to male patients and 31 (32. 6 %) to females. The calculated means for CHOL, LDH, and protein levels in pleural effusion and serum samples between exudate and transudate effusion showed statistically significant differences with the p -value = 0. 000. In distinguishing between exudative and transudate pleural effusion, a high Pearson correlation was observed between CHOL ratio and clinical diagnosis (r = 0. 971), as well as between CHOL level in effusion samples and LDH level in serum samples (r = 0. 867). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value analysis of the parameters in the differentiation between exudate and transudate samples revealed the following values: 97. 7 % and 100 %, 100 %, and 95 %, respectively, for the CHOL ratio; 86 %, 97. 4 %, 97. 4 %, and 97 %, respectively, for the LDH ratio; and 81. 4 %, 81. 6 %, 89. 7 %, and 70. 4 %, respectively, for the protein ratio. On the basis of the study findings, it could be concluded that estimation of CHO, LDH, and protein ratios can assist in the differentiation between exudative and transudate pleural effusion and thus patient management. Hence, this approach should be included in routine laboratory analyses of pleural effusions. Nevertheless, additional techniques should be incorporated in the diagnosis of doubtful pleural effusions, as this will improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in this setting...|$|R
