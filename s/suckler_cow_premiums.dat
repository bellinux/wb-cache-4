50|$|The {{reformed}} Common Agricultural Policy for {{the period}} 2014-2020 is strongly linked to the overall Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The CAP is aiming for increased competitiveness, improved sustainability and increased efficiency. The aid will be distributed differently between and within EU Member States. Direct aid will be 'greener' by introducing three mandatory greening practices. The importance of rural development increases. In 2013, Flemish farmers received 258.8 million euros in direct support. Entitlement rights were good for 228.2 million euros of this amount, and the <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> <b>premium</b> for 27.3 million euros. With 23%, dairy farming had in the period 2007-2012 the greatest share of direct support. A significant part goes to beef cattle farming and arable crops. The business types pigs and horticulture traditionally receive little or no direct support. For the overall agricultural and horticultural sector, the share of direct support in the farm income is on average 24%.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experiment that {{was carried out}} in order to examine the decision making process of farmers in the Alentejo dryland region of Portugal. Cumulative Prospect Theory allows modeling the Alentejo dryland farmers' decision process, because when they decide what crops and livestock activities will produce the different results are appraised relatively to the initial wealth, which permits its appraisal in terms of gains and of losses. An inquiry is developed to study the Alentejo dryland farmers' preferences, which intend to determine risk preferences through a set of games. A discrete sequential stochastic programming model is developed to examine farmers' decision-making process face to the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy. The objective function, that maximizes the total value of the game, portrays the farmers' behavior face to risk and it is constituted by the set of functions (value function and probability weighting function) ranked upward. The total value of the games will be given by the sum of the positive and negative components. Model results show that Cumulative Prospect Theory portrays the Alentejo dryland farmers' decision-making process quite well. All the farmers produce durum wheat as main agricultural production and choose the maximum of number of cattle heads and sheep herds. The full decoupling of income payment from agricultural production leads to the abandonment of the durum wheat production. The beef cattle farmers keep their production and the sheep farmers reduce their herds drastically. The introduction of 50 % of sheep premium, proposed by the Portuguese Government, raises sheep production, accompanied of the increase of the pasture area. These results permit to conclude that the Portuguese Government's proposal is sufficiently cautious because, on the one hand, when associating to 100 % of <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> <b>premium</b> allows the use of the shares negotiated with European Union in 2003 and when associating to 50 % of sheep premium permit the maintenance of sheep herd. On the other hand, the Portuguese Government's proposal of crop subsidies not linked to agricultural production forces the farmers to choose alternative agricultural activities in the bad soils. Finally, the introduction of the area crop-yield insurance program associated with the new Common Agricultural Policy is an interesting alternative for the Alentejo dryland farmers, because the new Common Agricultural Policy only secure a minimum farm income level, while the insurance program permits making face to agricultural production variability and avoids the abandonment of the agricultural activity.

40|$|The {{number of}} <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> in Sweden has {{increased}} from 60 000 in the mideighties to 165 000 1995. By tradition {{the majority of the}} <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> are tied up in former milking cow barns during the winter season. These barns are insulated and ventilated, not very well maintained and very labour consuming. The interest and need for development of simple, rational and cheap systems of production systems for <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> has increased. This study comprises both a literature review and a field study. The literature review concerns the economy in <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> production as well as the origin of the cattle, ethology and their behaviour. It emphasizes the role of natural behaviour, because <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> production in more simple production systems and housing, to be successful, has {{to take advantage of the}} natural behaviour patterns in cattle at a great degree. The last and main part of the literature review concerns climate and ambient environment and the effect on cattle heat balance, possibilities for adjustment to cold and need for extra energy when the animals are exposed to low outside temperatures as well as wind and snow or rain. The literature review concludes that housing cattle outside or in simple sheds, results in a slightly higher feed consumption because of decreased digestibility of feed and because of demand of extra feed to maintain heat balance during cold periods. The literature review also shows that the <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> is well adjusted to stay outside or in simple sheds during the winter in Sweden if provided with sufficient feed. The field study includes material from visits at 50 <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> herds with different types of housing including insulated buildings with tied up cattle, different types of loose house systems, (cubicles, deep litter straw bedding etc) and even ranch systems without buildings. Geographically the herds are sited from Stockholm region to the southernmost province, Sk√•ne. The herd size varied from 15 to 1000 <b>suckler</b> <b>cows.</b> Most of the herds had between 30 and 60 dams. The critical period in <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> production is the cold season combined with calving Then the demand on the thermal environment and intensity of labour is at its maximum. The question is how the producer can coop with these critical situations in an optimum way considering the animal and human wellfare. In the field study different aspects of this, such as technical, labour and animal environment, investment and feed costs, health and productivity where looked at. The results of the field study shows that <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> production under Swedish climatic and soil conditions can, maintained in low cost buildings with little input of labour and economic resources, still be far better than production in the traditional way in insulated houses and with tied up cows. In the field study, the following conclusions have been drawn: - Dividing the dams into groups, are at all forms of loose house systems important so that younger and weaker individuals do not loose weight and condition. The most suitable groups are pregnant heifers in one group, first time calvers and cows in bad condition in one group and older cows in good condition in one group. - Date of calving is not a factor that excludes simple non- insulated barns. Early calving is performed with good result except when calving outside especially when there is wet snow, which can cause loss of new-born calves. - Calving difficulties are much less in loose house systems compared to tied up systems. - There should be sufficient of calving boxes, preferably one box per 8 - 10 heifers and one per 15 - 20 cows. In tied up system the need for calving boxes are even bigger. - Calf cribs are well used by the calves. It should be placed in such a way that it provides the calves with a sheltered resting place and the space must be sufficient, at least 0, 6 m 2 per calf or bigger, It should also be placed near the cows, be easy to reach for the calves and free from draught. - Calf health is better in loose house systems where there are less animals per m 2 and the air volume per beast is greater than in tied up systems. - The working hours are more in a tied up system during the wintertime, 15 - 20 hours per cow compared to 8 - 14 hours per cow in a loose house system. - The need for checking and looking alter the cows and calves during the calving period is much greater in a tied up system than it is in a loose house system, but there is a greater demand in the stockman‚Äôs ability to take notice in his or her cattle in a loose house system. - When using existing buildings such as barns, one must be aware of the needs of reinforcement, particularly in the walls from animals and bedding. - When using straw bedding, the experience often is that the need of straw is very large and the work with the straw takes a great deal of time. There are great differences in the amount of straw that is needed depending on how many animals per m 2 there are, type of feed stuff, the quality of the straw and if there is an exercise yard connected to the bam. - Straw should, if possible, be kept under roof. It decreases the need of straw and makes it easier to use. The conclusion of this study throughout both literature and field studies, is that there are good possibilities in Sweden, to develop the more simple forms of housing with maintained or more likely enhanced health and well-being in the <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> and their calves, To be able to take in use more simple forms of housing for the <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> and by this lowering the costs, means greater possibilities for the <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> production to survive in the long run.

40|$|The {{agricultural}} sector {{is being called}} upon to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). A scenario approachwas developed to explore the plausible futures of the French bovine sector {{and their impact on}} climate change. These scenarios encompass a Business As Usual scenario (S 1 -BAU) and alternative contrasting scenarios: (S 2) cattle production increase to meet a high global demand under a liberal policy, (S 3) refocus on internal demandwithin France, with an upmarket move to ‚Äògreen‚Äô products, (S 4) committed public policy to reduce GHGemissions. This paper analyses how key drivers of these scenarios (e. g. subsidies on investment, reduction ofmarket risks, carbon tax, limitation of concentrate feed in animal diets) affect the evolution of production,economics, and environmental impact on climate change of typical French <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> and dairy farms, bymeans of simulations performed with a bio-economic model. To adapt their farming systems to the scenarios,farms can opt for variably intensive/integrated practices per animal and per unit land area. Some technologicalprogress in animal production, crop production, and farm equipment is also modeled. Results show that in S 1 -BAU, milk production, net income and impact on climate change of dairy farms rise. Beef production and impacton climate change decrease slightly in <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> farms. Impact on climate change per unit of product decreasesowing to higher productivity per animal and to a more integrated management of crop production. Alternativescenarios underline that reorienting public support toward farm investment would further intensify dairy farmsand increase their income, but would reduce production and income of <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> farms and favor crop production(S 2). Climate change impact per unit of product is more strongly reduced in S 3 (organic farming withlow feed concentrate) than in S 2, but with a reduced production, particularly for milk.

40|$|If {{you keep}} cattle in a herd outside {{all year round}} on big varying grounds, their {{possibility}} to perform their natural behaviour increases. This way of keeping cattle requires that you provide them with their other needs, like shelter and a dry and clean resting place. According to the animal welfare authority¬¥s regulations on livestock farming, only animals that are suited to stay outside during the cold season are allowed to be kept outside. They should also {{have access to a}} shelter or another building that gives them protection from the weather and wind and provides a dry and clean resting place. Research has shown that as long as cattle do not get exposed to precipitation and wind they will manage low temperature well. Some of the things that will affect how well the animals handle different climates are the isolation ability of the fur, the animals¬¥ body size and the feed intake. A dry lying place that is both insulating and moisture absorbent is also of great importance. The animals increase the time they are lying down in bad weather conditions, such as rain and wind. By lying down they save their energy and reduce their body surface, and thereby reduce the heat radiation. The purpose with this Bachelor thesis is to enhance the understanding of where a herd of <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> which are kept outside during winter time in the middle of Sweden, chooses to seek shelter, how they distribute their resting time over the diurnal cycle, and in wich terrain they prefer to lie. The data collection took place on a herd of 60 <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> in G√§vleborg. The animals on the farm were mainly Hereford cross-breds of varying age. The area in which the animals were kept during the data collection period was 40 hectares large, and consisted of varied terrain. The animals had access to four shelters of the circular arc model. The data collection was conducted during two different periods (October and February) to cover various weather conditions. Eight focal animals which would carry measuring equipment were selected for each collection period that lasted 21 days each. They carried the GPS collars, which recorded the cows positions every 15 minutes around the clock during the entire period, and activity meters, which made the registrations every minute, to determine whether the animals were lying, walking or standing. A stationary weather station recorded the weather every 15 minutes. Data have been processed so that all missed GPS recordings of where the animals were, was treated as they were in a shelter due to that the GPS collars often have difficulties to get satellite contact under a tin roof. However, this can give a too high number of recordings of staying in the shelter, and therefore we call this variable "shelter + missed". This study shows that <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> that were kept outside during October and February in the middle of Sweden were lying down approximately one third of the day and that they appeared to be lying down as much as in the "shelter+missing" as in the natural protection. Approximately one third of the time, the <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> spent in open terrain. The area that the animals spent the most time after the open terrain was the "shelter+missing". Almost as much time that was spent in the "shelter+missing" (19, 3 %) was spent even in the dense spruce forest (16, 6 %). In the sparse wood the <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> were standing (50, 7 %) and lying (49, 3 %) about the same, while they were standing (80, 3 %) much more than they were lying (19, 7 %) in the dense forest. The "shelter+missing" was the protection that differed the most from the other protection areas because the animals were lying down significantly more (65, 3 %) than they were standing (34, 7 %). During 83, 8 % of the time the <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> were recorded in some sort of protection when they were lying down at night. The <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> were lying 2, 4 % at night, 8, 8 % during dawn-dusk and 6, 6 % during the day. The conclusion is that the <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> that were kept outside during the winter time in this herd were lying mostly at night, that this happened mostly in protected areas, and that the shelters seemed to be a protection they used...|$|R

The aim of Strategy F was to offer the cows the same amount of energy as offered on Strategy S, but at a constant daily level. In Experiment 1, cows on Diet C were offered grass silage and straw and on Diet A grass silage and a fl our-mill industry by-product. On Strategy S, feeding was stepped with barley (0, 1. 5 and 3. 5 kg d- 1). On Strategy F, barley was offered 1. 43 kg per head daily. In Experiment 2, cows were offered either grass silage (C) or whole-crop barley silage (A) as a sole feed.

40|$|<b>Suckler</b> <b>cow</b> {{production}} in France relies mainly {{on a relatively}} extensive management of forage, implying that production risk may be enhanced by the sensitivity of those crops to weather variability. However risk exposure {{is supposed to be}} mitigated either through ex-ante decisions concerning pasture area management or through ex-post decisions concerning the purchase of feeds. This paper aims at assessing weather impacts on cattle production level decisions. Since farmers' decisions depend on farmers' behaviour regarding risks, which are namely production and price risks, we test constant absolute risk aversion, constant relative risk aversion and risk neutrality assumptions. We develop an econometric model encompassing an auto-regressive price function and a production function which allow inputs to affect independently mean and variance of the production. Weather indicators embodied by average regional forage production for current and past years are explicitely introduced as non controllable inputs. The estimation framework consist in conditions on the first and second moment of output production, output price and profit. Following, ISIK (2003), additional condition on each of both allocable inputs enable us to take into account risk aversion and both price and production risks in parameters estimation. We use the Generalized Method of Moments in order to make minimum assumptions regarding variable exogeneity and error distribution. We apply the model to an original panel dataset containing 65 individual yearly observations recorded over the period 1987 - 2005 on French <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> farms of the north of Massif Central. Because of the difficulties to find a relevant set of instruments, these preliminary results do not analyse weather impact on production mean. However we can advance that production decisions depend on price and production risks as farmers are found to be risk averse. Weather variability of the current year increase production risk whereas fertilizer level application slightly increased it. However we did not highlight that weather impact depend on production level.

30|$|Depending on {{the animal}} (and the {{exposure}} pathway and source), PCDD/Fs or dl-PCBs can contribute in various ratios to TEQ. dl-PCBs {{are often the}} main contributor. For example, in the German federal monitoring plan for beef from <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> herds, more than 90 % of the regulatory TEQ exceedances in meat were from dl-PCBs. On the other hand, in 60 investigated small free-range chicken flocks in the Netherlands, the TEQ contribution from PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs was similar, with a slightly higher impact from PCDD/Fs [31].|$|R

50|$|Two {{conflicting}} tendencies {{caused the}} current rarity of purebred, high-performance animals. The Pinzgauer is mainly bred as a beef <b>suckler</b> <b>cow,</b> {{so there is}} no selection on milk performance. However, there are utility crossings with local or distinct beef breeds, too. In Austria itself, since 1969, Red Holstein have been crossed into Pinzgauer to increase the milk performance. The aim is to achieve 6,000 kg milk with 4% milk fat content and 3.5% protein. The average milk performance in Austria is 5,356 kg milk with 3.89% milk fat and 3.28% protein (2005).|$|R
40|$|Potential {{biochemical}} {{indicators of}} long-term undernutrition in cattle, {{which could be}} used objectively, reliably and routinely, were investigated by evaluating frequently analysed metabolites in cattle. In an initial study, a meta-regression of literature data for glucose, urea, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) against body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW) and its change (BWC) was conducted. The credible intervals of the gradients included zero for all regressions, showing that there were no significant relationships between any of the blood metabolites and BCS, BW or BWC across the 13 included studies. In a second study, fresh field samples from nine herds of adequately-nourished <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> and stored samples from two herds of <b>suckler</b> <b>cows,</b> which had experienced severe undernutrition, were analysed for serum albumin, total protein, urea, BHB, NEFA, creatinine, fructosomine and globulin. Positive regressions with BCS were obtained for albumin and creatinine, and a negative regression with fructosamine/albumin ratio. With the threshold for detecting undernutrition set at >= 10. 75 mu mol g(- 1), the fructosamine/albumin ratio gave sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. Therefore, it is probably necessary to combine several blood measures to obtain a valid assessment of the nutritional state of ruminants, and we advise against the use of a single plasma metabolite concentration in assessing the nutritional state and welfare of individual cows...|$|R
40|$|Keeping {{beef cattle}} {{outdoors}} during winter reduces costs and improves animal welfare, but in-creases {{the risk of}} nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) runoff losses. This study evaluated a rota-tional pen design on grassland with two groups of <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> given access to an expanding staying area and a new feeding area each week (72 cattle ha‚àí 1), with one month‚Äôs stay per pen. The spatial distribution of excreta and effects on N and P surface runoff was evaluated during six months. The total excreta loads corresponded to 500 kg¬∑N¬∑ha‚àí 1 and 50 kg¬∑P¬∑ha‚àí 1. New feeding ar-eas did not distribute excretions evenly, {{which resulted in the}} highest proportion of excretions (31 %) occurring in the first week‚Äôs sub-area. The topsoil had significantly higher amounts of min-eral-N, mainly as NH 4 -N (29 - 81 kg¬∑ha‚àí 1), than an unaffected area (13 kg¬∑ha‚àí 1). Mean total runoff losses were similar for both groups (1. 4 kg¬∑P¬∑ha‚àí 1 and 9. 0 kg¬∑N¬∑ha‚àí 1). Around 78 % of N and 70 % of P runoff losses occurred during the month with cattle present. During the first two weeks with heavy rain, N and P runoff losses were 50 % higher from an area with <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> than a corre-sponding vegetated sub-area without cows.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} successive years using 32, 53 and 74 calves of crossbred <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> in a semi-arid area close to Nairobi, Kenya. A 2 X 2 factorial experimental design was used with milking and supplementation (2 kg concentrate/head per day) as the main treatments. The effects of milking (or not milking), supplementing (or not supplementing) cows were examined by measuring {{the growth rate of}} the calves from birth to weaning at 6 months of age. In experiments 2 and 3 each of the 4 groups of calves was sub-divided to give equal numbers of calves either receiving or not receiving a small amount (1 kg/day) of weaner pellets. The growth rates for calves of milked cows were 0. 54 kg/day (experiment 1), 0. 63 kg/day (experiment 2) and 0. 58 kg/day (experiment 3). The growth rates of calves of the non-milked cows were 0. 81 kg/day (experiment 1), 0. 70 kg/day (experiment 2) and 0. 67 kg/day (experiment 3). Provision of concentrate to either the cows and/or the calves did not {{have a significant effect on}} the growth of the calves except in the first 12 weeks of experiment 1. Therefore, although withdrawal of milk from crossbred <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> significantly reduced the growth rate of the calves, acceptable weights at weaning in the range of 120 to 140 kg were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Since {{decoupling}} of the CAP, many Scottish <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> {{farms are}} facing financial difficulties. In response, many farmers are out-wintering extensively managed <b>suckler</b> <b>cows</b> to minimise production costs. These systems are of animal welfare concern. A range of trade-offs between animal welfare indicators and between animal welfare and farm profitability can be identified. A Dynamic Programming (DP) model {{was developed to}} study these trade-offs. Two herds were modelled assuming their feeding regimes were either low (LHERD) or high (HHERD). The objective of the DP was to maximise the expected net margin from a current cow and its successors over an infinite time horizon. Preliminary {{results showed that the}} rate of voluntary culling was higher in HHERD than in LHERD. Animals in HHERD had shorter life expectancy. The expected net present value was 58 % lower in LHERD than HHERD (-¬£ 41. 5 and - ¬£ 24. 3 respectively). These results suggest a heavier culling rate and shorter longevity for animals in HHERD that compromises animal welfare. Also HHERD had a greater implied stocking density than LHERD. This increase of the cows‚Äô population may adversely affect the environment. The presented model provides some of the basic information required to explore some of the trade-offs between farm profit, animal welfare and the environment.

30|$|Upland farm cattle are {{predominantly}} <b>suckler</b> <b>cow</b> herds {{which are used}} to produce beef calves. While the hardy breeding animals can graze the moor all year-round, their progeny will usually graze the hills only during the summer, and in winter they will be moved down to lower-lying pastures, prior to sale off the holding or recruitment into the breeding flock or herd, in the following year. Commonly, grazing land for these young stock was provided on upland dairy farms often located in the valley bottoms, where the milking herd was generally kept indoors through the winter.|$|R
40|$|Livestock production, and {{especially}} beef production, {{has a major}} impact on the environment. Environmental impacts, however, vary largely among beef systems. Understanding these differences is crucial to mitigate impacts of future global beef production. The objective of this research, therefore, was to compare cradle-to-farm-gate environmental impacts of beef produced in contrasting systems. We reviewed 14 studies that compared contrasting systems using life cycle assessment (LCA). Systems studied were classified by three main characteristics of beef production: origin of calves (bred by a dairy <b>cow</b> or a <b>suckler</b> <b>cow),</b> type of production (organic or non-organic) and type of diet fed to fattening calves...|$|R
