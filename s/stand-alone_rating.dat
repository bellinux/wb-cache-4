40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the funding advantage {{afforded by the}} joint liability scheme to German Landesbanken. The advantage is estimated by computing the difference between Moody's baseline credit assessment (BCA), representing the <b>stand-alone</b> <b>rating,</b> and the adjusted BCA incorporating group support assumptions. This notch advantage is then multiplied by time-varying yield spreads between the respective notches and the rating-dependent liabilities. Our methodology {{estimates the}} funding advantage that remains when governmental support for banks formerly considered 'Too Big to Fail' (TBTF) is substantially reduced or even abolished. We find a substantial monetary funding advantage due to group support assumptions, amounting on average to a multiple of the Landesbanken's aggregated annual profits. The aggregated observations mask a distinct heterogeneity, {{with some of the}} banks being significantly more exposed to the funding advantage than others...|$|E
40|$|In {{the fight}} to reduce carbon emissions, {{it is easy to}} see the {{necessity}} of reducing energy consumption. Buildings consume a large amount of energy, and have significant potential for energy savings. One tool for realising these potential savings is building simulation. To be able to use building simulation, accurate models for windows are needed. The models include individual layer models, to determine the solar and longwave radiative behaviours, as well as whole-system models to determine heat flows through the various layers of fenestration systems. This thesis looks at both kinds of models for incorporating windows into building simulations. A new network whole-system model is implemented, and integrated into the California Simulation Engine building simulation software. This model is also used as the calculation engine for a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>rating</b> tool. Additionally, a measurement technique used to measure off-normal solar properties of drapery materials, as part of developing shading layer models, is investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The network model uses a very general resistance network, allowing heat transfer between any two layers in a complex fenestration system (CFS), whether they are adjacent or not, between any layer and the indoor or outdoor side, or between the indoor and outdoor sides, although this last case is unlikely. Convective and radiative heat transfer are treated using the same format, resulting in increased stability. This general resistance network is used to calculate indices of merit for the CFS using numerical experiments. This approach requires fewer iterations to solve than previous solution methods, and is more flexible. The off-normal measurement technique which was investigated used a sample holder inserted into an integrating sphere. This is a non-standard way of using an integrating sphere, and early analyses did not provide conclusive information as to the effect of the sample holder. A Monte Carlo analysis confirmed the amount of beam attenuation as being 20 % for the sample holder used in the experiments. Also con firmed was the effectiveness of dual-beam integrating spheres in correcting for the presence of a sample holder. The <b>stand-alone</b> <b>rating</b> tool which uses the general network framework, incorporates an easy-to-use visual interface. This tool models multiple types of shading layers with no restrictions on how they are combined. Users can easily change any one layer to see the effects of different arrangements. Users may specify any combination of indoor and outdoor ambient and mean radiant temperatures, insolation, and beam/diffuse split...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{prerequisites for}} {{and the results of}} unanimous monetary policy decisions in a monetary union consisting of heterogeneous members. The analysis is based on a multicountry version of Rogoff's model of the determination of monetary policy in the presence of supply shocks. It is shown that an international transfer system can be designed which creates consensus both on the average rate of inflation and the common response to asymmetric shocks to the participating economies. We conjecture that this kind of transfer mechanisms, institutionalized or informal, supporting joint decisions tend to evolve in contexts where there is strong aversion of disagreement. Monetary policy is arguably such a context, because frequent disagreement within the decision-making body could be harmful to credibility. The transfer system capable of supporting consensus on monetary policy can be based on activity-related, automatic subsidies for countries which would individually prefer lower inflation rates, and activity-related taxes for countries which would prefer higher inflation in absence of the transfer system. It turns out that the common monetary policy created by unanimous decisions under the supporting transfer mechanism can be characterized as a weighted average of the national "stand-alone" inflation rates, i. e. the rates which would prevail without the monetary union. The weights of the countries are not related to the sizes of the national economies, but rather to the national attitudes towards inflation and transfer income. Countries with a low <b>stand-alone</b> <b>rate</b> of inflation get a large weight in the determination of the common monetary policy, as do the countries which have a relatively low marginal valuation of international transfer income. positive inflation theory; monetary union; monetary policy...|$|R
40|$|Currently one of {{the most}} {{promising}} power solutions for remote rural areas and isolated islands which are far away from utility grid is the stand-alone solar photovoltaic (PV) renewable energy system or hybrid solar-wind power system. This paper presents the investigation results of a real remote solar PV project on an island in Hong Kong. The <b>stand-alone</b> PV system, <b>rated</b> at 19. 8 kWp, is established on a remote island for power generation to local residents. Power on this island was originally supplied by diesel generators and this new solar energy system has significantly reduced fuel costs and alleviated environmental pollution. The on-site entire system's operating data was collected for one whole year in 2011, and the energy performance of the PV array, inverters, battery bank and the entire PV system were analyzed in terms of daily energy balance, normalized performance parameters and overall system energy utilization ratio. The results from this long term system monitoring and its evaluation enables a detailed inspection of system operating performance with respect to the technical issues, which provides a useful reference for future applications of solar photovoltaics in remote islands.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Severely {{impaired}} {{patients with}} persisting intracranial occlusion despite standard treatment with intravenous (IV) administration of recombinant {{tissue plasminogen activator}} (rtPA) or presenting beyond the therapeutic window for IV rtPA may be candidates for interventional neurothrombectomy (NT). The safety and efficacy of NT by the Penumbra System (PS) were compared with standard IV rtPA treatment in patients with severe acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by large intracranial vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. METHODS: Consecutive AIS patients underwent a predefined treatment algorithm based on arrival time, stroke severity {{as measured by the}} National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and site of arterial occlusion on computed tomographic angiography (CTA). NT was performed either after a standard dose of IV rtPA (bridging therapy [BT]) or as single treatment (<b>stand-alone</b> NT [SAT]). <b>Rates</b> of recanalization, symptomatic intracranial bleeding (SIB), mortality, and functional outcome in NT patients were compared with a historical cohort of IV rtPA treated patients (i. e., controls). Three-month favourable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤ 2. RESULTS: Forty-six AIS patients were treated with NT and 51 with IV rtPA. The 2 groups did not differ with regard to demographics, onset NIHSS score (18. 5 ± 4 v 17 ± 5; P =. 06), or site of intracranial occlusion. Onset-to-treatment time in the NT and IV rtPA groups was 230 minutes (± 78) and 176. 5 (± 44) minutes, respectively (P =. 001). NT patients had significantly higher percentages of major improvement (≥ 8 points NIHSS score change at 24 hours; 26...|$|R
