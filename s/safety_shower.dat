40|$|Standards for {{overhead}} emergency <b>safety</b> <b>showers</b> {{used for}} decontamination in laboratories and production sites specify the spray pattern {{and the water}} flow rate. Up to now, {{there has not been}} a scientific basis for these requirements. The decontamination of water-soluble contaminants has been investigated using 15 customary shower heads at 20 to 110 L min- 1 water flow rate. A general relationship between water flow rate and decontamination effectiveness could not be established: At a flow rate of 30 L min- 1 the wash-off time in general did not exceed the time observed at considerably higher flow rates. The shortest decontamination time has been found with a spray pattern that does not fulfill current standards...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{exposure}} to hazardous materials, in many industrialenvironments and in everyday life due {{to the possibility of}} terrorist attacks,is widely recognised. It is therefore pertinent to have robustdecontamination equipment to limit the effects of hazardous materials andin turn protect human life and assets.

40|$|A novel mobile {{fine spray}} unit, utilising a Spill-Return AtomiserÂ® (SRA) has been {{designed}} and developed {{for the purpose of}} decontamination within healthcare environments. The unit is able to spray uniformly onto any given surface, providing 'mist like' coverage. The high liquid pressure fine spray swirl atomiser that has been developed incorporates a spill-return orifice into the rear face of the swirl chamber with the aim of giving a significant reduction in flow rate whilst maintaining droplet size. Initial work modified a commercial atomiser to add spill-return. However drop sizes were considered to be too large and a new design was constructed based upon earlier work on efficient high pressure (up to 12 MPa) swirl atomisation. The atomiser was characterised for different geometries, supply pressures and spill return orifice sizes using a Laser Particle Sizer (Malvern Mastersizer-X) and Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). Spill-Return Swirl Atomiser (SRA) with a long swirl chamber was also designed and experimentally tested. This was found to have a direct reflection on the control of spray characteristics and the determination of the coating performance of the SRA on various surfaces in achieving the desired efficiency in the disinfection procedure. The subsequent coating and coverage produced by the SRA was analysed both quantatively and qualitatively via a range of test procedures. The investigation has found that the utilisation of fine sprays (15 um<D 32 < 25 um) at high liquid pressure (< 12 MPa) and low flow rates (< 0. 3 1 /min) is indeed suitable for surface disinfection in healthcare applications (i. e. MRSA, VRSA etc.). Moreover, the resulting fine sprays can be used for various applications such as humidification, cleaning, coating, cooling and decontamination.

40|$|On December 23, 1991, the U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) and the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) {{agreed to}} adhere to the {{provisions}} of Department of Ecology Consent Order No. DE 91 NM- 177 (Consent Order). The Consent Order lists regulatory milestones for liquid effluent streams on the Hanford Site to comply with the permitting requirements of Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 216, State Waste Discharge Permit Program, or WAC 173 - 21 8, Washington Underground Injection Control Program, where applicable. Hanford Site liquid effluent streams discharging to the soil column are categorized in the Consent Order as follows: Phase I Streams; Phase II Streams; and Miscellaneous Streams. Phase I and Phase II Streams are addressed in two reports: Plan and Schedule to Discontinue Disposal of Contaminated Liquids into the Soil Column at the Hanford Site (DOE-RL 1987), and Annual Status of the Report of the Plan and schedule to Discontinue Disposal of Contaminated Liquids into the Soil Column at the Hanford Site (WHC-EP- 0196 - 1). There originally were 33 Phase I and Phase II Streams; however, some streams have been eliminated. Miscellaneous streams are those liquid effluent streams discharged to the ground that arc not categorized as Phase I or Phase II Streams. Source waters of miscellaneous streams originate directly from the Columbia River, from treated Columbia River water, or from groundwater and demineralized water. Miscellaneous streams result primarily from source water used in processes such as cooling, hydrotesting, and steam generation. Miscellaneous streams also occur through the use of these source waters for maintenance and construction activities such as draining, flushing, and washing. Miscellaneous streams discharging to the soil column on the Hanford Site were subject to the requirements of several milestones identified in the Consent Order (DE 91 NM- 177). The Plan and Schedule for Disposition and Regulatory Compliance for Miscellaneous Streams (DOE/RL- 93 - 94) provides for the disposition of miscellaneous streams to satisfy one of the Consent Order Section 6 requirements. Additional commitments established in the plan and schedule (Activity 6. 2. 3, 6. 2. 4, and 6. 2. 6) were to submit WAC 173 - 216 Categorical State Waste Discharge Permit applications for hydrotest, maintenance, and Construction waste water, cooling water and condensate, and storm water discharges. Activity 6. 2. 5 required the submittal of a WAC 173 - 216 Categorical State Waste Discharge Permit application for surface water discharges from coal ramp washdown, vehicle washing, and <b>safety</b> <b>shower</b> discharges. However, through stream elimination and through permitting streams under existing Categorical Permits, Ecology agreed to eliminate the requirements under activity 6. 2. 5...|$|E

40|$|The pace {{at which}} change is {{occurring}} {{in the life of}} human beings, due to technological advancement, could be described as logarithmic. This fast-paced change is not just of consequence to the individual, but to countries, governments, companies, big and small systems like villages and sports clubs and the like, as well. This study case was inspired by the fact that what was a little-known threat yesterday, could suddenly become a crippling matter. It is, therefore, critical for individuals and businesses to consider risk not just in the usual context but with an open mind. This is especially true for systems in the Third World or developing nations where evolutionary stages of advancement and development are known to have been skipped due to forced or influenced adoption by the advanced or First World dictates. An example is the adoption of Carbon Emission Minimisa tion Pacts that have also been mooted for developing nations, even though their participation in causing the past Industrial Revolution pollution was minimal. A small operation in the Eastern Cape may, today, see no need to attract an overseas customer, not realising that the local customer may enter a merger or be bought out by an international organisation which would demand international protocols on the local supplier. Such is the risk with Globalisation. Local businesses should embrace global competitive practices for sustainability in the global business arena that is surely upon the business place today and the short term. South African businesses are no longer protected by the country borders, or the government and political systems such as the apartheid-born sanctions and tariff regimes. The objective of this study of Legionella bacteria risk management by business firms in the Eastern Cape (East London and Border Areas) is to obtain an insight into how they fare on one of the risks that, in Europe, is legislated and, {{in many parts of the}} First World, is regarded as fundamental. Beside the globalisation issues mentioned above, the South African workforce has been noted as highly affected by HIV and TB, which are symptomatic of people susceptible to Legionnaireâs Disease. The high cost and skills shortage in the South African industry demand great care in order to prevent further loss, due to sick absenteeism or the death of workers. The study included a comprehensive literature review of issues around Legionella bacteria in industrial operations and how ill effects could be prevented and managed. A questionnaire was then drawn up and used to check for awareness, capability and ascertain what motivational factors could influence Legionella risk management by businesses in the geographical study area. All businesses with facilities utilising water cooling towers, <b>safety</b> <b>showers,</b> waste water treatment plants, humidifier air conditioning and water fountains, were presented with the questionnaire. A 56 percent return was achieved and responses were processed and analysed using Microsoft Excel on a Windows XP computer package. The findings showed that there was a poor awareness of Legionella bacteria and the risk they posed, a factor that may be used to explain the poor questionnaire returns. The capability assessment also showed a weak status. Legislation, proof of outbreak and fines were determined as effective would-be motivators for full Legionella risk management. The study concluded with recommendations for awareness programmes by interested bodies like the Legionella Action Group, Department of Labour and companies providing Legionella consulting services. While legislation and, therefore, fines, were not yet applied in South Africa, the drive for employee and community welfare should be adequate motivating factors for businesses to manage Legionella risk. Foreign capital inflow into the South African economy was also a factor that should be considered by businesses that looked to expand and need to access these funds through mergers or acquisitions. These funds would require financial as well as technical audits that show adequate risk protection...|$|R
