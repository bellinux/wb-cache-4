40|$|Fresh fecal {{material}} that {{was free of}} ova and parasites was pooled with 10 % Formalin in a 1 : 4 ratio to prepare a standard specimen. Portions of 100 ml of this specimen were individually seeded with Cryptosporidium oocysts, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia cysts; ova of Necator americanus; and Strongyloides larvae. Appropriate volumes of each parasite suspension were {{used to evaluate the}} Fecal Concentrator Kit (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.), Fecal Parasite Concentrator (Evergreen Scientific, Los Angeles, Calif.), Para-Pak Macro-Con (Meridian Diagnostics, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio), and Trend FeKal CON-Trate (Trend Scientific, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.). A standardized gauze filtration method was used as the reference procedure. Tests were performed in triplicate with each individual parasite-concentrator combination, with three <b>slides</b> examined <b>from</b> each <b>sediment.</b> All of the systems effectively concentrated parasites compared with direct examination of unconcentrated fecal material. The Fecal Concentrator Kit provided the best overall performance. Clarity of sediment, lack of debris, and uniformity of background material were found to be important considerations for microscopic detection of parasites in concentrated specimens...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the release}} of {{hydrophobic}} organic contaminants (HOCs) <b>from</b> <b>sediment</b> by in-situ benthic flow-through chambers • Good agreement between HOC flux measurements from triplicate flow-through chambers. • Higher flux of HOCs was measured by flow-through chambers than reported flux measurements done by closed chambers. • Installing and testing of a GF-filter to separate particulate and dissolved fraction of HOCs, in progress. • Increase battery capacity for longer sampling duration, and lower detection limits. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK • Dissolved HOCs released <b>from</b> <b>sediment</b> inside chamber are collected onto sorbent (PUF). • Particle-bound HOCs suspended <b>from</b> <b>sediment</b> inside chamber are collected on filter (GFF). • Oxygen levels in chamber are kept at ambient conditions by water flow, and bioturbation activity remains unaltered. • Incoming water is stripped of its content of HOCs using PUF. METHOD • Develop flow-through benthic chamber for assessment of {{the release of}} HOCs <b>from</b> <b>sediment.</b> • Measure the release of HOCs <b>from</b> <b>sediment</b> to water under close-to-natural conditions. • Assess the effects of bioturbation on the release of HOCs <b>from</b> <b>sediments.</b> OBJECTIVE & SCOPE • HOCs are released <b>from</b> <b>sediment</b> to water. • Bioturbation increases the release of HOCs <b>from</b> <b>sediment</b> to water. • In-situ measurements of the release of HOCs <b>from</b> <b>sediment</b> to water related to bioturbation have not been done previously...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} benthic algae on soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) release <b>from</b> <b>sediments</b> in shallow lakes, experiments on SRP release with and without benthic algae in sediment cores and an experiment on SRP uptake by benthic algae were conducted using the radioisotope (32 P) tracing method. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in sediment cores was also investigated. The results show that benthic algae effectively reduce the release of SRP <b>from</b> <b>sediments</b> to overlying water. The uptake of SRP by benthic algae, which is the direct way in which benthic algae affect the SRP release <b>from</b> <b>sediments,</b> is low in filtered water and increases with the SRP concentration. However, in the experiment, the increased uptake rate lasted {{for a short time}} (in one hour), and after that it returned to a low rate. Benthic algae make the DO concentration and the oxic layer thickness increased, which can indirectly reduce the SRP release <b>from</b> <b>sediments.</b> These findings indicate that benthic algae can reduce the SRP release <b>from</b> <b>sediments</b> in both direct and indirect ways. It seems that the indirect way also {{plays an important role in}} reducing the SRP release <b>from</b> <b>sediments...</b>|$|R
