25|$|A <b>smurf</b> <b>attack</b> {{relies on}} misconfigured network devices that allow packets {{to be sent}} to all {{computer}} hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network, rather than a specific machine. The attacker will send large numbers of IP packets with the source address faked to appear to be the address of the victim. The network's bandwidth is quickly used up, preventing legitimate packets from getting through to their destination.|$|E
2500|$|ICMP Echo Request attacks (<b>Smurf</b> <b>attack)</b> can be {{considered}} one form of reflected attack, as the flooding host(s) send Echo Requests to the broadcast addresses of mis-configured networks, thereby enticing [...] hosts to send Echo Reply packets to the victim. Some early DDoS programs implemented a distributed form of this attack.|$|E
50|$|A Smurf {{amplifier}} is {{a computer}} network that lends itself to being used in a <b>Smurf</b> <b>attack.</b> Smurf amplifiers act to worsen the severity of a <b>Smurf</b> <b>attack</b> because they are configured {{in such a way}} that they generate a large number of ICMP replies to the victim at the spoofed source IP address.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, many IP {{networks}} would participate in <b>Smurf</b> <b>attacks</b> if prompted (that is, they {{would respond to}} ICMP requests sent to broadcast addresses). The name comes {{from the idea of}} very small, but numerous, attackers overwhelming a much larger opponent (see Smurf). Today, administrators can make a network immune to such abuse; therefore, very few networks remain vulnerable to <b>Smurf</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
25|$|These {{collections}} of systems compromisers {{are known as}} botnets / rootservers. DDoS tools like Stacheldraht still use classic DoS attack methods centered on IP spoofing and amplification like <b>smurf</b> <b>attacks</b> and fraggle attacks (these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks). SYN floods (also known as resource starvation attacks) may also be used. Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes. Unlike MyDoom's DDoS mechanism, botnets can be turned against any IP address. Script kiddies use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users. More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools {{for the purposes of}} extortioneven against their business rivals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Generally {{to secure}} a network from denial-of-service to <b>Smurf</b> <b>attacks,</b> hackers that perpetrate exploits, it is {{necessary}} to perform the tasks like Searching for multiple strings in packet payloads, approximate string matching, IP traceback via probabilistic marking, IP traceback via logging, detecting worms, etc. To execute the tasks, many algorithms are used. Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS) are two standard search algorithms used to traverse any network. The search performance of these algorithms may differ node to node. i. e. The search performance of BFS may be better for some nodes and the search performance of DFS may be better for some other nodes. To search a particular node, only one algorithm is enough when it is better than the other. This paper gives an idea to select an algorithm for a node before start the search, such as the algorithm is better than the other algorithm in the aspect of search performance...|$|R
50|$|A fraggle {{attack is}} a {{variation}} of a <b>Smurf</b> <b>attack</b> where an attacker sends {{a large amount of}} UDP traffic to ports 7 (echo) and 19 (chargen) to an IP Broadcast Address, with the intended victim's spoofed source IP address. It works very similarly to the <b>Smurf</b> <b>attack</b> in that many computers on the network will respond to this traffic by sending traffic back to the spoofed source IP of the victim, flooding it with traffic.|$|E

The female <b>Smurfs</b> prepare an <b>attack</b> that night but instead of Gargamel, Papa Smurf appears, and the female Smurfs accept him into their home. Soon, Gargamel comes and destroys Smurfy Grove, {{capturing}} all the Smurfs, {{with the exception of}} Smurfette, who is now alone, feeling heartbroken for her actions. However, Snappy shows her a picture of her and the others, and she soon realizes she is not a real Smurf, and heads back to Gargamel's lair, then save the Smurfs.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{computer}} networks {{have been subject}} to widespread security attacks. Some are spoofing attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and its various forms (like ping <b>attacks,</b> <b>smurfing</b> etc), password sniffing, packet capturing along with traffic analysis and other wireless key cracking attacks. Many of these attacks steal someone's identity and use it for exploiting the victim or others by masquerading or forgery, made the network or computer system inoperable by interrupting normal services, created a back door for re-visits etc. In this paper we analyze some of these attacks and evaluate its effectiveness, concluding with some security recommendations...|$|R
50|$|Broadcasting may {{be abused}} {{to perform a}} type of DoS-attack known as a <b>Smurf</b> <b>attack.</b> The {{attacker}} sends fake ping requests with the source IP-address of the victim computer. The victim computer is flooded by the replies from all computers in the domain.|$|E

5000|$|... == Reasons for {{efficacy}} == Because of {{the history}} of ICMP attacks (like <b>Smurf</b> <b>Attack,</b> Ping flood, Ping of death), many ICMP packets are commonly blocked on firewalls.

50|$|The <b>Smurf</b> <b>attack</b> is a {{distributed}} {{denial-of-service attack}} in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address. Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim's computer will be flooded with traffic. This can slow down the victim's computer {{to the point where}} it becomes impossible to work on.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, a {{broadcast}} storm can be instigated {{for the purpose}} of a denial of service (DOS) using one of the packet amplification attacks, such as the <b>smurf</b> <b>attack</b> or fraggle attack, where smurf sends a large amount of ICMP Echo Requests (ping) traffic to {{a broadcast}} address, with each ICMP Echo packet containing the spoof source address of the victim host. When the spoofed packet arrives at the destination network, all hosts on the network reply to the spoofed address. The initial Echo Request is multiplied by the number of hosts on the network. This generates a storm of replies to the victim host tying up network bandwidth, using up CPU resources or possibly crashing the victim.|$|E
50|$|A {{principal}} {{limitation of}} standard broadcast wake-on-LAN is that broadcast packets {{are generally not}} routed. This prevents the technique being used in larger networks or over the Internet. Subnet directed broadcasts (SDB) {{may be used to}} overcome this limitation. SDB may require changes to intermediate router configuration. Subnet directed broadcasts are treated like unicast network packets until processed by the final (local) router. This router then broadcasts the packet using layer 2 broadcast. This technique allows a broadcast to be initiated on a remote network but requires all intervening routers to forward the SDB. When preparing a network to forward SDB packets, care must be taken to filter packets so that only desired (e.g. WoL) SDB packets are permitted — otherwise the network may become a participant in DDoS attacks such as the <b>Smurf</b> <b>Attack.</b>|$|E
40|$|Embedded {{systems are}} {{becoming}} a main solution to many specific tasks because of this high stability, minimal power consumption, portability and numerous useful. Nowadays, many new applications are developed using embedded system. This paper presents the possible usage, design and implementation on embedded Linux platform system for Intrusion Detection (<b>Smurf</b> <b>Attack</b> Detect). By applying these methods the embedded system is able to identify <b>Smurf</b> <b>attack</b> and analyze ICMP traffic. The software is executed on a Linux based Single Board Computer (SBC) which run TS-Linux 2. 4. 23 kernel. Results show that the Embedded Security Scan Detector (ESSD) unit managed to identify possible attack besides running on relatively low-end embedded platform. It is significant that network security product develop on embedded Linux has a very high market potential. Our test of the new systems shows satisfactory results for monitor and analyzes ICMP traffic and <b>Smurf</b> <b>Attack</b> detecting activity under such hardware limitations...|$|E

In IP Address Spoofing attack through ICMP, attackers use incorrect source IP addresses in attack packets (spoofed IP packets) to hide identity from victim, it also {{reduce the risk of}} trace-back and avoid detection. In this paper, we investigate the methods adopted in order to perform attacks through Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages, also known as <b>Smurf</b> <b>Attack.</b> We present the comparative analysis of the various solutions of <b>Smurf</b> <b>Attack...</b>|$|E

3000|$|The {{evaluation}} of proposed rule against KDD 99 [1] {{is done by}} considering two different approaches of reliability. The experiment focuses on detection of <b>smurf</b> <b>attack.</b> Hence, the frame of discernment is [...] = {smurf,-smurf, θ}. In KDD 99 dataset [1], total 1944 <b>smurf</b> <b>attack</b> is present. Table  2 shows the results of true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), positive prediction value (PPV) and negative prediction value (NPV) of Snort, Suricata, NETAD and PHAD as an individual IDS. Table  2 also shows the result of alert fusion of Snort, Suricata, NETAD and PHAD using Dempster–Shafer rule and the proposed rule. The results of fusion are derived by considering conflict between IDS evidence as a reliability factor. It can be observed from Fig.  2 that with alert fusion using proposed rule, the number of true negatives are higher compared to individual IDS, {{while there is a}} drastic {{reduction in the number of}} false positives. Figure  3 shows that the alert fusion with proposed rule drastically reduces the false positive rate (FPR) without affecting the true positive rate.|$|E
30|$|Recalling {{our main}} objective, {{that was to}} {{identify}} {{the existence of an}} attack through the sequences of the system calls. The results, which were presented in the previous section, have indeed verified that approach, since the comparison of the system calls triggered during the attack steps exhibits a much larger similarity than that produced when comparing the logs from some attack step and the respective logs for normal system operation. This assumption came true for all three steps of the “co-residence” attack and the <b>smurf</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
3000|$|Network {{stress is}} {{executed}} by launching a <b>smurf</b> <b>attack</b> [37] on a specially configured virtual network. In order {{to perform a}} <b>smurf</b> <b>attack,</b> the attacker needs the IPv 6 address of the victim. The victim can be the Host or any other Virtual Machine on the same network. His IPv 6 address can be obtained using two methods. The first one is via the ifconfig command, which can be executed on the Host. The second method is detecting IPv 6 -active hosts on the same network via the ping 6 command [38]. The attacker can easily ping the link-local all-node multicast address ff 02 :: 1 from any virtual machine by executing the command [...] "ping 6 -I[*]<[*]interface[*]>[*]ff 02 :: 1 ". After obtaining the IPv 6 address, the attacker can use the smurf 6 tool to perform the attack, executing the command [...] "smurf 6 [*]<[*]interface[*]>[*]victim_ipv 6 _address". Through this method the attacker VM (or the Host) will flood the Virtual Network with spoofed ICMPv 6 echo request packets, the source address {{of which is the}} IPv 6 address of the victim machine and destination address is the link-local all-node multicast address ff 02 :: 1. Then the remaining machines on the same network will flood the victim with ICMPv 6 echo replies, thus stressing the virtual network even more.|$|E

The paper provides {{a detailed description of the}} design and operation of the algorithms used by the active routers and demonstrates how this approach is able to defeat a SYN and <b>SMURF</b> <b>attack.</b> Other approaches to network design, such as the introduction of a firewall and intrusion detection systems, can be used to protect networks, however, weaknesses remain.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to find out if someone has intrusion into or is trying to get it the network. One big problem is amount of Intrusion which is increasing day by day. We need to know about network attack information using IDS, then analysing the effect. Due to the nature of IDSs which are solely signature based, every new intrusion cannot be detected; so it is important to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) methods / techniques in IDS. Introduction of AI necessitates the importance of normalization in intrusions. This work is focused on classification of AI based IDS techniques which will help better design intrusion detection systems in the future.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 51) LiteSwitch is {{a remote}} power management tool {{that controls the}} power states of machines via a web interface, relying on an agent that runs on the host machines and the Wake-on-LAN protocol. The aim is to reduce wasteful power consumption, thus lowering costs and carbon dioxide emissions. This paper details the project life-cycle in developing a first iteration of LiteSwitch including all core functionality. There are numerous additional features that could be added in future iterations. Some unexpected limitations to Wake-on-LAN were discovered. The reliable routing of magic packets across subnets is not possible given the default configuration of most routers. This is because magic packets are most readily addressed as subnet directed broadcasts, and due to a security threat known as a <b>smurf</b> <b>attack,</b> routers in their default configuration do not route subnet directed broadcasts. Various potential remedies and work-arounds are suggested, including a configuration strategy for routers that would allow for the routing of magic packets while still preventing harmful subnet directed broadcasts from being routed. Options {{that do not require}} any configuration of the network are also explored. It was also discovered that Apple iMac's network interface cards do not support the ability to wake the machine from a shutdown state. As this is a hardware issue there is little {{that can be done to}} circumvent the problem. OS X does allow for an iMac to be woken from a sleeping state by magic packet. Therefore LiteSwitch is able to send iMacs to sleep and still be able to wake them, or it can shut them down remotely but then it will lose control of that machine until it is turned on manually...|$|E
