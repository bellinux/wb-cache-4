40|$|Introduction. In Sub-Saharan Africa, {{excessive}} foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> {{is commonly}} associated with cephalopelvic disproportion and obstructed labour. This study set out to determine the associations of maternal pelvis height and maternal height with intrapartum foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding.</b> Methods. This was a multisite secondary analysis of maternal birth records of mothers with singleton pregnancies ending in a spontaneous vertex delivery. A summary {{of the details of}} the pregnancy and delivery records were reviewed and analysed using multilevel logistic regression respect to foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding.</b> The alpha level was set at P< 0. 05. Results. 412 records were obtained, of which 108 / 385 (28 %) observed foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding.</b> There was a significant reduction in risk of foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> with increasing maternal height (Adj. IRR 0. 97, P= 0. 05), maternal pelvis height (Adj. IRR 0. 88, P< 0. 01), and raptured membranes (Adj. IRR 0. 10, P< 0. 01). There was a significant increased risk of foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> with increasing birth weight (Adj. IRR 1. 90, P< 0. 01) and duration of monitored active labour (Adj. IRR 1. 21, P< 0. 01) in the final model. Conclusion. This study showed that increasing maternal height and maternal pelvis height were associated with a significant reduction in intrapartum foetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that happens {{during the process of}} human childbirth. Due to the highly deformable fetal scalp being in contact with the maternal anatomy, the shape of the fetal head changes. This can be benefi�cial when the fetal head dimensions are very similar to the dimensions of the female pelvis hence allowing the baby to progress safely through the birth canal. Conversely, excessive <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> may have serious eff�ects on the baby's wellbeing. The fi�rst part of this thesis presents a computer-based �finite element model of fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> as an improvement on previously developed models. The second part of the research focuses on another cause of potentially excessive fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding,</b> i. e. the incorrect use of obstetric instruments including the obstetric forceps and the ventouse (vacuum extractor). The degree of damage that may be caused by incorrectly placing a forceps (i. e. asymmetric placement of the blades) or a ventouse (i. e. placement on top of soft parts of the skull such as the fontanelles) was assessed by means of fi�nite element analysis after developing a set of software tools to facilitate these experiments. The fi�nal results of this research included: an improved and more realistic model of fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> under conditions of normal delivery, and results that reveal the great potential of severe damage that obstetric forceps and/or the ventouse may cause to the baby's head when applied incorrectly...|$|R
40|$|Fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> is a {{phenomenon}} which may contribute to satisfactory progress during delivery as it allows the fetal head to accommodate to the geometry of the passage. In contrast, excessive <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> may result in cranial birth injuries and thus affect the infant shortly or even long after birth. One group of researchers in the past investigated the biomechanics of fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding</b> from an engineering {{point of view and}} limited themselves to a static, linear model of the parietal bones. In this paper, we present a non-linear model of the deformation of a complete fetal skull, when subjected to pressures exerted by the cervix, during the first stage of labour. The design of the model involves four main steps: shape recovery of the fetal skull, the generation of a valid and compatible mesh for finite element analysis (FEA), the specification of a physical model and the analysis of deformation. Results of the analysis show good agreement with those obtained from clinical experiments on the quantitative assessment of fetal <b>head</b> <b>moulding.</b> The model also displays shapes after moulding which have been reported in previous studies and which are generall...|$|R

On one hand, consumers’ behaviour is more selective; On the other hand, brassiere design and development cycle are getting shorter and shorter. <b>Mould</b> <b>head</b> design {{is a key}} process in producing brassieres. A master cone which is the prototype of the <b>mould</b> <b>head</b> can be developed by a novel parametric method.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) is {{a common}} and serious obstetric condition, {{especially}} in sub-Saharan Africa. Recognition relies on clinical observations, such as cervical dilatation, <b>head</b> descent, <b>moulding,</b> and size of fetus, all made in a trial of labour. No prospective studies have investigated intrapartum clinical observations and their predictive value for CPD. The objectives of this research were 1) to determine the association of intrapartum clinical findings, especially level of <b>head</b> and <b>moulding,</b> with the outcome of CPD, 2) to determine inter-observer agreement of these findings between clinicians, and 3) to compare intrapartum clinical palpation with symphysis-fundal height (SFH) measurement in the prediction of birth weight. A prospective cross-sectional comparative study {{was done in the}} Chris Hani Baragwanath labour ward, a large referral centre. The subjects were women at term, in the active phase of labour, with vertex presentations. The author, blinded to previous clinical or ultrasound findings, performed clinical assessments {{at the same time as}} the women’s attending clinicians. His observations were not divulged to the clinicians and he did not participate in obstetric management of the women. The primary outcome measures were CPD, defined as caesarean section for poor progress, and birth weight. Five hundred and eight women were examined, of whom 113 (22. 2...|$|R

5000|$|The 1990s 12" [...] Action Man {{was closer}} in {{construction}} {{to the poor}} quality imitations of the original line; very limited articulation, with equipment not to scale (see illustration below). The hands could not really grasp any of the accessories. These figures were essentially G.I. Joe Hall of Fame bodies with {{a different set of}} <b>head</b> <b>moulds,</b> some of which had [...] "fuzzy" [...] hair. Later examples improved on the articulation, depending on the price point. The figures were marked [...] "©Hasbro International 1993" [...] across the buttocks. Some came with blue shorts, reminiscent of the late 70s-80s body. The articulation of neck, waist, arms and legs varied as mentioned. Some, like Tiger Strike (see below) have rubber legs, no waist, elbow or wrist pivot, and a head that only looks left/right. Even the more articulated versions cannot compare to the range of motion offered by their early predecessors; for example, the knee/ankle joints only pivot up/down; they do not rotate, and the waist does not allow for rotate and [...] "lean" [...] to the extent possible with earlier figures. The feet on all body variants are like Barbie; not to scale with the body. Unfortunately, these bodies are also grossly overweight in comparison, {{and as a result of}} this and the small feet, they are much more difficult to pose freestanding. The more articulated bodies were also of a harder plastic, rather than the softer vinyl/rubber used for basic figure limbs that were similar to Barbie's [...] "Ken". Basic figures were available in a variety of configurations such as Tiger Strike and Sport Extreme, as well as deluxe sets such as Sky Dive, CrimeBuster and Raid and Roller Extreme. The more expensive sets contained the more articulated figures.|$|R
