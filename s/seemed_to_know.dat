5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} neither he nor anyone else <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{were once}} again criticized for poor {{tackling}} and conservative play-calling following a loss to a previously winless St. Louis Cardinals team. This time, complaints came from the players as the Cardinals <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in advance which plays the Buccaneers would be running, and the Buccaneers waited until {{too late in the}} game to make adjustments. The Buccaneers led early, after Steve DeBerg's touchdown pass to Calvin Magee on a fake field goal. Steve Young's rushing and passing combined for 304 of the Buccaneers' 347 yards. The Cardinals unexpectedly used a soft zone defense instead of their usual blitzing, which contributed to Tampa Bay's decision to avoid the passing game until the fourth quarter. The Cardinals put the game away with Stump Mitchell's 31-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run, in which three Buccaneers missed tackles. Ron Holmes, Jeremiah Castille, Marvin Powell, and Gerald Carter all missed the game with injuries.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, Kaspersky {{discovered}} the Red October malware, {{which had been}} used for widespread cyber-espionage for five years. It targeted political targets like embassies, nuclear sites, mostly in Europe, Switzerland and North America. The malware was likely written by Russian-speaking hackers and the exploits by Chinese hackers. That June, Kaspersky discovered NetTraveler, which it said was obtaining data on emerging technology from government targets and oil companies. Kaspersky did not identify who was behind it, but it was similar to other cyber-espionage coming from Beijing, China. Later that same year, Kaspersky discovered a hacker group it called Icefog after investigating an cybersecurity attack on a Japanese television company. Kaspersky said the hacker group, possibly from China, was unique in that they targeted specific files they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about before planting malware to extract them.|$|E

500|$|In 1957, Drake {{was sent}} to Eagle House School, a preparatory {{boarding}} school in Berkshire. Five years later, he went to Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire, attended by his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He developed an interest in sport, becoming an accomplished sprinter over 100 and 200 yards, representing the school's Open Team in 1966. He played rugby for the C1 House team and was appointed a House Captain in his last two terms. School friends recall Drake at this time as having been confident and [...] "quietly authoritative", while often aloof in his manner. His father Rodney remembered, [...] "In one of his reports [...] said {{that none of us}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him very well. All the way through with Nick.

[...] On 1 August 1940, Galland {{was awarded the}} Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (...) for his 17 victories. Galland continued to make fighter sweeps over southern England before the main assault opened. On 11 August, Galland's unit engaged 74 Squadron. In a brief dogfight, one Spitfire was shot down. During these battles the RAF <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> just where and when to send their aircraft. This made Galland suspect {{a high level of}} organisation was at work controlling RAF fighters. The cloudy skies of Britain were a dangerous environment to confront an enemy that had an effective ground control system. Galland resolved to fly higher, where he could see most things and where the Bf 109 performed at its best.|$|E

500|$|Koechlin won The Hindus 2009 The MetroPlus Playwright Award {{along with}} Prashant Prakash for the play Skeleton Woman which they co-wrote, {{directed}} by Nayantara Kotian. The play {{is a modern}} adaptation of an Inuit folk tale about a writer; Koechlin played the protagonist's wife. It premiered at the Prithvi Theatre, Mumbai. Asmit Pathare of Mumbai Theatre Guide in his review wrote: [...] "The actors being the playwrights themselves, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what they were doing". She also co-wrote Colour Blind, a play that attempts to rediscover {{different aspects of the}} personality of Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore through his life and writings. In dual roles, Koechlin plays the Argentine writer and intellectual Victoria Ocampo (a close associate of Tagore), and a young woman who is writing a research paper on him. Aditi Sharma of Mumbai Theatre Guide calling Koechlin the [...] "star or the play" [...] noted that she [...] "really put in an effort to build her character and it shows".|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{watched the}} episode for TrekNation in August 2007, and {{described}} {{it as one of}} her favourite episodes from the first season. She thought it laid the groundwork for later episodes in The Next Generation, , and [...] regarding the Klingon culture. However, she felt that the drama seemed artificial and that the writers forced a situation where Worf had to kill one of the Klingons as if [...] "justifying the brutality as necessary for the good of Starfleet". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] also thought that the drama with Worf deciding whether or not to join the Klingons was problematic. He thought {{it was hard to believe}} that the crew <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Worf as little as they did at this point in the series, but praised it for being the starting point for all future Klingon-based stories in the franchise. He gave it a score of three out of four.|$|E
