40|$|Different {{types of}} {{laterally}} extensive sand- and gravel-dominated deposits, {{up to several}} tens of metres thick, were investigated in the Suupohja area of western Finland. The studied sediments were deposited in glacial, ice-marginal, glaciofluvial, sea or lake, littoral and terrestrial environments during several glacial-non-glacial cycles. Seventeen pre-Late Weichselian and three Late Weichselian/Holocene sedimentary units were identified. These were divided into ten formally and two informally defined formations that were together termed the Suupohja Group. Every unit are nevertheless not detectable throughout the study area. The informally defined “Karhukangas lower deposits” represent the lowest units in the Suupohja Group. The Karhukangas lower deposits with 5 till units, 3 glaciolacustrine/-marine units and 2 sand units, were interpreted as having been deposited during possibly four glacial-non-glacial cycles before the Late Pleistocene Subepoch (MIS 6 or earlier). The Kankalo Sand above the Karhukangas lower deposits comprises glaciofluvial and aeolian sands of Late Saalian, Eemian or Early Weichselian origin (MIS 6 –MIS 5 c). The Kariluoma Till above the Kankalo Sand was possibly deposited during the Late Saalian glacial advance, although an Early Weichselian origin is also possible. The Harrinkangas Formation, with glaciofluvial and quiet-water sediments, is interpreted as having been deposited during the Late Saalian and Eemian Stages (MIS 6 –MIS 5 e). The uppermost units in the deposits studied, the Kodesjärvi <b>Formation</b> (<b>shore</b> deposit), Isojoki Sand (aeolian), Rävåsen Formation (glaciofluvial), Vanhakylä <b>Formation</b> (<b>shore</b> line deposit), Dagsmark Till and Kauhajoki Till, were deposited during the Weichselian Stage (MIS 5 d–MIS 2). In addition, Early Holocene (MIS 1) eskers without till cover were informally termed the “Holocene esker deposits”. The Lumikangas <b>Formation</b> represents gravelly <b>shore</b> deposits formed in the Holocene Epoch, when these areas last emerged from the sea. The first Weichselian ice expansion possibly reached {{the western part of}} Suupohja in the Early Weichselian Substage (MIS 5 d?), but it did not expand further to the east. The second Weichselian glaciation of relatively short duration occupied the southern part of Finland in the later part of Middle Weichselian (MIS 3). Thus, the southern half of the country remained ice-free for the majority (~ 65 – 75 %) of the Weichselian Stage. Instead, both humid temperate and periglacial conditions alternated. In the initial part of Middle Weichselian, this area was partly submerged, which indicates eastward expansion of the Scandinavian ice sheet(s), depressing the lithosphere. The exceptionally thick sediment cover, multiple lithofacies, relict landscape and preserved preglacially weathered bedrock are evidence of weak glacial erosion in the Suupohja area during the latest as well as earlier glaciations, making this area one of the key areas in Quaternary research...|$|R
40|$|Background. Kivalina is a {{northwest}} Alaska {{barrier island}} village of 400 people vulnerable to storm surges exacerbated recently by delayed winter sea and <b>shore</b> ice <b>formation.</b> The village has no in-home piped water or sewage; the &#x 201 C;washeteria&#x 201 D; {{is the only}} structure providing public showers, laundry facilities and flush toilets. In October 2004, a storm damaged the washeteria septic system resulting in prolonged facility closures. We assessed rates of gastrointestinal, respiratory and skin infections potentially impacted by prolonged washeteria closures. Methods. We obtained washeteria closure dates from 2003 to July 2009 and defined &#x 003 E; 7 day closure as prolonged. We received de-identified data on all Kivalina clinic visits from 2003 to 2009 and selected visits with ICD- 9 diagnosis codes for respiratory, skin, or gastrointestinal infection; subsequent same patient/same illness-category visits within 14 days were excluded. We compared annual visit rates, for all ages combined, before (2003 &#x 2013; 2004) and after (2005 &#x 2013; 2009) the &#x 201 C; 2004 &#x 201 D; storm. Results. The washeteria had prolonged closures for 34 days (4. 7 %) in the 2 years 2003 &#x 2013; 2004 and 864 days (51. 7 %) between January 2005 and July 2009. Closures ranged from 8 to 248 days. Respiratory infection rates declined significantly from 1. 32 visits/person/year in the 2003 &#x 2013; 2004 period to 0. 99 visits/person/year in the 2005 &#x 2013; 2009 period. There was {{a significant increase in}} skin infection rates after 2004, peaking at 0. 28 visits/person/year in 2007 and then declining significantly to 0. 15 visits/person/year in 2009. Gastrointestinal infection rates remained stable and low throughout (average: 0. 05 visits/person/year). No temporal association was observed between respiratory, gastrointestinal or skin infection rates and prolonged washeteria closures. Conclusion. The Kivalina washeteria was closed frequently and for extended periods between 2005 and 2009. Initial closures possibly resulted in increased skin infection rates. No increase in respiratory or gastrointestinal infections was noted. Evaluation of community adaptations to closures and other factors (e. g. childhood pneumococcal vaccination) would expand understanding of these findings...|$|R
40|$|Lord Howe Island, {{situated}} 600 k m east of Australia, {{provides a}} unique opportunity to study the development of rock coast landforms and the long-term planation of an oceanic island. The island is a remnant of a large shield volcano that was built by late-Miocene hotspot volcanism. Since this time, the island has gradually migrated northward into warmer seas, and marine planation, operating at a decreasing rate over time, has reduced the island to a vestige of the original volcano. Lord Howe Island currently lies at the southern limit to coral growth. A fringing coral reef has developed on only the western side of the island, such that one side of the island is very effectively sheltered from wave attack, while the other side is exposed to waves of unlimited fetch. The contrast between landforms on each of these coastlines provides a clear illustration of the importance of wave erosion in rock coast evolution: the reef-protected coastline consists of depositional beaches, vegetated hillslopes, diminutive cliffs, and basalt shore platforms that are veneered with talus, whereas the exposed coastline includes precipitous basalt cliffs up to 800 m high that are plunging or have cliff-foot talus slopes, and cliffs 200 m or less high that have actively eroding shore platforms. Variation in rock resistance also exerts a clear control on coastal morphology at Lord Howe Island. Rock resistance was assessed through Schmidt Hammer testing as well as measurements taken on discontinuities within rocks, and wave characteristics were assessed with bathymetric data and data on the local wave climate. At Lord Howe Island, talus slopes occur beneath cliffs where a critical size of cliff face has supplied sufficient talus to offset wave abrasion and removal of talus during the Holocene highstand. Plunging cliffs or shore platforms occur where source areas are smaller. In some areas, a critical depth of water prevents waves from breaking against the cliff face and plunging cliffs occur irrespective of rock resistance. Where water depths are shallower, however, plunging cliffs only exist if the resistance of rocks exceeds the assailing force of waves. In this respect, time is a crucial factor, as rock resistance is gradually degraded by weathering processes. Type B shore platforms have developed along sections of coast where the assailing force of waves has exceeded rock resistance. There is a close positive correlation between the elevation of shore platforms and nearshore water depth, and this indicates the important role of breaking waves in <b>shore</b> platform <b>formation</b> at Lord Howe Island. Several other factors indicate that platforms at Lord Howe Island have been strongly influenced by wave erosion, particularly the fact that platforms on the exposed coastline are wider than platforms on the lagoonal coastline. However, weathering processes become more important as platform width increases, and platforms become lower and flatter as they become wider. This thesis proposes a four-stage model of Type B, microtidal shore platform development at Lord Howe Island. The model attempts to synthesise divergent hypotheses in the literature with a time-based perspective of platform evolution...|$|R
40|$|In 1978 - 1995, the Caspian Sea {{was exposed}} to the {{intensive}} sea level rise by 2. 35 m after its long downing. It gave valuable material for investigations of coastal zones of various types and river deltas response to sea level fluctuations. The interpretation of multitemporal satellite images was used for analyzing of changes and compiling of maps of coastal ecosystems statement and dynamics for Kalmykian coastal zone in 1978 - 1991, 1991 - 1997, 1997 - 2001. They show that sea transgression to land, which was waiting with sea level rise, is not characteristic feature {{for this type of}} coasts with reed mudflats. Reed opposites flooding and boundary between reed weeds and sea changes are relatively weak. But wetting of reed mudflat lead to its large widening in the landward direction from 2 to 8 km. After 1995, when sea level rise stopped and gradually lowered, returning moving of reed mudflat band in the seaward direction has took place. This event again has began from back side of mudflat. So the back boundary of mudflats is more sensitive to sea level fluctuations than the front boundary between reed weeds and sea. The Caspian Sea level fluctuations also strongly influence on the river mouth processes, especially in large protruding deltas. Monitoring of the Caspian deltas was provided by space surveys for the Ural, Terek, Sulak, Kura river deltas. The analysis of created maps shows that the following changes during the sea level rise period are typical for protruding deltas of the Caspian Sea: flooding of low laying periphery parts; wave abrasion of more deep parts of the near <b>shore</b> slope and <b>formation</b> of spits from material of abrasion; formation of barrier-lagoon complex; hydrographical network reconstruction. Investigated features of the Caspian coastal zone and river deltas dynamics can be used as an analogue phenomenon for forecasting of processes which can take place in world coastal zones and river deltas in the case of proposed global significant sea level rise. 1...|$|R
40|$|Cyclone Isaac {{passed through}} the {{limestone}} and sand islands of the Ha 'apai and Tongatapu groups of the Kingdom of Tonga on 3 March 1982 and {{was probably the most}} severe storm experienced in southern Tonga in more than 100 years, causing extensive damage to buildings and crops. The limestone islands most affected by the storm are composed principally of reefal limestones, and the coastal terraces are late Pleistocene in age, many having been dated to the last Interglacial. There is little evidence of past storms preserved on the coast, and storm blocks and extensive rubble deposits on reef flats are rare or absent. The worst hit islands were in the Ha'apai group. Here the raised reefal limestone cliffsof the eastern shores of islands on the barrier reef resisted the storm, except for blocks of up to 2 m in diameter detached from the upper visor of a wave-cut notch on Ha'ano. Coastal scrub, however, was stripped,. coconut palms were felled and Pandanus was broken for more than 50 m on Ha'ano, 30 m on Lifuka, and locally on Foa and 'Uiha. Some regeneration of the dominant shrubs, Messerschmidia argent ea, Hibiscus ti/iaceus, and Bikkia tetrandra, was observed at the time of survey, 11 - 15 weeks after the storm. Both deposition and erosion were noted on pocket beaches between cliffs of reefal limestone, with at least 28 m 3 per m of sand removed from the beach face on one beach on Lifuka. The island of Tatafa was severely devastated; the cyclone had passed directly over the southern end, causing the sandy shoreline to retreat by 200 m, scouring a channel through the island, leaving scour holes on the western side, and destroying much of the coastal scrub. Tongatapu also sustained much damage to buildings and crops, and much of the north coast was flooded. The greatest change was observed to have occurred on sand cays off the northern coast. Four of these underwent change since a survey in 1969, and much of the change could have been attributed to Cyclone Isaac. The greatest change occurred on the smallest island, Manima, with coconut stumps left on the reef flat to the east indicating at least 12 m of shoreline retreat. On Oneata and Pangaimotu deep-rooted individuals of Excoecaria agallocha were left exposed more than 8 m on the eastern shore by destruction of the coastal scrub. On Makaha'a retreat of the shoreline was localized, and along much of the coast a sand cliff occurred which had changed little since it was mapped in 1969. Undercutting of the <b>shore</b> and <b>formation</b> of a sand cliff appear {{to be related to the}} presence of beachrock at the foot of the beach, and the storm did not cause much shoreline retreat. On the northern sand cays off Tongatapu patterns of change were variable. On Fafa recession occurred on the eastern and northeastern shore, but also occurred to the south, reflecting the configuration of the reef flat. Monuafe and Tufaka lost some scrub but the lack of woody vegetation meant that little evidence of former island shape remained. Deposition occurred on Malinoa, the sand cay nearest to the path of the storm, which is situated on a narrow reef flat and is open to a long fetch and deep water to the east. Few of the topographic changes brought about by Cyclone Isaac will remain for long before they are obscured, except the reshaping of Tatafa. Similarly, rapid regrowth of vegetation implies that coastal vegetation will soon be restored, but changes in composition may persist. Though Cyclone Isaac was a severe storm, a type which occurs infrequently, its effects on the coastal landforms and vegetation of Tonga appear to have been less than those of similar storms on more isolated atolls elsewhere in the Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Zonation, {{defined as}} {{biological}} distribution pattern along the vertical dimension, {{is the most}} obvious biological phenomenon in the intertidal zone throughout the <b>shore</b> globally. The <b>formation</b> of zonation involves many abiotic and biotic factors and underlying processes. Some early zonation schemes assumed that zonation patterns are merely controlled by tidal level, specifically" critical tidal levels". Later, based on observations of shores in {{different regions of the}} world, ecologists increasingly believed that "biological zones" would be more appropriate for describing zonation in the intertidal zone and this approach is accepted by most ecologists currently. But {{because of a lack of}} quantitative descriptions and criteria, "biological zones" cannot be assessed or described accurately for a practical guideline to be used in fieldwork around the world. Under the framework of hierarchical theory, different scales of sampling were conducted for revealing the zonation patterns by multivariate analysis techniques, including MDS, DCA and cluster analysis, based on a data set derived from a gentle sloping gravel flat in Daya bay, in South China. The results show that perception and interpretation of zonation is scale- dependent. A sampling grain (size of sample unit) along the vertical level which is greater than 10 cm appears adequate to identify zonation on this shore. Based on these results, zones were grouped under different scale schemes with the best groupings being those at the scale which has the largest discrepancy between zones and the smallest discrepancy within zones. The spatial patterns of abiotic and biotic variables were revealed using classic statistical methods (standardized Moristia Index) and spatial analysis techniques (Mantel correlation). Most dominant species were found to be significantly patchy, as were the environmental factors (sediment, shore height, etc.) measured. However, environmental factors displayed significant correlations with community structure, while most of the dominant species were significant related to community structure, except for vertical height which showed a significant correlation with community structure for most sample lags and for all sampling periods. In order to evaluate the relative contribution of different factors and underlying processes to zonation, the Mantel coefficients between community structure and vertical height, biological factors and spatial autocorrelation were subjected to path analysis and partial path analysis models using a variance partitioning approach. Three basic components were found to be significantly correlated with community structure, represented by spatial, vertical height and biological matrices. Variation in community structure determined by vertical height (Z) is equivalent to "critical tidal level", variation in community structure determined by interactions between biological factors and vertical height (ZB) is equivalent to "biological zone". The value of Z and the value of ZB, zonation scheme of "biological zone" is stronger than that of "critical tidal level". The large value of SZ, variation of community structure determined by the interaction between spatial autocorrelation and vertical height, indicated that zonation cannot solely interpreted in terms of "biological zones" and that the underlying mechanisms of zonation need to be explored further.
