40|$|The {{adhesive}} {{action of}} clays confronted during tunnel drives in which <b>slurry</b> <b>shields</b> are implemented has a devastating {{impact on the}} advance rate. This report evaluates past experiences of the clogging action of cohesive soils (clays) and introduces detailed examinations of adhesion between cohesive soils and steel surfaces. This allows good definition of sticky soils and also gives {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms that cause stickiness. The conclusions drawn out of experiences gained from past tunnel drives have been based upon the analysis of soil parameters. These enable forecasts to be made to the potential clogging effect (stickness) of clays. Furthermore, typical clogging forms and areas are introduced as well as current countermeasures to prevent them. The concepts for the laboratory tests to measure adhesion are based on thorough research and evaluation of existing publications. These also give insight of the fundamentals of soil adheshion, the technical possibilities to measure them as well as the large number of influencing factors. Laboratory test samples have partly been taken from tunnel drives and cover a wide spectrum of different mineralogical compositions. Shear and tension tests are carried out in order to measure tangential and normal adhesion. All surfaces of the samples and testing equipment (steel) are moistened, prior to sample placement, to simulate the interaction between clays and <b>shields</b> on <b>slurry</b> drives. The moistening of the test samples and equipment is carried out with water as well as other fluids with additives. The results of the adhesion tests show a clear dependence on the moistening time and the duration of contact between soil and steel. Further dependencies are found on the consistency of the clay and the composition of the moistening fluid. Significant correlations can be found between the adhesion and the mineralogical composition of a clay as well as its plasticity. Theoretical evaluations indicate that adhesion is created by differing water/fluid pressures in the soil pores and the surrounding. Previous moistening causes a film of water/fluid to be trapped between the clay and the steel surfaces. The swelling action of the clay absorbs part of the water film which causes suction and makes the clay stick to the steel surface. This effect not only applies to the excavation chamber of <b>slurry</b> <b>shields,</b> but also to all other soil handling activities in which water is present. The report includes advice which contributes to a better assessment of the adhesion of clays during the preparations of future tunnel drives in which <b>slurry</b> <b>shields</b> are to be implemented.

The proposed approach is successfully applied to develop six models for top risks in tunnel works. More than 30 tunneling experts in the Netherlands and Germany were involved in the investigation to provide information on identifying relevant scenarios than can lead to failure events associated with tunneling risks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In <b>slurry</b> or EPB <b>shields</b> a {{bentonite}} <b>slurry</b> or a foam may be injected by the TBM {{into the}} soil. These injections will displace {{part of the}} pore water before the TBM and, especially in fine sands, will cause excess pore pressures {{in front of the}} TBM, which lower the effective stresses in the soil and thereby the stability of the tunnel face. These excess pore pressures increase during boring and dissipate during stand-stills. Using a time-dependant groundwater flow model this behaviour has been included in a limit equilibrium model, in order to predict the pore pressures measured in front of the TBM. The results have been compared to field measurements. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{soft ground}} with very high water {{pressure}} or where ground conditions are granular (sands and gravels) {{so much so}} that a plug could not be formed in the Archimedes screw, <b>Slurry</b> <b>Shield</b> TBMs are needed. The cutterhead is filled with pressurised slurry which applies hydrostatic pressure to the excavation face. The slurry also acts as a transport medium by mixing with the excavated material before being pumped out of the cutterhead back to a slurry separation plant, usually outside of the tunnel. Slurry separation plants are multi-stage filtration systems, which remove particles of spoil from the slurry so that it may be reused in the construction process. The limit to which slurry can be 'cleaned' depends on the particle size of the excavated material. For this reason, slurry TBMs are not suitable for silts and clays as the particle sizes of the spoil are less than that of the bentonite clay from which the slurry is made. In this case, the slurry is separated into water, which can be recycled and a clay cake, which may be polluted, is pressed from the water.|$|E
50|$|In soft ground, {{there are}} three main types of TBMs: Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPB), <b>Slurry</b> <b>Shield</b> (SS) and {{open-face}} type. Both types of closed machines operate like Single Shield TBMs, using thrust cylinders to advance forward by pushing off against concrete segments. Earth Pressure Balance Machines are used in soft ground with less than 7 bar of pressure. The cutter head does not use disc cutters only, but instead an combination of tungsten carbide cutting bits, carbide disc cutters, drag picks and/or hard rock disc cutters. The EPB gets its name because it uses the excavated material to balance the pressure at the tunnel face. Pressure is maintained in the cutterhead by controlling the rate of extraction of spoil through the Archimedes screw and the advance rate. Additives such as bentonite, polymers and foam can be injected ahead of the face to increase {{the stability of the}} ground. Additives can also be injected in the cutterhead/extraction screw to ensure that the spoil remains sufficiently cohesive to form a plug in the Archimedes screw to maintain pressure in the cutterhead and restrict water flowing through.|$|E

40|$|For tunnels it is {{not only}} important, how the tunnel and the {{surrounding}} rock behave during the life time of the tunnel. It is also very meaningful to understand how the tunnel is behaving, while it is under construction. The basis for this thesis is to understand, how the tunnel behaviour, concerning deformation and stability, is for different rock conditions during the excavation process and what its influence is on the tunnel in final state. Additionally a case study is made of a praxis-example in Switzerland, in which it is pointed out, how difficult circumstances can be during the excavation and what measurements had to be done to cope with all the problems of excavating the tunnel. This example emphasises once more, how important a good understanding of rock behaviour during the excavation is. The report is built up in three more or less different sections: Chapters 2 to 4, chapters 5 and 6, and chapter 7. Chapters 2 to 4 form the first part, that is functioning as a basis for the calculations and analysis made in chapters 5 to 7. An analytical analysis about stress-deformation relations together with basic rock mechanic principles is worked out in chapter 2. Due to the complexity of the rock many rock classifications have been made to qualify different rock classes with their corresponding behaviour. One of these rock classes is used to obtain basic rock parameters, with which calculations are performed. This is, together with an description of different types a specific rock behaviour, outlined in chapter 3. An analytical approach for face stability problems is presented and further worked out in chapter 4. Chapters 5 to 6 are the main part with the calculations and the analysis, in which chapter 5 deals about the aspects, concerning the tunnel ring, and chapter 6 deals about the aspects, concerning the tunnel face. Basic rock calculation is given, about how the rock responds to the excavation of a tunnel. This calculating formed the basic for further calculations and research. The influence of different tunnel constructing aspects have been computed and compared with the basic rock-behaviour. In this way a good impression is obtained about how different constructing aspects, such as lining -constructed far away and close to the face-, pre-tunnelling, sequential excavation and rock improvement are performing in respect to stability and deformation of both the tunnel face and the tunnel lining. Chapter 7 is the case study of the Adler tunnel in Switzerland. Rock mechanical problems are analysed and described. It is also recapitulated, what measurements have been carried out to deal with the risen problems and how successful they were. The result of all these calculations for behaviour of the tunnel ring is, that lining gives an extensive reduction of the radial inward movement. The performance of the lining is at its most in the weakest rock and when the lining is constructed close to the face. The addition of a pre-tunnelled construction improves the performance in weaker rock. The deformation is further reduced. This is however not the case in good rock. In those cases pre-tunnelling should not be used, as it {{is a waste of time}} and money. An extra aspect of these performances is, that by reducing the lining the pressure on the lining is increased. The lining has to be dimensioned on these higher pressures. The most important aspect for the tunnel face is stability. Pre-tunnelling is not an option to stabilise the tunnel face. Grouting may introduce inadmissible tension stresses in the grouted area, which nullify the desired stabilisation. A good option for making the face more stabile is to excavate in sequences, because decreasing the diameter means a high reduction of the risk for face collapse. A stabile tunnel face is very much depending on the diameter of the tunnel, there where the depth of the tunnel determines the amount of plasticity around the tunnel face. Readers who are interested in typical geo-hydrological aspects of rock tunnelling, shield tunnelling, such as EPB and <b>Slurry</b> <b>Shields,</b> with counter pressures on the tunnel face, typical lining aspects, such as differences between different linings or the improvement of the lining strength in time, or time dependent behaviour of the rock are kindly requested to read other papers or reports.

40|$|Abstract. The {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics of}} clay are high cohesion and low permeability. For <b>slurry</b> <b>shield</b> tunnelling in clayey soils, favorable aspects are that slurry cake with low permeability {{can be established}} more easily and effectively at the excavation face thanks to clayâ€™s high cohesion, which is advantageous for stability of excavation face, and long stand-up time of clay offers enough time for backfilling of the tail void before collapse of surrounding soils, thus lessening ground volume loss. However, some typical problems are encountered due to clayâ€™s high cohesion and low permeability. One primary problem is the clogging of slurry pipeline, once in case of which, slurry pressure will fluctuate severely, thus inducing unstable condition at the excavation face. In extreme cases, the pipeline bursts and soils at the excavation face collapse towards the cutterhead for immediate drop of slurry pressure. Another common problem is clayâ€™s adhesion to the cutterhead, which weakens the excavation efficiency of cutterhead and limits advance rate of the shield machine. Tunnelling will inevitably disturb surrounding soils and excess pore water pressure occurs. In clayey soils, due to clayâ€™s low permeability, it usually takes {{quite a long time}} for the excess pore water pressure to disperse completely. The consolidation settlements associated with pore water dispersing account for {{a large percentage of the}} total settlements. Accumulated ground settlements threate...|$|E
40|$|The Aeschertunnel, a large noncircular shallow tunnel, was {{excavated}} using a jet grout arch {{for primary}} excavation support where glacial moraine was encountered. Surface deformations were monitored during jet grouting and as excavation {{of the top}} heading and bench proceeded. Observations of the construction process and the surface settlements suggest that the jet grouting arch limited the volume loss to 0. 35 %, similar to that achieved with <b>slurry</b> <b>shield</b> and EPB TBM. The surface settlement trough was considerably narrower than achieved using conventional tunneling methods. Numerical back-analysis suggests that the narrow settlement trough is created by localized shear bands induced by the over-pressure associated with the jet grout process. In soft ground tunneling the construction of large non-circular tunnels is particularly challenging. The construction method must provide worker safety as well as meet stringent design requirements. In an urban environment one of the design requirements is that the construction method must control surface settlement within specified tolerances. In Europe, a popular construction method for large non-circular tunnels utilizes sub-horizontal jet-grout columns to form a protective fan (vault) of cemented soil ahead of the excavation face. Jet-grouting has an advantage over many other construction techniques {{in its ability to}} be used in varying ground conditions and tunnel geometric configurations. The process of jet-grouting is a high energy process that replaces the soil with soil-cement slurry and, after hardening creates a 0. 6 m diameter column of soil-cement. As a result, in shallow tunnels the jet-grouting process may induce surface settlements that exceed the design requirements...|$|E
40|$|A tunnel is {{a passage}} way that carries people or {{vehicles}} {{to cross a}} destination that have obstruction or to shorten the travelling time. Tunnels in the olden days are used for mainly mining works. In the recent years as technology evolve with time, tunnels construction had become more commonly used transport routes in places that alternative solution such as roads or bridges impossible to be built or the costing is higher since there are obstruction to be accounted for in order to built the necessary routes. Tunnels are also used as rails links, vehicles and also as canals for water diversion. Most tunnels are built through a hill or mountain and underground below cities, roads, ocean or rivers. The constructions of tunnels are very complex because it involves precise and accurate planning. Tunnel construction depends mainly on geological study of the sub-surface before determining the type of construction method and costing involves. This is because the type of soil formation will determine the structural needs, types of machineries, suitability for that particular location to construct the tunnel and also the environmental impact on the society and the natural surrounding especially the sub-surface of the soils (e. g. underground streams and {{the stability of the}} soil). Tunnels are constructed all around in the world as the method of construction is getting more advances and this allows the tunnels that are impossible to build are now done. This thesis is mainly a study on the SMART Tunnel Project that is under construction in Malaysia.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} demand for new tunnels in respond to rapid growth in cities. Earth pressure balanced or <b>slurry</b> <b>shield</b> tunneling method is commonly used to construct tunnels in soft ground to improve stability and safety. Over the decades, many studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate active failure of tunnel face in sand and clay. However, investigation on passive failure of tunnel face is relatively rare. Failures of a compressed air section during construction of Dockland Light Railway extension and the 2 nd Heinenroord Tunnel during drilling imply that a systematic investigation on passive failure at tunnel face is required. The objectives of this study are to investigate passive failure and deformation mechanisms due to tunnelling in sand and clay by carrying out centrifuge model tests and numerical simulations together with plasticity and cavity expansion solutions. Centrifuge model tests were carried out for tunnels located at cover to diameter (C/D) ratios ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 0 in medium dense sand and soft clay. Three-dimensional finite element analyses were carried out to back-analyse the measured results. After calibrating the numerical tool, numerical parametric study was performed to extend the investigation to consider C/D in a wider range of 1. 0 to 6. 0. In addition, tunnels located at C/D ratio of 2. 0 in loose and dense sand were also included in the numerical parametric study to investigate effect of relative density. The measured and computed results are used to evaluate some existing upper bound and cavity expansion solutions in estimating passive failure pressure. Besides, Gaussion distributions are adopted to describe the induced surface heave. A localised failure mechanism associated with surface settlement is observed for shallow tunnel located at C/D of 2. 2 in loose sand due to soil compression. As initial relative density is increased, on the contrary, a funnel-type failure mechanism associated with surface heave is induced attributed to an increase in soil dilation. With an increase in C/D ratio resulting in an increase in confining stress around the tunnel, soil surrounding the tunnel becomes less dilative and hence a localised failure mechanism associated with surface settlement is induced in medium dense sand. The surface settlement trough become wider and shallower as C/D ratio is increased. In soft clay, funnel-type and localised failure mechanisms are observed for shallow and deep tunnel, respectively. It is found that surface heave due to passive failure is less significant for deep tunnel located in clay at C/D equal to or larger than 3. 0. It is observed that surface heave in clay may be described using a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. An average of 90 % degree of consolidation is reached about 1. 5 years after passive failure. For shallow tunnel, initial heave due to tunnel face displacement is beneficial in reducing subsequent consolidation settlement but induced extra consolidation settlement for deep tunnel. It is found that existing upper bound solution adopting a five-block failure mechanism may be used in estimating passive failure pressures for tunnels with a funnel-type failure mechanism. The upper bound solutions overestimate passive failure pressures for tunnels with localised failure mechanism but cavity expansion solutions is fairly consistent with measured and computed values for deep tunnel. This is attributed to large discrepancy between localised and five-block failure mechanisms. For tunnelling in clay, passive failure pressure is about two times of the initial vertical total stress at tunnel centreline...|$|E
40|$|The {{particular}} thesis has as {{an object}} to examine and analyze the geological and geotechnical conditions which are possible to be met by {{the face of the}} excavation of the tunnel of the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway construction from the Dimokratia station, which belongs to the main project, to Stauroupoli. From this analysis is going to be discussed the applicability of mechanized tunneling methods and the selection of the most appropriate for the excavation type of TBM. As a result of the complete development of the urban areas and the increase of private vehicle use in the recent years, the ability to construct roads which are going to cover the demand of quick and safe transport has been limited significantly. For this reason man has turned towards the exploitation of levels beneath the ground surface and the construction of underground, metropolitan railways in order to solve this problem. The construction of the Metropolitan Railway of Thessaloniki is an ambitious effort to fulfill this objective in a heavily urban environment while the main railway line consists of a 9. 6 km long tunnel and 13 stations. The extension to Stauroupoli, on which the thesis focuses on, consists of 5 stations and a 5 km long tunnel, {{which is going to be}} developed initially in a plain environment with the altitude of the soil surface increasing up to 80 m in the final part of the tunnel. The geology of the area of the extension is characterized of the presence of Quaternary, soil formations, which are located in the initial and final part of the tunnel, Neogene, soil formations, which are located mainly in the middle part of the tunnel and rocky formations which consist of Green Schists and belong to the Chortiatis Unit, which is the alpine base of the area. In this particular project the demand of the practice of mechanized tunneling methods comes from the necessity for quick completion of the construction and the minimization of the underground disturbance, as possible dangerous situations during the excavation may lead to surface problems. This is the reason why the characteristics of the mechanized tunneling methods, which use TBMs, and the geological and geotechnical properties of the formations, that are going to be excavated, and are related to the selection of the appropriate for the excavation machine, and the laboratory and in situ tests that take place to define them, are described in detail. The data, which has been collected from 72 boreholes along the tunnel alignment, include for the soil formations particle size analyses of the geomaterials, the liquid limit of the Atterberg limits, the plasticity index, the consistency index (in a few parts of the tunnel), the quality of the geomaterials, the SPT values and the permeability of the formations. For the rocky formations are presented the values of the GSI, the quality of the rock mass based on RQD values, the unconfined compression strength of the intact rock and the permeability of them. All of the above properties are presented also in figures where it becomes apparent how they develop along the tunnel alignment. From the data above the applicability of 4 TBM types, which include open face shield machines, rock TBMs, <b>slurry</b> <b>shield</b> TBMs and EPB machines, is described and the behavior of them versus the excavation is judged based on the geological and geotechnical conditions along the tunnel alignment.

40|$|The TBM, not a blind mole! This thesis {{deals with}} {{some aspects of}} seismic imaging of the soft soil {{in front of a}} Tunnel Boring Machine to help tunnel constructors ``see'' the {{subsurface}} they are approaching, instead of steering the TBM forward like a ``blind mole''. The Dutch shallow subsurface has a very irregular layering and contains many heterogeneities. Geotechnical investigation of a tunnelling site, like soundings and borings, gives only local information of the soft subsurface and interpolation of the data will be inaccurate. This affects the safety during tunnel construction. The more information about the soil and obstacles in front of the TBM is known, the better tunnelling parameters can be controlled and damage to the TBM can be avoided. A seismic survey of the area will provide information on lateral variations in the subsurface. In combination with the geotechnical data, a much more accurate image of the tunnel trajectory can be made. Surface seismics will not always be easy, for example in urbanized areas. A solution would be to have a seismic system on the TBM. Seismic energy emitted from the machine reflects on contrasts ahead of the bore front and is recorded again by receivers on the TBM. The reflected energy gives the tunnel constructors an image of the subsurface in front of the TBM and therefor increases safety of the tunnelling. The source is a very important element of every seismic system. Its properties have to be optimal so that the emitted signals are suitable for the tunnelling application. In the shallow soft soils of the Netherlands, the use of shear waves is preferred over compressional waves as the former are less influenced by the water in the pores. Since the loose soils cause a high damping, the source signals should be low frequent. Some practical aspects to be investigated are the position of the source (and receivers) on the TBM and the contact with the soil for perfect transmission of the seismic energy. The design of such a seismic source falls outside the scope of this research. Instead of developping an active source, this thesis firstly examines if seismic energy is emitted by the TBM itself and, if this is the case, whether it is suitable for imaging in soft soils. The construction of the Second Heinenoord Tunnel near Rotterdam is set up as an experimental project in which many aspects of soft soil tunnelling in the Netherlands are investigated. On this site, seismic experiments are performed, on the earth surface, in the subsurface, in the TBM and in the tunnel. The first geophone lines on the earth surface show recordings of seismic energy coming from the TBM. Processing of the data indicates that the TBM emits shear waves in a frequency range between 5 and 100 ~Hz. As said before, these are good properties for a seismic source that is to be used in soft soils. Depending on the position of geophone lines, events with an average wavespeed varying from 100 to 200 m/s are registered. These are typical velocities for shear waves in soft soils, higher when the sand content increases, lower when more clay is present. Some recordings show distinct events with a regular amplitude and periodicity. At other locations, these can be very irregular, which makes it more difficult to analyse the data. In combination with recordings in the TBM itself, the actual source of the seismic signals is determined. Engines and pumps can be excluded quickly. Clear pulses are registered by geophones that are attached to the hydraulic jacks {{at the end of the}} TBM. These jacks push the machine forward against the tunnel elements that are already in place. The propagation of the TBM in the soil is not always a smooth movement, but it is influenced by friction effects between the machine and the surrounding soil. Most probably, the emitted seismic signals are related to the operation of the hydraulic jacks and therefor depending on the soil type around the TBM. This explains the variations in amplitude and periodicity. Experiments in the subsurface and inside the tunnel are carried out to test the suitability of the TBM as a seismic source. Performance of shear wave seismics in soft soils is very good, but for tunnelling applications new aspects have to be taken into account. Whether the TBM is used as a seismic source or an active source is developped, the optimal position for receivers when imaging the subsurface in front of the TBM is the cutter wheel. The <b>slurry</b> <b>shield</b> TBM used for the construction of the Second Heinenoord Tunnel pumps a viscous bentonite to the bore front to ensure its stability. For seismic recording on the cutter wheel, the penetrability of the bentonite by shear waves in crucial. To exclude any uncontrollable aspects of the hydraulic jacks, external compressional and shear wave sources are used in this experiment. As receivers, geophones at depth, in the path of the TBM, and pressure sensors on the cutter wheel are applied. The results are rather ambiguous. The recordings on the geophones show that the waves are highly attenuated. But not even the compressional waves are recorded on the cutter wheel. It is possible that the pressure sensors are not suitable for these kind of measurements. If, on the other hand, the seismic energy could not penetrate the bentonite, special hardware adjustments are necessary. Also the efficiency of the jacks as seismic source is tested. During construction of the second tunnel tube of the Second Heinenoord Tunnel, the first tube is used as a strong reflector. Geophones are attached to the tunnel wall of the second tube. The recordings have a very high signal-to-noise ratio. After removal of the direct waves, travelling through the tunnel wall, reflected events generated by the other tunnel tube can be traced in the data, allthough they are very weak. Reflections coming from ahead of the TBM might therefor be even harder to distinguish. Applying the TBM as a efficient, reliable and controllable seismic source for imaging requires more research on the operation of the hydraulic jacks and the influence of the soil surrounding the TBM. The theoretical part of this thesis focusses on processing of data from a seismic system for tunnelling, where receivers are installed on the cutter wheel of the TBM. Seismic surveys for oil- and gasexploration are performed over a very large area, using hundreds of receivers. Traditional seismic processing techniques are optimised for these configurations. In tunnelling applications, the receivers are limited in aperture by the diameter of the TBM and in number by the available space on the cutter wheel. Applying the existing processing techniques, like phaseshift migration, on this new configuration will introduce large artefacts into the data because of the truncation of the extrapolation operator. Short, symmetric, spatial extrapolation operators that are stable in a specified wavenumber range are designed, using a weighted-least-squares optimisation. Migration in the spatial domain instead of the frequency domain makes it possible to take small lateral soil variations (perpendicular to the cutter wheel in case of tunnelling applications) into account. For a large number of receivers, the short operators will limit computation time extensively. In tunnelling, the lenght of the operator will be based on the number of receivers on the cutter wheel. However, the symmetric operators are only optimal for the middle receiver. For the other data points, the operator is shifted and gets asymmetrically truncated, which again generates artefacts. Also, only part of the data points are used in the extrapolation, which is rather inefficient if so few data is available. Therefor the weighted-least-squares optimisation is adjusted to design short, asymmetric, spatial extrapolation operators. For each data point, a new operator is created, based on the number of receivers and the relative position of the data point, taking all other data points into account. By varying the weight and the wavenumber range in which the operator should be accurate, the optimal operator can be calculated. For the outmost points, special attention is necessary to ensure stable operators. The performance of the symmetric and asymmetric operators in both forward and inverse extrapolation is compared, for different operator lenghts. In the forward experiment, a source signal is forward extrapolated, once with symmetric and once with asymmetric operators. On both data sets, inverse extrapolation is performed with the same, symmetric method so that differences in the final result are only due to the forward extrapolation. Comparison with the original input signal gives an indication of the performance of the operators. A similar experiment is performed to investigate the inverse extrapolation. In this case, a modelled data set is inverse extrapolated once with symmetric and once with asymmetric operators. Then both data sets are forward extrapolated with the same operator set and compared with the input data. Both experiments show that the accuracy of the operators decreases with the operator lenght. In general, the symmetric and asymmetric operators have a similar level of performance. The symmetric operators have less negative effects on the inverse extrapolation. In the forward extrapolation, the asymmetric operators introduce less artefacts. Finally, the extrapolation operators are applied on simple modelled 2 D data sets with homogeneous and layered backgrounds. Migration with symmetric operators for data sets with a small number of receivers introduces more artefacts. These are mainly generated at the outmost data points and are extrapolated further into the data. Especially in layered media, which is typical for the shallow subsurface, the asymmetric operators perform much better. The examples clearly show the advantage of the short asymmetric spatial operators for migration of seismic data from tunnelling applications. They contribute in creating an accurate image of the subsurface in front of the TBM and increase safety of the tunnelling activities. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
