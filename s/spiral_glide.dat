50|$|In glide recovery, the {{ejection}} charge either deploys an airfoil (wing) or separates a glider {{from the}} motor. If properly trimmed, the rocket/glider will enter a <b>spiral</b> <b>glide</b> and return safely. In some cases, radio-controlled rocket gliders are flown {{back to the}} earth by a pilot in much the way as R/C model airplanes are flown.|$|E
5000|$|On August 6, 1914, Thompson set {{the flight}} {{altitude}} record by flying to {{a height of}} 15,256 ft over Overland Park, Kansas in his Day-Gyro plane. [...] Because of the coldness at that altitude, he wore a sheepskin suit. [...] When the plane ran out of fuel, he executed a <b>spiral</b> <b>glide</b> maneuver to return to earth. [...] This feat, which placed him at the altitude of modern turboprop planes, happened only 10 years after the Wright brothers' first flight. [...] However, because of the advances in flight technology, the record did not last long.|$|E
40|$|The {{mourning}} dove (Zenaida macroura) {{is one of}} the most widely distributed and abundant birds in North America. Fall populations of this game bird in the United States are estimated to be slightly more than 400 million birds. In recent years, the annual harvest by hunting in the United States has been estimated at 18 to 25 million birds, similar to the harvest of all oth-er migratory game birds combined. Mourning doves are highly adaptable, occurring in most ecological types except marshes and heavily forested areas. The {{mourning dove}} is a medium-sized member of the Columbidae family. While this family consists of ap-proximately 300 species of doves and pigeons, only 8 species, including the mourning dove, are native to the United States. The mourning dove is approxi-mately 11 to 13 inches in length, with a 17 – to 19 –inch wingspan, weighing on average 4. 4 ounces. Mourning doves have delicate bills and long, pointed tails. They are grayish-brown and buff in color, with black spots on wing coverts and near ears. The tail and wing feathers are gray, except for black-bordered white tips on the tail. Their eyes are brown and bordered by light blue bare skin, while legs and feet are a dull red. Males are slightly larger than females, and slight-ly more brightly colored. Males have more of a pink-ish wash on the breast and a brighter blue-gray color-ation on top of the head. Juveniles have light buff tips to their feathers, giving a scaly appearance. Mourning doves are monogamous and form strong pair bonds that persist during at least one nesting sea-son. The breeding season is among the longest of all North American birds, with peak nesting activity oc-curring in late spring/early summer and a decline be-ginning in July. At the beginning of the breeding sea-son, unpaired males devote considerable time to perch cooing and performing displays such as flap-ping/gliding flight to attract females. When perform-ing the flapping/gliding flights, a male leaves his coo-ing perch with a vigorous and noisy flapping of his wings, rising up to 100 feet in the air. He then ex-tends his wings and begins a long <b>spiraling</b> <b>glide</b> back down. The perch coo {{is one of the}} few vocalization...|$|R
25|$|Before {{and after}} the nesting season, groups of {{breeding}} birds will sometimes initiate gatherings; these seem to occur at the boundary of the group's combined range or in the unclaimed land separating it from neighbouring groups. The initiation signal is a conspicuous display flight given by a bird surveying its territory: it spirals tens of meters/yards high into the air, usually briefly does a fluttering hover {{at the top of}} the <b>spiral,</b> and then <b>glides</b> down. Group neighbours will respond by performing the same type of flight, and eventually about half the group's members will depart to the meeting location where they will spend several tens of minutes – sometimes more than an hour – chattering, calling, duetting, and excitedly moving about the meeting site (which typically is some small tree or shrubbery). In winter, birds will often assemble in small groups and roost together, particularly to keep warm during the night; this is apparently not initiated with a specific assembly display however.|$|R
50|$|Like other {{vultures}} it is a scavenger, feeding {{mostly on}} the remains of dead animals. It usually disdains the actual meat, however, and lives on a diet that is typically 85-90% bone marrow. This is the only living bird species that specializes in feeding on marrow. The bearded vulture can swallow whole or bite through brittle bones up {{to the size of}} a lamb's femur and its powerful digestive system quickly dissolves even large pieces. The bearded vulture has learned to crack bones too large to be swallowed by carrying them in flight to a height of 50 - 150 m above the ground and then dropping them onto rocks below, which smashes them into smaller pieces and exposes the nutritious marrow. They can fly with bones up to 10 cm in diameter and weighing over 4 kg, or nearly equal to their own weight. After dropping the large bones, the bearded vulture <b>spirals</b> or <b>glides</b> down to inspect them and may repeat the act if the bone is not sufficiently cracked. This learned skill requires extensive practice by immature birds and takes up to seven years to master. Its old name of ossifrage ("bone breaker") relates to this habit. More seldom, these birds have been observed to try to break bones (usually of a medium size) by hammering them with their bill directly into rocks while perched. During the breeding season they feed mainly on carrion. They prefer limbs of sheep and other small mammals and they carry the food to the nest unlike other vultures which feed their young by regurgitation.|$|R
5000|$|Susan Feder's program {{notes of}} the St. Louis Symphony {{recording}} of this piece include imagery given by Tower regarding the title:"The Island is remote, lush, tropical with stretches of white beach interspersed with thick green jungle. Above is a large, powerful, and brightly colored bird which soars and <b>glides,</b> <b>spirals</b> up, and plummets with folded wings as it dominates but lives in complete harmony with its island home."Tower's analysis of Island Prelude divides it into three main sections, possibly fitting the sonata form, {{or at least a}} variation of the ABA form. The beginning largo section portrays [...] "a very slow-moving consonant landscape that gradually becomes more active and dissonant." [...] The beginning time signature is 5/4 with the quarter note ca. 40 beats per minute. While the quarter pulse is kept constant, the number of beats per measure frequently changes between 5/4, 4/4, 3/4, and 2/4, creating the unpredictable, yet constant terrain. In the quintet, the horn begins the piece on an A, concert pitch. The clarinet and bassoon alternate on pitches A and B while trading triplet rhythms. The oboe begins its solo in measure 10 with sustained notes over the ebbing major 2nds, 4th, and 6ths. The use of consonant intervals maintains the sense of a [...] "consonant landscape". Tower describes the oboe's presence as a [...] "slightly more prominent and melismic line which in turn activates the surrounding held chords." [...] Measure 12 breaks the consonance with the clarinet sounding a G# against the A in the bassoon and horn. Dissonant tension builds until the release at measure 15, then the tension begins again (m.21). The counterpoint develops into a second section, or B section, with more complex rhythm and independence of lines. At measure 54, superimposed tritones move up by half steps to continue the rising modulation. The chromaticism then begins to move downward (m.63), and the oboe recaps the running sixteenth and thirty-second patterns before resting (m.73). Chromatic steps, repetition, and dissonant leaps build to m90 where the oboe begins its flight of complex rhythm over spasmodic chords in the bass. The bass then imitates (m.97) parts of previous rhythmic ideas as the melodic line soars higher, building to measure 108 where all instruments hit a unison on C. A falling fifth pattern in the clarinet, horn, and bassoon brings the range back down and heavy counterpoint continues until the oboe returns on a high Eb trill (m.129). Three short chords sound under the trill and oboe plays the trill down an octave with each chord, ending on a low Eb. Here, the oboe begins its cadenza. Fast swooping arpeggios portray the flight patterns of the [...] "large bird" [...] gliding upward against the breeze. The oboe's [...] "two short cadenzas" [...] ascend [...] "in a burst of fast notes that lead into a final, quiet coda." [...] The ending section is a reflection back to the beginning, or A material, and is [...] "very slow, sustained, high, and dissonant." [...] The horn ends on an A, concluding on the same note that it began, and the oboe holds a high B, reflecting back on the opening major second. The other instruments fill in the {{notes of the}} ending major ninth chord.|$|R
