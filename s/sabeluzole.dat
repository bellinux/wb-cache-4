50|$|<b>Sabeluzole</b> (R-58,735) is a {{nootropic}} and neuroprotective drug {{which was}} originally {{developed for the}} treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and has subsequently been researched for other applications such as sleep apnoea. It acts primarily as an NMDA antagonist, but other mechanisms of action may also be important.|$|E
40|$|Morphological rearrangements, such as synapse number changes, {{have been}} {{observed}} in the adult mammalian brain after various experimental paradigms of learning and behavioral experience. The role of axonal transport in the physical translocation of material during this form of brain plasticity has not been fully appreciated. We show here by quantitative video microscopy that <b>sabeluzole</b> (R 58735), a new memory-enhancing drug in humans, effectively increases fast axonal transport in rat neuronal cell cultures. Long-term incubation (24 hr) with <b>sabeluzole</b> in the concentration range between 0. 1 and 1 μM increases both velocity and jump length of saltatory movements maximally by 20 – 30 % in embryonic hippocampal neurons. Acute treatment only increases the velocity by 15 – 20 %. Further-more, the inhibition of axonal transport by 0. 1 mM vanadate in N 4 neuroblastoma cells is reversed by 1 μM <b>sabeluzole.</b> Observations on the kinesin-induced microtubule mobility in a reconstituted system show a 10 % enhancement by <b>sabeluzole</b> at an optimal concetration of 2 μM, but no increase in kinesin ATPase activity. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} pharmacological compound shown to increase fast axonal transport. The mechanism of fast axonal transport enhancement is discussed as a rationale for new therapeutic treatment in neuropathology...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and characterize a biodegradable drug-loaded nerve guide for peripheral nerve regeneration. <b>Sabeluzole,</b> a nerve growth agent, was selected as model compound. Four biodegradable polymers were selected for this study: a copolymer of polylactic acid and polycaprolactone (PCL); a copolymer of polyglycolic acid and polycaprolactone PCL; a copolymer of PCL/polydioxanone (PDO) and PDO. Placebo and drug loaded nerve guides were obtained by melt compression and melt extrusion. status: publishe...|$|E
