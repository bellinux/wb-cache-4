50|$|Thus, attracting, {{repelling}} and <b>shearing</b> <b>material</b> {{surfaces are}} necessarily stacked on each other, i.e., occur in continuous families. This {{leads to the}} idea of seeking LCSs in finite-time dynamical systems as exceptional material surfaces that exhibit a coherence-inducing property more strongly than any of the neighboring material surfaces. Such LCSs, defined as extrema (or more generally, stationary surfaces) for a finite-time coherence property, will indeed serve as observed centerpieces of trajectory patterns. Examples of attracting, repelling and shearing LCSs are in a direct numerical simulation of 2D turbulence are shown in Fig.2a.|$|E
40|$|We give an {{algorithmic}} {{introduction to}} Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) using a newly developed computational engine, LCS Tool. LCSs are most repelling, attracting and <b>shearing</b> <b>material</b> lines {{that form the}} centerpieces of observed tracer patterns in two-dimensional unsteady dy-namical systems. LCS Tool implements the latest geodesic theory of LCSs for two-dimensional flows, uncovering key transport barriers in unsteady flow velocity data as explicit solutions of differential equations. After a re-view of the underlying theory, we explain the steps and numerical methods used by LCS Tool, and illustrate its capabilities on three unsteady fluid flow examples. ...|$|E

40|$|Using the {{complete}} set of Maxwell equations, the ray paths and Stokes parameters of a polarized wave are followed which passes through a slab of differentially <b>shearing</b> <b>material</b> of variable refractive index. The polarization state of the signal leaving {{the top of the}} slab is related to the polarization state of the initial wave. In general, the two are not the same. These calculations were made to illustrate the point that the polarization properties of observed pulsar signals may be very {{different from those of the}} emitted signals due to propagation effects in the differentially shearing magnetospheres that most pulsars are believed to possess. While it is recognized that the precise amount of polarization variations is model dependent, the calculations show that even for simple situations a noticeable polarization variation occurs. Accordingly, the calculations reported here are an educative device: they show that it is, perhaps, unwise to assume that the observed polarization properties of pulsar signals are the same as the emitted signals...|$|E

50|$|Shearing, {{also known}} as die cutting, is a process which cuts stock without the {{formation}} of chips {{or the use of}} burning or melting. Strictly speaking, if the cutting blades are straight the process is called shearing; if the cutting blades are curved then they are shearing-type operations. The most commonly <b>sheared</b> <b>materials</b> are in the form of sheet metal or plates, however rods can also be sheared. Shearing-type operations include: blanking, piercing, roll slitting, and trimming. It is used in metalworking and also with paper and plastics.|$|R

Using the internal programming FISH, the cohesive fracture model is programmed into a hybrid distinct element algorithm as encoded in Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC).
