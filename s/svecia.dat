50|$|<b>SVECIA</b> is a Swedish Screen {{printing}} brand. The origin is over 60 years ago, when a Swedish {{screen printer}} asked Mr. Åke Svantesson of “Svantesson & Co” {{to repair a}} Scottish 'McCormick' screen printing machine he had bought before the second world war. Mr. Svantesson, an engineer who specialized in making precision components for the aircraft and reactor industries, did {{such a good job}} that he was asked to design and construct a new mechanized screen printer.|$|E
50|$|After 1598, Anna {{spent the}} rest of her life in Poland, though she always {{referred}} to herself as a Princess of Sweden. Known as Anna of <b>Svecia</b> (Anna of Sweden), she was Protestant member of a Catholic royal family, and acted as a protector of the exiled Protestant Swedish loyalists of Sigismund and Polish Protestants. Princess Anna maintained good relationship with and influence upon Sigismund, and she functioned as his political adviser on the affairs of state, something which made her a controversial figure in Poland.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Svecia</b> is {{produced}} in a fashion typical to many semi-hard cheeses. Milk is pasteurized to 72 C then cooled to around 30 C. Rennet is added to coagulate the milk into curds and lactic acid enzymes are added to replace enzymes and bacteria killed during pasteurization. The curd is cut, stirred, and slowly drained, then heated back up to a temperature near 40 C to drive off more moisture. After salt is added, the curds are packed into moulds, loosely enough to leave the air pockets which make up Svecia's tiny holes. After a soak in brine, bringing the total salt content of the cheese to 1.0 - 1.5 percent by weight, the cheese is aged in a dry environment {{for at least two}} months [...] - [...] sometimes up to more than a year.|$|E
