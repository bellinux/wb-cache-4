50|$|<b>Snake</b> <b>Mode</b> {{plays out}} {{the same way as}} Endless Mode, with the {{exception}} that the rotozoan has only one tentacle, whereas {{the other half of the}} organism is translucent. The translucent side can then be used to destroy goobugs upon impact, giving the player an advantage. In <b>snake</b> <b>Mode,</b> too, the player plays for points under the same directions as in Endless Mode, where the highest score achieved will be recorded and displayed on the title screen. Uniquely to <b>Snake</b> <b>Mode,</b> however, the goobugs that are in contrast to the colour of the rotozoan's tentacle will appear in various colours that are not present in any other mode, including deep blue, magenta and orange. Another unique feature about <b>Snake</b> <b>Mode</b> is the option to unlock and switch between themes. Once the player has managed to unlock the final stages for each level in Stages Mode, completing these with the All Completed achievement will unlock new themes in <b>Snake</b> <b>Mode.</b> The themes feature a background from Stages Mode, and will also have a preset colour for the rotozoan's tentacle. This way, the player will be rewarded for completing the most difficult sixth and seventh stages of each level in Stages Mode.|$|E

40|$|Medical Image {{segmentation}} {{deals with}} segmentation of tumor in CT and MR images for improved quality in medical diagnosis. Fluid Vector Flow (FVF) enhances the concave object extraction capability. We propose {{a new approach}} that we call the “fluid vector flow ” active contour model to address problems of insufficient capture range and poor convergence for concavities. This paper intends to combine watershed algorithm with FVF snake model to reduce the computational complexity, to improve the insensitiveness to noise, and capture range. Specifically, the image will be segmented firstly through watershed algorithm and then the edges produced will be the initial contour of FVF model. This enhances the tumor boundaries and tuning the regulating parameters of the FVF <b>snake</b> <b>mode</b> by coupling the smoothness of the edge map obtained due to watershed algorithm. Superiority of the proposed work is observed in terms of capture range, concave object extraction capability, sensitivity to noise, computational complexity, and segmentation accuracy...|$|E

30|$|Biological snake has a cord-like {{body with}} many links (bones) which can form diverse {{locomotion}} modes with many functions [1]. Snake {{is one of}} the most successfully evolved species, which has lived on the earth for 300 million years because of its high adaptation to the environment. Different locomotion modes also have various functions. Some snakes have the ability to change their movement mode immediately when entering into a new environment.

25|$|The {{movement}} of snakes in arboreal habitats {{has only recently}} been studied. While on tree branches, <b>snakes</b> use several <b>modes</b> of locomotion depending on species and bark texture. In general, snakes will use a modified form of concertina locomotion on smooth branches, but will laterally undulate if contact points are available. Snakes move faster on small branches and when contact points are present, in contrast to limbed animals, which do better on large branches with little 'clutter'.|$|R
40|$|Multi-maternal nesting {{behaviours}} (or communal nesting) {{represent a}} remarkable expression of prenatal parental care. In squamate reptiles (lizards and <b>snakes)</b> this <b>mode</b> of parental care {{has been reported}} in different lineages. Nevertheless, the causes behind its origin remain largely un- explored, and hence, poorly understood. Here, we study parental care in the Argentinean gecko- nid species Homonota borelli. We found that this lizard nests communally, which represents the first report of communal nesting for this species {{and one of the first}} within the genus. The facts that the number of potentially suitable places for nesting is much higher than the number of nests observed and that eggs from the same nests eclose asynchronously, suggest that the evolu- tion of this behaviour would be mediated by the fitness advantages of oviposition in sites where eggs have previously been laid. Therefore, communal nesting in H. borelli would be adaptive...|$|R
30|$|According to the {{research}} on the biological snake, the snake-inspired robot has extremely high redundancy with many degrees of freedom, with its body {{on the ground and}} kinetically stable. This feature makes the snake easily adapt to irregular terrain. Based on this high adaptability, the snake robot can be adopted where human beings cannot go to carry out tasks. The <b>snake’s</b> locomotion <b>modes</b> can be categorized into following four types: (1) serpentine locomotion; (2) rectilinear locomotion; (3) rolling locomotion; and (4) sidewinding locomotion. In this paper, two locomotion modes are developed. The serpentine movement is the most typical locomotion mode, which has been widely observed in almost all species of snakes. According to Hirose’s [2] research on the biological snake, {{the research}} starts with generating the serpentine curve for the snake robot [3]. To test additional locomotion performance of the robot, sidewinding is further investigated and performed on the developed robot.|$|R

5000|$|Animals with {{elongated}} {{bodies and}} reduced or no legs have evolved differently from their limbed relatives. [...] In the past, some {{have speculated that}} this evolution was due to a lower energetic cost associated with limbless locomotion. The biomechanical arguments used to support this rationale include that (1) there is no cost associatied with the vertical displacement {{of the center of}} mass typically found with limbed animals, (2) there is no cost associated with accelerating or decelerating limbs, and (3) there is a lower cost for supporting the body. This hypothesis has been studied further by examining the oxygen consumption rates in the <b>snake</b> during different <b>modes</b> of locomotion: lateral undulation, concertina, and sidewinding. [...] The net cost of transport (NCT), which indicates the amount of energy required to move a unit of mass a given distance, for a snake moving with a lateral undulatory gait is identical to that of a limbed lizard with the same mass. However, a snake utilizing concertina locomotion produces a much higher net cost of transport, while sidewinding actually produces a lower net cost of transport. Therefore, the different modes of locomotion are of primary importance when determining energetic cost. The reason that lateral undulation has the same energetic efficiency as limbed animals and not less, as hypothesized earlier, might be due to the additional biomechanical cost associated with this type of movement due to the force needed to bend the body laterally, push its sides against a vertical surface, and overcome sliding friction.|$|R
