[...] In 2013, Mildura <b>Solar</b> <b>Concentrator</b> Power Station, a 1.5MW demonstration plant, was commissioned by Silex Systems and it was expected to be expanded to 100MW by 2017. However, in August 2014, the project was abandoned by Silex, due to lack of commitment to renewable energy by the Abbott government, with plans to scrap the praised Renewable Energy Target (RET) in Australia cited as {{one of the main reasons}} for the abandonment of the project. This decision has been extensively criticised by international scientists, who claim Australia risks being [...] "left behind the rest of the world" [...] if it cuts its plans for renewable energy.

2500|$|Solar Systems was {{a leader}} in high {{concentration}} solar photovoltaic applications, and the company built a photovoltaic Mildura <b>Solar</b> <b>concentrator</b> power station, Australia. This project will use innovative concentrator dish technology to power 45,000 homes, providing 270,000 MWh/year for A$420million. Solar Systems has already completed construction of three concentrator dish power stations in the Northern Territory, at Hermannsburg, Yuendumu, and Lajamanu, which together generate 1,555 MWh/year (260 homes, going by the energy/home ratio above). This represents a saving of 420,000litres of diesel fuel and 1550tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year. The {{total cost of the}} solar power station was [...] "A$7M, offset {{by a grant from the}} Australian and Northern Territory Governments under their Renewable Remote Power Generation Program". The price of diesel in remote areas is high due to added transportation costs: in 2017, retail diesel prices in remote areas of the Northern Territory averaged $1.90 per litre. The 420,000 litres of diesel per year saved by these power stations in the first decade of operation would thus have cost approximately $8,000,000.|$|E
