60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>over</b> Anne, and gayly {{patted her}} on the shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "La sakes! Surely you can't {{talk like}} humans!" [...] Then, {{recovering}} from her alarm, <b>she</b> again <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the beetle, who answered her: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou hast somehow murdered her; {{how then}} be herself again? My sweet mistress! oh, my young mistress! Tell me! tell me!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> low <b>over</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{something}} in his manner warned them. Philippa laughed as <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his chair.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the girl's {{hand again}} and uttered little ejaculations of {{surprise}} and perplexity.|$|E

6000|$|... "An {{alarming}} {{amount of}} devil there," [...] was Stephen's first thought. The second, when <b>she</b> had <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her work, was, [...] "I wish {{she would look}} at me again." [...] The next was to answer,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Garnett: [...] "Oh yes, {{the books}} are full of it. Are those mallows? They might carry off {{the effects of the}} chocolates." [...] Miss Ramsey passes her the box of marshmallows which <b>she</b> has <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the table to look at.|$|R
60|$|Philip smiled. Charlotte proceeded, and Charles saw Laura's colour {{deepening}} as <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her work.|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} tremblingly; <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> toward him; his mouth wet her ear; he whispered it.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> him. Her lips hovered {{above his}} face and her long hair brushed his cheeks.|$|E

60|$|The {{goldfish}} ducked {{its head}} down just as Reera re-entered the cottage. <b>She</b> saw Ervic <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the kettle, so she came and joined him.|$|R

60|$|Had she {{not thought}} the king dead {{she would have}} cut out her tongue rather than reveal his {{identity}} to these soldiers of his great enemy.

60|$|While her {{electric}} spotlight played {{upon this}} padlock <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> and examined it swiftly but with care.|$|E

6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Thank me not, {{seeing that}} you do not know the end of this matter. Perchance it is hidden from you lest you should go mad, you and your wife, Merytra, she who was the Pharaoh's Lady of the Footstool, and sang him to sleep. Look at me, Wizard, and tell me, who am I?" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>over</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Freda was silent, but {{her face}} flushed painfully, and Edmund saw the tears falling down her cheeks as <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her plate.|$|E
60|$|Kate {{smiled at}} this, and laid {{her hand on}} his arm, while <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the pillow and looked tenderly into his eyes.|$|E
60|$|The {{tears were}} {{trickling}} down her checks as <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> him, {{and it seemed}} she had never loved him so much as now.|$|E
6000|$|Before I {{was aware}} of her, <b>she</b> <b>bent</b> her head <b>over</b> my hand, and touched it tenderly with her lips. [...] "I am not an ungrateful woman," [...] she murmured--"and yet I don't know how to thank you." ...|$|R

60|$|Then Zikali {{rose from}} the corner {{where he had been}} sitting so silently, and waddled heavily across the open space to where the shield lay in front of the King.
