2500|$|The {{index of}} {{refraction}} (or refractive index) {{is a way of}} measuring the speed of light in a material. Light travels fastest in a vacuum, such as in outer space. The speed of light in a vacuum is about 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. The refractive index of a medium is calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in that medium. The refractive index of a vacuum is therefore 1, by definition. A typical <b>singlemode</b> fiber used for telecommunications has a cladding made of pure silica, with an index of 1.444 at 1,500nm, and a core of doped silica with an index around 1.4475. The larger the {{index of refraction}}, the slower light travels in that medium. From this information, a simple rule of thumb is that a signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200,000 kilometers per second. To put it another way, the signal will take 5 milliseconds to travel 1,000 kilometers in fiber. Thus a phone call carried by fiber between Sydney and New York, a 16,000-kilometer distance, means that there is a minimum delay of 80 milliseconds (about [...] of a second) between when one caller speaks and the other hears. (The fiber in this case will probably travel a longer route, and there will be additional delays due to communication equipment switching and the process of encoding and decoding the voice onto the fiber).|$|E

50|$|Typical modern {{multimode}} graded-index fibers have 3 dB/km of attenuation loss (50% loss per km) at 850 nm and 1 dB/km at 1300 nm. <b>Singlemode</b> 9/125 loses 0.4 dB/km at 1310 nm and 0.25 dB/km at 1550 nm. Very {{high quality}} <b>singlemode</b> fiber intended for long distance applications is specified {{at a loss}} of 0.19 dB/km at 1550 nm. POF (plastic optical fiber) loses much more: 1 dB/m at 650 nm. Plastic optical fiber is large core (about 1mm) fiber suitable only for short, low speed networks such as within cars.|$|E

Semiconductor lasers reach some 100 m, but small, inexpensive semiconductor lasers have shorter lengths, with one source claiming 20 cm. <b>Singlemode</b> fiber lasers with linewidths {{of a few}} kHz can have coherence lengths exceeding 100 km. Similar coherence lengths can be reached with optical frequency combs due to the narrow linewidth of each tooth. Non-zero visibility is present only for short intervals of pulses repeated after cavity length distances up to this long coherence length.|$|E

50|$|Bends with {{continuously}} varying {{radius of}} curvature following the Euler spiral are also used to reduce losses in photonic integrated circuits, either in <b>singlemode</b> waveguides, to smoothen the abrupt change of curvature and coupling to radiation modes, or in multimode waveguides, in order to suppress coupling to higher order modes and ensure effective <b>singlemode</b> operation.A pioneering and very elegant application of the Euler spiral to waveguides had been made as early as 1957, with a hollow metal waveguide for microwaves. There {{the idea was to}} exploit the fact that a straight metal waveguide can be physically bent to naturally take a gradual bend shape resembling an Euler spiral.|$|E

5000|$|Polarization-maintaining {{optical fibers}} {{are used in}} special applications, such as in fiber optic sensing, {{interferometry}} and quantum key distribution. They are also commonly used in telecommunications for the connection between a source laser and a modulator, since the modulator requires polarized light as input. They are rarely used for long-distance transmission, because PM fiber is expensive and has higher attenuation than <b>singlemode</b> fiber.|$|E

50|$|Rays {{that fall}} within this angular range are {{reflected}} from the core-cladding boundary by total internal reflection, {{and so are}} confined by the core. The confinement of light by the fiber can also be {{described in terms of}} bound modes or guided modes. This treatment is necessary when considering <b>singlemode</b> fiber, since the ray model does not accurately describe the propagation of light in this type of fiber.|$|E
50|$|The large {{dispersion}} {{and small}} footprint {{of the device}} make the chromo-modal dispersion device potentially useful for on-chip dispersion compensation using optical components such as integrated gratings and planar multimode waveguides. The advantage of physical compactness, combined with the magnitude and tunability of its dispersion suggest its potential use as a versatile tool for pulse stretching or compression {{in a variety of}} applications in which the capabilities of <b>singlemode</b> fiber or diffraction grating-based dispersive elements will not suffice.|$|E
50|$|For comparison, plastic {{optical fibers}} (POF) have low bandwidths and {{transmission}} rates (typically 100 MBit/s). They {{also have a}} high attenuation and therefore, the maximum distance is around 100 meters. Glass fibers {{on the other hand}} have very high bandwidths and transmission rates of up to GBit/s. The attenuation in glass fibres is much lower, glass fibers can cover distances of more than 10 km. Regarding bandwidth and distances, HCS fibers are situated between POF and multimode or <b>singlemode</b> fibers.|$|E
50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one <b>singlemode</b> fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber connector plugs. A multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of connector plug.|$|E
5000|$|A {{class of}} {{laboratory}} power meters has an extended sensitivity, {{of the order}} of -110 dBm. This is achieved by using a very small detector and lens combination, and also a mechanical light chopper at typically 270 Hz, so the meter actually measures AC light. This eliminates unavoidable dc electrical drift effects. If the light chopping is synchronized with an appropriate synchronous (or [...] "lock-in") amplifier, further sensitivity gains are achieved. In practice, such instruments usually achieve lower absolute accuracy due to the small detector diode, and for the same reason, may only be accurate when coupled with <b>singlemode</b> fiber. Occasionally such an instrument may have a cooled detector, though with the modern abandonment of Germanium sensors, and the introduction of InGaAs sensors, this is now increasingly uncommon.|$|E
