40|$|Purpose: <b>Supplementary</b> <b>fees</b> such as {{restocking}} fees, nonrefundable {{shipping and}} handling fees, and cancellation fees have become prevalent in the USA, and customers {{as well as the}} popular media have raised serious concerns about them. This paper aims to test whether such fees could benefit consumers because they lead to lower prices. Design/methodology/approach: Transaction data that include prices and fees were collected from different service providers, including hotels, airlines, online retailers, and restaurants. The data were collected from different countries at different points in time. Cross-sectional and panel data sets were used to test the relationship between fees and prices. Findings: The empirical results indicate that on average higher fees lead to lower prices for the majority of customers who do not abuse customer-friendly service policies. These findings are valid for different service industries in different countries even after controlling for unobse rved heterogeneity using panel econometric models. Originality/value: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that special fees are used to limit the abuse of customer-friendly service policies, thus helping service providers to offer lower prices to the majority of customers who do not abuse these policies...|$|R

Bachir, ridden by Dettori, was made the 4/1 third choice with the other five runners starting at odds of 16/1 or more. Bachir led from the start and stayed on well under strong pressure to hold off the challenge of Giant's Causeway and win by a neck with Cape Town close behind in third. After the race Dettori said [...] "I had no particular plan but having ridden earlier and realised the ground was perfect and there was no obvious pace in the race, I decided to have my mount prominent from the start.

Confidence and interest in the filly grew, and she was made favourite for the race. Her position looked even stronger when Shahtoush won the Oaks {{on the day before}} the Derby. On the day of the race itself she headed the betting at 11/4, ahead of the Irish colts Second Empire (Grand Criterium) and King of Kings (2000 Guineas), becoming the first filly to start favourite for the race since Sceptre in 1902.

50|$|After a {{break of}} more than three months, Saonois {{returned}} to the racecourse for the Prix Niel (a trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) at Longchamp on 16 September. He started the joint-third-favourite in the betting alongside Kesampour, behind Last Train (narrowly beaten by Imperial Monarch in the Grand Prix de Paris) and the Secretariat Stakes winner Bayrir. The colt was restrained by Hamelin {{in the early stages}} and was still last of the six runners 400 metres from the finish. He struggled to obtain a clear run until the last 100 metres when he accelerated between horses to take the lead and won by one and a quarter lengths and a short head from Bayrir and Last Train. In October, Saonois started at odds of 9/1 for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe after his owner paid a <b>supplementary</b> entry <b>fee</b> of €100,000. Racing on heavy ground, he never looked likely to win and finished fifteenth of the eighteen runners behind Solemia.

25|$|On 14 May Golden Horn {{was moved}} up in class {{to contest the}} Group Two Dante Stakes at York Racecourse, a major trial for the 2015 Epsom Derby which {{attracted}} a strong field. Ridden by Buick colt started 4/1 third favourite behind Jack Hobbs (also trained by Gosden), and Elm Park with the other contenders including the Aidan O'Brien-trained pair John F Kennedy and Ol' Man River (winner of the Beresford Stakes). Golden Horn was restrained by Buick {{in the early stages}} as the outsider Lord Ben Stack led, before moving into contention three furlongs from the finish. He moved past Elm Park to take the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and three quarter lengths from Jack Hobbs, with Elm Park three and a quarter lengths back in third. Golden Horn had not been entered for the Epsom Derby and Oppenheimer was initially unwilling to pay the £75,000 <b>supplementary</b> entry <b>fee</b> as he believed that the colt's pedigree meant that he was unlikely to stay the Derby distance of one and a half miles. The Prix du Jockey Club was named as a probable target. After discussions with Gosden however, Oppenheimer agreed to supplement the horse and Golden Horn was elevated to the position of ante-post favourite for the Derby.|$|R

Penser had to pay a <b>supplementary</b> <b>fee</b> of £15,000 as the colt had not been among the original entries for the race. Reid settled the colt in third place as Mons set the pace from Even Top. Beauchamp King moved forward from half way, took the lead approaching the final furlong and won [...] "readily" [...] by one and a quarter lengths from Even Top and Mons. After the race Reid commented; [...] "Perhaps I should have waited a bit longer, {{but he was always}} going well and from three down I knew he would win...

2500|$|Carry Back's first {{important}} victory came on his seventeenth {{run of the}} season. In the Cowdin Stakes on October 3, ridden by Bill Hartack, {{he turned}} into the straight in third before producing a strong late run to win going away by {{one and a half}} lengths from Globemaster. He disappointed in the Champagne Stakes after being left at the gate, leading to concerns that he was developing the same problems which ended his mother's career. After being given extra schooling, he was sent to Garden State Park for the $287,000 Garden State Futurity, at that time the most valuable race in America. Price paid a <b>supplementary</b> entry <b>fee</b> of $10,000 to run Carry Back in the race, which he described as [...] "a lot of dough to me." [...] Ridden by John Sellers, Carry Back was fourteenth of the fifteen runners in the early stages but moved into contention on the outside approaching the straight.

The draw for starting stalls saw Golden Horn allotted the fourteenth stall, on the wide outside of the field: Dettori commented [...] "I’d have loved a single-figure number but we’ll have to deal with what we’ve got. We will make a plan." [...] Gosden initially said [...] "We are used to a wide draw in the Arc as Taghrooda had one last year and spent most of her time on that bicycle track they have around the outside of the course at Longchamp. We expected a high draw and we got one." [...] He later explained that he was not suggesting any unfairness saying [...] "I was merely having a joke... I'm sorry if other people don't have a sense of humour". Golden Horn started the 9/2 third favourite behind Treve who was attempting to win the race for the third time and New Bay, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club.

She was partnered by Piggott who was unable to ride at less than 117 pounds, meaning that Madam Gay had to carry four pounds more than weight-for-age. She was settled behind the leaders along the rail before moving up into third place approaching the final turn. The filly could make no further progress, but stayed on to finish third of the fourteen runners beaten a nose and two lengths by John Henry and The Bart. During her stay in the United States it was made known that the filly was available for sale at a price of $2,000,000, {{but there were no}} takers. She then returned to Europe for the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp Racecourse on 13 September. She was made the 7/4 favourite, but after being given a great deal of ground to make up in the straight she finished third to April Run and Leandra. Madam Gay was then bought for an undisclosed sum (later reported as $1.4 million) to Daniel Wildenstein in a private deal. On her final racecourse appearance, Madam Gay produced one of her few poor efforts as she finished tenth behind Vayrann in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 17 October.|$|R
