40|$|Conventional <b>slinding</b> genioplsty has {{the risk}} of mental nerve injury after {{operation}} and difficult to correct vertical asymmetry of chin. So, authors propose a new genioplasty to correct asymmetry of chin. Switching genioplasty is a modification method of conventional genioplasty. Between mandibular right and left canine, osteotomy line of triangular shape make until mandibular lower border. In large side, osteotome line of wedge shape is added to reduction. After osteotomy, segment of wedge shape was separated from chin. Distal segment was rotated to reduction side. Because of rotation of distal segment, space is made in opposite side. Seperated segement of wedge shape from large side is switched this space to fill. So, stability of distal segment is achieved. Authors applied to swiching genioplasty the patients who was remained the chin asymmetry after both sagittal split ramus osteotome was done because mandible asymmetry. After operation, patient and operator were satisfied with excellent esthetic results without any other complication. The switching genioplasty is effective surgical technique fo...|$|E
40|$|Throphozoites of Giardia duodenalis group {{obtained}} from fragments or scratched of hamster's mucosa were examined by transission electron microscopy. The fine {{structure of the}} trophozoites are presented and comapred with those described for other animals. Some of the trophozoites present the cytoplasm full of glycogen, rough endoplasmic reticulum-like structures and homogeneous inclusions not enclosed by membranes, recognized as lipid drops, which had not been observed in Giardia from other animals. The adhesive disk is composed of a layer of microtubules, from which fibrous ribbons extend into the cytoplasm; these ribbons are linked by layer of crossbridge filaments that shows an intermediary dense band, described {{for the first time}} in this paper. The authors regard this band as the result of the cross-bridge filaments <b>slinding</b> in the medium region between adjacent fibrous ribbons, and suggest a contractile activity for them. The role of the adhesive disk on the trophozoite mechanism of attachment to host mucosa is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} research builds upon {{previous work}} at Cambridge on the formal verification of ARM processor hardware and assembly level software. We will use formal {{models of the}} ARM 4 T instruction set architecture (ISA) resulting from the completed EPSRC project Formal Specification and Verification of ARM-based Systems (GR/T 20106 / 01). The aim of the project is to continue and broaden work started in Magnus Myreen’s PhD and to deepen existing international collaborations, particularly with Professor <b>Slind</b> at the University of Utah. <b>Slind’s</b> group already makes use of tools and techniques developed by Myreen, and we make use of their work. Mike Gordon (Principal Investigator) Mike Gordon works on the application of theorem proving to formal verification of hardware and software. He leads the Hardware Verification Group (HVG) at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. HVG has been in existence for over twenty years and members have worked {{on a wide variety}} of formal specification and verification problems including low-level hardware, processors, floating point algorithms, probabilistic algorithms and the analysis of mixed hardware software systems. The tool used for this work is the HOL system, which was initially developed at Cambridge. The current version is HOL 4, which is a thriving open source project hosted by SourceForge with 25 registered developers. 1 Ex members of HVG include past and present faculty at universities in the UK, Australia, Italy, North America and Hong Kong, researchers in government facilities in France, the USA and Australia and technical staff of several international companies. HVG is part of the Automated Reasoning Group (ARG), which is jointly led by Professors Paulson and Gordon. This group is responsible for both the HOL and the Isabelle proof assistants as well as a number of other tools (e. g. Joe Hurd’s Metis theorem prover which is both standalone and incorporated into HOL 4 and Isabelle) ...|$|R
50|$|Bethany Memorial Chapel {{was built}} by Norwegian homesteaders who settled in the Big Bear Ridge area north of Kendrick in rural Latah County, Idaho. Norwegians who had settled in the area met {{at the home of}} Edward Dahl on July 21, 1902, for the purpose of {{organizing}} a Lutheran church in the area. In late July 1902, plans were prepared for the building, which was to be constructed on one-half acre of land promised by Edward Jones. However, Jones had sold his land to Halvor Nelson, who then added another one-half acre to the property. Construction of the Carpenter Gothic building began in 1905 and was completed, inside and out, in 1908. Although the interior of the building had not yet been completed, the first service in the church took place on December 26, 1905, when Halvor Lien married Hilda <b>Slind.</b> The pews, altar railing, and pulpit were carved by Eric Leien, a member of the congregation. It was originally named the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Bethany Congregation of Kendrick. There is no longer an active congregation holding services, but the church and cemetery are maintained by community members.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the rapid growth of the {{importance}} of internal communication (IC) (Invernizzi and Romenti 2009; Zerfass et al. 2011), both with reference to its diffusion and to the strategic role attached to it, has called for a new and in-depth reconsideration of its contribution in organizations. Indeed, recent perspectives in the debate state that IC is currently facing a complex phase of redefinition of its identity (Christensen and Cornelissen 2011; Hiebert et al. 2011; Groysberg and <b>Slind</b> 2012). However, scholarship on IC seems to have sensed the significance of this evolutionary step in the identity of IC with some delay (Verčič, Verčič, and Sriramesh 2012). So far, literature has depicted a dramatically fragmented picture of IC, failing also in providing a broad empirical exploration of the phenomenon. Acknowledging the demand for a wider and cohesive perspective on IC, this study aims at participating in the debate on the evolution of IC identity by investigating its changing dynamics, exploring the foundations of its identity, and mapping its specific dimensions as organizational agent. As for the method, an interpretive multi-phase and dynamic research design has been developed in order to cast a new, holistic (Daymon and Holloway 2002), and context-based (Creswell 2007) glance on a phenomenon whose evolutionary dynamics requires a new point of view (Bosio 2009) in order to grab the nuances of its complexities (Richards and Morse 2007). Therefore this study develops three interconnected and complementary levels of mapping of IC thought, perceptions, experiences, and practices (see figure 1). Based on findings, IC is revealed through narratives of evolutions, changes, and tensions, which depict IC as a phenomenon in transition between the inadequacy of its current positioning and the aspiration to take on an ideal mandate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn June 2012, Germany {{has been}} able to supply half of its own {{electric}} demand from solar energy. This is one of the promising examples for which renewable energy is taking a larger part in the total demand. But with the increase of solar or wind power on the market, there is more pressure on the stability of the grid and {{there is a need to}} balance the surplus of these new sources of energy. One of the most promising technologies for such power balancing is pumped storage hydropower (PSH). There is now a rapidly growing development of pumped storage hydropower in Europe, and a growing interest also in Norway due to the large hydro capacities. The term &# 147;Green Battery&# 148; has been introduced, where Norwegian hydropower reservoirs can be &# 147;charged&# 148; by surplus wind power and emptied in order to fill in load during calm periods. The background of this thesis starts by a screening process to identify the possible sites in Nord and S&# 248;r-Tr&# 248;ndelag. It is followed by a ranking of the sites based on economic and environmental criteria. 31 Sites have been identified gathering a capacity of 15, 000 MW for an average construction cost of 3. 1 million NOK per MW installed. The main environmental criterion is the water level variation in the reservoirs, limited to 13 cm/h in this study. This first part of this thesis is followed by a pre-feasibility study for the refurbishment of two existing power plants: Bogna and <b>Slind.</b> They are suitable for the installation of pumped storage hydropower technology. They can supply during 4. 5 days, 1, 100 MW and 430 MW (respectively). These capacities are the result of a cost optimization which was realized to select the optimum size of the two pumped storage hydro power plants. </p...|$|R
