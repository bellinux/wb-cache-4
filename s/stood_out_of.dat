5|$|Missouri <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Hampton Roads on 11 September 1952 {{and arrived}} at Yokosuka on 17 October. Vice Admiral Joseph J. Clark, {{commander}} of the 7th Fleet, brought his staff onboard on 19 October. Her primary mission was to provide seagoing artillery support by bombarding enemy targets in the Chaho-Tanchon area, at Chongjin, in the Tanchon-Sonjin area, and at Chaho, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Hungnam during the period 25 October through 2 January 1953.|$|E
5|$|Yorktown <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Callao on 4 March 1892, steamed northward via San Diego and San Francisco, and {{eventually}} {{arrived at the}} Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California. The gunboat subsequently underwent repairs there {{until late in the}} following month. Having weathered one diplomatic storm and international incident, Evans and his command soon set sail on another mission that, if handled wrongly, could have caused ill-feeling with the British.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{qualified}} {{nature of}} this comment, the operation Beatty had in mind was both important and potentially dangerous. On 6 February 1918, Battleship Division Nine <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Scapa Flow to guard the high value Scandinavian Convoy to and from Norway. Twice in the previous year, this convoy—with its essential cargos of iron ore, nitrates, and other chemicals—had been raided by German cruisers and destroyers, {{with the loss of}} 15 allied freighters. To avoid a repeat of these attacks, the British had taken to escorting the convoys with dreadnought squadrons. Still, the possibility existed that the Germans would send out their entire fleet to cut off and annihilate the overmatched battleship squadron, with severe strategic effect.|$|E

5|$|On 31 December 1918, Wadsworth <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Brest {{to return}} to the United States and reached Boston, Massachusetts, on 9January 1919. Following an {{extended}} overhaul, she put to sea on 1May to serve as one of the picket ships stationed at intervals across the ocean for the transatlantic flight of four Curtiss NC flying boats, one of which, NC-4, successfully completed the feat. The destroyer returned home and operated on the east coast through the summer of 1919. On 29August, Wadsworth was placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia where she remained almost two years. On 9May 1921, the destroyer returned to active service along the east coast.|$|E

25|$|The East China Sea and Yellow Sea were Triggers {{objective}} for her seventh patrol. She <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Midway on 22 October {{and proceeded}} to her patrol area. At 22:00 on 1 November, she sighted a convoy that was steaming in two columns. When a ship in the nearer column overlapped one in the more distant group, Trigger fired a spread of three torpedoes at them. One torpedo struck the nearer freighter in the bow and one hit the farther ship amidships. The submarine saw the nearer ship go down by the bow, before she herself was forced to go deep where she was severely depth-charged by two escorts.|$|E

The ship <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> San Diego on 15 October 1966, bound a second time for Southeast Asian waters, returning to its homeport on 28 March 1967 and making a midshipman training cruise to Pearl Harbor. Richmond K. Turner departed for its third tour off Vietnam on 10 June 1968, and contributed to Fleet readiness in Asian waters until returning to San Diego in December 1968.|$|E
25|$|After a brief {{return to}} Attu, Watts {{departed}} the Aleutians on 22 February {{and headed for}} Hawaii with Jarvis (DD-799). The two destroyers reached Pearl Harbor on 1 March and began a fortnight of training and voyage repairs. On the 15th, Watts <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Pearl Harbor {{and headed back to}} the Aleutians for less than a month of operations. On 18 April, DesDiv113 left the northern Pacific for good. From there, Watts and her division mates headed for Hawaii and three weeks of training in preparation for duty in the recently launched Okinawa invasion. On 5 May, she cleared the Hawaiian Islands and steamed west by way of Eniwetok and Ulithi.|$|E

25|$|The carrier resumed normal {{operations}} {{along the}} west coast soon after recommissioning. That assignment lasted until mid-March 1956. On 19 March, she <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> San Francisco Bay {{on her way to}} her third tour of duty with the 7th Fleet since her reactivation in 1953. Yorktown stopped at Pearl Harbor from 24 March – 9 April and then continued her voyage west. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan on 18 April and departed again on 29 April. The warship operated with the 7th Fleet for the next five months. During that time, she conducted operations in the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea. She also visited such places as Sasebo, Manila, Subic Bay, and Buckner Bay at Okinawa. On 7 September, the aircraft carrier <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Yokosuka and pointed her bow to the east. After a non-stop voyage, she arrived back at Alameda on 13 September. She resumed west coast operations for about two months. On 13 November, she embarked upon a round-trip to Pearl Harbor, from which she returned to Alameda on 11 December. Yorktown resumed normal operations out of Alameda upon her return and remained so employed until March 1957. On 9 March, she departed Alameda for yet another tour of duty in the Far East. She made stops at Oahu and Guam along the way and arrived at Yokosuka on 19 April. She put to sea to join TF 77 on 25 April and served with that task force for the next three months. On 13 August, the warship departed Yokosuka for the last time, made a brief pause at Pearl Harbor, and arrived in Alameda on 25 August.|$|E
25|$|After shakedown, Marvin H. McIntyre <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Los Angeles Harbor, 18 January 1945, on {{her first}} war mission. She arrived at her destination, Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, 4 February and {{commenced}} intensive amphibious training operations {{in preparation for the}} invasion of Okinawa. Departing the Solomons 15 March, McIntyre steamed in convoy for the advanced staging area at Ulithi. There she rendezvoused with her task unit and sailed for the Ryukyus 27 March. At Okinawa on 1 April, she discharged passengers and cargo for the initial attack. The attack transport remained off Okinawa until 5 April, when she retired to the Marianas with wounded marines as passengers. She arrived at Saipan on the 9th, debarked the casualties, and got underway against the next day for Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June, the {{aircraft}} carrier <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Majuro with TF 58 and set a course for the Mariana Islands. After five days steaming, she reached the launch point and began sending planes aloft for the preliminary softening up of targets {{in preparation for the}} invasion of Saipan. Yorktown aircrews concentrated primarily upon airfields located on Guam. Those raids continued until 13 June, when Yorktown, with two of the task groups of TF 58, steamed north to hit targets in the Bonin Islands. That movement resulted in a one-day raid on 16 June before the two task groups headed back to the Marianas to join in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. TF 58 reunited on 18 June and began a short wait for the approaching Japanese Fleet and its aircraft.|$|E
