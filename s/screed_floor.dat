40|$|Screed {{floors are}} bound by sand-cement (SF) or by {{anhydrite}} (AF). Sand-cement floors are levelled manually and anhydrite floors are self-levelling and therefore differences in work demands and prevalences of musculoskeletal complaints might occur. The objective was to assess among SF layers and AF layers (1) the prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints and (2) the physical work demands, energetic workload, perceived workload and discomfort. A questionnaire survey and an observational field study were performed. Compared with AF layers (n = 35), SF layers (n = 203) had higher, however, not statistically significant different, prevalences of neck (20 % vs. 7 %), shoulder (27 % vs. 13 %), low back (39 % vs. 26 %) and ankles/feet (9 % vs. 0 %) complaints. Sand-cement-bound <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers (n = 18) bent and kneeled significantly longer (Δ 77 min and Δ 94 min; respectively), whereas AF layers (n = 18) stood significantly longer (Δ 60 min). The work demands of SF layers exceeded exposure criteria for low back and knee complaints and therefore new working measures should be developed and implemented. In comparison with anhydrite-bound <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers, sand-cement-bound <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers exceeded exposure criteria for work-related low back and knee complaints. New working methods and measures for sand-cement-bound <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers should be developed and implemented {{to reduce the risk}} for work-related musculoskeletal complaint...|$|E
40|$|Electrical screed {{levelling}} {{machines are}} developed to reduce kneeling and trunk flexion of sand-cement-bound <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers. An observational intervention study among 10 floor layers {{was performed to}} assess the differences between a self-propelled and a manually moved machine. The outcome measures were work demands, production time, perceived load, discomfort and applicability. Compared to the self-propelled machine, the duration of kneeling (∆ 13 min; p = 0. 003) and trunk flexion (∆ 12 min; p < 0. 001) was shorter using the manually moved machine, and the duration of pushing and pulling increased (∆ 39 min; p < 0. 001). No significant or relevant differences were found for production time, perceived load and discomfort. Nine out of ten floor layers found the manually moved machine applicable and three out of ten found the self-propelled machine applicable. When compared with the traditional manner of floor laying, both electrical machines reduced the exposure towards kneeling and trunk flexion. Practitioner Summary: Electrical machines may help to reduce high physical work demands on floor layers. A manually moved machine is better applicable for the installation of screed floors in residences with smaller floor areas. A self-propelled machine is better applicable on large floor areas with a minimum width of 4...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{development}} and availability of ergonomic measures in the construction industry, the number of construction workers reporting high physical work demands remains high. A reduction of the high physical work demands {{can be achieved by}} using ergonomic measures. However, these ergonomic measures must be effective and implemented. In the first part, the effect of ergonomic measures on the physical work demands and workload was evaluated in two highly demanding construction jobs: <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers and ironworkers. It was found that a different working method and electrical screed levelling machines are effective in significantly reducing the exposure to physically high work demands of floor layers, but not for the workload. For ironworkers, allowing 100 -kg four-worker lifts instead of 50 -kg two-worker lifts did not result in differences in physical work demands, but reduced the biomechanical workload of the low back. The second part described and evaluated two guidance strategies of a Participatory Ergonomics intervention to implement ergonomic measures in construction companies. In the first strategy, the companies were guided by means of face-to-face contacts with an ergonomic consultant. In the second strategy, the guidance was offered through email contacts (e-guidance). The e-guidance influenced the use of ergonomic measures the most compared to the fact-to-face guidance, although the intervention was better delivered to the companies in the face-to-face guidance strategy...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} manufacturers' {{claims that}} structural polypropylene fibres provide satisfactory {{crack control reinforcement}} and compare the findings against steel fabric used as crack control in screeds where tensile forces are likely to occur. Design/methodology/approach – The procedure used to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and residual strength factors was compliant with ASTM C 1018 - 97 and in part ASTM C 78 - 02 to define first crack toughness and first crack strength. Findings – A 142 steel fabric reinforcement as used in screeds was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{with the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete. Where polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete did have an advantage over the steel reinforced concrete was when I 20 was exceeded and the deflection and crack width was excessive. Steel fabric tended to fail and/or the screed material failed either prior to or in excess of I 20, whereas the fibre reinforced concrete held together albeit at a very much reduced load transfer when compared with steel fabric. Practical implications – If the forces to be encountered through expansion or contraction are small, then, due to the small distances between the fibres redistributing the stress and minimising the cracks within the concrete matrix, polypropylene fibres may be suitable for crack control when directly compared with A 142 fabric reinforcement. The use of fibres has benefits to the floor screed companies, using screed-laying machines as the process avoids laying steel on which the screed machine will have to operate. Originality/value – There is a general lack of research coverage examining crack control in <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> finishing materials...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{present the}} {{experimental}} {{performance of the}} heat of wetting depending {{on the number of}} functional groups on the surface of quartz sand. It is established that in the process of increase of specific surface of fine ground quartz filler naturally there is an increase in the total number of active centers, but their number does not change per unit of surface. The calorimetric method of analysis established that the mechanical activation increases the reactivity centers. This is the result of chemical reactions occurring on the surface, for example, under the influence of water present in the air. The authors observed hydration of surface groups and change in their reactivity. A method of regulation of rheological characteristics of pastes with plasticizing additives in the system ”cement - quartz sand - graphite“ was developed, which was aimed to reduce the ultimate shear stress up to 0. 5 [...] . 1. 3 PA and water-composite relationship of a sand mix by 15 [...] . 25 % while maintaining the viscosity of the paste that provides a uniform application of the composite in <b>screed</b> <b>floors</b> technology possessing electrical conductivity. Polycarboxylate is an efficient plasticizing additive which maintains self-levelling effect of the mixture at optimum water-cement ratio. It was determined that the threshold concentration of electrical current flow in the studied system is 0. 15 (wt.), at which the aggregation of contacting graphite particles with the formation of a continuous three-dimensional mesh a conducting current is observed {{in the structure of the}} composite. The change in the concentration of the graphite allows ensuring the stability of the electrophysical parameters of the resistive materials and structures based on them. In order to increase the electrical conductivity of graphite dispersions in a model system a plasticizer was added, which reduces water-composite ratio in the formation of pastes. Chemical-based plasticizer has no significant effect on the magnitude of the threshold concentration. The increase in activation time of silica sand leads to the increased resistance of the prototypes and to the reduction of specific electrical conductivity of graphite dispersions in the system under study from 9. 8 Om - 1 ·m - 1 to 0. 018 Om - 1 ·m - 1.

40|$|Aerated {{concrete}} {{is one of}} the few constituent {{parts of}} demolition rubble for which no valid recycling technology has been developed. Anno 2010 aerated concrete is a problem waste fraction. It is undesirable in the stony fraction (concrete rubble, mixed rubble) because of the poorer technical characteristics for the traditional applications in foundations and under foundations of roads. In addition, the chemical composition (leaching of sulphates) may also cause problems in other applications (embankment, supplement, concrete) or in landfills. Recycling the aerated concrete in the production itself (closing the loop) is only possible if the waste product is pure enough, which is after demolition works is not easy to guarantee. There is a need for applications within which this fraction of construction and demolition waste can be recycled, and preferably in as high as possible applications so that a direct or good market can be generated for aerated concrete waste.

Consequently they can look very similar to a sand/cement screed Flow screeds are often {{preferred}} to traditional cement based screeds as they are faster to install and provide a similar finish. Flow screed is most often used in combination with underfloor heating installation as the reduced thickness provides for more effective and efficient heat transfer. One of the main advantages of liquid flow screed is that, it offers few additional benefits compared to sand and cement.

This study evaluates the characteristics of concrete produced with Atlantic ocean and Lagoon water. Concrete produced with tap water (regarded as potable drinking water) serves as the control experiment. Compressive strength, workability and density were used to evaluate the characteristics of concrete specimens. All the concrete samples have true shnnp with Lagoon water concrete having low workability and both tap and Atlantic ocean water concrete having medilllll workability. The concrete specimens produced with the three types of water fall into the category of normal weight concrete as their densities lie within the range of 2200 - 2600 kg m- 3 specified.

40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} waste (C&DW) {{represents one of}} the EU’s largest waste streams. According to the Directive 2008 / 98 /EC on waste, at least 70 percent (by weight) of non-hazardous C&DW must be recuperated by 2020. Eurostat estimates an annual C&DW generation of 970 Mton in EU- 27, representing an average value of almost 2. 0 ton per inhabitant, with an average recovery rate of 47 %. A case study in the Port of Antwerp (PoA) demonstrated new high grade recycling options for purified material fractions from C&DW. C&DW from the selective demolition of an office building was used {{for the construction of a}} new waste collection center. Recovery focused on the mineral fraction of C&DW. This selectively collected mineral fraction was crushed for the production of mixed recycled aggregates (MRA). Currently, MRA are used almost exclusively in low-grade unbound applications like (sub) foundations. However, this market is getting increasingly saturated. Therefore, the development of more high-grade applications is needed to assure a market for the stony fraction of C&DW. The use in these high-grade applications requires recycled aggregates with a higher purity, to guarantee optimal technical and environmental performance. In order to obtain this higher purity, MRA were treated by advanced automated sorting technologies. Near Infrared (NIR) sorting was used to strongly reduce the content of problematic fractions (e. g. organics, gypsum). These materials can lead to expansive compounds, delays in hardening and a lack of bonding strength in cement-based materials. As a result of the NIR sorting, the technical and environmental quality of the MRA was significantly improved. Subsequently, the purified MRA were treated by color (UV-VIS) sorting. This sorting technique allows the separation of a grey (concrete) fraction and a red (ceramic) fraction. The concrete fraction was then reprocessed into new concrete products that were used for the production of foundation concrete and polished concrete floors, both inside and outside the building. The latter application in particular can be considered as very high level, demonstrating the technical possibilities of pure recycled concrete aggregates. During the case study, a high-grade recycling option for autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) was also demonstrated. The major challenge for AAC recycling is sulfate leaching, causing both environmental and technical problems. A strong reduction in sulfate leaching from AAC recycling products was obtained via immobilization. Recycled AAC was used in the case study as a sand replacement in an insulating <b>flooring</b> <b>screed.</b> This case study illustrates the possible added value of selective demolition and advanced sorting techniques for the creation of high-grade recycling options. Additionally, a recycling pathway for one of the more problematic C&DW types (AAC) was demonstrated...|$|R
