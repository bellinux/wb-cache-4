50|$|Rush {{grew up in}} Chelmer, {{a western}} {{riverside}} suburb of Brisbane. Following his arrest, conviction and sentencing, {{it was revealed that}} Rush had been expelled from Brisbane's St Laurence's College during his Year 10 studies for an incident involving drugs. It was reported that Rush then moved to another Brisbane school, Marist College Rosalie, whence he graduated in 2002. Media reports claim that Rush was using cannabis at the age of 15 and has used ecstasy and prescription drugs. Further information released following his <b>sentencing,</b> <b>state</b> that in December 2004 Rush pleaded guilty at Inala Magistrates' Court to 16 offences, including drug possession, fraud, theft and drink-driving. A warrant for his arrest in Australia was outstanding {{at the time of his}} trip to Bali, relating to A$4,796.95 stolen from an Australian bank.|$|E
40|$|The general tone of {{articles}} by policy makers is satisfaction that pre-sumptive sentencing, as {{practiced in the}} United States, although threatened, has not been greatly damaged by Blakely v. Washington and related cases. Sentencing research, because it usually does not con-sider how discretion operates {{before and after the}} sentencing stage, does not actually provide an empirical basis for such satisfaction. Illustra-tions from several jurisdictions show that the presumptive sentence guidelines may not have been as effective at reducing discretion and disparity as policy makers seem to believe. In addition, the policy choices embedded in the sentencing grid itself can contribute to dispar-ity, and the grid can and should be analyzed to assess its role. Policy Implications: Although not definitive, these analyses suggest that policy makers need to be more cautious with any conclusion about the relative benefits of presumptive versus voluntary guidelines. Analyses of sentencing varia-tion must vary with the institutional setting. In a presumptive <b>sentencing</b> <b>state,</b> more of the total sentencing variation is likely to be contained in the grid or exercised in the charge bargaining stage (or earlier) com-pared with a less-structured sentencing system, where appreciable vari-ation may remain at the sentencing stage...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} and subsequently {{the execution of}} criminal penalties of deprivation of liberty byanother Member State, {{other than the one}} of the conviction, is an act of mutual trust between Member Statesof the European Union. However, the differences between criminal legal norms, particularly regarding theminimum and maximum limits of some punishment prescribed for the same offense, require a differentapproach in the sense that a member can not recognize and then enforce a sentence of deprivation of libertywith the maximum limits greater than its own legislation, for the same offense. This very sensitive issue wasresolved by adopting the Framework Decision 2008 / 909 /JHA of the Council from 27 November 2008, wherethe European legislative act allows the executing Member State the re-individualization of the deprivation ofliberty sentence, the goal being that the penalty imposed is compatible with the internal law of theenforcement state. In the implementation of European legislative act depositions, any member State whichhas recognized such a court order, based on a legal decision ordered by a competent judicial body may stillre-individualize the penalty regarding its maximum limit. The examination of the European legislative acthighlights also some flaws that must be corrected, taking into account the possibility for the executingMember States to fully modify the applied punishment, as regards both its nature and its proportion applied inthe <b>sentencing</b> <b>State...</b>|$|E

40|$|The ICC {{and other}} {{international}} criminal tribunals have at their disposal premises {{for the purpose of}} the pre-trial detention of accused. However, for the enforcement of their sentences these international tribunals are dependent on the assistance of States. Article 103 of the ICCSt stipulates that a sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a State designated by the ICC from a list of States which have indicated to the Court their willingness to accept sentenced persons. Legally, this amounts to a transfer of execution of a (foreign) judgment, a device that is well-known in the realm of international cooperation in criminal matters. In this horizontal context such transfers are usually governed by international treaties, the most famous of them being the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This Convention leaves States parties ample leeway to arrange the transfer of sentences and prisoners, but attaches a number of minimum requirements, like the condition that the sentenced person, the <b>sentencing</b> <b>State</b> and the administering State all agree to the transfer, that the sentenced person is a national of the administering State and that the condition of ‘double criminality’ is satisfied. Such conditions serve to reconcile the interests of States with those of the sentenced person. In the vertical framework of cooperation between the ICC and States, both the sovereign interests of States involved and the position of the individual are less prevailing and, indeed, are expected to succumb to the overarching aspirations of international criminal justice...|$|E
40|$|In September 2013 in {{the case}} of Divito v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) the Supreme Court of Canada dealt with the issue of whether section 6 (1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Charter, which grants Canadians the right to enter Canada was {{violated}} in a case where the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness declined to consent to the transfer of a Canadian citizen to serve his sentence in Canada where the <b>sentencing</b> <b>state</b> had consented to the transfer. Another issue was whether sections 8 (1) and 10 (1) (a) and 10 (2) (a) of the International Transfer of Offenders Act, which granted the Minister the discretion to consent or not to consent to the transfer, were contrary to section 6 (1) of the Charter. In resolving the above issues, the Court referred to its earlier jurisprudence, academic publications and international law. Although the Court agreed with the government that the appeal was moot because the appellant had left the USA {{by the time it was}} heard, it held that it retained “a residual discretion to decide the merits of a moot appeal if the issues raised are of public importance” and that this case was one of public importance because “[t]he issues are likely to recur in the future and there is some uncertainty resulting from conflicting decisions in the Federal Court. ” The purpose of this article is to highlight the interpretative tools invoked by the court and the implications of the judgement.

40|$|In {{this article}} I address the Problem of Universals by {{answering}} questions about what facts {{a solution to the}} Problem of Universals should explain and how the explanation should go. I argue that a solution to the Problem of Universals explains the facts the Problem of Universals is about by giving the truthmakers (as opposed to the conceptual content and the ontological commitments) of the <b>sentences</b> <b>stating</b> those facts. I argue that the <b>sentences</b> <b>stating</b> the relevant facts are those like 'a has the property F', that is, <b>sentences</b> <b>stating</b> that a particular has a certain property. Finally I show how answering these questions in this way transforms the Problem of Universals, traditionally conceived as the One over Many, that is, the problem of explaining how different particulars can have the same properties, into the Many over One, that is, the problem of explaining how the same particular can have different properties. The Problem of Universals is the problem of the Many over One. © Oxford University Press 2000...|$|R

40|$|Freeze (1992) argued on {{the basis}} of data from several {{different}} languages that there is a close relationship between existential <b>sentences</b> (<b>stating</b> the existence of an entity) and locative <b>sentences</b> (<b>stating</b> the location of an entity). Freeze (1992) proposes that they are both derived from the same base structure and that the surface differences are rather due to the distinct information structures. This paper argues against this position with the data from Serbian existentials, which show clear syntactic differences from the locatives. Thus, the close relationship between existential and locative sentences that Freeze (1992) observes is conceptual, but not (necessarily) part of the syntax of the language. In order to account for the data, we propose that existential sentences originate from a different syntactic predication structure than the locative ones. The existential meaning arises, as we will show, from the interaction of this predication structure with the structure and meaning of the noun phrase...|$|R
