500|$|In 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for [...] "When Love Takes Over", {{the media}} {{reported}} that Columbia Records and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement. However in a 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated {{the decision to}} leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record Ms. Kelly did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] she {{would go on to}} fire Matthew Knowles. It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow Destiny's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video ("Why Don't You Love Me") from her album I Am... Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released [...] "Commander" [...] was unfair on Rowland. These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] airing several days before [...] "Commander", the media was [...] "making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn't exist." [...] She also said, [...] "we all came out {{at the same time and}} it really doesn't matter... I think there's room for everybody... There's Bey, there's Ciara putting something out and [...] GaGa putting something out, but, because we started out together, people are going to <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> But I really don't care, I love her 'til our dying days and that's all that counts." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{peculiar}} tracks on the album include [...] "Bonsai People", which is a Red Hot Chili Peppers type funk metal song. The lyrics compare childlike people to bonsai trees {{in a way that}} they are tiny (humble, God-fearing) but as a strong breed they can endure the rending of wind (temptation) since their roots are deeply entrenched into soil (word of God). [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] on the other hand is a dark, melodic black metal type song which begins with oppressive clean guitaring. With a haunting voice a person whispers the words [...] "Hell is a totally cool site, so let's get there, all right?". This sentence is probably an attempt to describe the attitude of some of the black metal fans; the lyrics tell that those who <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> are under the 'spell of hell' which the devil uses to mislead people. Consecutively, it can be said that [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] was Deuteronomium's way of expressing their stance on the black metal movement which had at that time become very popular, with Emperor and likes being played on the Finnish metal radio program 'Metalliliitto', as the band members recall in an interview. [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] became Deuteronomium's best known song. The songs [...] "III" [...] and [...] "Northern Praise" [...] are also black metal influenced and present more worshipful lyrics, the forementioned is vocalized in Finnish and refers to the trinity of God. The latter is also a somewhat popular song as it is noted for being one of their best known songs. The self-titled song [...] "Street Corner Queen" [...] is a punk rock influenced death metal song about a prostitute, the lyrics tell that she sells love though deep inside she knows that it's not love at all, and that she seeks comfort from wrong ways. [...] "Druglord" [...] is another punk rock influenced death metal track. The lyrics are written from the perspective of a young person who suffers from drug addiction.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for MTVU.com, Noel said [...] "I did say {{at the time that}} it was my best song ever, but I'm kind of prone to <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> as you probably know." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, she was {{not aware}} at first of the {{importance}} of the discovery. In his memoir [...] What Mad Pursuit, Crick said that she had told him later [...] "You were always coming home and <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> so naturally I thought nothing of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sally stiffened. She {{had liked}} Ginger {{up to that}} moment, and later on, no doubt, she would resume her liking for him: but in the {{immediate}} moment which followed these words she found herself regarding him with stormy hostility. How dare he sit there <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> about Gerald? ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE (much {{put out by}} this pleasantry). No: don't <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> That's {{just the}} sort of thoughtless remark that makes a lot of mischief.|$|E
6000|$|Hallward started back. [...] "This is blasphemy, Dorian!" [...] he cried. [...] "You {{must not}} <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> They are horrible, and they don't mean anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you haven't it?" [...] she echoed. [...] "It's {{when you}} <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> that you're so dreadfully tiresome. As {{if there were}} {{anything}} that you haven't or mightn't have!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If Jerry {{is killed}} will {{you feel so}} fine about it?" [...] demanded Norman, who had been <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> all his life and never {{could be made to}} see any reason why he shouldn't. [...] "Now, never mind kicking me in the shins, Ellen. I want to see if Parson meant what he said or if it was just a pulpit frill." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hoopdriver {{began to}} suspect that his {{antagonist}} was, if possible, more seriously alarmed {{at the prospect of}} violence than himself, and his spirits rose again. These chaps ought to have a thorough lesson. [...] "Of COURSE you knew the door was open," [...] he retorted indignantly. [...] "Of COURSE you thought we should hear what you said. Don't go telling lies about it. It's no good your <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> You've had your fun, and you meant to have your fun. And I mean to make an example of you, Sir." ...|$|R
60|$|JULIA (firing up). If he {{has nothing}} worse than that on his conscience, he may sleep pretty well. In what way am I more womanly {{than any of the}} rest of them, I should like to know? They are always <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> behind my back--I hear of them from Sylvia. Only the other day a member of the {{committee}} said I ought never to have been elected--that you (to Charteris) had smuggled me in. I should like to see her say it to my face: that's all.|$|R
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. You shouldn't <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> Jack. I {{hope you}} won't tell Ann that I have been {{speaking}} to you. I only wanted to set myself right with you and Tavy. I couldn't sit mumchance and have everything put on me.|$|E
6000|$|Oh, don't <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to me. It {{breaks my}} heart. I wouldn't ever {{have told you}} only I was upset by your going. If they'd only given me time {{to get used to}} the thought I wouldn't ... I wouldn't make such a fool of myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, don't <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> Jane," [...] said Anne quickly, [...] "because {{it sounds}} silly. It couldn't {{be better than}} Mrs. Evans's, you know, for she is a professional, and I'm only a schoolgirl, with a little knack of reciting. I'm quite {{satisfied}} if the people just liked mine pretty well." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 vice-presidential {{debate on}} October 2, 2008, Palin stated that [...] "A leader like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, {{who is not}} sane or stable when he <b>says</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons." [...] She also further criticized Obama's {{proposal}} in 2007 to meet with Ahmadinejad without preconditions, stating that such an action [...] "is downright dangerous because leaders like Ahmadinejad, who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe {{off the face of}} the Earth an ally like we have in Israel, should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{this time}} it's in our relations, yours and mine," [...] Verena replied, {{in a tone}} in which only Verena could <b>say</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> [...] "You ought {{to see how she}} throws herself into them. She is sure it will all work round for your good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{she used}} to <b>say</b> funny <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> to make you laugh when you were all ready to cry. There wasn't many folks {{understood}} her.

6000|$|... "If you <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I shall {{forget how}} far we have to travel," [...] he declared. [...] "I need your friendship. I have come over here with rather a desperate purpose. I think I can say that I have never known fear, and yet {{sometimes}} I flinch when I think of the next few months. I want a real friend, Lady Dredlinton." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Pope said he shouldn't <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> She {{then said}} [...] "Syd!" [...] quietly but sharply to Sydney, {{who was making}} a disdainful, squinting face at Theodore, and told the parlourmaid to clear the plates for sweets. Mr. Magnet professed great horror of public speaking. He said that {{whenever}} he rose to make an after-dinner speech all the ices he had ever eaten seemed {{to come out of}} the past, and sit on his backbone.|$|E
6000|$|Dan and {{the girls}} and I were sitting in a row on Aunt Olivia's garden fence, {{watching}} Felix weed. Felix worked well, {{although he did not}} like weeding--"fat boys never do," [...] Felicity informed him. Felix pretended not to hear her, but I knew he did, because his ears grew red. Felix's face never blushed, but his ears always gave him away. As for Felicity, she did not <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> out of malice prepense. It never occurred to her that Felix did not like to be called fat.|$|E
60|$|There were a {{good many}} {{neighbours}} gathered in the house, {{and some of them}} remembered Hanrahan; but some of the little lads that were in the corners had only heard of him, and they stood up to have a view of him, and one of them said: 'Is not that Hanrahan that had the school, and that was brought away by Them?' But his mother put her hand over his mouth and bade him be quiet, and not be <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> 'For Hanrahan is apt to grow wicked,' she said, 'if he hears talk of that story, or if anyone goes questioning him.' One or another called out then, asking him for a song, but the man of the house said it was no time to ask him for a song, before he had rested himself; and he gave him whiskey in a glass, and Hanrahan thanked him and wished him good health and drank it off.|$|R
60|$|Don't {{like these}} Chinese lanterns, with that moon-tawdry! eh! By Jove, Molly, I {{sometimes}} think we humans are a rubbishy lot--each of us talking {{and thinking of}} nothing but our own petty little affairs; {{and when you see}} a great <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> up there--[Sighs.] But there's your Aunt, if I were to <b>say</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to her she 'd-- she'd think me a lunatic; and yet, you know, she 's a very good woman.|$|R
5000|$|During {{a battle}} with the Nazis on Elbe Day, the Phantom Reporter narrates, [...] "Dynamic Man said you couldn't throw a rock without hitting {{somebody}} in a mask and tights. 'And those are just the pansies in the German army,' he said, then added-- 'They'd probably run even faster if they weren't wearing those stiletto heels.' Curt was always <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> He {{made a point of}} saying them. Which made some of us wonder if maybe it was D.M. who had something besides his costume hidden deep in his closet." [...] The Twelve #1 Dynamic Man also displays an anti-homosexual attitude towards the flamboyant Blue Blade and threatens a gay supporter with bodily harm. In a quick interview, Dynamic Man calls J. Edgar Hoover [...] "a man's man" [...] (perhaps an intentional irony because Hoover's enemies have spread the rumor <b>that</b> he reportedly <b>liked</b> to dress up in women's clothes). He becomes increasingly colder with time, seeking fame and recognition, and stressing his status as the Man of Tomorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{would be}} {{extremely}} awkward,” said Jane, meeting an irresolute piece of bread and butter halfway; “we hardly know the McKennas, {{and it would be}} very tiresome having to telephone to some unsympathetic private secretary, describing Louise to him and asking to have her sent back in time for dinner. Fortunately, I didn’t go to any place of devotion, though I did get mixed up with a Salvation Army procession. It was quite interesting to be at close quarters with them, they’re so absolutely different to what they used to be when I first remember them in the ’eighties. They used to go about then unkempt and dishevelled, in a sort of smiling rage with the world, and now they’re spruce and jaunty and flamboyantly decorative, like a geranium bed with religious convictions. Laura Kettleway was going on about them in the lift of the Dover Street Tube the other day, saying what a lot of good work they did, and what a loss it would have been if they’d never existed. ‘If they had never existed,’ I said, ‘Granville Barker would have been certain to have invented something that looked exactly like them.’ If you <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> quite loud, in a Tube lift, they always sound like epigrams.” ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she could}} not <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to her, because she had promised Selina, who made a great point of this, {{that she would never}} be too {{familiar}} with her. Selina was not without her ideas of decorum--very far from it indeed; only she erected them in such queer places. She was not familiar with her children's governess; she was not even familiar with the children themselves. That was why after all it was impossible to address much of a remonstrance to Miss Steet when she sat as if she were tied to the stake and the fagots were being lighted. If martyrs in this situation had tea and cold meat served them they would strikingly have resembled the provoking young woman in the schoolroom at Mellows. Laura could not have denied that it was natural she should have liked it better if Mrs. Berrington would sometimes just look in and give a sign that she was pleased with her system; but poor Miss Steet only knew by the servants or by Laura whether Mrs. Berrington were at home or not: she was for the most part not, and the governess had a way of silently intimating (it was the manner she put her head on one side when she looked at Scratch and Parson--of course she called them Geordie and Ferdy) that she was immensely handicapped and even that they were. Perhaps they were, though they certainly showed it little in their appearance and manner, and Laura was at least sure that if Selina had been perpetually dropping in Miss Steet would have taken that discomfort even more tragically. The sight of this young woman's either real or fancied wrongs did not diminish her conviction that she herself would have found courage to become a governess. She would have had to teach very young children, for she believed she was too ignorant for higher flights. But Selina would never have consented to that--she would have considered it a disgrace or even worse--a pose. Laura had proposed to her six months before that she should dispense with a paid governess and suffer her to take charge of the little boys: in that way she should not feel so completely dependent--she should be doing something in return. 'And pray what would happen when you came to dinner? Who would look after them then?' Mrs. Berrington had demanded, with a very shocked air. Laura had replied that perhaps it was not absolutely necessary that she should come to dinner--she could dine early, with the children; and that if her presence in the drawing-room should be required the children had their nurse--and what did they have their nurse for? Selina looked at her as if she was deplorably superficial and told her that they had their nurse to dress them and look after their clothes--did she wish the poor little ducks to go in rags? She had her own ideas of thoroughness and when Laura hinted that after all at that hour the children were in bed she declared that even when they were asleep she desired the governess to be at hand--that was the way a mother felt who really took an interest. Selina was wonderfully thorough; she said something about the evening hours in the quiet schoolroom being the proper time for the governess to 'get up' the children's lessons for the next day. Laura Wing was conscious of her own ignorance; nevertheless she presumed to believe that she could have taught Geordie and Ferdy the alphabet without anticipatory nocturnal researches. She wondered what her sister supposed Miss Steet taught them--whether she had a cheap theory that they were in Latin and algebra.|$|E

5000|$|Yuhas openly {{rejects the}} civil rights {{argument}} {{of gay and lesbian}} people. [...] "If {{you have to go out}} of your way and tell people that you are gay or somebody thinks that you're feminine or whatever, well, I'm sorry, that's not the same as being a black guy who has to face the horrors of racism every day of his life in some places." [...] He goes further by saying that LGBT individuals cannot be compared to the African American civil rights struggle because being black is [...] "immutable," [...] but you cannot look at a person and know they are gay. Yuhas has been berated by gay advocacy groups for <b>saying</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and even had to fend off a formal Federal Communications Commission (FCC) complaint for using alleged homophobic slurs over the public airwaves. The latter complaint was because Yuhas has a sometimes-segment on his program called the [...] "Extraordinary Gay Update" [...] where he urges gay people not to use words that [...] "we demand others purge from their vocabulary" [...] as we use the words about ourselves.|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT [scared {{and much}} upset]. On my word I believe I am, Miss Reilly. If {{you say that}} to me again I shan't answer for myself: all the harps of Ireland are in your voice. [She laughs at him. He {{suddenly}} loses his head and seizes her arms, to her great indignation]. Stop laughing: do you hear? I am in earnest--in English earnest.

60|$|Kipps bowed {{over her}} hand. His manners, his counter manners, were the easiest {{she had ever}} seen upon him. She turned to her mother. It was no good now, no good. Her mother! You couldn't <b>say</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before her mother! All was lost but politeness. Kipps rushed for the door. He stood at the door bowing with {{infinite}} gravity, and she smiled and nodded as she went out. She saw nothing of the struggle within him, nothing but a satisfactory emotion. She smiled like a satisfied goddess as the incense ascends.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the final}} of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić caused a minor stir when he said it would be [...] "good" [...] if Phelps lost. [...] "It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy", Čavić said. Phelps responded, [...] "When people <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> it fires me up more than anything." [...] On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest {{competitor}} Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.|$|E
5000|$|Suhler {{never had}} the {{privilege}} of sharing the stage with Stevie Ray Vaughan, but he did get the opportunity to meet the blues legend on a couple of occasions, initially in 1989 at his father's jewelry store in Dallas when Vaughan stopped in to have a watch repaired. When Suhler's father asked Stevie if he had any advice for his musician son, his reply was [...] "Yeah, keep it clean" [...] - meaning stay clear of drugs, advice which Suhler took to heart. When Vaughan didn't return to pick up the watch, Suhler decided to try to return it to him - [...] "Vaughan was playing in Dallas at Fair Park, I take his watch to him, get backstage and he's very amused that I'm even there bringing him his watch—he was very polite, a very sweet, soft-spoken man. And I'm not big on vibes and auras and stuff like that but I swear on everything that's holy to me that when Stevie walked up to me he radiated a light, he had an aura about him. And I don't even like to <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> because people say 'Yeah, sure' - but he was a big inspiration to me".|$|E
