40|$|A {{reliable}} <b>static</b> formation <b>temperature</b> {{is valuable}} in determining casing depths, establishing geothermal gradients, analyzing logs and estimating fluid potential for geothermal reservoirs. The conventional drilling mud fluid systems associated with geothermal well drilling distort the <b>static</b> formation <b>temperature</b> near the wellbore because the circulating mud temperature is normally {{much less than}} the <b>static</b> formation <b>temperature.</b> As a result, a wellbore temperature recorded during drilling operations does not reflect the static formation condition. The use of a Horner-type temperature buildup plot, similar to the conventional pressure buildup method, has been suggested for estimating <b>static</b> formation <b>temperature.</b> The method has proven satisfactory in a number of oil and gas field cases. Recently, Dowdle and Cobb investigated the conditions under which the Horner temperature plot can be used to yield representative <b>static</b> formation <b>temperatures.</b> They concluded that the method is reliable if both the wellbore temperature gradient changes very slowly and the mud circulation time is short. However, in geothermal operations, temperature gradients are usually more extreme and longer circulation times are required to cool the wellbore sufficiently for logging. Therefore, the method has proved to be less reliable. As an alternative solution, dimensionless Horner temperature type curves have been developed for determining reliable <b>static</b> formation <b>temperatures</b> under normal geothermal drilling conditions in the Imperial Valley, California. This paper discusses solutions of the basic temperature equation and their comparison with empirical data, development of empirical type curves, accuracy of the <b>static</b> formation <b>temperature</b> estimation, and two field examples of such estimation. 5 refs., 3 figs...|$|R

50|$|A {{supersonic}} {{wind tunnel}} is a wind tunnel that produces supersonic speeds (1.2<M<5)The Mach number and flow {{are determined by}} the nozzle geometry. The Reynolds number is varied by changing the density level (pressure in the settling chamber). Therefore, a high pressure ratio is required (for a supersonic regime at M=4, this ratio is of the order of 10). Apart from that, condensation of moisture or even gas liquefaction can occur if the <b>static</b> <b>temperature</b> becomes cold enough. This means that a supersonic wind tunnel usually needs a drying or a pre-heating facility.A supersonic wind tunnel has a large power demand, so that most are designed for intermittent instead of continuous operation.|$|E
