5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or white sugar.|$|E
5000|$|Processing sucrose from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> yields glycine betaine as a byproduct. The {{value of}} the TMG rivals that of the sugar content in <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On February 4, 2011, the USDA-APHIS {{announced}} glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> {{had been}} partially deregulated and growers {{would be allowed}} to plant seed from spring 2011 until an EIS is completed. [...] USDA-APHIS developed requirements that growers must follow if handling glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> and will monitor growers throughout the partial deregulation period. [...] The requirements are classified into categories which include planting glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> for seed production, planting for sugar production, and transporting <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> across state lines. [...] Failure to follow the requirements set by USDA-APHIS may result in civil or criminal charges and destruction of the crop. In July 2012, after completing an environmental impact assessment and a plant pest risk assessment the USDA deregulated Monsanto's Roundup Ready <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT] Crop maps {{were made}} using Landsat TM {{data of the}} Tokachi plains, Hokkaido, Japan, to {{investigate}} the relationship between soil organic matter content and planting ratio. Sugar content and root weight of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were also estimated using Landsat TM data obtained around harvesting time in 1986. The study site was classified into 5 -subclasses. <b>Sugar</b> <b>beets,</b> potatoes and wheat were distinguished with 95 per cent accuracy. Sugar content and root yield also could be estimated with accuracy using this method. Planting ratio and yield of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> varied according to soil organic matter content. These results suggest that Landsat TM data are useful for constructing crop maps and for estimating sugar content and root weight for <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> Application of this approach may increase productivity of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> by improving fertilization...|$|R
5|$|Sugar {{also led}} to some {{industrialization}} of areas where sugar cane was grown. For example, Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment, persuaded the British Government that sugar cane could be cultivated in British India with many advantages and at less expense than in the West Indies; as a result, sugar factories were established in Bihar in eastern India. During the Napoleonic Wars, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> production increased in continental Europe {{because of the difficulty}} of importing sugar when shipping was subject to blockade. By 1880, the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> was the main source of sugar in Europe. It was cultivated in Lincolnshire and other parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part of its sugar from its colonies.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{infestation}} by this aphid, leaves of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> become swollen, roll, and cease developing. The roots grow poorly and the sugar content is reduced. In some other plants the leaves do not become distorted but growth is affected and flowers abort due to {{the action of the}} toxic saliva injected by the aphid to improve the flow of sap.|$|E
5|$|There {{were a few}} regular {{carriers}} left by the 1920s, one of whom ran Jackson's Navy, using {{horses to}} tow the barges, and steam tugs after 1930. When the company stopped trading in 1948, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> traffic was carried to Ely in boats owned by the beet factory for another ten years. Fuel oil for the pumping stations was supplied by the tanker barge Shellfen until 1971, by which time the Well Creek was almost impassible.|$|E
50|$|Sugar is {{generally}} produced from sugarcane or <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> However, the global production of sugar from sugarcane {{is at least}} twice the production from <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> Therefore, this section focuses on sugar from sugarcane.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) {{deregulated}} glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> {{after it}} conducted an environmental assessment and determined glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were highly unlikely {{to become a}} plant pest. Sugar from glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> has been approved for human and animal consumption in multiple countries, but commercial production of biotech beets has been approved only in the United States and Canada.|$|R
50|$|The main {{crops that}} are grown are wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, <b>sugar</b> <b>beets,</b> fruits and vegetables. The {{livestock}} that is raised include cattle and sheep. In the drier east, farmers grow wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet.</b> It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet,</b> bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1800s, Credit Suisse set up banking and {{insurance}} companies in Germany, Brussels, Geneva and others (as SKA International) with the bank as a shareholder of each company. It created insurance companies like Swiss RE, Swiss Life, Rentenanstalt and Schweiz. Credit Suisse had its first unprofitable year in 1886, due to losses in agriculture, venture investments, commodities and international trade. The bank created its own <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> factory, bought 25,000 shares in animal breeding ventures and supported an export business, Schweizerische Exportgesellschaft, that experienced heavy losses for over-speculative investing.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the Center for Food Safety, the Sierra Club, the Organic Seed Alliance and High Mowing Seeds filed {{a lawsuit}} against USDA-APHIS {{regarding}} their decision to deregulate glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> in 2005. The organizations expressed concerns regarding glyphosate-resistant sugar beets' ability to potentially cross-pollinate with conventional <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b> U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White, US District Court for the Northern District of California, revoked the deregulation of glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> and declared it unlawful for growers to plant glyphosate-resistant <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> in the spring of 2011. Believing a sugar shortage would occur USDA-APHIS developed three options in the environmental assessment to address the concerns of environmentalists. In 2011, a federal appeals court for the Northern district of California in San Francisco overturned the ruling. In July 2012, after completing an environmental impact assessment and a plant pest risk assessment the USDA deregulated Monsanto's Roundup Ready <b>sugar</b> <b>beets.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2007, GM <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were commercialized and GM seed {{sold in the}} United States. In 2008/2009, 60% of the <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> {{grown in}} the US were GM. By 2009/2010, the {{percentage}} of GM beets had grown to 95%.|$|R

5|$|Both {{strontium}} and strontianite {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it {{was identified as a}} new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> was in the 19th century the largest application of strontium (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass. With the displacement of cathode ray tubes by other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.|$|E
5|$|Early {{freight traffic}} {{consisted}} of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> and swedes, together with {{large volumes of}} peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch. Traffic into the area included manure. In the 1920s, stations notified the control centre at Goole {{of the number of}} wagons they would need for consignments of peas and potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began {{to take some of the}} trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, and those were run if required. The peat works at Hatfield was still supplying an average of six wagon-loads per day.|$|E
5|$|While Degesch {{owned the}} rights to the brand name Zyklon and the patent on the {{packaging}} system, the chemical formula was owned by Degussa. Schlempe GmbH, which was 52 per cent owned by Degussa, owned {{the rights to}} a process to extract hydrogen cyanide from waste products of <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> processing. This process was performed under license by two companies, Dessauer Werke and Kaliwerke Kolin, who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from Schering AG to form the final product, which was packaged using equipment, labels, and canisters provided by Degesch. The finished goods were sent to Degesch, who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors: Heerdt-Linger GmbH (Heli) of Frankfurt and Tesch & Stabenow (Testa) of Hamburg. Their territory was split along the Elbe river, with Heli handling clients to the west and south, and Testa those to the east. Degesch owned 51 per cent of the shares of Heli, and until 1942 owned 55 per cent of Testa.|$|E
