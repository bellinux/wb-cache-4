40|$|We {{investigated}} the growth parameters of Saccharomyces rouxii isolated from spoiled chocolate syrup. The optimum pH range for <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> was 3. 5 to 5. 5, whereas the minimum and maximum pH values that permitted growth were 1. 5 and 10. 5, respectively. For cells grown in 0 and 60 % sucrose the optimum water activity (aw) values were 0. 97 and 0. 96, respectively. The optimum temperature for <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> increased with a decreasing aw {{regardless of whether}} glucose or sucrose {{was used as the}} humectant. The optimum temperatures for <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> were 28 degrees C at an aw of greater than 0. 995 and 35 degrees C at an aw of 0. 96 to 0. 90 in 2 X potato dextrose broth with sucrose. Increasing the sorbate concentration (from 0. 03 to 0. 10 %) caused the growth of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> to become more inhibited between aws of greater than 0. 995 and 0. 82. <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> did not grow when the sorbate level was 0. 12 % (wt/vol). At lower sorbate levels, the effect of sorbate on the growth of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> depended on the aw level. Lowering the aw enhanced the resistance of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> to increasing concentrations of potassium sorbate. Permeability and polyol production are discussed with respect to sorbate tolerance of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> at different aw levels...|$|E
40|$|By {{crossing}} of a heterothallic haploid yeast, Saccharomyces rouxii, we {{have succeeded in}} obtaining diploid hybrids. This paper shows one possible method of breeding heterothallic haploid yeasts for industrial application. <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> is highly salt-tolerant and {{plays an important role}} in shoyu and miso fermentation. Therefore, genetic improvements of the properties are of commercial importance. Since newly isolated <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> could neither conjugate nor sporulate on sporulation media commonly used, a suitable medium for conjugation and sporulation of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> was firstly investigated. A 5 % NaCl Shoyu-koji extract agar was found to be most efficient. Next, we tried to get diploid strains by mass culture of two mating types on the conjugation medium, but several phenomena made this difficult: (i) zygotes quickly sporulated before budding; (ii) several zygotes showed terminal budding, but the buds could not grow into diploid cells, suggesting they would be heterocaryon; and (iii) a few zygotes lost their viability. After trying to isolate and cultivate a large number of zygotes in various combinations of crossing by micromanipulation, we fortunately recognized that large cells arose from some combinations. The analysis of ploidy suggested that the large cells would be diploid. Also, they showed sporulation of typical Saccharomyces, i. e., two to four spores in an unconjugated ascus. The diploid strains thus obtained were highly salt-tolerant and stable in liquid medium. Therefore, the procedure presented here would be effective for breeding salt-tolerant <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii...</b>|$|E

When exponentially growing yeasts were transferred from a normal high water activity growth medium (awO. 997) to synthetic medium containing 8 % NaCI (low water activity growth medium aw 0. 955) the pattern of glycerol accumulation during the first eight hours of the adaptation was markedly different in the two species. <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> began to accumulate glycerol immediately after transfer whereas glycerol accumulation by S. cerevisiae was both retarded and greatly diminished in magnitude.

40|$|We {{identified}} putative long terminal repeat- (LTR) retrotransposon sequences {{among the}} 50, 000 random sequence tags (RSTs) {{obtained by the}} Génolevures project from genomic libraries of 13 Hemiascomycetes species. In most cases additional sequencing enabled us to assemble the whole sequences of these retrotransposons. These approaches identified 17 distinct families, 10 of which are defined by full-length elements. We also identified five families of solo LTRs that were not associated with retrotransposons. Ty 1 -like retrotransposons were found in four of five species that are phylogenetically related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. uvarum, S. exiguus, S. servazzii, and S. kluyveri but not Zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and in two of three Kluyveromyces species (K. lactis and K. marxianus but not K. thermotolerans). Only multiply crippled elements could be identified in the K. lactis and S. servazzii strains analyzed, and only solo LTRs could be identified in S. uvarum. Ty 4 -like elements were only detected in S. uvarum, indicating that these elements appeared recently before speciation of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. Ty 5 -like elements were detected in S. exiguus, Pichia angusta, and Debaryomyces hansenii. A retrotransposon homologous with Tca 2 from Candida albicans, an element absent from S. cerevisiae, was detected in the closely related species D. hansenii. A complete Ty 3 /gypsy element was present in S. exiguus, whereas only partial, often degenerate, sequences resembling this element were found in <b>S.</b> servazzii, Z. <b>rouxii,</b> <b>S.</b> kluyveri, C. tropicalis, and Yarrowica lipolytica. P. farinosa (syn. P. sorbitophila) is currently the only yeast species in which no LTR retrotransposons or remnants have been found. Thorough analysis of protein sequences, structural characteristics of the elements, and phylogenetic relationships deduced from these data allowed us to propose a classification for the Ty 1 /copia elements of hemiascomycetous yeasts and a model of LTR-retrotransposon evolution in yeasts...|$|R

In this work, the ability to produce trehalose of soy sauce yeasts was studied first and {{the results showed that}} trehalose could be accumulated gradually in logarithmic phase and achieve a concentration peak in stationary phase. Then the relevance of growth conditions and intracellular trehalose level of soy sauce yeasts was investigated. Mutant strains (S 3 - 2, T 3 - 5) which can grow in hypertonic conditions, showed different results from their original organisms Zygosaccharomyces <b>rouxii</b> (<b>S)</b> and Torulopsis versatilis (T). For S and T could increase trehalose level from 7. 0 % and 7. 5 % to 8. 4 % and 9. 6 % with 9 % salt stimulation, respectively. While the mutants could accumulate more trehalose under a higher salt (about 12 %) stimulation compared to 0 % NaCl situation, which suggested a significant feature of the mutants. And the original strains could increase the trehalose level from 8. 4 % and 9. 6 % to 10. 1 % and 10. 9 % respectively under heat shock (40 °C, 30 mins). Moreover, the mutant strains could also product more trehalose in the thermal stimulation condition, but less than the original ones...|$|R
40|$|The osmotolerance of Saccharomyces rouxii 48 - 28 was {{confirmed}} with both NaCl- and KCl-fortified growth media, with more tolerance being exhibited for the potassium salt. Washed and buffered cells from unfortified medium were challenged {{with a variety}} of compounds (and also with physical treatments) that potentially would elicit membrane perturbations. The efficacy of these brief treatments was judged primarily by monitoring subsequent viability. Change in the degree of expression of β-fructofuranosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26), which is cryptic in young cells of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii,</b> was a second criterion. There was a linear correlation between cell death and enzyme expression for treatments with polyenes, detergents, some organic solvents which did not denature the enzyme, and various freeze-thaw regimens in graded amounts of glycerol. The species is relatively insensitive to polyene antimycotics, the order of decreasing effect being filipin, nystatin, and amphotericin B. <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> was found to be less sensitive to osmotic shock than is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but in neither species is β-fructofuranosidase released to the medium. The sensitivity of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> to ionic detergents, but not to nonionic detergents, was rationalized as being due to cell wall discrimination against larger micelles for the nonionic examples. This {{was confirmed}} by showing that protoplasts were sensitive to both classes. In cultures older than 5 days the normal agreement between colony-forming units and methylene blue exclusion (another test of viability) no longer held. Delayed fermentation of sucrose by <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii,</b> which is a diagnostic feature of the species, is explained by death of some cells, expression of their β-fructofuranosidase, and utilization of the monosaccharides by the surviving cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{activity of}} the sugar-tolerant (osmophilic) yeast, Saccharomyces rouxii, and the non-tolerant species, Sacchromyces cerevisiae, were compared after growth in a complex basal medium, the medium supplemented with polyethylene glycol (mol. wt 200) to give a water activity of 0. 95, and the medium supplemented with glucose (24 and 36 %, w/v). The properties compared were Qo, (glucose), NADH oxidase activity of isolated mitochondria 1 fractions, and cytochrome content. When grown in the basal medium S. cerevisiae was somewhat more active than <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> by all criteria.

40|$|The {{immobilization}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DSM 70424, Saccharomyces ludwigii DSM 3447 and Saccharomyces rouxii DSM 2531 on brewer’s {{spent grain}} and then ethanol production and sugar consumption of these immobilized yeasts were investigated. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the abilities of these three immobilized yeasts for producing alcohol for brewing at two temperatures (7 and 12 °C) using two different sugar levels (one at original level supplied in the brewery and one with 2. 5 % (w/v), added glucose to the wort). Increasing both parameters resulted in higher alcohol production by all the yeasts studied. At 7 °C and with original wort density the ethanol content at the end of fermentation was 2. 7 % (v/v) for S. cerevisiae, 1. 7 % for S. ludwigii and 2. 0 % for <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii.</b> After the addition of 2. 5 % (w/v) glucose at the same temperature (7 °C), the alcohol production was increased to 4. 1, 2. 8 and 4. 1 %, respectively. Similar improvements were observed when the fermentation was carried out at 12 °C with/without the addition of glucose to the wort. However, temperature indicated greater influence on S. ludwigii than did on <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> and S. cerevisiae.

40|$|Raffinose {{hydrolysis}} was {{studied in}} Saccharomyces rouxii. The responsible enzyme {{was identified as}} a β-fructofuranosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26), which has a pH optimum of 5. 5 and a Km of 83 mM for raffinose. This enzyme was cryptic in cells from a 3 -day culture. A 2 -min treatment with 0. 1 volume of ethyl acetate in sodium acetate buffer (pH 6) gave complete expression of the enzyme, which was still retained by the cell. Ghosts were prepared by modifying membrane structure with small basic proteins in distilled water, and after washing they showed the full complement of enzymatic activity. The enzyme remained cryptic in osmotically protected spheroplasts; however, after lysis (by dilution) release, as well as expression, was effected. Mechanical disruption of fresh cells revealed and released all of the enzyme. Cells in early stationary phase had all of their β-fructofuranosidase in a cryptic state. Aging yielded fractional expression of activity; initially this was proportional to cell death, but later the degree of expression exceeded the death rate. Media from aged cultures or cell-free extracts of aged cells were not effective in revealing the cryptic enzyme of younger cells. <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> β-fructofuranosidase has a different autolytic-release pattern from its counterpart in S. cerevisiae. Also, high concentrations of glucose do not repress the <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> enzyme. The β-fructofuranosidase in young cells of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> must be enclosed by the protoplasmic membrane or a special vesicular structure.

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the effect of fermentation condition and Saccharomyces strains on the pH, foam property and CO 2 concentration of non-alcoholic beer (Ma-al-shaeer). For this, the beer samples were inoculated with four different species of Saccharomyces (Saccharomyces rouxii 70531, <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> 70535, S. ludwigii 3447 and S. cerevisiae 70424) and fermented for 48 h in both aerobic and periodic aeration at three different temperatures. Then their pH, CO 2 concentration and foam property were analyzed in 12 h intervals during 48 h fermentation. The results shows that the treatments with 4 × 10 7 CFU. ml - 1 and periodic aeration at 24 ˚C showed the greatest decrease in pH, and the treatments with 10 7 CFU. ml - 1 and aerobic-periodic aeration at 4 ˚C showed the lowest decrease in pH. The highest and lowest amounts of CO 2 and foam property were obtained in the treatments with 4 × 10 7 CFU. ml - 1 inoculation, aerobic condition, and the treatments with 10 7 CFU. ml - 1, periodic aeration, respectively. These results further demonstrated that the highest drop in pH, and the highest ability of producing CO 2 and foam were for S. cerevisiae 70424, and the lowest belonged to <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> 70531. The overall outcome of the study points to the fact that physico-chemical properties of Ma-al-shaeer is important from the consumers' point of view.

40|$|Cells of the {{osmotolerant yeast}} Saccharomyces rouxii were {{transformed}} to protoplasts in good yield (85 %) by digesting cell walls with snail-gut enzyme {{in the presence}} of 10 mM dithioerythritol, 0. 1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8), and 2. 0 M KCl. The requirement for 2. 0 M KCl compares with that for S. bisporus var. mellis (another osmotolerant species) and contrasts with the 0. 3 to 0. 8 M KCl concentrations used in the preparation of most yeast protoplasts. Short digestions (60 min or less) produced mostly spheroplasts; longer incubations (90 min or more) yielded mostly protoplasts as judged by electron micrographs. These protoplasts could be transferred to 1. 0 M KCl or 2. 0 M sorbitol without lysing, but lysis was pronounced in 0. 5 M KCl or 1. 0 M mannitol and complete in 0. 02 M KCl. Protoplasts were separated from isolated cell wall remnants and debris by centrifugation on a linear gradient of Ficoll 400 (35 to 17. 5 %, wt/vol) containing 2. 0 M KCl. Both crude and fractionated protoplast preparations contained vesicles which were identified with the periplasmic bodies of whole cells. Some of the periplasmic bodies were connected to protoplasts by fine pedicels; others appeared free. Independent degeneracy of periplasmic bodies was occasionally observed. β-Fructofuranosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) activity is cryptic (physically) in cells of <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> in contrast to the expressed enzyme (periplasmic space) of other Saccharomyces species.

A brief treatment with ethyl acetate caused the periplasmic bodies of young cells to become electron light. Periplasmic bodies were most prevalent in the regions of the bud scars and were often accommodated within large invaginations in the protoplasmic membrane.

40|$|Osmoregulation in {{both the}} xerotolerant yeast <b>S.</b> <b>rouxii</b> (strain YA) and the non-tolerant S. cerevisiae (strain Y 41) {{involves}} the accumulation of the compatible solute glycerol.

However, glycerol accumulation occurs by different means in the two yeasts. The major factor responsible for the increase in the intracellular concentration of glycerol in rouxii is that, as the a^ of the growth medium is lowered, an increased proportion of glycerol is retained in the cell but the total amount of glycerol produced differs only slightly from that when the yeast is grown at a high a^ in basal medium. In contrast, the production of glycerol by cerevisiae increases markedly but there are only very minor changes in its retention...|$|E

The {{stability}} of NaCl-tolerance, which had been considered {{to be gained by}} growing yeast in a medium containing sodium chloride (0 - 22 %), was examined. We classified these yeast strains into four types by their NaCl-tolerance. They were halotolerant type, halophilic type, low-halophilic type and halophobic type. Two strains of wild yeasts, viz. T. glabrata and T. etchellsii were found very highly NaCl-tolerant (up to 22 % NaCl) and both of them were very small in cell size. These yeasts were isolated from soya mash. Cell size of the halotolerant and halophilic type strains of Torulopsis yeasts isolated from sake cake pickle and soya mash were much smaller than these of low-halophilic or halophobic ones. Almost strains of halophilic, low-halophilic, halophobic and some of halotolerant strains showed smaller cell size if they were grown in the medium supplemented with high concentration of sodium chloride (15 - 20 %). Some of halotolerant strains, however, did not show any significant difference in cell size by the addition of sodium chloride to the growth medium.
