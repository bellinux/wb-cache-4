25|$|A common {{method of}} obtaining pure {{cultures}} is <b>serial</b> <b>dilution.</b> Cultivators dilute either a wild sample or a lab sample containing the desired algae with filtered water and introduce small aliquots (measures of this solution) into {{a large number of}} small growing containers. Dilution follows a microscopic examination of the source culture that predicts that a few of the growing containers contain a single cell of the desired species. Following a suitable period on a light table, cultivators again use the microscope to identify containers to start larger cultures.|$|E
25|$|John Roth and Sophie Maisnier-Patin {{reviewed}} the approaches {{in both the}} Lenski team's delayed mutations and the Van Hofweges team's rapid mutations on E. coli. They argue that both teams experienced the same sequence of potentiation, actualization, and refinement leading up to similar Cit+ variants. According to them, the period of {{less than a day}} during which citrate usage would be under selection, followed by 100-fold dilution, and a period of growth on glucose that would not select for citrate use, ultimately lowered the probability of E. coli being able accumulate early adaptive mutations from one period of selection to the next. On the other hand, Van Hofwegen's team allowed for a continuous selection period of 7 days, which yielded a more rapid development of citrate-using E. coli. Roth and Maisnier-Patin suggest that the <b>serial</b> <b>dilution</b> of E. coli and short period of selection for citrate-use under the conditions of the LTEE perpetually impeded each generation of E. coli from reaching the next stages of aerobic citrate utilization.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} label and identify individual cells via fluorescent antibodies, cellular products such as cytokines, proteins, and other factors may also be measured as well. [...] Similar to ELISA sandwich assays, cytometric bead array (CBA) assays use multiple bead populations typically differentiated by size and different levels of fluorescence intensity to distinguish multiple analytes in a single assay. [...] The amount of the analyte captured is detected via a biotinylated antibody against a secondary epitope of the protein, followed by a streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin treatment. The fluorescent intensity of R-phycoerythrin on the beads is quantified on a flow cytometer equipped with a 488nm excitation source. [...] Concentrations of a protein of interest in the samples can be obtained by comparing the fluorescent signals to those of a standard curve generated from a <b>serial</b> <b>dilution</b> of a known concentration of the analyte. Commonly also referred to as cytokine bead array (CBA).|$|E

50|$|In {{biology and}} medicine, besides the more {{conventional}} uses described above, <b>serial</b> <b>dilution</b> {{may also be}} used to reduce the concentration of microscopic organisms or cells in a sample. As, for instance, the number and size of bacterial colonies that grow on an agar plate in a given time is concentration-dependent, and since many other diagnostic techniques involve physically counting the number of micro-organisms or cells on specials printed with grids (for comparing concentrations of two organisms or cell types in the sample) or wells of a given volume (for absolute concentrations), dilution can be useful for getting more manageable results. <b>Serial</b> <b>dilution</b> is also a cheaper and simpler method for preparing cultures from a single cell than optical tweezers and micromanipulators.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>serial</b> <b>dilution</b> is the {{stepwise}} dilution of {{a substance}} in solution. Usually the dilution factor {{at each step}} is constant, resulting in a geometric progression of the concentration in a logarithmic fashion. A ten-fold <b>serial</b> <b>dilution</b> could be 1 M, 0.1 M, 0.01 M, 0.001 M ... Serial dilutions are used to accurately create highly diluted solutions as well as solutions for experiments resulting in concentration curves with a logarithmic scale. A tenfold dilution for each step is called a logarithmic dilution or log-dilution, a 3.16-fold (100.5-fold) dilution is called a half-logarithmic dilution or half-log dilution, and a 1.78-fold (100.25-fold) dilution is called a quarter-logarithmic dilution or quarter-log dilution. Serial dilutions are widely used in experimental sciences, including biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and physics.|$|E
