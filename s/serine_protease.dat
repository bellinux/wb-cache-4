5|$|Serpins are a {{superfamily}} {{of proteins}} with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and {{are found in}} all kingdoms of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (<b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt its active site. This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
40|$|Mouse serosal {{mast cells}} (SMCs) and Kirsten sarcoma virus-immortalized mast cells store {{large amounts of}} mast cell {{carboxypeptidase}} A and <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> in their secretory granules. Secretory granule proteins from 2. 6 x 10 (6) purified SMCs were separated by NaDodSO 4 /PAGE, trans-blotted to poly(vinylidine difluoride) membranes, and subjected to amino-terminal amino acid sequencing. Four distinct mast cell <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> were identified. With mast cell carboxypeptidase A, these <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> comprise the major proteins of mouse SMC secretory granules. Each of the four SMC <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> was distinct from the two <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> present in mucosal mast cells in the intestines of helminth-infected mice. The secretory granules of a Kirsten sarcoma virus-immortalized mast cell line contained three of the SMC-derived <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> {{and one of the}} mucosal mast cell-derived <b>serine</b> <b>proteases.</b> Thus, the family of mouse mast cell secretory granule <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> has at least six distinct members that can be expressed in different combinations in different mast cell populations...|$|R

25|$|PAI-1 is a <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> {{inhibitor}} (serpin) that {{functions as}} the principal inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA), the activators of plasminogen and hence fibrinolysis (the physiological breakdown of blood clots).

25|$|Antithrombin is a serpin (<b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> inhibitor) {{and is thus}} {{similar in}} {{structure}} to most other plasma protease inhibitors, such as alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-antiplasmin and Heparin cofactor II.|$|E
25|$|Urokinase, {{also known}} as urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (uPA), is a <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.|$|E

25|$|Renin (etymology and pronunciation), {{also known}} as an angiotensinogenase, is a <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> protein and enzyme {{secreted}} by the kidneys that participates in the body's renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)—{{also known as}} the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis—that mediates the volume of extracellular fluid (blood plasma, lymph and interstitial fluid), and arterial vasoconstriction. Thus, it regulates the body's mean arterial blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} pathway is triggered by {{activation of the}} C1-complex. The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of C1q, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of C1s, or C1qr2s2. This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single pentameric IgM can initiate the pathway, while several, ideally six, IgGs are needed. This also occurs when C1q binds directly {{to the surface of}} the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two C1r molecules. C1r is a <b>serine</b> <b>protease.</b> They then cleave C1s (another <b>serine</b> <b>protease).</b> The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. C4b and C2b (historically, the larger fragment of C2 was called C2a but is now referred to as C2b) bind to form the {{classical pathway}} C3-convertase (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b later joins with C4b2b to make C5 convertase (C4b2b3b complex).|$|E

25|$|Antithrombin is a <b>serine</b> <b>protease</b> {{inhibitor}} (serpin) that degrades the serine proteases: thrombin, FIXa, FXa, FXIa, and FXIIa. It {{is constantly}} active, but its adhesion to these factors is increased {{by the presence}} of heparan sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan) or the administration of heparins (different heparinoids increase affinity to FXa, thrombin, or both). Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of antithrombin (inborn or acquired, e.g., in proteinuria) leads to thrombophilia.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that C. coronatus produces lipolytic, chitinolytic and proteolytic enzymes, especially extracellular proteinases, namely <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> which are optimally active at pH 10 and 40 °C. <b>Serine</b> <b>proteases</b> are {{a diverse group of}} bacterial, fungal and animal enzymes whose common element is an active site composed of serine, histidine and aspartic acid. The <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> produced by C. coronatus are involved in the forcible discharge of sporangia and sporangiospores, in addition it has also been suggested that these proteases may have a function in the pathogenesis of human disease caused by C. coronatus. The <b>serine</b> <b>proteases</b> secreted by this fungus show great activity and thermostability, making them suitable for commercialization in the leather and detergent industries, as well for the recovery of silver from discarded photographic films.

25|$|In vivo, {{chymotrypsin}} is a {{proteolytic enzyme}} (<b>Serine</b> <b>protease)</b> {{acting in the}} digestive systems of many organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a hydrolysis reaction, which despite being thermodynamically favorable occurs extremely slowly {{in the absence of}} a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin are peptide bonds in which the amino acid N-terminal to the bond is a tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin will also hydrolyse amide bonds in vitro, a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.|$|E
