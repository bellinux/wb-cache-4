40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if a statistically significant difference exists between <b>shipper</b> and <b>receiver</b> measurements, a statistical combination of the <b>shipper's</b> and <b>receiver's</b> limit-of-error (LOE) is calculated to determine the shipper/receiver limit-of-error, LOES/R. The <b>shipper's</b> and <b>receiver's</b> LOE may possess random and systematic components. Depending on the interpretation of the systematic and random components, the determination of the LOES/R can be performed by several different calculational methods. These calculational methods and their associated underlying assumptions are reviewed {{in the context of the}} LANL <b>shipper</b> <b>receiver</b> program. This paper, by presenting the assumptions that form the basis of a site-specific shipper/receiver difference calculation, can assist those individuals responsible for calculating LOES/R...|$|R

40|$|Proposed {{abandonment}} of branch rail lines {{in rural areas}} has stimulated considerable concern over the impact of abandonment on <b>shippers,</b> <b>receivers,</b> and rural communities. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present estimates of the benefits and the costs of upgrading seventy-one branch rail lines. A benefit-cost analysis is used to compare the net benefits with the net costs of upgrading the rail lines. Separate models are utilized to estimate the benefits to grain shippers, fertilizer shippers, and <b>shippers</b> and <b>receivers</b> of all other products from upgrading the branch lines. Benefit-cost ratios are presented for six alternative solutions. Key words: benefit-cost ratios, grain transportation, rail abandonment, railroads. Until around 1900, railroads were the domi-nant mode of transportation in the Midwest. Since then, the development of motor ve-hicles, highways, airlines, and improvements in waterway transportation have changed the transportation system. As a consequence, railroad officials claim that they now have too many rail lines that are no longer profit-able and are sapping financial resources needed to improve the efficiency of the rail-road system. Shippers and communities along branch rail lines view the situation differently. The railroad still is vital, they say, to the survival of farmers, businesses, and communities. But little factual evidence is available to resolve the conflict. Railroads generally cite their poor financial situation as evidence for branch line abandonment. Community lead-ers cite past traffic as evidence for continued operation of the line. Public discussions and some studies of the expected impact of rail abandonment impli-citly assume that product flows must remain as they have been in the past (Poth).

40|$|Because rail is {{the only}} {{cost-effective}} transportation mode available to many agricultural shippers who are not located near markets or waterway transportation, long-term trends in railroad service and capacity are critically important to U. S. agriculture. These long-term trends are important because they will define {{the size of the}} rail network to which agricultural shippers will have access, the minimum shipment requirements that rail <b>shippers</b> and <b>receivers</b> will have to meet, the amount of intramodal competition that will exist in the industry, and, ultimately, the levels of rail service and capacity that will be available to agricultural <b>shippers</b> and <b>receivers</b> in the 21 st century.

40|$|International audienceDeciding {{shipment}} size {{is important}} in freight transport: {{it depends on the}} logistical imperatives of shippers and the technical possibilities of carriers. Shipment size choice is also closely related to transportation mode; it is therefore important from a public policy perspective. The theory of optimal shipment size and mode choice is robust. There are many inventory-theoretical models of optimal shipment size, applied by shippers in operational contexts. However, none of them has been validated empirically over a large and heterogeneous population of shipments, so that they are virtually useless for modeling freight transportation demand. This is due in particular to the lack of adequate data. In this paper, the simple Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is assessed empirically on a national scale, over a heterogeneous population of shipments. Using the French ECHO database, which notably observes commodity flow rates between <b>shippers</b> and <b>receivers,</b> the EOQ shipment size specification is estimated. The validity of the EOQ model is confirmed. In addition, the dominant role of the commodity flow rate between the <b>shipper</b> and the <b>receiver,</b> and of commodity value density is revealed. The relationship between mode choice and shipment size is also highlighted...|$|R

40|$|The {{model in}} this paper is {{intended}} to explain the choice of transport made by shippers, {{as well as their}} total demand for transportation services. The optimal choice of mode is shown to involve a trade-off among freight rates, speed, dependability (variance in speed) and en-route lossage. It is shown that faster, more dependable service simply reduces the <b>shipper's</b> or <b>receiver's</b> inventories, including his safety stock and his inventory in transit. Hence inventory theory makes possible a direct comparison of the four attributes on which mode selection is based and leads to a model of rational choice in transport demand. The resulting model is suitable for statistical estimation given adequate data. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{considered}} {{in terms of}} ton-miles or tonne-kilometers hauled per unit of energy consumed, rail transport can be more efficient than other means of transportation. Maximum economies are typically realized with bulk commodities (e.g., coal), especially when hauled over long distances. However, shipment by rail is not as flexible as by the highway, which has resulted in much freight being hauled by truck, even over long distances. Moving goods by rail often involves transshipment costs, particularly when the <b>shipper</b> or <b>receiver</b> lack direct rail access. These costs may exceed that of operating the train itself, a factor that practices such as containerization aim to minimize.|$|R
