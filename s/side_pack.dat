50|$|The game {{features}} 150 different missions. Although some of {{the missions}} have the same objective no two missions are exactly alike. Objectives vary from killing enemies in a certain manner, killing enemies with a limited arsenal, getting to a location within the given time or fighting enemies in the dark.There are also several unlockables, such as several new costumes, gallery images, weapons, or extra equipment such as light weight boots that increase movement speed, a laser sight that improves aiming, a customising pack that gives each weapon a unique ability or a <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> that gives the ability to carry two extra normal items.The player controls Jill Valentine. When aiming specifically for an enemy's head or legs a small targeting reticule appears {{in front of the}} target and expands and contracts rhythmically. When the aim is as small as possible the chance of hitting the targeted area is greater. At the end of each mission a score is determined by time, kills, damage or a combination of the three along with item usage.|$|E

The large (1908) pack—intended to be carried in regimental transport except when in full marching order—and entrenching tool carrier were retained from World War I issue, although the later was initially issued in modified form before being reintroduced in 1941. Frogs for the 1907 SMLE and No.4 Rifle bayonets were also issued. Different combinations of these components comprised the 'marching order' and the 'battle order' respectively. In addition various items were issued {{to be used by}} officers and often armoured crewmen, such as pouches for binoculars, pistol ammunition and compass (externally the same as that for pistol ammunition but with felt padding inside), as well as a 'valise' <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> and holster for the [...]38 revolver (a tank crew version with leg strap also existed in two versions).|$|E
40|$|Background: Control {{of balance}} {{is a complex}} motor skill that {{involves}} integration of sensory inputs and the planning and execution of flexible movement patterns. Carrying side packs is famous in our society especially shoulder side packs. Most students carry shoulder side packs and they don't care about the way to carry {{them to be more}} balanced. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of carrying shoulder <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> on dynamic postural stability and to determine the best way of carrying a shoulder <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> either on the dominant side or non-dominant side that doesn’t affect dynamic postural stability in young healthy female. Methods: Sixty female volunteers aged from 18 to 25 years old participated in the study. Biodex balance system was used to measure the dynamic postural stability in three different occasions (without carrying a shoulder <b>side</b> <b>pack,</b> with carrying a shoulder <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> on the dominant side, and on the non-dominant side) with a rest period in between. Results: Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test were used to compare dynamic posture balance without carrying and during carrying a shoulder <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> on dominant and non-dominant sides. Analysis revealed that overall, anteroposterior and mediolateral stability indexes reduced significantly (P< 0. 0001) when carrying shoulder <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> on dominant side in comparison with when carrying shoulder <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> on non-dominant side and without carrying bag. Conclusion: It was concluded that carrying a shoulder <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> on the non-dominant side didn't disturb the postural stability when compared to carrying on the dominant side so, we recommend the students to carry shoulder side packs on the non-dominant side...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the muscle {{activities}} of fifteen male participants (23. 44 ± 2. 63 years) during unilateral hockey bag load carrying of different weights (10 %, 20 %, and 30 % bodyweight) and sizes (small and large). Walking without a hockey bag was the control condition. The results showed that increased peak and integrated EMG occurred with an increased load weight in the semitendinosus, gastrocnemius, rectus abdominis, and vastus medialis. The left rectus femoris and left semitendinosus were both significantly greater than the right corresponding muscle. Carrying the large hockey bag produced greater peak EMG in the right rectus abdominis and the right rectus femoris, whereas the right vastus medialis showed a larger peak EMG in the small hockey bag. It was concluded that the posterior-lateral carrying style of hockey bag load carriage explained the results being similar to both backpack and <b>side</b> <b>pack</b> load carriage studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionA study {{carried out}} in the city of Braga, in February 2008 (shortly after the entry into force of Law 37 / 2007 of August 14 of tobacco control), in {{hospitality}} venues revealed that there are establishments that allow smoking inside their facilities. This raised the problem of knowing what the concentration of nicotine in the air present in these venues is (an indicator of pollution by tobacco smoke). Participants and methodsThe air quality was assessed in March 2009, in six hospitality venues, of the city of Braga: two smoke free restaurants under 100 m 2; two coffees less than 100 m 2 (a smoke free coffeehouse and another that does not allow consumption); a smoke free night bar with less than 100 m 2 and a nightclub with a smoking area and a non-smoking room, separated by a curtain of air. Measurement of vapor phase nicotine in air was done by active monitoring, through the use of monitors, using the methodology applied by Hammond 1. Particles (PM 2. 5) were measured with a <b>Side</b> <b>Pack.</b> ResultsThe average concentration of nicotine inside the smoke free coffeehouses and restaurants is 6. 29 mg/m 3, while inside the coffeehouses where smoking is not allowed is 1. 1 mg/m 3. The concentration of nicotine in the night bar has a very high value (9. 42 mg/m 3). At the disco, the concentration of nicotine is the highest recorded in enclosed spaces (19. 1 mg/m 3 in the area where smoking is forbidden and 10. 2 mg/m 3 in a smoke free area). ConclusionsThe results suggest that in the hospitality venues, where smoking is permitted, there is a high air contamination by Environmental Tobacco Smoke, which are particularly exposed workers. More studies are needed to clarify the situation of tobacco consumption in the hospitality sector...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectivesNasal packing is {{commonly}} practiced in postoperative care after nose and sinus surgery, {{not only for}} haemostasis but also as internal stabilisation and synechia formation control. The aim of our study was to compare the pain level, adhessions and haemostatic properties of Stammberger sinus dressing (SSD) with Dissolvable Sinu-Knit (DSK) and routine nasal packing in latex gloves finger (RNP) after FESS in adult patients. Methods 45 patients with bilateral chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) (totally 90 sides) were recruited into our trial. All patients underwent bilateral FESS without septoplasty. Following completion of surgery, every single nasal cavity <b>side</b> was <b>packed</b> {{with one of the}} studied dressing chosen randomly. In 41 sides nasal cavities were packed with Stammberger Sinus Dressing (SSD) in 26 <b>sides</b> <b>packed</b> with Dissolvable Sinu-Knit and 23 sides were filled with routine nasal packing in latex gloves finger (RNP). Haemostatic effect was assessed during the recovery period, pain level was recorded by the patients on a visual analogue scale 24 hours after surgery. Tendency to postoperative middle meatal synechia formations was assessed during control visits in the 1, 2, 4 and 8 week postoperatively. ResultsThree (7. 3 %) of <b>sides</b> <b>packed</b> with SSD and four (15. 3 %) packed with DSK had primary postoperative bleeding that required additional packing. Finally 30 patients were packed with RNP. In patients packed with RNP bleeding didn’t appear. Mean pain level for SSD was 0. 85 (range from 0 to 3) and for DSK 2. 1 (range 0 to 5) whereas for RNP was 5. 6 (range from 2 to 9). Five (13. 1 %) of thirty-eight sides with SSD and five (22. 7 %) of twenty-two sides with DSK had synechia in middle meatus whereas eight (26. 6 %) of total thirty <b>sides</b> <b>packed</b> with RNP had synechia at any one of the control visits. ConclusionWe found that Rapid Rhino Stammberger Sinus Dressing and Dissolvable Sinu-Knit are associated with very low local pain level and with a good effect in postoperative bleeding and synechia formation control...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe fd {{filamentous}} phage can be {{contracted to}} short rods called I-forms and to spheroidal particles called S-forms. The conversions from fd→I-forms→S-forms were previously suggested to mimic steps in fd penetration. The same conversions, in reverse order, were suggested to mimic steps in fd assembly. The I-forms and S-forms bind the hydrophobic probe, 1 -anilino-napthalene- 8 -sulionate (ANS); {{under the same}} conditions, fd binds this probe very poorly. Rigidly <b>packed</b> <b>side</b> chains in fd and nonrigidly <b>packed</b> <b>side</b> chains in I-forms and S-forms would explain the differences in ANS binding. A compilation of the properties of I-forms and S-forms indicate that: (i) they have compact structures; (ii) they have secondary structures of the same type as native phage; (iii) they have non-native morphologies; and (iv) they may have nonrigid <b>side</b> chain <b>packing.</b> These are the properties of molten globules...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there was any benefit or detrimental consequences of placing a hyaluronic acid pack (Merogel) into the middle meatus after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). METHODS: A randomized controlled blinded study was performed in 42 patients with chronic sinusitis undergoing ESS. The patients were randomized to receive Merogel on one <b>side</b> and no <b>packing</b> on the other side. Patients were assessed at 2, 4, and 6 - 8 weeks after surgery and the presence of synechia, edema, and infection was noted with the observer blinded to the side that had received the Merogel. RESULTS: At 2 weeks the <b>side</b> <b>packed</b> with Merogel had 35 % synechiae, 83 % edema, and 30 % mucopurulent discharge and on the control side the figures were similar with 22. 5 % synechiae, 83 % edema, and 28 % mucopurulent discharge. In both groups these figures improved over the observation period but percentages in the groups remained similar. At no time point was the difference between the <b>packed</b> and unpacked <b>sides</b> statistically significant for any of the measures when assessed with Fisher's exact test. CONCLUSION: Merogel nasal packing has no significant beneficial or detrimental effect in terms of synechia, edema, or infection when placed in the middle meatus after ESS. 4 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. High-accuracy protein {{structure}} modeling demands on accurate and very fast side chain prediction since such a procedure must be repeatedly called {{at each step}} of structure refinement. Many known side chain prediction programs, such as SCWRL and TreePack, depend on the philosophy that global information and pairwise energy function must be used to achieve high accuracy. These programs are too slow {{to be used in}} the case when <b>side</b> chain <b>packing</b> has to be used thousands of times, such as {{protein structure}} refinement and protein design. We present an unexpected study that local backbone information can determine side chain conformations accurately. LocalPack, our <b>side</b> chain <b>packing</b> program which is based on only local information, achieves equal accuracy as SCWRL and TreePack, yet runs many times faster, hence providing a key missing piece in our efforts to high-accuracy protein structure modeling. keyword: side chain prediction, local backbone features, multiclass Support Vector Machines. ...|$|R
