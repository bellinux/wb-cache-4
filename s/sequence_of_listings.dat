40|$|Adaptation to a novel {{gravitational}} state involves {{adaptation of}} vestibular mediated responses, in particular those {{mediated by the}} otolith organs. The present paper investigates whether the orientation <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> plane, which is under control of otolith signals, is affected by sustained exposure to hypergravity. Subjects were exposed to four G-loads differing in duration (45 or 90 min) and magnitude (2 or 3 G). During centrifugation subjects were in a supine position, directing the gravito-inertial acceleration along the naso-occipetal axis. We determined the orientation <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> plane before and after each centrifuge run, with the head erect and tilted in pitch. Head tilt in pitch induced a counter-pitch <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> plane, which {{was found to be}} less pronounced after centrifugation. In addition, exposure to 3 G for 90 ~min induced a small backward tilt <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> plane compared to the pretest orientation (head erect). In order to explain these results a hypothesis is discussed, proposing that the orientation <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> plane in the head is governed by a head fixed orientation vector that is modulated by the direction of gravity relative to the head. Sustained centrifugation is proposed to decrease this gravitational modulation, leading to the effects observed. This could reflect a shift towards a more body centered frame of reference...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe shall discuss three {{theoretical}} explanations <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> law for conjugate eye movements {{with the}} head fixed: the original argument by Helmholtz, which is “sensorimotor” {{in its attempt to}} optimize vision by using internal feedback from the oculomotor system, and two comparatively simple recent explanations based on either visual or oculomotor performance. These geometrical demonstrations shed some light on recent generalizations <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> law to vergent eye movements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the changes in}} Listing's plane resulting from prismatically induced vergence. The three-dimensional angular positions of the two eyes were compared in normal subjects wearing search coils and gazing at targets 1. 9 m away with and without prisms. For horizontal base-out prisms each degree of convergence in one eye yielded 0. 72 deg of temporal rotation <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> plane in that eye. The results from vertical prisms were not what was expected from the horizontal results. A base-up prism on the right eye induced a downward and temporal rotation <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> plane. A base-down prism on the right eye induced an upward and nasal rotation <b>of</b> <b>Listing's</b> plane. The effects of oblique prisms were those expected from combining the effects of horizontal and vertical prisms. Thus in addition to producing a horizontal or vertical misalignment of the gaze line, prisms induce an unexpected position-dependent torsional disparity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThree-dimensional eye positions, when {{expressed}} as rotation vectors, are constrained {{to lie in}} a head-fixed Listing’s plane. The offset and orientation <b>of</b> <b>Listing’s</b> plane changes when the head is tilted. To assess the influence of age on this phenomenon, young (less than 30 years old) and older (> 65 years old) human subjects were seated upright, pitched nose up and nose down, and rolled right ear down and left ear down. Listing’s plane was computed from eye movements recorded using a dual scleral search coil while subjects scanned a complex visual scene. During pitch, Listing’s plane counterpitched {{with respect to the}} head, while during roll, it translated {{in a manner consistent with}} “ocular counterrolling”. There was no significant difference in this reorientation <b>of</b> <b>Listing’s</b> plane between the young and older subjects. The only obvious difference between the two age groups was that the “thickness” <b>of</b> <b>Listing’s</b> plane was greater in the older subjects. This suggests that aging has a small, but definite, influence on Listing’s law...|$|R
