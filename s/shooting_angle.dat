United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening as he pushed past Sounders FC defender Leonardo González to receive a {{diagonal}} pass from Clyde Simms. However, due to the difficult <b>shooting</b> <b>angle,</b> Pontius' shot was wide of the far post. In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. goalkeeper Josh Wicks parried the shot away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a direct free kick from , but his low kick curled just wide of the target. In the 18th minute, Seattle midfielder Sebastian Le Toux played a ball in to teammate Freddie Ljungberg, whose shot on goal was barely saved by Wicks, who kicked out a foot to block the shot. Just before halftime, Le Toux crossed to an unmarked Montero, whose direct header on goal was just in reach of Wicks, who again made the save to keep the score level, 0–0. Seattle outshot D.C. 9–6 in the first half.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{with good}} backup {{from the rest}} of the defenders, {{stopping}} attacks can prove very difficult if the goalkeeper remains in the middle of the goal. The most defensible position is along a semicircular line connecting the goalposts and extending out in the centre. Depending on the ball carrier's location, the goalkeeper is positioned along that semicircle roughly a metre out of the goal to reduce the attacker's <b>shooting</b> <b>angle.</b> The goalkeeper stops using his or her hands to tread water once the opponent enters at about the 7 metre mark and starts to lift their upper body using the eggbeater technique to prepare to block the shot. Finally the goalkeeper tries to block the ball down, which is often hard for the longer reaches, but prevents an offensive rebound and second shot. As is the case with other defensive players, a goalkeeper who aggressively fouls an attacker in position to score can be charged with a penalty shot for the other team. The goalkeeper can also be ejected for twenty seconds if a major foul is committed. [...] Also inside the five metre mark, the goalie can swing at the ball with a closed fist without being penalised.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{additional}} mechanics differentiate Arrow Flash {{from similar}} scrolling shooters, {{one of which}} is that the ability to transform the player's ship. The two forms available are a humanoid mecha form and a typical jet form. The player's weapons change depending on the form. The jet form only shoots forward but intensely, it can fly faster horizontally and the helper ships follow the jet in a snakelike pattern. The mecha form has a wider <b>shooting</b> <b>angle,</b> sometimes even firing backwards, it has a faster vertical speed and the helper ships remain in a fixed formation whilst in this form. Missiles will also home on enemies in mecha form, whereas they only travel directly forward in jet form. Regardless of form, the ship is killed in only one hit unless the player picks up an energy shield which can sustain three hits.|$|E

50|$|For {{the next}} match, two weeks later, United {{played host to}} the German champions, Wolfsburg, at Old Trafford. Wolfsburg began the game strongly, {{imposing}} themselves physically on the pitch, but although United had the upper hand {{by the end of}} the half, the teams went into the half-time interval at 0-0. After the break, United continued to create chances, but it was Wolfsburg who got the opening goal through striker Edin Džeko. Michael Carrick committed a foul on the edge of his penalty area, but the referee allowed play to continue as Wolfsburg were still in possession. The ball was crossed in by Makoto Hasebe and Džeko rose above Patrice Evra at the far post to head past Tomasz Kuszczak. United responded immediately through a Ryan Giggs free-kick that took a large deflection off Christian Gentner in the Wolfsburg wall, wrong-footing goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and found the bottom corner of the goal for Giggs' 150th for Manchester United. In the 78th minute, United won a throw-in on the left side, from which Evra found Wayne Rooney. Rooney played the ball in to Dimitar Berbatov in the Wolfsburg penalty area, but the Bulgarian was unable to make room for a shot and laid the ball off to Giggs. Likewise, Giggs could not find a <b>shooting</b> <b>angle</b> and chose to nudge the ball back to Carrick, who curled it into the far corner from outside the area. United protected their lead for the remaining 12 minutes, and the win took them to the top of their group.|$|E
