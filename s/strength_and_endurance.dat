5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the Tudor rose, the nation's floral emblem, and the Three Lions {{featured on the}} Royal Arms of England. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England {{around the time of}} the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace. It is a syncretic symbol in that it merged the white rose of the Yorkists and the red rose of the Lancastriansâ€”cadet branches of the Plantagenets who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the Rose of England. The oak tree is a symbol of England, representing <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance.</b> The Royal Oak symbol and Oak Apple Day commemorate the escape of King Charles II from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father's execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, but they have been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance</b> are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} 24 {{issues of the}} series, the {{character}} possessed shapeshifting abilities and went by the codename Myriad, though {{for a brief time}} he masqueraded as a female masked vigilante called Vigil, who exhibited superhuman <b>strength,</b> speed, <b>and</b> <b>endurance,</b> <b>and</b> expertise in martial arts and acrobatics. It was later revealed that for some time, he had been taking an illegal drug called Flex, that granted him his elevated <b>strength,</b> speed, <b>and</b> <b>endurance,</b> powers that remained permanently bonded to his half-alien physiology after he ceased taking the drug. In issue #25 of the series (October 2009), the character, whose shapeshifting powers had been erased in the previous issue, obtained different powers, in addition to his superhuman <b>strength,</b> speed, <b>and</b> <b>endurance.</b> Now possessing telepathy, he goes by the name Wraith.|$|R
5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment {{is considered the}} most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected {{for their ability to}} work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance</b> (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{volcanic}} loam soils, such as {{are found}} in New Zealand, {{require the use of}} four heavy draught horses to pull a double-furrow plough. Where paddocks are more square than long-rectangular it is more economical to have horses four wide in harness than two-by-two ahead, thus one horse is always on the ploughed land (the sod). The limits of <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance</b> of horses made greater than two-furrow ploughs uneconomic to use on one farm.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the last}} phase of the {{recovery}} rehabilitation. Phase V includes returning to sports after being cleared by therapist or surgeon. In order {{for this to happen}} the patient must have full range of motion, continue maintaining <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance,</b> and be able to increase proprioception with agility drills. Patient is still to be aware that going down hill or down stairs while the knee is aggravated may cause further injury like a meniscus tear.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{training}} - It {{is important}} from the outset, it is progressive and prepares recruits for Battle Physical Training (BPT) in Phase 2. Physical training periods concentrate on introducing and developing the techniques required for rope climbing, regains, fireman's carry and obstacle courses with {{an introduction to}} speed marching and load carries. However, {{it is necessary for}} recruits to continue fitness training in their own time in order to build their <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance</b> to the required level.|$|E

It is noted that the physical exercises for <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> power <b>endurance</b> develop gunners in precisely those physical qualities that are necessary for the performance of their direct duties. It is noted that the exercises for <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>strength</b> <b>endurance</b> is necessary to give priority to the preparation of artillery of the Army...|$|R
25|$|Fixed: The fixed {{signs are}} Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. A native with mainly fixed signs has the <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance</b> {{to see things}} through and to uphold the status quo. They need stable homes, careers and {{partnerships}} and prefer the known to uncertainty. Fixed subjects are loyal and dependable but can be very obstinate. A subject lacking fixed signs cannot stick with anything or see anything through, and will tend {{to walk away from}} problems. They may be too easily bored or too busy chasing rainbows ever to make anything substantial happen. Planets in the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses, or an emphasis on earth in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|In the {{multiplayer}} modes 'Survival of the Fittest', 'Civil War', and 'Turf War', a Big Daddy suit will spawn at {{a random}} {{location in the}} level. The choice {{is given to the}} player who finds this suit to become the Big Daddy, which will give the player greater <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance</b> but prohibits the use of plasmids and hacking, as well as expelling any previously held damage bonuses against other players. The Big Daddy can stomp, shoot a rivet gun, melee attack, and throw proximity mines. All damage dealt to the Big Daddy is permanent, and cannot be replenished. Once the Big Daddy is defeated, the suit disappears and spawns in another location on the map two minutes later. In 'Capture the Sister' one member of the defending team is chosen at random to be the Big Daddy; after the player's death, the Big Daddy suit disappears {{for the rest of the}} round.|$|E
25|$|Thor is {{a superb}} hand-to-hand combatant, and is skilled in armed combat, excelling {{in the use}} of the war hammer, sword, axe and mace. Thor {{possesses}} two items which assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his signature weapon, the mystical hammer Mjolnir. The first item doubles Thor's <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance</b> while the second is used to control his weather abilities; flight; energy projection and absorption; dimensional travel; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast (which taps into Thor's life force, and has even forced Galactus to flee), the Thermo-blast, and the Anti-Force (which counteracts another force). Using Mjolnir by throwing it in the desired direction and then holding on to the handle's leather loop, Thor can fly at supersonic speeds in Earth's atmosphere and travel faster than light in space. He can also use the hammer to create a barrier by letting it spin in a circle, and even managed to contain an explosion powerful enough to destroy a 1/5th of the universe, although at the cost of his own life. He can throw an object out of Earth's atmosphere by using his strength, and throw his hammer to Asgard from which it will return.|$|E

500|$|The opening track, [...] "Contract on the World Love Jam", {{is a sound}} collage made up of samples, scratch cuts, and snippets {{recorded}} by Chuck D from radio stations and sound bites of interviews and commercials. The tension-building track introduces the album's dense, sample-based production. According to Chuck D, the song features [...] "about forty-five to fifty [...] voices" [...] that interweave {{as part of an}} assertive sonic collage and underscore the albumâ€™s themes. [...] "Incident at 66.6 FM", another collage that segues into [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome", contains snippets from a radio call-in show interview of Chuck D and alludes to the media persecution perceived by Public Enemy. [...] "Burn Hollywood Burn" [...] assails the use of black stereotypes in movies, and [...] "Who Stole the Soul?" [...] condemns the record industry's exploitation of black recording artists and calls for reparations. [...] "Revolutionary Generation" [...] celebrates the <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>endurance</b> of black women with lyrics related to black feminism, an unfamiliar topic in hip hop. It also addresses sexism within the black community and misogyny in hip hop culture.|$|E
