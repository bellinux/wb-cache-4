From 2008 to 2017, the Republican Party went from [...] "debating how to combat human-caused climate change to arguing {{that it does not}} exist," [...] according to The New York Times. In 2011 [...] "more than half of the Republicans in the House and three-quarters of Republican senators" [...] said [...] "that the threat of global warming, as a man-made and highly threatening phenomenon, is at best an exaggeration and at worst an utter 'hoax' [...] ", according to Judith Warner writing in The New York Times Magazine. In 2014, more than 55% of congressional Republicans were climate change deniers, according to NBC News.

6000|$|When {{a wealthy}} nation like the English discovers the {{perfectly}} patent {{fact that it}} is making a ludicrous mess of the government of a poorer nation like the Irish, it pauses for a moment in consternation, and then begins to talk about Celts and Teutons. As far as I can understand the theory, the Irish are Celts and the English are Teutons. Of course, the Irish are not Celts any more than the English are Teutons. I have not followed the ethnological discussion with much energy, but the last <b>scientific</b> <b>conclusion</b> which I read inclined on the whole to the summary that the English were mainly Celtic and the Irish mainly Teutonic. But no man alive, with even the glimmering of a real scientific sense, would ever dream of applying the terms [...] "Celtic" [...] or [...] "Teutonic" [...] to either of them in any positive or useful sense.|$|E
60|$|Do {{not allow}} yourselves to be misled by the common notion that an {{hypothesis}} is untrustworthy {{simply because it}} is an hypothesis. It is often urged, in respect to some <b>scientific</b> <b>conclusion,</b> that, after all, it is only an hypothesis. But what more have we to guide us in nine-tenths of the most important affairs of daily life than hypotheses, and often very ill-based ones? So that in science, where the evidence of an hypothesis is subjected to the most rigid examination, we may rightly pursue the same course. You may have hypotheses and hypotheses. A man may say, if he likes, that the moon is made of green cheese: that is an hypothesis. But another man, who has devoted {{a great deal of time}} and attention to the subject, and availed himself of the most powerful telescopes and the results of the observations of others, declares that in his opinion it is probably composed of materials very similar to those of which our own earth is made up: and that is also only an hypothesis. But I need not tell you that there is an enormous difference in the value of the two hypotheses. That one which is based on sound scientific knowledge is sure to have a corresponding value; and that which is a mere hasty random guess is likely to have but little value. Every great step in our progress in discovering causes has been made in exactly the same way as that which I have detailed to you. A person observing the occurrence of certain facts and phenomena asks, naturally enough, what process, what kind of operation known to occur in Nature applied to the particular case, will unravel and explain the mystery? Hence you have the scientific hypothesis; and its value will be proportionate to the care and completeness with which its basis had been tested and verified. It is in these matters as in the commonest affairs of practical life: the guess of the fool will be folly, while the guess of the wise man will contain wisdom. In all cases, you see that the value of the result depends on the patience and faithfulness with which the investigator applies to his hypothesis every possible kind of verification.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Update of a {{clinical}} practice guideline for the physiotherapy management {{of patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} supporting the clinical decision-making process. Methods: A systematic computerized literature search was performed on different modalities for improving physical exercise capacity, reducing exertional dyspnoea, improving airway clearance and encouraging changes in physical activity behaviour. Methodological quality was scored with the PEDro Scale. <b>Scientific</b> <b>conclusions</b> were graded according to the criteria of the 'Dutch Evidence Based Guideline Development Platform'. These, together with practical considerations, were used to formulate recommendations for clinical practice. Results: A total of 103 studies were included in the systematic review, consisting of five meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, 84 randomized controlled trials and 14 uncontrolled studies, Twenty <b>scientific</b> <b>conclusions</b> supported six recommendations on physical exercise training. Nineteen <b>scientific</b> <b>conclusions</b> supported eight recommendations on interventions for reducing dyspnoea. Five <b>scientific</b> <b>conclusions</b> supported seven recommendations concerning treatment modalities to improve mucus clearance, and two <b>scientific</b> <b>conclusions</b> supported two recommendations on strategies for encouraging permanent changes in physical activity behaviour. Conclusions: Strong recommendations support the use of physical exercise training to improve health-related quality of life and functional exercise capacity. Future research should investigate whether additional interventions for reducing exertional dyspnoea have a place as adjuncts to physical exercise training in selected patients. In addition, treatment of impaired mucus clearance, especially during acute exacerbations, requires further research. With the advance of new technologies for objective measurements of physical activities in daily life more research is needed concerning interventions to initiate and maintain physical activity behaviour change during and after supervised physical exercise training programme...|$|R

50|$|Ethnomethodology and {{the social}} {{anthropology}} of Pierre Bourdieu are probably the best representation of the initial work of Znaniecki and his model of culture as a system of values. In a sense humanistic sociology has transcended the structure vs function debate, focusing instead on the value-based world of culture. A researcher working as a humanistic sociologist has a scientific objectification of values. Using analytic induction {{in the context of}} the humanistic coefficient, not unduly influenced by questions of structure or function, an objective order for the social world is found. That the character of this social world is derived from sociological sources does not discount a <b>scientific</b> <b>conclusion.</b> A humanistic sociologist models the experience of humanity as the span of social action. A humanistic sociologist derives a dual structure for this space from axiological constructions mapped by symbolic expressions. A humanistic sociologist will follow the path pointed to by Znaniecki and reject the naturalistic view.|$|E

These creatures had barely been studied before the 1960s, and she focused in three groups: the microscopic Chaetognatha, which are carnivorous and feed on other plankton; the colonial Sinophora, which cluster in groups of individuals of the same species (like the Portuguese Man'o'War); and the Medusa or jellyfish. By studying the plankton of the English Channel and in the Bay of Biscay, her work led to the discovered some anomalies in the distribution of plankton species which led to the <b>scientific</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the Atlantic waters had moved poleward in an unusual way.
