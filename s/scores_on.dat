5|$|Kohlberg's {{scale is}} about how people justify {{behaviors}} and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E
5|$|Smetana had {{virtually}} no precursors in Czech opera apart from František Škroup, whose works had rarely lasted beyond one or two performances. In his mission {{to create a new}} canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> ensembles and choruses.|$|E
30|$|Patients in the {{intervention}} group used a smartphone with the MONARCA II app installed and were instructed to use the system for daily evaluation for 9  months. The MONARCA II system allowed for evaluation of the following measures on a daily basis: mood (<b>scored</b> <b>on</b> a scale from −[*] 3 to +[*] 3); sleep duration (measured in half-hour intervals); medicine intake; activity level (<b>scored</b> <b>on</b> a scale from −[*] 3 to +[*] 3); mixed mood (<b>scored</b> <b>on</b> a scale from 1 to 3); irritability (<b>scored</b> <b>on</b> a scale from 1 to 3); anxiety (<b>scored</b> <b>on</b> a scale from 1 to 3); cognitive problems (<b>scored</b> <b>on</b> a scale from 1 to 3); alcohol consumption; and stress (<b>scored</b> <b>on</b> a scale from 1 to 3).

5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{the student}} {{population}} was over 10,000, placing it as the fourth largest California state institution and larger than 96% of the U.S.’s colleges and universities at the time. In 1957, entering freshmen <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> examinations were ranked in the top 10% of all universities in the U.S. In the following years, the college’s scores also surpassed most of the other California state colleges. In 1957 the college became the first to use an identification number for each student, which was necessary to simplify handling of records, grades, and other tasks of the large number of students. To keep up with student expansion, the square footage of the buildings and classrooms was increased from 255,434 to 1,243,737.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland's {{ecosystems}} can {{be particularly}} fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> environmental public health, its heavy reliance on {{renewable sources of energy}} (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|The DEQ has {{collected}} water-quality {{data in the}} Rogue basin since the mid-1980s and has used it to generate <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). The index is meant to provide an assessment of water quality for general recreational uses; OWQI scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). Of the eight Rogue basin sites tested during the water years 1997–2006, five were ranked good, one was excellent, and two—Little Butte Creek and Bear Creek, in the most populated part of the Rogue basin—were poor. On the Rogue River itself, scores varied from 92 at RM138.4 (RK222.7) declining to 85 at RM117.2 (RK188.6) but improving to 97 at RM11.0 (RK17.7). By comparison, the average OWQI score for the Willamette River in downtown Portland, the state's largest city, was 74 between 1986 and 1995.|$|E

5|$|The {{first class}} arrived in fall 1927. The {{incoming}} Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population. One third of students hailed from Wisconsin (as opposed to 90 {{percent in the}} university), most were from urban areas (the East Coast had particularly strong representation), one third were second-generation immigrants, and Meiklejohn estimated their Jewish population at 40 percent. The College was all-male, {{due in part to}} space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex living arrangements, in keeping with American college conventions. The students were largely well-versed in current affairs, with higher <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts. Meiklejohn appreciated the challenges of reconciling this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's democratic governance.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Quests are {{directly}} linked to Lightning's growth: as she completes quests, her stats are boosted, with the main story quests yielding the biggest boosts. Many side quests can only be obtained at certain times, since the real-time build of the world means NPCs are in constant movement, and only appear in certain places at a given time. Lightning can also accept quests from the Canvas of Prayers, a post board found in all the main locations. Upon completing NPC quests, Lightning is rewarded with a portion of Eradia, spiritual energy retrieved when a person's burden is lifted. Every day at 6 AM game-time, Lightning is drawn back into the Ark, a location where the in-game clock does not progress. Once there, Lightning gives her gathered Eradia to a tree called Yggdrasil: if she has gathered enough, the in-game clock is extended by a day. She can also restock on supplies and collect new equipment. Another feature in the game was Outerworld Services, a feature where players could take photos and share them, along with their personal stats and battle <b>scores,</b> <b>on</b> Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook features were disabled in April 2015. All Outerworld services were terminated in April the following year.|$|E
