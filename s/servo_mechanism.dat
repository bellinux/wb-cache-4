50|$|Swirl flap {{position}} is adjusted by an electrical or vacuum-activated <b>servo</b> <b>mechanism</b> which {{is under the}} control of the engine management system. In a typical implementation the flaps will be closed at idle speed, creating additional turbulence in the intake. As engine speed increases, the flaps are gradually opened until, at around 2,000 rpm, they are parallel to the airflow and present virtually no resistance. Their purpose is to ensure that the air entering the cylinder is sufficiently turbulent for good fuel-air mixing even at low engine speeds. This aids in reducing certain toxic emissions and may also improve low-end power and torque.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Quantum Corporation sued CMI for patent {{infringement}} {{relating to the}} <b>servo</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the entire CM6600 line of drives. Instead of putting the tracking grating on the head arm and driving the arm directly from a voice coil, like the Quantum designs, CMI made a composite motor that would bolt to the drive {{in place of the}} usual stepper motor, with the voice coil on the bottom and the tracking mechanism on top (similar to DC servo motors used in process controls and robotics). CMI connected the motor to the arm with a metal-band pulley, the same mechanism they used on their stepper-motor drives. Since the feedback system was behind the pulley, it had to compensate for slack in the arm, one of several things the CMI firmware didn't take account of.|$|E
50|$|Historically, a {{different}} operation method has been used, {{in which the}} sample-probe support distance is kept constant and not controlled by a feedback (<b>servo</b> <b>mechanism).</b> In this mode, usually referred to as 'constant height mode', the deflection of the cantilever is recorded {{as a function of}} the sample x-y position. As long as the tip is in contact with the sample, the deflection then corresponds to surface topography. The main reason this method is not very popular anymore, is that the forces between tip and sample are not controlled, which can lead to forces high enough to damage the tip or the sample. It is however common practice to record the deflection even when scanning in 'constant force mode', with feedback. This reveals the small tracking error of the feedback, and can sometimes reveal features that the feedback was not able to adjust for.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} usually {{includes an}} angular reference device {{such as a}} mechanical or optical gyro and <b>servo</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In {{the case of a}} tank, there is one servo stabilizing the turret and another for the elevation of the gun. The aiming is then done by control input to the mechanism, rather than directly on the gun. The control mechanism usually has other functions, such as applying super-elevation and leading the target according to its velocity, making it a fire-control system, and some guns are entirely automatic.|$|R
50|$|In optical {{recording}} systems, <b>servo</b> <b>mechanisms</b> accurately follow the track in three dimensions: radial, focus, and rotational speed. Everyday handling damage, such as dust, fingerprints, and tiny scratches, not only affects retrieved data, but also disrupts the servo functions. In some cases, the servos may skip tracks or get stuck. Specific sequences of pits and lands are particularly susceptible to disc defects, and disc playability {{can be improved}} if such sequences are barred from recording. The use of EFM produces a disc that is highly resilient to handling and solves the engineering challenge in a very efficient manner.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the initial}} flight trials were being carried out, the design team {{examined}} the lift problem. Studies identified possible weight savings of 3.16 tons. The weight-saving measures included deleting {{twelve of the}} double-berth cabins, removing the reefing booms from the nose to frame 1 and between frames 13 to 15 at the tail, replacing the glass windows of the observation decks with Cellon, removing two water ballast tanks, and removing the <b>servo</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the rudder and elevators. [...] Letting the gasbags out would gain 3.18 tons extra lift, although Michael Rope considered this unwise, [...] since {{there were thousands of}} exposed fixings protruding from the girders; chafing of the gasbags would have to be prevented by wrapping these in strips of cloth. To further increase lift, an extra bay of [...] capacity could be installed. This would deliver an extra nine tons disposable lift. After much consultation, all these proposed measures were approved in December. Letting out the gasbags and the weight-saving measures were begun. Delivery by Boulton Paul of the metalwork for the extra bay was expected to take place in June.|$|E
5000|$|The {{overview}} given above may {{describe a}} modern {{version of the}} Miller cycle, but it differs in some respects from the 1957 patent. The patent describes [...] "a new and improved method of operating a supercharged intercooled engine". The engine may be two-cycle or four-cycle and the fuel may be diesel, dual fuel, or gas. It {{is clear from the}} context that [...] "gas" [...] means gaseous fuel and not gasoline. The pressure-charger shown in the diagrams is a turbocharger, not a positive-displacement supercharger. The engine (whether four-stroke or two-stroke) has a conventional valve or port layout, but an additional [...] "compression control valve" [...] (CCV) is in the cylinder head. The <b>servo</b> <b>mechanism,</b> operated by inlet manifold pressure, controls the lift of the CCV during part of the compression stroke and releases air from the cylinder to the exhaust manifold. The CCV would have maximum lift at full load and minimum lift at no load. The effect is to produce an engine with a variable compression ratio. As inlet manifold pressure goes up (because of the action of the turbocharger) the effective compression ratio in the cylinder goes down (because of the increased lift of the CCV) and vice versa. This [...] "will insure proper starting and ignition of the fuel at light loads".|$|E
50|$|When {{the player}} tries {{to read from}} a stop, it does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down {{from the surface of}} the disc until a {{reflection}} is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.Different brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north-south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.Another <b>servo</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.Two optical pick-up designs exists, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre.|$|E

5000|$|In larger steam {{turbines}} an oil operated <b>servo</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the oil chamber. The outlets of the oil chamber are connected to an oil drain tank through pipes.The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”. The equation for the willan’s line is given by: ...|$|E
5000|$|Doppler {{navigation}} was {{in common}} commercial aviation {{use in the}} 1960s until it was largely superseded by inertial navigation systems. The equipment consisted of a transmitter/receiver unit, a processing unit and a gyro stabilised antenna platform. The antenna generated four beams and was rotated by a <b>servo</b> <b>mechanism</b> to align with the aircraft's track by equalising the Doppler shift from {{the left and right}} hand antennas. A synchro transmitted the platform angle to the flight deck, thus providing a measure of 'drift angle'. The ground speed was determined from the Doppler shift between the forward and aft facing beams. These were displayed on the flight deck on single instrument. Some aircraft had an additional 'Doppler Computer'. This was a mechanical device containing a steel ball rotated by a motor whose speed was controlled by the Doppler determined ground speed. The angle of this motor was controlled by the 'drift angle'. Two fixed wheels, one 'fore and aft' the other 'left to right' drove counters to output distance along track and across track difference. The aircraft's compass was integrated into the computer so that a desired track could be set between two waypoints on an over water great circle route. It may seem surprising to 21st. century readers, but it actually worked rather well and was great improvement over other 'dead reckoning' methods available at the time. It was generally backed up with position fixes from Loran, or as a last resort sextant and chronometer. It was possible to cross the Atlantic with an error of a couple of miles when in range of a couple of VORs or NDBs.It's major shortcoming in practice was the sea state, as a calm sea gave poor radar returns and hence unreliable Doppler measurements. But this was infrequent on the North Atlantic ...|$|E

Tracking is performed based on the object's color, color distribution and color distribution with a probabilistic kernel. Output from the tracker is channeled to a proportional-integral-derivative controller, which generates steering commands for the robot controller. The robot controller in turn takes the steering commands and generates motor commands for the six legs of the robot. A large class of significant applications can be addressed by allowing such a robot to follow a diver or some other moving target.
