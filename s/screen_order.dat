40|$|In 2005 the Northern Territory of Australia {{conducted}} {{its first}} population-based gambling and problem-gambling prevalence survey, administering both the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) and the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI) {{to the same}} sample of respondents. Using a sub-sample of regular gamblers (n= 361), the respective problem gambling screens were subject to psychometric testing that included dimensionality, internal consistency, external validity, classification validity and <b>screen</b> <b>order</b> effects. Analyses were conducted for all regular gamblers stratified by gender. The CPGI produced a significantly lower prevalence estimate than the SOGS as well as lower rates of false-positives as measured against external criteria. Consistent with other studies, dimensionality analysis revealed a multi-dimensional factor structure for the SOGS and a single dimension for the CPGI. The CPGI displayed stronger correlations with external criteria and stronger internal consistency than the SOGS. A gender effect was observed, with both screens performing better for females. In addition, <b>screen</b> <b>order</b> significantly affected problem gambling prevalence estimates, although only for males and all persons. As a group, the psychometric analyses revealed that the results produced by the respective gambling screens are heavily context dependent, {{both in terms of}} methods of application and the characteristics of target populations. The key message of the paper is that post-hoc psychometric testing of gambling screens is essential in understanding the limitations of problem gambling prevalence estimates and to qualify and guide their interpretation when applied in general population surveys...|$|E
