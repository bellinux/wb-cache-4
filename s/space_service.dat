50|$|The {{plot and}} {{narrative}} center on one Heris Serrano, a strong competent female protagonist. She has recently left the Regular <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> that guards the Familias Regnant {{rather than face}} a court-martial for saving the lives of her troops by deliberately disobeying the orders of her bloodthirsty superior, Admiral Lepescu, and capturing her objectives in a way other than what he specified.|$|E
50|$|A {{societal}} {{criticism of}} the SCA is that the courts {{should be looking at}} the intents of parties, rather than access to communications. This brings into question the role of service providers as neutral repositories for content. In the modern <b>space,</b> <b>service</b> providers are unclear on if applying SCA would be a violation of user privacy rights. As a result, non compliance to subpoena could have a legal and economic impact on service providers.|$|E
50|$|Zayikin was {{assigned}} as backup commander for Voskhod 2. He {{then went on}} to graduate from the Zhukovsky Military Engineering Academy, Monino, in 1968. He left the <b>space</b> <b>service</b> on medical grounds (stomach ulcer) while training for Soyuz missions on October 25, 1969. He then became an instructor and lead engineer at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center. He left the space programme in 1982, and retired from active military duty in 1987.|$|E

50|$|During the war, the {{building}} suffered two direct hits from firebombs, and was badly damaged each time. The roof structure was completely destroyed, and a proper replacement was built {{only in the}} early 1980s, {{with the construction of}} the present roof extension. Since this time, the “Hohenzollernhaus” functions as the Foundation’s headquarters and principal source of revenue. This 6-floor-building hosts the Wempe Jeweller, the clothing manufacturer Tom Tailor as well as the office <b>space</b> <b>service</b> company World-Wide Business Centres.|$|E
50|$|He makes {{frequent}} {{appearances on}} radio and television in Australia, including breakfast TV shows Sunrise and Today, and has spoken at many public lectures and conferences, among them the UNESCO World Science Forum, the EuroScience Open Forum and Japan's annual Science and Technology in Society Forum. He was scheduled to be among the first passengers of Virgin Galactic's <b>space</b> <b>service</b> when flights begin in 2014 or 2015. Born in Brazil of Portuguese ancestry, he now lives in Sydney.|$|E
50|$|Due to a past {{catastrophe}} on Earth, humanity {{was forced}} to live amongst the stars for several centuries, resulting {{in the creation of}} the S.D. calendar and the birth of the Aria Federation, an empire whose influence extends from Earth to Saturn. In S.D. 1478, an embassy located within the empires capital on Earths moon was seized by terrorists, and forces deployed by Arias Special <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> ended in disaster as the terrorists triggered a self-detonation device, killing themselves and several civilians in the process.|$|E
5000|$|ViviSat {{will compete}} for <b>space</b> <b>servicing</b> {{business}} with the recently announced <b>Space</b> Infrastructure <b>Servicing</b> (SIS) vehicle from MDA. However, the two vehicles will operate with different technology approaches. ViviSat will connect to the target satellite {{in the same way}} as MDA SIS, but will not transfer fuel. It will rather use [...] "its own thrusters to supply attitude control for the target." ...|$|R
40|$|Consideration of {{customer}} satisfaction {{should be an}} essential part of evaluating library performance. Satisfaction depends, to some extent, on customer expectations of <b>space,</b> facilities and <b>services.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the "Outcome Budget Evaluation (OBE) " for gauging the level of <b>space,</b> <b>services</b> and facilities available in the library of past and present. Therefore, a focus group of 60 degree-level students across seven faculties was selected using the ―Lead User‖ method. These students who have been using both infrastructures; both the old and new UTHM libraries, are involved with parameters as <b>space,</b> <b>services</b> and facilities. A self-administered quantitative survey is designed and executed to measure the library performance. In overall, results of this study reveal that 98 percent of respondents are very satisfied with the present library including <b>space,</b> facilities and <b>services.</b> Lesson learned in this study has implications not only on student satisfaction, however much more internal perspectives on <b>space,</b> facilities and <b>services</b> in the library...|$|R

50|$|Fresh {{from the}} events of The Rising Commander Peter Raeder is called to a board of inquiry for certain {{questionable}} actions during the first missions of the Invincible. When the board seems to be about to send Raeder to a desk job on Earth, a special ops Marine group catches Raeder's interest. In exchange for running a high-risk high-reward undercover assignment, the Marine General {{will make sure that}} Raeder regains his position on the Invincible. With little other choice if he wishes to remain in <b>space</b> <b>service,</b> Raeder agrees.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 the Anti-Missile and Space Defence Forces {{were formed}} (войска противоракетной и противокосмической обороны и ПКО) under Artillery Lieutenant General Yu. Votintsev. They were reorganised as the Ministry of Defence <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Units in 1982, and were {{expanded}} to include the Chief Space Operations Directorate in 1986. In 1991 the Soviet Union was broken up. The Russian Armed Forces were established on 7 May 1992, enabling the creation of Russian Space Forces later that year on 10 August. They were merged with the Strategic Missile Troops in 1996, but were reformed in 2001.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story begins}} with Captain C.F. [...] "Hawk" [...] Hawkens (Vince Edwards) - a former <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Colonel turned pirate - who leads his crew {{on a mission}} to steal a {{freighter}} owned by an interstellar corporation simply referred to as [...] "The Company". During the theft, a 10-year-old boy named Peter (David Mendenhall) slips aboard the freighter to hide and the pirates steal the ship unaware he is aboard. After the freighter rendezvouses with Hawk's ship, the crew fight {{to save the life of}} a comrade wounded during the shootout. Meanwhile, Peter comes out of hiding and asks to be taken home.|$|E

5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{constructed}} with fire-resistant materials and also had enhanced fire-detecting and fire-extinguishing equipment installed for the time. A [...] "smoke-pipe" [...] fire-detecting system {{was installed in}} all cargo spaces, the paint locker, carpenter shop, dry storeroom and bosun's storerooms. A CO2 fire suppression system protected the cargo <b>spaces,</b> <b>service</b> <b>spaces</b> and machinery space in addition to standard fire fighting equipment.|$|R
50|$|Circa 9 {{hectares}} {{have been}} identified as being suitable for residential development, with a maximum density of 8-10 units per hectare, which would give an estimated maximum population growth of 255 persons. This figure does not account for open <b>space,</b> <b>service</b> roads and other ancillary development, nor does it account for possible residential development within the village development area, village centre extension area or future development area. The scale of any developments will be monitored to ensure the population does not exceed the council treatment systems. The proposed developments will also have to contribute to the provision of additional infrastructural services when the capacity of the treatment systems are exceeded.|$|E
50|$|The modern suburb {{was planned}} in {{connection}} with the conversion of the North Line into an S-train line. Virum station opened in 1936. The ambition was to create a healthy, well-functioning suburb with a population the size of a medium large Danish provincial town. The centre of the new suburb was Virum Torv, a mixed-use development centred on a roundabout next to the station. It contained retail <b>space,</b> <b>service</b> functions and apartments. Its northeastern corner was completed in 1939, its southeastern corner in 1943 and its southwestnern corner less than a year later. A cinema, Virum Bio, was from the beginning located in the building on the southeastern conrer. The same building also contained an Irma supermarket.|$|E
50|$|When {{there are}} several {{directories}} that have different but similar files, some of these files may have identical content. Single instance storage allows identical files to be merged to one file and create references to that merged file. SIS consists of a file system filter that manages copies, modification and merges to files; and a user <b>space</b> <b>service</b> (or groveler) that searches for files that are identical and need merging. SIS was mainly designed for remote installation servers as these may have multiple installation images that contain many identical files; SIS allows these to be consolidated but, unlike for example hard links, each file remains distinct; changes to one copy of a file will leave others unaltered. This is similar to copy-on-write, which is a technique by which memory copying is not really done until one copy is modified.|$|E
40|$|The LOVES {{computer}} code developed {{to investigate the}} concept of <b>space</b> <b>servicing</b> operational satellites {{as an alternative to}} replacing expendable satellites or returning satellites to earth for ground refurbishment is presented. In addition to having the capability to simulate the expendable satellite operation and the ground refurbished satellite operation, the program is designed to simulate the logistics of <b>space</b> <b>servicing</b> satellites using an upper stage vehicle and/or the earth to orbit shuttle. The program not only provides for the initial deployment of the satellite but also simulates the random failure and subsequent replacement of various equipment modules comprising the satellite. The program has been used primarily to conduct trade studies and/or parametric studies of various space program operational philosophies...|$|R

5000|$|The leftmost element, #84, is a brick {{structure}} {{built in}} 1834 by Albert and Edmond Dole that was originally three stories in height. It shares unified cornices {{at the fourth}} and fifth level with the adjacent wood frame block (#88), also built (in 1843) by the Doles. These building were used by the Doles, who were cabinetmakers, as a furniture factory until 1889. Chandler & Co., the next occupant, adapted the space for use as a retail furniture showroom, using some of the space for upholstery work and as a repair shop. During their ownership, #84 and #88 were both raised to five stories, and #96 was integrated into its facility, with the intervening courtyard <b>space</b> <b>service</b> as a shipping and loading area. It was home to the Bangor Furniture Company 1927-1989. [...] It has since been converted into mixed retail/commercial/residential use.|$|E
50|$|The broad plot {{synopsis}} of the Astrosaurs series {{is that the}} dinosaurs were not in fact wiped out when a large meteor hit the earth millions of years ago; they had in fact discovered space travel during the Triassic period and had already left earth {{by the time the}} meteor struck. The dinosaurs subsequently settled in a part of space called the Jurassic Quadrant, which is divided between the carnivores and herbivores; between the two sectors is a neutral area of space. The two factions broadly stay at peace by avoiding each other, but invariably trouble flares up between the two from time to time. Admiral Rosso, a crusty old Barosaurus, employs Teggs to work for the DSS (Dinosaur <b>Space</b> <b>Service)</b> in the first book and introduces him to his crew, which includes over fifty people and fifty Dimorphodon, most notably Arx Orano, Iggy Tooth and Gipsy Saurine, along with fifty dimorphodon. In Earth Attack, which is notable for being an extra-long edition, General Loki the Velociraptor goes back in time to try and prevent the dinosaurs leaving Earth, so the whole history of Astrosaurs would never have happened. However, he is stopped.|$|E
40|$|Besides {{providing}} position, navigation, {{and timing}} (PNT) to terrestrial users, GPS is currently {{used to provide}} for precision orbit determination, precise time synchronization, real-time spacecraft navigation, and three-axis control of Earth orbiting satellites. With additional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) coming into service (GLONASS, Beidou, and Galileo), {{it will be possible}} to provide these services by using other GNSS constellations. The paper, "GPS in the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume," presented at the ION GNSS 19 th International Technical Meeting in 2006 (Ref. 1), defined the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume, and analyzed the performance of GPS out to 70, 000 km. This paper will report a similar analysis of the performance of each of the additional GNSS and compare them with GPS alone. The <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume, defined as the volume between 3, 000 km altitude and geosynchronous altitude, as compared with the Terrestrial Service Volume between the surface and 3, 000 km. In the Terrestrial Service Volume, GNSS performance will be similar to performance on the Earth's surface. The GPS system has established signal requirements for the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume. A separate paper presented at the conference covers the use of multiple GNSS in the <b>Space</b> <b>Service</b> Volume...|$|E
40|$|The LOVES {{computer}} program {{was employed to}} analyze the geosynchronous portion of the NASA's 1973 automated satellite mission model from 1980 to 1990. The objectives of the analyses were: (1) to demonstrate the capability of the LOVES code to provide the depth and accuracy of data required to support the analyses; and (2) to tradeoff the concept of <b>space</b> <b>servicing</b> automated satellites composed of replaceable modules against the concept of replacing expendable satellites upon failure. The computer code {{proved to be an}} invaluable tool in analyzing the logistic requirements of the various test cases required in the tradeoff. It is indicated that the concept of <b>space</b> <b>servicing</b> offers the potential for substantial savings in the cost of operating automated satellite systems...|$|R
