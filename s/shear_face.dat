40|$|Strengthening {{structures}} through external bonding {{of advanced}} fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite {{is turning out}} to be exceptionally well known worldwide amid the previous decade on the grounds that it gives a more practical and in fact better option than the conventional procedures much of the time as it offers better strength, good fatigue resistance, low weight, corrosion resistance, easy and rapid installation along with minimal change in geometry of the structure. Although many in-situ RC beams are continuous in construction, there has been a limited research in the area of FRP strengthening of continuous beams. In the present study, an experimental investigation is carried out to study the behavior of continuous RC beams under static loading. The beams are strengthened with externally bonded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) sheets and also with unbonded GFRP using steel bolt system. Different scheme of strengthening have been employed. The experiment consists of six continuous (two-span) beams with overall dimensions equal to (150 × 250 × 2300) mm. All the beams will have similar longitudinal and transverse steel reinforcement. One beam was not strengthened and was considered as a control beam, whereas all other beams were strengthened in various patterns with externally bonded GFRP sheets and unbonded GFRP with end anchorage using the steel bolt system. The present study examines the responses of RC continuous beams, in terms of failure modes, enhancement of load capacity and load deflection analysis. The results indicate that the shear strength of RC beams can be significantly increased by gluing GFRP sheets to the <b>shear</b> <b>face.</b> In addition, the unbonded sheets with end anchorage also improved the cracking behaviour of the beams by delaying the formation of visible cracks and reducing crack widths at higher load levels...|$|E

The improved shearer clearer, like its predecessor, reduces dust concentrations in the shearer operator's walkway by splitting the airflow on the upwind side of the shearer and confining the dust cloud to the face side of the shearer. The improved shearer-clearer system utilizes more practical-mounting locations for the water sprays and requires less water consumption. In the underground test, the improved system maintained the clean-air split in the walkway up to 40 ft downstream from the shearer.

The {{temperature}} remarkably elevates and the material softens in the thin severely deformed layer. The cut faces are contacted each other with sliding motion immediately after shearing. Sheet materials are a pure aluminum A 1050 and its alloy A 5052. Two similar sets of circular shearing punch, die and sheet are concentrically stacked in the device for performing the simultaneous shearing. The upper sheared circular sheet slides into the hole of the lower one for joining shortly after the shearing. Strain-rate order was about 104 /s in shearing, where the punches were driven by a drop-weight. Quasi-static test was also conducted for comparison. Joining was achieved only in the high-speed test. Joining boundary was not visible at the central portion in thickness, though the gap openings were seen near both sheet surfaces. Joining efficiency was evaluated as the relative strength to the tensile strength of the material. It was improved as the shearing clearance becomes smaller. The maximum efficiency was about 30 % for A 1050 material. It is about 25 % for A 5052. It was at most 10 % in the joining of A 1050 and A 5052...|$|R

3000|$|In Kirchhoff’s theory, w(x, y) {{obtained}} above {{corresponds to}} neutral plane deflection w 0 N with edge condition w 0 N = 0. Obviously, this edge condition {{is not required}} to obtain [u 1, v 1] and face deflection. With reference to the present analysis, it is relevant to note the following observations: In the preliminary solution, σ z, α[τ xz, τ yz], α 2 [σ x, σ y, τ xy] are of O(1). As such, estimation of in-plane stresses, thereby, in-plane displacements, are not dependent on w 0. The support condition w 0 = 0 along the plate edge does not play any role in the estimation of in-plane displacements. In fact, Kirchhoff’s theory gives only a lower bound for α for the validity of small deformation theory. Validity of its application is a questionable proposition for small values of α even slightly higher than this lower bound since the theory gives highly constrained solutions for displacements. Shear deformations are included in FSDT in which <b>face</b> <b>shear</b> conditions are not satisfied and Reissner’s theory in which edge condition on w 0 is not satisfied. Both of these theories give {{more or less the same}} maximum vertical deflection. It shows that satisfying either edge condition on w 0 or <b>face</b> <b>shear</b> conditions has equal effect on deformations. In each of these theories, both conditions are satisfied only in the limit.

40|$|Although {{longwall}} mining productivity can far exceed that of room-and-pillar mining, the total methane emissions per extracted volume associated with longwall sections are generally {{higher than those}} for continuous miner or pillar removal sections. Increased face advance rates, increased productivities, increased panel sizes, and more extensive gate road developments have challenged existing designs for controlling methane on longwalls. Methane control research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently examined a number of practices designed to maintain concentrations in mine air within statutory limits and consistently below the lower explosive limit. These included a reservoir modeling approach to predict methane inflows in gate road entries. The outputs sug 2 that emission rates in the gate roads decreased {{with the use of}} shielding boreholes and increased degasification time. Also, mining perpendicular to the face cleats liberated more gas into the mine workings, emissions were almost a linear function of Langmuir pressure and volume, and emissions were inversely related to sorption time constant. Subsequent simulations predicted changes in methane drainage using in-seam boreholes. The results showed that longer degasification times resulted in lower face emission rates. Premining degasification produced more methane than that produced during panel extraction, a fact attributed to the already decreased methane content of the coalbed. This work concluded that longer premining degasification periods would be more advantageous to the operator. The industry trend toward increasing longwall face width can produce increased methane emissions from the face due to a higher volume of cut coal on the face conveyor. Two methods were used to estimate face methane levels on longer faces. In the first method, segmented methane data were extrapolated for greater face widths. The second method estimated emissions contributions from the <b>shearer,</b> <b>face</b> conveyor, panel belt, longwall face, and ribs, and summed these for wider panels.

40|$|A key {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to share application of chilled water sprays for prevention of frictional ignitions in coal mines to provide a safe occupational environment. Frictional ignitions in underground mines if not managed adequately may lead to major explosions. Historic statistics have indicated that the greatest explosion risk originates from frictional ignitions. Methane and dust related to explosions have resulted in over 7500 lives lost in the last ten years worldwide. The experiences of chilled water sprays used for managing heat in deep metal mines in South Africa is highly relevant to frictional incendive/face heat management in Australian coal mines. Mine ventilation and water sprays (used for dust suppression and dilution ventilation) are established technologies that are widely used in coal mines for the prevention of frictional ignitions. However, greater benefits of cooling or the sharp reduction in incendive heat from cutting picks by the use of chilled water sprays outweighs cooling using the current practice of using warm service water. Chilled water spray droplets have the potential to become „improved last line of defense‟ against gas ignitions. For example, introduction of chilled water sprays with millions of fine chilled water droplets around picks and face area would provide a simple, reliable and rapid cooling power of 210 kW and 1 005 kW for continuous miners <b>faces</b> and Longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>face</b> respectively. A US study has noted that 90 % of all frictional ignitions occurred in coal mines that liberated at least 0. 39 % of CH 4 through their mine ventilation air methane system. However, analyses of South African statistics indicate that frictional ignition have occurred in coal and gold mines that liberated even with lower emissions between 0. 02 % to 0. 05 % of CH 4 through their mine ventilation air methane system. Therefore, it is important to raise awareness that frictional ignition risks are ever present in coal mines regardless of gas contents or gas emissions. The application of wet head systems, proactive ventilation and methane monitoring, active suppression systems, and frequent safety interactions for preventing frictional ignitions are discussed...|$|R
