40|$|During a storm, wind induced ovalling {{vibrations}} {{were observed}} on several empty silos of a closely spaced group consisting of 8 by 5 thin-walled silos {{in the port}} of Antwerp (Belgium). To clarify the cause and location of these wind induced vibrations, the spatial distribution of the aerodynamic pressures on the <b>silo</b> <b>surfaces</b> is determined in both 2 D and 3 D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations of the highly turbulent wind flow around the silo group. The influence of the angle of incidence of the wind flow on the dynamic wind pressures is investigated by performing 2 D URANS (unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes) simulations. Linking of the aerodynamic pressures to dynamic properties of the silos reveals strong narrow band frequency peaks in the turbulent pressure coefficient spectra of the silos near the lee side corners {{of the group that}} match the structural natural frequencies of the observed ovalling modes. The importance of 3 D wake effects on the spatial distribution of aerodynamic pressures along the height of the silos is investigated with 3 D DDES (delayed detached eddy simulations). An important issue in the 3 D simulations is the application of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) at the inlet of the domain. The aerodynamic pressures on the <b>silo</b> <b>surfaces</b> are first investigated using the same procedure as for the 2 D results and afterwards by performing one way coupling calculations; i. e. by applying the 3 D aerodynamic pressures as transient external loads on a 3 D finite element model of the silos.

Previous to the discharge, we prepare the system using different filling procedures: distributed, i. e. a homogeneous rain of grains across the cross-section of the silo; concentric, a granular jet along the silo axis; and a combination of both, i. e. filling half of the silo using one procedure and the second half using the other. We observe that each filling protocol leads to distinctive evolutions of the apparent mass (i. e., the effective weight sensed at the base) during the discharge. Interestingly, the use of combined filling protocols may lead to a reduced apparent mass, smaller than any other achieved with a simple filling. We propose a model based on the Janssen rationale that quantitatively accounts for the latter puzzling experimental observation...|$|R
40|$|Dry {{matter and}} energy losses which occur from the faces of silage (1) prior to {{unloading}} from silos and (2) following unloading but prior to being consumed by livestock {{are referred to as}} after-fermentation. Silages with low rates of after-fermentation are said to be stable, and thus, have a relatively long bunk life. After-fermentation in silages is caused by aerobic organisms becoming active {{because of the presence of}} oxygen prior to or following unloading from silos. The aerobic organisms metabolize residual carbohydrates and lactic acid in silage and the heating of feeds after unloading is indication of activity of such organisms. In conventional tower silos, after-fermentation losses can occur from the face of the silage. In "sealed " or oxygen-limiting structures similar losses can occur in the unloading zone due to oxygen exposure during feeding periods. In horizontal silos, similar types of losses can occur from the face of the silo as well as the top <b>surface</b> if <b>silos</b> are not covered well. Research by Zimmer et ale (1973) indicated that after-fermentation losses were primarily but not exclusively related to yeast populations and activity. Their findings suggested that yeast populations increased in silage during periods of oxygen exposure with high population being related to greater exposure. Exposure to oxygen caused by slow filling rates and improper silo construction, maintenance or managementwould permit aerobic microbial populations to increase. At unloading, the greater the yeast and other aerobic microbial populations, the shorter the bunk life and the greater the dry matter losses observed from silages...|$|R
40|$|Both the {{principle}} of operation and the motion-control system of a suspended robot for <b>surface</b> cleaning in <b>silos</b> are presented in this paper. The mechanical design is a reasonable compromise between basically contradictory factors in the design: the small entrance and the large surface of the confined space, and the suspension and the stabilization of the robot. The design consists of three main parts: a support unit, the cleaning robot and a cleaning mechanism. The latter two parts enter the silo in a folded form and, thereafter, the robot’s arms are spread {{in order to achieve}} stability during the cleaning process. The vertical movement of the robot is achieved via sequential crawling motions. The control system is divided into two separate subsystems, the robot’s control subsystem and a support-unit control subsystem, in order to facilitate different operational modes. The robot has three principle motion-control tasks: positioning the robot inside the silo, holding a vertical position during the cleaning process and a crawling movement. A scaled prototype of the robot has been implemented and tested to prove the concept, in order to make certain that the mechanical design suits the main functions of the robotic system, to realize the robot’s design in an industrial version and to test it in a realistic environment...|$|R
40|$|Wind induced ovalling {{vibrations}} {{were observed}} during a storm in October 2002 on several empty silos of a closely spaced group consisting of 8 by 5 thin-walled silos {{in the port}} of Antwerp (Belgium). To clarify the cause and location of the observed silo vibrations, a thorough analysis of the aerodynamic pressures on the <b>silo</b> <b>surfaces</b> is required. Therefore, both 2 D and 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been performed. While the 2 D simulations mainly aim at studying {{the influence of the}} angle of incidence of the wind flow on the location where ovalling vibrations can be observed, the 3 D simulations are performed to incorporate 3 D flow effects into the analysis and to assess the validity of the conclusions of the 2 D simulations. The 3 D pressure distribution on the silo walls is applied as an external time dependent load on a 3 D finite element model of a silo to determine the structural response. Afterwards, modal projection of the load is performed to determine the contribution of each ovalling mode shape to the dynamic structural response. For the 2 D simulations, a similar technique of harmonic decomposition is derived and validated with the 3 D one-way coupling approach. The results of both approaches yield evidence of the onset of ovalling vibrations, corresponding to the observed pattern of oscillations in the Antwerp silo group...|$|R

The samples were examined by dilution plating before and after aerosolization in an acoustical dust generator. Aerosol samples were collected by liquid impinger and filter cassettes. The samples were examined for total aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, lactobacilli, listeriae, thermophilic actinomycetes, fungi, and endotoxin. Very high levels of total aerobic bacteria and fungi {{were found in the}} surface sample (up to 10 (9) CFU/g in the bulk sample and up to 10 (9) CFU/m 3 after aerosolization), whereas the corresponding values from the deepest site were 100 to 50, 000 times lower. Aspergillus fumigatus predominated among the fungi, whereas Bacillus and gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species) prevailed among bacteria. Thermophilic actinomycetes occurred in numbers up to 10 (7) CFU/g in the bulk samples, whereas anaerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and listeriae were only few or absent. The concentration of endotoxin was high in the surface sample (up to 211. 4 Endotoxin Units/mg) and about 200 -fold lower in the sample from the deepest site. The results show that contact with dust from the surface of silage carries the risk of exposure to high concentrations of microorganisms, of which A. fumigatus and endotoxin-producing bacteria are the most probable disease agents...|$|R

Fumigation with phosphine was tested on two (70 m) replicate silo bags each containing 240 t of wheat (9. 9 and 9. 2 % m. c.). The target application rate of phosphine was 1. 5 g m 3 with a fumigation period of 17 days. Aluminium phosphide tablets were inserted into each bag at ten release points spaced at 7 m intervals starting 3. 5 m from either end of the bag. A total of 14 bioassay cages containing mixed age populations of strongly phosphine resistant Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) were inserted into each fumigated silo bag. Complete control of all life stages of R. dominica was achieved at all locations in the fumigated silo bags. Phosphine concentrations at release points increased rapidly and remained high {{for the duration of the}} fumigation. Concentrations at midway points were always lower than at the release points but exceeded 215 ppm for ten days. The diffusion coefficient of available phosphine averaged over the first three full days of the fumigation for both fumigated silo bags was 2. 8 x 10 7. Venting the silo bag with an aeration fan reduced the phosphine concentration by 99 % after 12 h. Relatively small amounts of phosphine continued to desorb after the venting period. Although grain temperature at the core of the silo bags remained stable at 29 degreesC for 17 days, grain at the <b>surface</b> of the <b>silo</b> bags fluctuated daily with a mean of 29 degreesC. The results demonstrate that silo bags can be fumigated with phosphine for complete control of infestations of strongly phosphine resistant R. dominica and potentially other species...|$|R
40|$|With {{a modern}} day {{tendency}} in architecture to build slender structures {{with a low}} eigenfrequency, wind loading often constitutes the critical design load. During a storm in October 2002, wind induced ovalling vibrations were observed on several empty silos of a closely spaced group (pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1. 05) consisting of 8 by 5 thin-walled silos in the port of Antwerp (Belgium) [1]. While realistic information on dynamic wind loads is increasingly important to improve the design of such flexible structures, {{it is difficult to}} obtain reliable design pressures. Design codes typically provide only basic quasi-static wind pressures for a restricted class of structures with a simple geometry. To clarify the cause of the wind induced ovalling vibrations in the silo group, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations are an interesting alternative to more expensive wind tunnel tests or in situ measurements to determine the transient wind loads on the silo structures. Since the pressure distribution around the cylinders of the group is highly dependent on the orientation of the group, the complex flow regime around and within the 8 by 5 silo group has been simulated for 7 angles of incidence between 0 and 90, leaving other influencing parameters unchanged (e. g. spacing ratio, Reynolds number, [...] .). First, the numerical procedure is validated for the case of a single silo in cross flow under identical circumstances. The 2 D URANS (unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) simulations of the entire group consequently reveal similarities of the flow regime around the silo group with the flow within tube arrays (e. g. heat exchangers) [2] and the flow around rectangular cylinders [3]. Analysis of the fluctuating wind pressures on the <b>silo</b> <b>surfaces</b> shows that ovalling oscillations of the third and fourth eigenmodes will be induced at the lee side of the silo group. These correspond with the lowest structural eigenfrequencies of the silos and the pattern of the visually detected vibrations during the 2002 storm...|$|R
40|$|Finite element models, which {{employ the}} Drucker-Prager yield criterion, have been {{developed}} to simulate the static contact statuses between conical silos and granular materials in 3 forms: the near contact, the sliding contact and the sticking contact. Contact conditions are established when 2 separated surfaces touch at normal direction while maintaining tangential relative movement. In general physical meaning, the surfaces in contact status have the following characteristics: 1) No penetration between each other; 2) The normal pressure and the tangent friction force may be transferred during contact; 3) Generally the normal pulling force cannot be transferred when surface separation occurs. Due to the symmetric property of conical structures, simplified two-dimensional contacting simulations are carried out in this paper, nonlinear finite element software ANSYS is used and the contacting surfaces between granular materials and conical silos are defined with rigid-to-flexible surface-to-surface contact pair. The target <b>surfaces</b> of conical <b>silos</b> are modeled with TARGE 169 element and the contact surfaces of granular materials are modeled with CONTA 171 element. During finite element analysis, conical silos and granular materials are meshed with two-dimensional solid element, PLANE 42. The static contact statuses are investigated with conical silos containing different granular materials. The silo geometries vary at a dip angle of 20 °, 33. 7 ° and 45 °. Sunflower seeds, corn, coal, rounded gravel and wheat are selected as the granular materials. Results show that the mechanical properties of granular materials (including bulk density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, dilation angle, internal friction angle, cohesion) and silo designs (especially dip angle) have significant effects on the contact statuses at the interface between conical silos and granular materials: 1) For various granular material, 3 contact statuses, i. e. the form of near contact, sliding contact and sticking contact, can be found between granular materials and conical silo walls; 2) The contact statuses between conical silos and granular materials do not depend on (or not mainly depend on) any mechanical property of granular materials. The contact statuses are a combined effect of all mechanical properties of granular materials. Those granular materials with very small dilation angle may have the near contact statuses. Those granular materials with higher cohesive force usually present a smaller sticking contact area, and those granular materials with higher elastic modulus and bulk density usually present a larger sticking contact area than those with opposite material properties; 3) With the decreasing of conical silo depth, the near contact area disappears, the sliding contact area decreases and the sticking contact area increases. 4) Under the sliding contact status, the friction energy dissipation is mainly due to the relative motion between contact surfaces. Under the sticking contact status, the friction energy dissipation is mainly due to the elastic deformation because of the contact. The greater the sticking contact area, the more difficultly the silo discharges. The greater the sliding contact area, the more seriously the <b>silo</b> internal <b>surfaces</b> could be damaged. Since larger sticking/sliding contact area inevitably causes unloading difficulties or friction damage, contact statuses between granular materials and conical silos should be optimized in the silos design in order to boost storage efficiency...|$|R
40|$|With an {{increasing}} tendency in civil engineering to build ever taller skyscrapers and longer bridges with lighter materials, structures {{are more susceptible}} to wind-induced vibrations. In the design process, however, aeroelastic safety is often not considered. While the conceived structures are perfectly adopted to standard design loads, they are only seldom aerodynamically optimized. Many examples exist where wind-induced vibrations have led to catastrophic structural failure. Wind-induced vibrations can be caused by either forced excitation or aeroelastic effects. In the first case, the forced vibrations originate from turbulent fluctuations in the wind flow around the structure, e. g. from natural turbulence in the wind flow attacking the structure or due to periodic vortex shedding {{in the wake of the}} structure. The second, aeroelastic phenomena are typically self-excited and are due to displacements of the structure that result in interactions with the wind flow. It must be emphasized that it is often impossible to pinpoint one specific excitation mechanism as the single cause of observed wind-induced vibrations since these are often initiated by a combination of different phenomena. In design codes, however, only forced excitation is mostly considered. It is therefore important to develop advanced techniques to study wind-induced vibrations that can incorporate all different excitation mechanisms at once. To study the susceptibility of a structure to wind-induced phenomena, a coupled multiphysics problem considering both wind flow and structural dynamics has to be solved. Because of the complexity of such problems, simplified phenomenological and experimental models are often unsatisfactory while numerical methods have the advantage that all possibly interacting excitation mechanisms can be accounted for simultaneously. With procedures available to couple a numerical model for the wind flow, i. e. computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the structure, e. g. finite element (FE) models, it should be possible to study wind-structure interaction (WSI) numerically. The goal of this thesis is therefore to investigate whether for a realistic, complex WSI problem numerical simulations can adequately predict observed wind-induced vibrations. For this purpose, the specific case study of a silo group is considered where wind-induced ovalling vibrations were observed during a storm in October 2002 on several empty silos in a group of forty silos in the port of Antwerp (Belgium). The necessity of performing complicated numerical WSI simulations for this problem is examined. First, it is investigated with both 2 D and 3 D CFD simulations how turbulent fluctuations in natural atmospheric winds can be simulated and how they are preserved in the flow field. In the 2 D simulations realistic turbulence levels cannot be simulated in the oncoming wind flow but these calculations allow to study wake-induced effects on the aerodynamic pressures in the silo group for a changing angle of incidence of the wind flow, as the simulations are computationally significantly less intensive. In the 3 D simulations, the turbulent wind flow can be modelled more realistically although some difficulties are encountered with the preservation of turbulence levels in the wind flow attacking the silo group as well. Due to the particular geometry of the silo group and the highly turbulent character of the wind flow, validation of the CFD simulation results is difficult. In addition to the silo group, the flow around a single silo is therefore considered. The better documented 2 D flow around a single cylinder is validated with results from the literature, while for the validation of the 3 D wind flow simulations, a wind tunnel test is performed for the single silo configuration. The influence of the blockage effect in the experiment is investigated and the pressure distribution on the <b>silo</b> <b>surface</b> shows reasonably good agreement in experiment and simulation. Qualitative validation is furthermore performed wherever possible for the silo group by comparing the flow pattern with geometrically similar flows e. g. through tube bundles of heat exchangers or around surface mounted prisms. The typical ovalling eigenmodes of a silo are determined from the FE model of the structure and subsequently, the modal projection of the aerodynamic pressure distributions from the 2 D and 3 D CFD simulations is determined. This approach allows to assess at which locations in the silo group ovalling vibrations are excited through direct forcing by the transient wind loads. For all angles of incidence in the 2 D simulations, a harmonic decomposition methodology is introduced as an alternative for the 3 D modal projection. The effect of a different turbulence modelling approach in the 2 D and 3 D simulations on the aerodynamic pressures on the <b>silo</b> <b>surfaces</b> is significant. While the 2 D simulations are found to be inadequate for the present purposes, the location of the ovalling vibrations in the silo group is predicted well by the 3 D simulations. Finally, the FE model of the structure and the 3 D CFD wind flow simulations are considered together as a single problem. To evaluate the importance of incorporating WSI for the prediction of ovalling vibrations, the structural response due to external aerodynamic forces is first calculated in one-way coupled simulations. The applied transient wind loads are determined a priori in the 3 D CFD simulations. In this approach, only forced excitation is considered as a possible excitation mechanism of wind-induced vibrations. In the two-way coupled WSI simulations by contrast, the structural and fluid solver are fully interacting and information is exchanged at the interface between the two solvers in every time step. Therefore, in this approach aeroelastic phenomena are also accounted for. Both one-way and two-way coupled simulations are performed for the single silo configuration and for the entire silo group. The structural response in the different coupled simulations in terms of excited eigenmodes is compared by considering modal deformation energy. Different frequency components can be clearly distinguished in the modal deformation energy of the structural response which are related to physical phenomena in the turbulent wind flow. After qualitative comparison of the results in the one-way and two-way coupled simulations, it cannot decisively be concluded whether ovalling vibrations of a single silo are due to forced excitation or if aeroelastic effects are important. Because the coupled WSI simulations are at the limit of practical feasibility of present day computational power, no grid independent solutions could be obtained. Nevertheless, the results of low resolution simulations for the silo group arrangement indicate that aeroelastic effects have a sigificant impact on the structural response of the silos. It is therefore concluded that complicated and grid independent WSI simulations are in general required to realistically predict the onset of ovalling vibrations in silo groups with numerical techniques. nrpages: 238 status: publishe...|$|R
