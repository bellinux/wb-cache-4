5000|$|The mature {{fishbone}} waterfern typically has simple, pinnate fronds {{of length}} 40-60 cm. Fronds have a short, thick stipe that is sometimes covered in small hairs. The class of blechnum ferns are typified by having distinct fertile and sterile fronds. Fertile fronds are easily distinguishable from sterile fronds in the fishbone waterfern. Overall, sterile fronds {{tend to be}} more delicate in appearance, with a thinner longer stipe. Fertile fronds are simply pinnate, like the <b>sterile</b> <b>variety,</b> but can grow to be much longer than sterile fronds in the fishbone fern. Pinna are thin, with a rounder profile than the flat pinna of the sterile fronds. Fertile pinna are curved towards the tip of the frond, and are much shorter than sterile pinna.

Analysis of developmentally staged B. napus flower buds indicated that APG transcript is confined to the anther during the period of microspore development. Reporter gene fusions established that the APG promoter directs expression in a number of cell types in anthers of transformed plants. This expression is consistent with the temporal pattern of mRNA accumulation in B. napus buds and follows a complex developmental pattern. Most significantly, the promoter is active in both sporophytic and gametophytic cell types, with activity of the transgene in each cell type being delineated by various cytological markers...|$|R

50|$|One option {{currently}} being explored is a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, which would kill middle-aged larvae of Cactoblastis cactorum. The bacterium {{was discovered by}} a group of scientists working in a colonization facility in Tifton, Georgia, who were attempting to rear large colonies of the moth. In their efforts to produce a <b>sterile</b> <b>variety</b> of the moth to eradicate it from its introduced habitat, a unique strain of bacterium was discovered. A particularly virulent variety of the bacterium was cultured that killed 100% of developing Cactoblastis cactorum larvae. This bacterium, when raised with the developing moth larvae, caused 100% mortality due to a combination of excreted exotoxins. The primary lethal exotoxin found in the guts of Cactoblastis cactorum after being exposed to Bacillus thuringiensis is referred to commonly as BtCc. It is being explored as short-term pest suppression because the bacterium is currently unable to be transferred from generation to generation in the gut of the moth. BtCc disrupts the digestive process of the larvae and causes near immediate larvae death. In order for this to be a long-term solution to control the spread of Cactoblastis cactorum, the bacterium or exotoxin would {{have to be able to}} reproduce and sporulate within the moth for its effects to spread in the population.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcacia mearnsii (black wattle) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} forestry species in South Africa, grown for its timber {{as well as}} its bark.

Previous research on crosses between diploid and tetraploid parent plants to produce triploid progeny has resulted in poor seed set. One possible barrier preventing seed set could be the viability of the pollen used in the cross pollination operations. Thus a study was conducted to test the pollen viability. In vitro agar media germination tests (ACIAR and Brewbaker and Kwack media) were optimised on Acacia podalyriifolia pollen and then used together with vital stain tests (Sigma® DAB peroxidase and p-phenylendiamine) to test pollen germination and viability of A. mearnsii pollen. These were then compared to in vivo pollen germination on the stigma, and were conducted on both diploid and tetraploid pollen mixes.

One PTGMS gene from Pei′ai 64 S, pms 1 (t), was mapped by a strategy of bulked-extreme and recessive-class approach with simple sequence repeat (SSR) and insert and deletion (In-Del) markers. Using linkage analysis for the F 2 mapping population consisting of 320 completely male sterile individuals derived from a cross between Pei′ai 64 S and 93 - 11 (indica restorer) lines, the pms 1 (t) gene was delimited to the region between the RM 21242 (0. 2 cM) and YF 11 (0. 2 cM) markers on the short arm of chromosome 7. The interval containing the pms 1 (t) locus, which was co-segregated with RM 6776, is a 101. 1 kb region based on the Nipponbare rice genome. Fourteen predicted loci were found in this region by the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Genomic Annotation. Based on {{the function of the}} locus LOC_Os 07 g 12130 by bioinformatics analysis, it is predicted to encode a protein containing a Myb-like DNA-binding domain, and may process the transcript with thermosensory response. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results revealed that the mRNA levels of LOC_Os 07 g 12130 were altered in different photoperiod and temperature treatments. Thus, the LOC_Os 07 g 12130 locus is the most likely candidate gene for pms 1 (t). These results may facilitate not only using the molecular marker assisted selection of PTGMS genes, but also cloning of the pms 1 (t) gene itself...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{some important}} issues surrounding possible deployment {{of genetically engineered}} (GE) insect-resistant potato in Peru, based on a large farmer survey held in Peru in 2003. We found that the formal seed system plays a limited role compared with the informal seed system, especially for smallholder farmers. Although 97 % of smallholder farmers would buy seed of an insect-resistant variety, a majority would buy it only once every 2 to 4 years. Survey data show that farmers {{would be willing to}} pay a premium of 50 % on seed cost for insect resistant varieties. Paying price premiums of 25 % to 50 %, farmers would still increase their net income, assuming insect resistance is high and pesticide use will be strongly reduced. Of all farmers, 55 % indicated preference for insect-resistant potato in varieties other than their current varieties. The survey indicates that smallholder farmers are interested to experiment with new varieties and have a positive perception of improved varieties. Based on these findings, and considering the difficulties implementing existing biosafety regulatory systems such as those in place in the U. S. and E. U., we propose to develop a variety-based segregation system to separate GE from conventionally bred potatoes. In such a system, which would embrace the spread of GE potatoes through informal seed systems, only a limited number of <b>sterile</b> <b>varieties</b> would be introduced that are easily distinguishable from conventional varieties...|$|R

40|$|Strategies {{to improve}} stem yield and juice quality in sweet sorghum were {{investigated}} in this study. Seed quality of sixty five accessions (landraces) from Botswana was investigated. Standard germination tests revealed that only 66 % of the accessions had germination percentages {{in excess of}} 85 %. The Accelerated Ageing test showed that only 50 %of the 26 accessions had germination percentages above 80 %. The results indicated that Botswana sweet sorghum seed quality is generally poor. Seed development and maturity observations demonstrated that maximum seed quality occurred 14 to 17 days after mass maturity (physiological maturity) and this coincided with maximum seed germination. These results suggest that harvesting sweet sorghum seed prior to mass maturity can lower seed quality. Farmers should, therefore be advised to select plants intended for seed harvesting {{and allow them to}} mature properly before the seeds are harvested. Differences in seed colour, shape and compactness of the inflorescences were observed amongst the 65 landraces collected from farmers in Botswana. Ten landraces were characterised and from the results it was evident that there was a range of genetic diversity which can be utilized in the improvement of the crop. Large panicles were characteristic of most sweet sorghum landraces, the effect of tiller, panicle and floret removal on juice quality was consequently studied. Removal of panicles and florets significantly improved juice quality whilst removal of tillers did not. Selection and breeding of genotypes with small panicles and male <b>sterile</b> <b>varieties</b> may improve juice quality and should be investigated. Effect of planting date, spacing and nitrogen were investigated. Early planting (October) resulted in increased stem yields but reduced juice quality. A 30 cm intra-row spacing resulted in high stem yields per plant and good juice quality. Nitrogen fertilisation increased stem yield and improved juice quality. On the bases of the results obtained from this study, early planting (October), application of 60 kg N ha-¹, and 30 cm intra-row spacing could be recommended for sweet sorghum production in pure stands. In pure stands yields of more than 37 000 stems (per hectare) of good quality can be attained. These could be sold at an estimated price of P 2. 00 (R 2. 25) per stem indicating the potential of sweet sorghum as a cash crop. However, its economic viability depends on the price elasticity in the supply - demand function. Dissertation (PHD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2003.

40|$|Introduction: Before a new {{vineyard}} construction, {{in addition}} to collecting detailed data on climate, soil and planting area, some other considerations like selection and understanding the principles of quality and quantity in terms of agronomic traits and physiological characteristics of the product should be made. Among grape varieties grown in anorchard, some self-fertile and male sterile cultivars (female physiological) are present. Without suitable pollinating, varieties in the vineyard, is not accessible for semi-fertile or sterile ones with high quality and quantity and will notbe sufficient. Therefore the identification of <b>sterile</b> <b>varieties,</b> the best pollinizers and fruit growth and phenological stages is essential. Qzlouzum is one of commercial seeded cultivars in West Azerbaijan province whichis suitable for storage and delivering to domestic and foreign markets forout of season because of nice red color and thick skin and late ripening. These favorable properties for sale with high prices {{is also one of}} the otherbenefits that have led to the interest of the farmers every year to increase the acreage of the cultivation. Preliminary studies showed that Qzlouzum cultivar is a physiological female and needs cross pollination for fruitset. This study aimed to investigate the complete botanical characteristics, flower sexuality, pollen germination and determine the phenological stages (especially fruit growth stages). Materials and methods: Based on grape descriptor, morphological characters of 10 vines of Qzlouzum grape cultivar at different stages from bud break to dormancy was studied in Horticultural Research Station in 1390 in Urmia(Kahriz). To calculate the growing degree days (GDD), daily temperature above 10 ° C was obtained from the meteorological station of Agriculture faculty in Kahriz-Urmia. Pollen germination rate was tested in both liquid and solid growth medium. In order to study the changes in a number of qualitative and quantitative traits, TSS (total soluble solids), TA (titrable acidity), pH, berry weight and diameter, seed length and weight from the beginning of the berry formation to harvest time of clusters in 15 -day interval were measured. Results and discussion: The results of this study showed that flowers of Qzlouzum are female with reflexed stamens. The results also determined that none of pollens germinated on both liquid and solid media culture. Based on reflexed stamens and none pollen germination, Qzlouzum grape cultivar proves to be male sterile (physiological substance). This cultivar needs 1483 degree days (above 10 °C) from bud break till ripening. The changes in TA and TSS were reversed. Amount of acid reduced and sugar content increased with time and berry development. Veraision period was approximately started 55 days after full bloom. At this stage, which is also known as berry softening, acid concentration is reduced and the amount of sugar was increased. Acid content and pH of the fruit were opposite together and by reducing the amount of acid, the pH levels increased. Several studies have confirmed that after changing the color of the grape varieties,sugar can often increase. Conversely, acid reduction in berries is the first happensbefore color change in berries. The berry weight and size changes were described as Double Sigmoid Curve. In the first phase, berry diameter and weight increased rapidly and lasted 60 days. In the second phase or delay phase, berry weight and diameter changedvery slowly while seed weight reached themaximum in this stage. After this phase, the third phase which was associated began with veraision, sugar content increased and the amount of aciddecreased. At this stage berry reached its maximum size and weight. Conclusion: Uniform planting of Qzlouzum red grapes is not recommended because of male sterility and suitable pollinizers should be used. Male sterility, without emasculation will be suitable for grape breeding programs. In areas with short growing season, if the total heat has not beensupplied, berries of this cultivar will ripe late and sugar contentand color intensity will decrease and will notproducedesired and marketable product. Phenological stages duration is highlydependent on factors such as cultivar, environment and location. Genetic factor also isparticularly important in determining the time of ripening. Qzlouzum is a late ripening grape cultivar and without sufficient thermal requirements, the ripening process will not occur completely...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Edible bananas {{originated}} {{mainly from}} two wild species, Musa acuminata Colla (AA) and Musa balbisiana Colla (BB), and triploid cultivars with an AAA, AAB or ABB genome {{are the most}} widely used. In the present study, chromosome pairing affinities are investigated in a <b>sterile</b> AB Indian <b>variety</b> and in its fertile colchicine-induced allotetraploid (AABB) derivative to determine the inheritance pattern of the tetraploid genotype. The potential implications of interspecific recombination and chromosomal composition of diploid gametes for Musa improvement are presented. Methods The pairing of different chromosome sets at diploid and tetraploid levels was investigated {{through a combination of}} conventional cytogenetic and genomic in-situ hybridization (GISH) analyses of meiotic chromosomes, leading to a likelihood model of the pairing behaviour. GISH analysis of mitotic chromosomes was also conducted to reveal the chromosome constitution of hybrids derived from crosses involving the allotetraploid genotype. Key Results Analysis of chromosome associations at both ploidy levels suggested that the newly formed allotetraploid behaves as a 'segmental allotetraploid' with three chromosome sets in a tetrasomic pattern, three sets in a likely disomic pattern and the five remaining sets in an intermediate pattern. Balanced and unbalanced diploid gametes were detected in progenies, with the chromosome constitution appearing to be more homogenous in pollen than in ovules. Conclusions Colchicine-induced allotetraploids in Musa provide access to the genetic background of natural AB varieties. The segmental inheritance pattern exhibited by the AABB allotetraploid genotype implies chromosome exchanges between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana species and opens new horizons for reciprocal transfer of valuable alleles.

Crosses were attempted among fourteen genotypes, three each of B. nigra, B. campestris, B. juncea, B. napus {{and two of}} B. carinata. Sum of 2645, 4823 and 1544 pollinations were made at the amphidiploid-amphidiploid, amphidiploid-diploid and diploid-diploid levels, respectively. The crossibility was very high at amphidiploid- amphidiploid ploidy level. Brassica napus and B. juncea among the species and B. juncea X B. napus among the combinations/direction of cross proved highly crossible. Brassica juncea crossed freely with Brassica napus and B. campestris, and fairly with B. carinata and B. nigra. Brassica napus neither proved as a good seed parent or as a good pollinator with B. carinata. None out of 267 pollinations attempted In 6 combinations of B. campestris x B. carinata produced any hybrid seed. Hence Brassica juncea among the species and Jun 9 among its genotypes proved the highly crossible {{and can be used}} as bridge for genetic transgression across the genomes. The cross-compatibility at every level demonstrated the monophyletic origin of Brassica species. The highly crossible amphidiploids however determine their relative phylogenetic closeness as compared to the diploids. Chromosomally B. campestris (2 N) proved as ideal diploids with 1 / 1 synapsis and 1 - 1 disjunction. Neither any secondary association nor any B chromosomes was observed in its PMC's, at Ml. Autoploidy was induced through applying 0. 02 70 aqueous colchicine to the seedlings of Brassica campestris and it was concluded that, its 6 hours treatment is threshold for colchiploidy induction in Brassica. In autotetraploids however, the chromosomes were oriented into asyndetics, one or two-chiasmatic bivalents, trivalents and quadrivalents. The anomalous chromosomal behavior predicts the imbalance chromosomal disjunction; resulting into viable aberrant gametes the union of such gametes could give rise to individuals, with a variety of genome constitutions. Meiotic analysis of autotetraploids that, autoploidy and the union of their aberrant gametes has probably {{played an important role in}} the evolution of the present Brassica species. Meiotic analysis in 8 digenomic triploids, 4 each containing genomes AAC and AAB, and 3 trigenomic haploids containing genomes ABC revealed univalent, bivalent and multivalent chromosomal configurations of various orientations. Variation in pollen fertility was so evident even within a plant and tetrads ranging from all the fertile to all the <b>sterile</b> gametocytes with <b>variety</b> of all the possible intermediates were available. Though variation among chromosomal association was present at the combinations and association levels uniformity in the frequency of the synaptic and asynaptic chromosomes was uniforl 1 l i. e. 70 and 30 percent respectively either in the case of digenomic triploids or trigenomic haploids. Ml associations both in digenomic triploids or trigenomic haploids showed that, no one among the genomes B or C had got any genetic factor for suppressing the homoeologous pairing among genomes A, from various sources. Besides autosyndesis among the genomes A, allosyndesis was also evident among the genomes A, C and B from the same or different sources, respectively. Furthermore meiotic regularity was higher in the digenomic triploids ABA and ACA as compared to the trigenomic haploids ABC. The studies also concluded that, whatsoever the source or origin of genome A was, it has retained chromosomal homology resulting frequently into the autosyndetic bivalents in the digenomic triploids...|$|R
