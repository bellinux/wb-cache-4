5|$|The 400-series {{highways}} are {{a network}} of controlled-access highways throughout the southern portion of the Canadian province of Ontario, forming a special <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provincial highway system. They are analogous to the Interstate Highway System in the United States or the Autoroute system of neighbouring Quebec, but under provincial jurisdiction and regulated by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). Although Ontario had been constructing divided highways for two decades prior, 400-series designations were introduced in 1952. Initially only Highways400, 401 and 402 were numbered; other designations followed in the subsequent decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{convergence}} of both series has very different properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not {{coincide with the}} function; but if the function is analytic then the series converges pointwise to the function, and uniformly on every compact <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the function is square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if the function is periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform).|$|E

Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were a <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Benedictine Order and thus the cathedral chapter at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, would have had no objections to him on that score. Foliot denied that he ever lobbied for the office, but John of Salisbury and Thomas Becket apparently believed that Foliot desired it.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E

5|$|Green-head ant {{workers are}} gamergates, meaning they can {{reproduce}} with winged males. With workers {{taking over the}} reproductive role, queens are relatively insignificant and are rarely produced in colonies. Nuptial flight begins in spring, with males mating {{with one or two}} females. Queens that establish their own colonies are semi-claustral, going out and forage to support their young. Another way colonies are formed is through budding, where a <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony leaves the main colony for an alternative nest site. The green-head ant is known for its painful and venomous sting that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. However, they can also be beneficial to humans, acting as a form of pest control by preying on agricultural pests such as beetles, moths and termites.|$|E
