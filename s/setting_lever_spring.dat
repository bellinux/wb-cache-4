5000|$|The L.R.5 {{emerged in}} 1945 as a single-engined, wooden, low-wing {{monoplane}} with a fixed tricycle undercarriage, {{powered by a}} [...] Blackburn Cirrus Minor 4-cylinder, air-cooled, inverted, in-line piston aircraft engine. The spacious side-by-side configuration cockpit was covered by a large plexiglas canopy with car-type entry doors on both sides. The undercarriage included <b>levered</b> <b>sprung</b> main legs and a steerable nosewheel.|$|R

This kind of machine included the Original Odhner, Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although {{most of these}} were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the <b>setting</b> <b>lever</b> positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring scale}} {{measures}} weight by reporting {{the distance that}} a spring deflects under a load. This contrasts to a balance, which compares the torque on the arm due to a sample weight to the torque on the arm due to a standard reference weight using a horizontal <b>lever.</b> <b>Spring</b> scales measure force, which is the tension force of constraint acting on an object, opposing the local force of gravity. They are usually calibrated so that measured force translates to mass at earth's gravity. The object to be weighed can be simply hung from the spring or set on a pivot and bearing platform.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a {{water-cooled}} twin-cylinder of 1800 cc enlarged to 1995 cc on later cars, with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves, {{and based on}} the original Royce engine but with an improved crankshaft. The power output was [...] at 1000 rpm. The car has a top speed of 39 mph. There is a transmission brake fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake <b>lever.</b> <b>Springing</b> is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles. It is a small car with a wheelbase of 75 in and a track of 48 in.|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of 1857 model Waltham movements are keywind {{from the rear}} and keyset from the front. A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no reversing clutch on the winding stem, and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to set the time. Later stemwind movements were <b>lever</b> <b>setting,</b> with a unique design of <b>set</b> <b>lever</b> which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a reversing clutch, a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the winding stem located at 3:00.|$|R

40|$|Capacitive {{coupling}} is {{most commonly}} used in NEMS/MEMS or in Scanning Probe Techniques to either induce a displacement or to detect an external interaction applied to the micro/nanosystem. A parabolic elastic deformation of the sensor signs a capacitive interaction as the applied voltage is varied. In this paper, we present detailed force measurements performed in the submicron range with a picoNewton sensitivity, and using a UHV AFM and a silicon microlever equipped with a metallized microsphere,. A complete treatment of the sensor sphere/plane geometry enables one to detect quantitatively a V 4 departure from the parabolic behaviour. This shows that using this setup allows to detect the increased deformation of a lever much before the mechanical instability. More importantly, this effect must be carefully taken into account if sphere/plane absolute separations are to be quantitatively measured {{on the basis of}} electrostatic calibration. To our knowledge, this behaviour in AFM is reported for the first time. We believe that it is relevant for the description of NEMS/MEMS behaviour. Moreover, it provides a method to accurately measure the <b>lever</b> <b>spring</b> constant without any direct contact...|$|R
5000|$|About 1,000 of the [...] "Rocketeer" [...] model pistols were produced; a few saw {{service in}} the Vietnam War, and were {{featured}} in the James Bond book, and movie, You Only Live Twice, the Matt Helm film Murderers' Row {{as well as one}} of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. novels The Monster Wheel Affair. At about the same general size as the Colt M1911, the Gyrojet was considerably lighter at only 22 ounces (625 g) as the structure was mostly made of Zamac, a zinc alloy. The weapon was cocked by sliding forward a lever above the trigger to pull a round into the gun; the <b>lever</b> <b>sprang</b> back when the trigger was pulled. The lever hit the bullet on the nose, driving it into the firing pin. As the round left the chamber, it pulled the lever forward again to recock it. The pistol lacked a removable magazine; rounds had to be pushed down from the open [...] "bolt" [...] and then held in place by quickly sliding a cover over them {{on the top of the}} gun. Reloading quickly was impossible.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the researched changeover from Operational Excellence (OE) {{to the new}} path of Operations Excellence (OsE). Operational Excellence (OE) predominantly deals with the efficiency (productivity), effectiveness (customer/market orientation) and optimization of production processes. In comparison, Operations Excellence (OsE) enlarges that perspective to see operations as <b>setting</b> <b>lever</b> by providing enablers as a central role for operational long-term success. The assessment of required against existing setting of enabler criteria in an organization (e. g., high performance culture, methods and instruments, employee empowerment, etc.) supports to become a plant's future health foreseeable and to identify its capability to achieve sustainability and excellence in terms of operations. To support a methodical integration of Operations Excellence in organizations, an OsE assessment framework has been developed within the applied research project “IMFT”.

40|$|New {{technology}} in the automotive industry {{is the key to}} success. Therefore, it is appreciated when people come with new design ways to solve problems. This leads to innovation in the automotive industry that will lead to better and more environmentally friendly cars. This report presents a concept on a pushing counter <b>lever</b> <b>spring</b> which provides the same characteristics of force curve as a diaphragm spring in a pressure plate of a car has. The mechanism is to be used for long-term testing and evaluating clutch pedals. The work describes the development process and the manufacture of a prototype. The program Creo (CAD / 3 D) is largely used to construct the components. As are the subprograms Mechanism Design and Simulate to simulate the movement and loads. Excel is a great help at the theoretical calculation of the mechanism and to evaluate the theory behind the concept. The result shows how to simulate a diaphragm spring in the pressure plate in a car for long-term testing of clutch pedals. The goal is to accurately mimic the force curve of a diaphragm spring, in order to design better pedals, and thus reduce the weight on the pedals to in turn reduce fuel consumption to protect the environment {{is one of the most}} important factors of all in the automotive industry...|$|R

50|$|The lever tumbler lock, {{which uses}} a <b>set</b> of <b>levers</b> to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting lever lock {{required}} the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still currently used today.|$|R
50|$|Tipping {{points with}} a very small {{separation}} distance between equilibrium states are used in microswitches.
