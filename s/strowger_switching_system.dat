50|$|The Director {{telephone}} system was a {{development of the}} <b>Strowger</b> step-by-step (SXS) <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> used in London and five other large cities in the UK from the 1920s to the 1960s. A large proportion (ca. 70% to 80%) of telephone traffic in large metropolitan areas is outgoing traffic, and it is distributed over many exchanges. A non-Director SXS exchange system is not suitable for these areas.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, 5th Signal Command {{embarked}} upon wide-ranging upgrades of {{its strategic}} communications equipment in Europe. The Hitler-era Reichspost 40 <b>Strowger</b> <b>switches</b> {{were replaced by}} KN-101 electronic <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> manufactured by Siemens. Likewise, record (message) traffic centers were upgraded with more powerful computer hardware and the Army's microwave backbone network in Europe was modernized with digital radio equipment, and in certain locations, concrete radio towers.|$|R
50|$|In a uniselector, the {{stepping}} switch steps only on one axis, {{although there are}} often several sets of contacts in parallel. In other types, such as the <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch,</b> mechanical switching occurs on two directions, across a grid of contacts. The <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> is {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} electromechanical stepping <b>switch</b> telephone exchange <b>system.</b> It {{was developed by the}} Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company founded in 1891 by Almon Brown Strowger. Because of its operational characteristics it is also known as a step-by-step (SXS) switch.|$|R

50|$|Historically, in {{telephone}} switches, {{connections between}} callers were arranged with large, expensive banks of electromechanical relays, <b>Strowger</b> <b>switches.</b> The basic mathematical property of <b>Strowger</b> <b>switches</b> {{is that for}} each input to the switch, there is exactly one output. Much of the mathematical switching circuit theory attempts to use this property to reduce {{the total number of}} switches needed to connect a combination of inputs to a combination of outputs.|$|R
50|$|Almon Brown Strowger (February 11, 1839 - May 26, 1902) was an American {{inventor}} {{who gave}} {{his name to}} the <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch,</b> an electromechanical telephone exchange technology that his invention and patent inspired.|$|R
25|$|Early exchanges were {{electromechanical}} systems using motors, shaft drives, rotating {{switches and}} relays. Some types of automatic exchanges were the <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> or step-by-step switch, All Relay, X-Y, panel switch and the crossbar switch.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of local line capacity on the existing crossbar exchange, which itself had replaced the relay and <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> exchanges and a modern digital System/X switch was installed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> {{has three}} banks of contacts. Toward {{the upper end}} of each shaft are two ratchets. The upper one has ten grooves, and raises the shaft. The lower one has long {{vertical}} teeth (on the other side, hidden).|$|R
50|$|From 1912, the British General Post Office, {{which also}} {{operated}} the British telephone system, installed several automatic telephone exchanges from several vendors in trials at Darlington on 10 October 1914 (rotary system), Fleetwood (relay exchange from Sweden), Grimsby (Siemens), Hereford (Lorimer) and Leeds (Strowger). The BPO selected the <b>Strowger</b> <b>switches</b> for small and medium cities and towns. However, {{the selection of}} <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> for London and other large cities was not decided until the 1920s, when the Director telephone system was adopted. The Director <b>systems</b> used SXS <b>switches</b> for destination routing and number translation facilities similar to the register used in common-control exchanges. Using similar equipment as {{in the rest of}} the network was deemed beneficial and the equipment could be manufactured in Britain.|$|R
50|$|Only a {{few hundred}} {{telephone}} lines attach to each remote concentrator. In North America concentrators are located in a serving area interface (SAI) or other enclosure in each neighborhood. In Europe the buildings which once contained local <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> telephone exchanges are now usually empty except for a remote concentrator.|$|R
50|$|The Manhattan and Bronx {{parts of}} the {{underground}} empire are owned by the Empire City Subway Company subsidiary. Similar construction, on a smaller scale, went on in Brooklyn, Buffalo and other urban areas. Suburban and rural service also expanded, mostly with aerial cable or open wire plant and <b>Strowger</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Exchanges {{based on}} the <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> were {{eventually}} challenged by other exchange types and later by crossbar technology. These exchange designs promised faster switching and would accept pulses faster than the Strowger's typical 10 pps—typically about 20 pps. At a later date many also accepted DTMF [...] "touch tones" [...] or other tone signaling systems.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{people use}} metonymy {{to call a}} variety of devices [...] "switches" [...] that conceptually connect or {{disconnect}} signals and communication paths between electrical devices, analogous to the way mechanical switches connect and disconnect paths for electrons to flow between two conductors. Early telephone systems used an automatically operated <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> to connect telephone callers; telephone exchanges contain one or more crossbar switches today.|$|R
5000|$|Because the UK network as {{run by the}} Post Office was {{reliant on}} <b>Strowger</b> <b>switches,</b> the {{techniques}} used in the UK were different. The exchanges worked on pulses received from each subscriber's phone, so tone signaling was of no use. The techniques primarily relied on the quirks of the exchange wiring, or facilities put in by the engineering staff. Some typical tricks used between the 1950s and 1970s included: ...|$|R
5000|$|In current American terminology, switch {{frequently}} {{refers to}} a system which is also called telephone exchange, the usual term in English, which is a large collection of selectors of some sort within a building. For most of the twentieth century the terms <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> and crossbar switch referred to an individual piece of mechanical equipment making up part of an exchange. Hence the pictures above show a [...] "crossbar switch" [...] using the earlier meaning.|$|R
5000|$|The {{commercial}} {{version of}} the <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch,</b> as developed by the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company, used a rotary dial for signalling to the exchange. The original final selector (connector) switch which connected to 100 customers was supplemented by preceding group selector stages, as the [...] "cascading" [...] enabled connection to many more customers, and to customers at other exchanges. Another requirement for commercial systems was a circuit to detect a busy connection (line) and return a busy signal to the calling subscriber.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{fundamental}} Bell {{patent for}} telephones expired on 30 January 1894, which {{provided an opportunity}} for independent companies to provide telephone services, although some had been established before that date. The Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange company had been formed on 30 October 1891. The first <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> went into operation on 3 November 1892 in LaPorte, Indiana, with 75 subscribers and capacity for 99. Independent manufacturing companies were established, such as Stromberg-Carlson in 1894 and Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company in 1897.|$|R
50|$|Relays {{originated}} with telegraphy as electromechanical devices used to regenerate telegraph signals. In 1885, Michael Pupin at Columbia University taught mathematical physics and electromechanics until 1931. The <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch,</b> the Panel switch, and similar ones were {{widely used in}} early automated telephone exchanges. Crossbar switches were first widely installed in the middle 20th century in Sweden, the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, and these quickly spread {{to the rest of}} the world - especially to Japan. The electromechanical television systems of the late 19th century were less successful.|$|R
50|$|Slightly more {{complicated}} was the two axis stepping <b>switch,</b> (also called <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> or two motion selector in Britain). Typically, a single compact group of wipers could connect {{to one of}} 100 (or 200) different fixed contacts, in ten levels. When the switch was idle, the wipers were disengaged from the fixed contacts. The wipers moved {{up and down on}} a vertical shaft, and rotated into the contact bank to make a connection. A spring, internal to the vertical shaft, returned the wipers to their home position at the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|In the New Zealand Post Office, which {{provided}} telephone service {{prior to the}} formation of Telecom New Zealand in 1987, [...] "Mechanician" [...] was a job classification for workers who serviced telephone exchange switching equipment. The term seems to have originated in the era of the 7A Rotary system exchange, and was superseded by [...] "Technician" [...] circa 1975, perhaps because [...] "Mechanician" [...] was no longer considered appropriate after the first 2000 type Step-byStep <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> exchanges began to be introduced in 1952 (in Auckland, at Birkenhead exchange).|$|R
25|$|The Panel switch {{was named}} for its tall panels covered with 500 rows of terminals. Each panel had an {{electric}} motor to drive usually sixty selectors by electromagnetically controlled clutches. The selector was similar in effect to a stepping switch though it moved continuously over the contacts. Each selector had five brushes, each of which could select from 100 terminals arranged in groups. Pulses were sent {{in the opposite direction}} than in the preexisting <b>Strowger</b> <b>switches,</b> i.e. from the selector to the register which had received the dialed digits from the caller, a signaling method that became known as revertive pulsing.|$|R
50|$|The {{precious}} metals {{division of the}} company always generated the most sales for Heraeus. When the price of gold, silver and platinum rose sharply in the 1930s, Heraeus also turned to platinum group metals such as palladium, rhodium and ruthenium. The development of the precious metal <b>strowger</b> <b>switch</b> and high-speed contact opened the market to Heraeus in 1950 to sell large volumes of contact rivets and springs. This laid the foundations {{for the company to}} enter markets such as telecommunications, microelectronics and computing.W. C. Heraeus was split up in 2010 to form Heraeus Precious Metals and Heraeus Materials Technology.|$|R
25|$|A {{characteristic}} of {{electromechanical switching equipment}} is that the maintenance staff could hear the mechanical clattering of <b>Strowgers,</b> panel <b>switches</b> or crossbar relays. Most Bell System central offices were housed in reinforced concrete buildings with concrete ceilings and floors.|$|R
25|$|In {{electrical}} controls, {{a stepping}} switch, {{also known as}} a stepping relay, is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection to be connected to {{one of a number of}} possible output connections, under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for these devices was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch).</b> As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.|$|R
5000|$|XY, a [...] "flat motion" [...] switch logically {{similar to}} <b>Strowger</b> <b>switching.</b> The [...] "XY Selector" [...] was not invented by SC, but {{licensed}} from L.M. Ericsson of Sweden {{in the late}} 40's and re-engineered for U.S. switching applications (Ericsson used it for PABX and a very small Rural Exchange application). XY was very popular with REA (RURAL ELECTRIFICATION ADMINISTRATION) funded independent telephone companies and out sold all other vendors in the less than 1000 line applications in the 50's. The largest XY ever in service was installed in Anchorage, AK by RCA Corporation for the U.S. Air Force. Later purchased by Anchorage Telephone Co, it eventually grew to over 10,000 lines.|$|R
40|$|The digital voice/data PBX {{is finally}} {{reaching}} it 2 ̆ 7 s anticipated potential {{and becoming a}} major factor when considering the total communications picture for many businesses today. The digital PBX {{has always been the}} choice for voice communications but has lagged behind the LAN industry when it comes to data transfers. The pendulum has begun to swing with the enhanced data capabilities of third and fourth generation PBXs. The battle for the total communication market is quite fierce between the LAN and PBX vendors now. This research thesis looks at the history, evolution, and architecture of voice/data PBXs. It traces development of PBXs through the present fourth generation architectures. From the first manual switches introduced in the late 18002 ̆ 7 s through the <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch,</b> step-by-step switching, stored program control, common control, digital switches, dual bus architectures, and finally what is anticipated in the future. A detailed description of of the new fourth generation dual bus architectures is presented. Lastly, speculations on the future direction PBX architectures will take is explored. A description of the mechanics of a possible Wave Division PBX is presented based on a fiber optic transport system...|$|R
50|$|The {{switching}} in TXE2s {{was carried}} out by reed relays and a typical TXE2 contained about 100,000 reeds. A 'reed' was actually two over-lapping ferromagnetic blades hermetically sealed within an inert-gas-filled glass capsule. The blades were gold-plated and separated by just a few thousandths of an inch. The reeds were fast in operation (about 1 millisecond), with a life expectancy of more than 10 million operations. The glass capsules were about an inch (25 mm) in length and about an eighth of an inch (3 mm) in diameter. Four reeds were generally present inside each relay coil, two for the speech-path, one for holding the path and one for metering. Switching with these reeds held out the prospect of much greater reliability compared with the <b>Strowger</b> <b>system,</b> where <b>switching</b> {{was carried out}} by base metal wipers moving through banks of metal contacts. The <b>Strowger</b> <b>switches</b> required routines to be carried out on them to clean the banks: they also required oiling and occasional adjustment. Reed relays required none of this. However, in practice, and particularly {{in the early years of}} the system's service, the performance of the reeds proved to be less good than had been expected.|$|R

50|$|Jersey's first {{automatic}} Strowger {{exchange a}} GEC SE50 Type (otherwise the GPO 4000 Type) was finally brought into operation on 1 November 1959 with {{a capacity for}} 9,000 lines. The new automatic exchange absorbed Millbrook exchange on 30 March 1960. Automated information services were introduced in 1960 providing subscribers with Mail Boat arrival data and a Daily Diary service, a Speaking clock service was introduced in 1964 using a system provided by Ericsson of Beeston. Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) was introduced in Jersey in 1966 which meant that most UK calls could now be dialled direct {{instead of having to}} go through an operator. The same year South exchange was converted to automatic working with a further GEC supplied <b>Strowger</b> <b>switch</b> fitted with GEC proprietary dust proofing, an 'improvement' later abandoned as unsuccessful. Between 1968 and 1969 public telephone kiosks were converted to the GPO pay on answer (POA) phone box type to enable STD.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We discuss {{stability}} of a loop {{consisting of two}} asynchronous <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> in which the first <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> influences the input and the switching signal of the second <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> and the second <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> affects the first <b>switched</b> <b>system’s</b> jump map. We show that when the first <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has a small dwell-time and is switching slowly {{in the spirit of}} average dwell-time switching, all the states of the closed loop are bounded.
