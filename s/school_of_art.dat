5|$|Scotland has had {{schools of}} art since the eighteenth century. The Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh had been founded in Edinburgh in 1760. It became the Trustees' <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art,</b> and placed under {{auspices of the}} Science and Art Department in South Kensington in 1858. It {{was taken over by}} the Scottish Education Department in 1907. Glasgow <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> grew from the city's School of Design, founded in 1845.

50|$|The <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> was {{constructed}} in masonry, a rarity amongst <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> buildings at this period. Bundaberg <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> and Maryborough <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> were the only other centres with comparable buildings. As Rockhampton was proposed to be {{the capital of the}} new state of Central Queensland, its new <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> would have to reflect the aspirations of its citizens. At a cost of £5,578 the Rockhampton <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> building would be the most expensive in the colony.|$|R
50|$|Memorial <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> form a {{distinct}} sub-group of utilitarian war memorials, separate from memorial halls, {{in that they}} combine the educational mission <b>of</b> the <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> movement with the utilitarian war memorial movement. Although they usually included a hall, they also included the library and reading room found in a typical <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> building. The first memorial <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> in Queensland opened at Bald Hills (August 1920) and Caboolture (September 1920). Other early memorial <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> include Wooroolin (1921); and Kumbia, Elimbah and Woody Point, (all 1922). Some memorial <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> were established in pre-WWI halls or <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> buildings, such as at Cooran and Cooroy (both 1926), and Southport (1939). The majority of identified Queensland memorial <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> buildings were <b>of</b> timber construction, but some used brick or concrete, including Wooroolin, Clayfield (1925), Morningside (1926), Innisfail (1930), and Pittsworth (1930). Demolished memorial <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> include Caboolture, Southport, Banyo (1925), Clifton (1926), Goodna (1927), Kedron (1928), and Bulimba (built by 1938).|$|R
50|$|On June 18, 1961, Republic Act No. 3409 {{was passed}} into law {{creating}} the Southern Samar National <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> and Trades.

On May 18, 1992, Southern Samar National <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> and Trades was elevated into a college and renamed as Southern Samar National <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> and Trades.|$|R

5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art,</b> {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art,</b> as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art,</b> Laura met {{one of the most promising}} students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Scottish art in {{the nineteenth}} century is the body of visual art made in Scotland, by Scots, or about {{scottish}} subjects. This period saw the increasing professionalisation and organisation of art in Scotland. Major institutions founded in this period included the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, the Royal Scottish Academy of Art, the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the Glasgow Institute. Art education in Edinburgh focused on the Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh. Glasgow <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> was founded in 1845 and Grays <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> in Aberdeen in 1885.|$|E

5000|$|As {{towns and}} districts were settled, local {{committees}} were formed {{to establish a}} <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> with the aim to [...] "promote moral, social and intellectual growth for the community". <b>Schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> established in rural districts often served a wider community purpose than those established in urban areas. Whereas every <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> established a library {{as part of their}} charter, the rural <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> was likely to serve an equally important function as a public hall and as a focus for district identity. To 1880, only 26 <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> had been established in Queensland towns, although the government encouraged the construction <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> by subsidising local fund-raising efforts. The movement grew rapidly during the 1880s and 1890s; so that by federation almost every town and settlement in the colony included a <b>school</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts,</b> or at least a reading room.|$|R
5|$|A {{final element}} in {{creating}} and sustaining the Athens musical culture was the University of Georgia Lamar Dodd <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art.</b> The {{great majority of}} Athens' musicians and their fan base {{were associated with the}} University's liberal arts curriculum, and the <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art,</b> rather than the music department, was the area where the creative and musical alliances that later defined the scene began forming in the 1970s. Michael Stipe of R.E.M. was an art major (although he did not graduate), and the Art School incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe, founding member and drummer for Pylon. The cinematographer for the documentary film Athens GA: Inside/Out was Jim Herbert, an art school professor. Herbert went on to direct music videos for a number of Athens bands, including 14 for R.E.M.|$|E

50|$|Although Maryborough was proclaimed a {{municipality}} (the Borough of Maryborough) in October 1861 it was {{not until}} 1874 that the town acquired a Town Hall which was constructed beside the first <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts.</b> In 1884 a Maryborough <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> Land Sale Act (1884) was passed to enable the trustees <b>of</b> the <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> to sell a portion of their grant to finance the construction <b>of</b> a new <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts.</b> As early as 1885 sections of the allotment were sold with the largest section retained as the site <b>of</b> the new <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> {{was built}} in Mount Morgan in 1889 and opened on 11 September 1891. It was {{destroyed}} by fire.

A special meeting <b>of</b> the <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> Committee {{was held in the}} Commonwealth Bank on 26 April 1923 to discuss the erection of another building.
