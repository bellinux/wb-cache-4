Carbapenemases are divided into different classes, depending on the structure of the enzyme and the mechanism by which they hydrolyze the β-lactam ring. The two broad categories of carbapenemases are serine-carbopenemases, which contain serine at the active site, and metallocarbapenemases, which contain zinc at the active <b>site.</b> <b>Class</b> A carbapenemases are serine carbapenemases and are encoded on either the chromosome of the bacteria or a plasmid. A serine at position 70 at the active site of this class of enzymes is required for hydrolysis of β-lactams to occur. Class D carbapenemases, also referred to as the OXA β-lactamases, are serine β-lactamases. They are encoded on plasmids and contain a large variability in amino acid sequence. The resistance mechanism for class D carbapenemases is caused by the formation of an acyl intermediate when breaking the β-lactam ring. Class B carbapenemases are metallolactamases and require a zinc at the active site for hydrolysis.|$|E

The resulting map {{is being used}} in RiskScape; a tool for comparing risks at a given site {{from a variety of}} hazards by estimating potential losses. A GIS-based geological map with national coverage has been compiled from several sources, and is used as the base data. Geological maps at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 from the QMAP project covering New Zealand have been used where available supplemented with detailed geological maps at scales ranging from 1 : 25, 000 to 1 : 50, 000 for the larger urban areas. The gaps have been filled by the 1 : 1, 000, 000 ‘Geological Map of New Zealand’. Every geological polygon in the composite geological map has been assigned one of the ground shaking amplification classes from NZS 1170. 5 to produce the product map. The classes conform to the <b>site</b> <b>class</b> definitions in NZS 1170. 5, which describes five classes with respect to ground shaking amplification. Assignment of these classes was straightforward for rock sites but more involved for soils where, for example, at boundaries between weak rock and deep soil sites a buffer zone of shallow soil was applied. The product map was checked by comparing it against 687 sites in a database of accelerograph locations where the ground class had been determined from site specific information. Currently, for 72 % of the sites the NZS 1170. 5 <b>site</b> <b>class</b> is the same for both the site specific data and the <b>site</b> <b>class</b> assigned to the geological polygon. ...|$|E

In forest inventory programs, site index is {{used in conjunction with}} other forest inventory attributes (i. e., height, age) for the estimation of stand volume.

In this research, we explore the implications and consequences of different estimates of site index on carbon stock characterization for a 2, 500 -ha Douglas-fir-dominated landscape located on Eastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We compared site index estimates from an existing forest inventory to estimates generated from a combination of forest inventory and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) -derived attributes and then examined the resultant differences in biomass estimates generated from a carbon budget model (Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS 3)). Significant {{differences were found between the}} original and LIDAR-derived site indices for all species types and for the resulting 5 -m site classes (p < 0. 001).

The data set includes {{a very large number of}} strong ground-motion records up to the 2003 Off Tokach main and aftershocks. <b>Site</b> <b>class</b> terms, instead of individual site correction terms, are used. The site classes of recording stations are from a recent study on site classification for strong-motion recording stations in Japan according to a classification scheme that has been used in Japanese engineering design. The use of <b>site</b> <b>class</b> terms enables tectonic source-type effects to be identified and accounted for in the present model. The effects of a faulting mechanism for crustal earthquakes also are accounted for. For crustal and interface earthquakes, a simple form of an attenuation model (with respect to distance) is able to capture the main strong-motion characteristics and achieves unbiased estimates. For subduction slab events, a simple distance modification factor is employed to achieve plausible and unbiased predictions. The effects of source depth, tectonic source type, and faulting mechanism of crustal earthquakes are significant. The need for magnitude- squared terms is evaluated, and the use of magnitude-squared terms reduces the interevent error further. 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{recorded}} {{strong motion}} data in Iran since 1994 {{till the end}} of 2002 are investigated in order to investigate the well recorded (high signal to noise ratio) accelerometric data, specially in the long period ranges. The records having low signal to noise ratio in the frequency range of less than 0. 3 Hz are excluded, and the rest of 100 records are processed and analyzed in this study. The site classification for these records is performed based on the receiver function method (estimating the H/V ratio for each of the recorded motions). According to this procedure, the number of the selected records were 46, 10, 16 and 28 for the <b>site</b> <b>classes</b> 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The frequency contents of most of the records show dominant amplitudes between frequencies 0. 2 and 10 Hz. The Fmax values are systematically greater for the vertical components comparing to the horizontal ones. This selected catalog of 100 accelerograms obtained from 15 earthquakes provides a basis for the good quality/recent strong motion records in Iran, having good quality low frequencies contents.

Within the critical range of short time periods, the variation in peak acceleration of design response spectra for various site classes is found non-uniform.
