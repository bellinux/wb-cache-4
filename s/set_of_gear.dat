50|$|The firebox {{had a short}} {{combustion}} chamber. The {{boiler barrel}} was telescopic and made up in three courses from 5/8 in, 11/16 in and 3/4 in thick plate respectively. The Walschaerts valve motion was operated by hand screw gear, with the reversing gear for one engine unit's <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> arranged to be raised while the other's was lowered for forward or reverse, thereby balancing each other.|$|E
50|$|V2 was {{completed}} with the Kestrel by autumn of 1937, and started company testing. Once again, the gear {{proved to be}} a problem. Blume immediately blamed all of the problems on Rethel, after noting that he was always skeptical of the design. He decided that the performance problems of having fixed gear would be offset by its lighter weight, and the Ar 80 then reverted to using a well-spatted and faired <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> similar to those used on their various biplane designs. Several months were lost in the conversion.|$|E

50|$|The {{most popular}} form found in {{automobiles}} is the hydraulic automatic transmission. Similar but larger devices {{are also used}} for heavy-duty commercial and industrial vehicles and equipment. This system uses a fluid coupling {{in place of a}} friction clutch, and accomplishes gear changes by hydraulically locking and unlocking a system of planetary gears. These systems have a defined <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ranges, often with a parking pawl that locks the output shaft of the transmission to keep the vehicle from rolling either forward or backward. Some machines with limited speed ranges or fixed engine speeds, such as some forklifts and lawn mowers, only use a torque converter to provide a variable gearing of the engine to the wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The gearbox of the middle-weight Kontio {{model was}} changed when the [...] Leyland O.375 engine was {{replaced}} by the [...] O.400 power unit in 1962. Despite being more powerful, the new engine reached maximum output only at a much higher engine speed, with maximum torque now achieved at 1600 rpm rather than 1100 rpm. The very different torque curve of the new engine required a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios, and the Kontio now received a six-speed gearbox in which the lower gears applied higher ratios than in the previously used five-speed box. The ratio of the top (now sixth) gear was approximately the same in both the old five speed and the new six speed transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|As soon as {{the course}} ended he {{collected}} a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> and headed north. Picking up a Metis guide, Billy Moore, they canoed up the Mattagami River to the Porcupine area and started surveying the entire area. Although they noticed lots of gold, {{it was in the}} form of small flakes embedded in quartz, as opposed to the easily mined nuggets he was used to from the Klondike. This was far less impressive, but he nevertheless decided to return the next year, in 1907, with a larger team to make a more thorough sweep, this time digging into the quartz mounds that dotted the area. Although they were again successful in finding gold, no one in the party considered it worthwhile mining. Eventually they simply gave up, dumped their tools in one of their test pits, and headed south.|$|E

50|$|According to Engineering News-Record, “Each leaf {{is to be}} {{operated}} by two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> trains, consisting <b>of</b> four <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> reductions. Each gear train is connected to two 100-horsepower main operating motors, only {{one of which is}} to be used at a time. The time required for opening or closing the bridge against a 28 mph wind is stated to be 57.6 seconds, of which 10 seconds is for acceleration and 2.86 seconds for deceleration. The main operating racks are bolted to the underside of the outside trusses, the pitch radius being 20 ft. The operating pinion, with a pitch diameter of 40 in, is mounted on a shaft <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> train.|$|R

50|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.The machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain. A drainage mill uses another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or Archimedes' screw. Sawmills use a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes, including papermills, threshing mills, and to process oil seeds, wool, paints and stone products.|$|E

Testing performed at NASA Glenn Research Center have shown correlations between specific condition indicators and specific types of gear wear. To speed up the detection and analysis of gear teeth, an image detection program based on the Viola-Jones algorithm was trained to automatically detect spiral bevel gear wear pitting. The detector was tested using a training <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wear pictures and a blind <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wear pictures. The detector accuracy for the training set was 75 percent while the accuracy for the blind set was 15 percent. Further improvements on {{the accuracy of the}} detector are required but preliminary results have shown its ability to automatically detect gear tooth wear. The trained detector would be used to quickly evaluate a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> or pinion pictures for pits, spalls, or abrasive wear. The results could then be used to correlate with vibration or oil debris data. In general, the program could be retrained to detect features of interest from pictures of a component taken over a period of time...|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) system has {{worked its way}} to becoming a standard subsystem in most of the current automobiles as it has contributed much to the improvement of fuel economy, emissions, drivability and safety. Precision control of the subsystem, which consists of a dc motor driving a throttle plate, a pre-loaded return spring and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> train to regulate airflow into the engine, seems rather straightforward and yet complex. The difficulties lie in the unknown system parameters, hard nonlinearity of the pre-loaded spring that pulls the throttle plate to its default position, and friction, among others. In this paper, we extend our previous results obtained for the modeling, unknown system parameters identification and control of a commercially available Bosch’s DV-E 5 ETC system. Details of modeling and parameters identification based on laboratory experiments, data analysis, and knowledge of the system are provided. The parameters identification results were verified and validated by a real-time PID control implemented with an xPC Target. A nonlinear control design was then proposed utilizing the input-output feedback linearization approach and technique. In view of a recent massive auto recalls due to the controversial uncontrollable engine accelerations, the results of this paper may inspire further research interest on the drive-by-wire technology. </p...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{assessment}} of gear wheels {{is an important}} task for the automobile industry and suppliers. Various kinds of faults have to be detected: cracks, structural damage, tiny inclusions or any contamination of the raw material. We propose a pattern recognition approach of ultrasonic signals induced in the test objects which is capable of distinguishing between good and bad parts. A signature analysis device was built at Fraunhofer IZFP Dresden. It contains an ultrasonic actuator for excitation and two sensors for data acquisition. From every sensor signal a short-term power spectrum is calculated. In a training stage models are created for two classes (good and bad) from a classified training <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wheels. These models are evaluated against a disjoint test set. A correlation coefficient based classifier was used as baseline system. Its class models ("reference patterns") consist {{of a number of}} partial short-term power spectra which have to be selected manually. We compared this approach to a statistical classifier based on hidden MARKOV models which can be trained without any user input. We used a good class and measured the divergence of all test parts from the good class. The final decision on a test part is made by an threshold. Below this threshold a part is classified as good, above it as bad. Only the HMM classifier was able to classify all parts in our experiments correctly...|$|E
