I should have learned a lesson in that store. Barring a few discordant days when the orders came in too fast or when we were short handed because of sickness, it was a veritable hive of happiness; morning after morning clerks and porters arrived, pale, yet smiling, and laboured with cheerfulness from eight o'clock until six, and departed as cheerfully for modest homes in obscure neighbourhoods that seemed to me areas of exile. They were troubled with no visions of better things. When the travelling men {{came in from the}} [...] "road" [...] there was great hilarity. Important personages, these, looked up to by the city clerks; jolly, reckless, Elizabethan-like rovers, who had tasted of the wine of liberty--and of other wines with the ineradicable lust for the road in their blood. No more routine for Jimmy Bowles, who was king of them all. I shudder to think how much of my knowledge of life I owe to this Jimmy, whose stories would have filled a quarto volume, but could on no account have been published; for a self-respecting post-office would not have allowed them to pass through the mails. As it was, Jimmy gave them circulation enough. I can still see his round face, with the nose just indicated, his wicked, twinkling little eyes, and I can hear his husky voice fall to a whisper when [...] "the boss" [...] passed through the store. Jimmy, when visiting us, always had a group around him. His audacity with women amazed me, for he never passed one of the [...] "lady clerks" [...] without some form of caress, which they resented but invariably laughed at. One day he imparted to me his code of morality: he never made love to another man's wife, so he assured me, if he knew the man!

It plays a large role in achieving the goal of sales increase and satisfaction of customer needs in commerce. In order to successfully enforce it, space management has to be linked to other business functions, for example procurement. Keeping in mind that over 60 % of purchases are the socalled impulsive purchases, merchants have to encourage consumers to shop and to increase <b>sold</b> <b>quantities</b> of their products through their business policy and methods. Customer orientation is reflected in adjusting the sales place to better serve customer needs and ensuring easier product location in the store. On the other hand, in order to increase sale, a merchant must pay close attention to categories and characteristics of a product, circulation product categories, adequate product placement within a sales space, defining shelf appearance and product placement on the shelves.

This indicates that besides the absence of an average GPG, women are disadvantaged in larger scale markets. These findings support recent experimental evidence that the GPG depends on the perceived competence and entitlement as women are traditionally active in small scale local vegetable trade but not in large scale trade in the survey region. Also, it is a warning that women might be left behind in an increasingly commercializing market, even though they traditionally controlled it...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{household}} typology distinguishing between net sellers, net buyers and self sufficient, the Net Benefit Ratio (NBR), defined by Deaton (1989), is used to approximate households' first order welfare variations when price change. In this paper, we discuss both the typology's criteria and the classic formula of NBR, since they are based a) on produced and consumed quantities rather than real marketed volumes and b) on a unique selling and buying price for all surveyed households. We propose another definition of a net seller and a new NBR expression allowing the analyst to take into account market failures (MF) and price seasonality (PS), which are two constancies in developing countries. We use two sets of data (from Mexico and Mali), to show that, if considering MF and PS, (1) the household typology can be partly reconfigured and (2) the distribution of the NBR over the household income profile slightly change. Yet, if the applied use of this reformulated NBR could contribute to get more precise impacts assessments, it implies to collect more data while doing surveys, by recording every market transactions of each household (bought, <b>sold</b> <b>quantities</b> and related prices). household welfare, food crop, net buyer, net seller, net benefit ratio, price seasonality, survey, Consumer/Household Economics, Marketing, D 12, C 14, Q 12, D 31, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|E

Timely identification of newly emerging trends is also needed in business process. Sales patterns from inventory data indicate market trends and can be used in forecasting which has great potential for decision making, strategic planning and market competition. The objectives in this research are to get better decision making for improving sale, services and quality as to identify the reasons of dead stock, slow-moving, and fastmoving products which is useful mechanism for business support, investment and surveillance. In this paper we proposed an algorithm for mining patterns of huge stock data to predict factors affecting the sale of products.

The aim {{of this article is}} that within the analyzed companies {{in the area of the}} statistical region of South Serbia determined the dynamics of purchasing and marketing of non-wood forest products (NWFPs), and their value. The purpose of this research is to examine the possibilities for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) towards sustainable use of NWFPs in a part of the territory of South Serbia. The subjects of the research are: purchased and <b>sold</b> <b>quantities</b> in analyzed companies, as well as the prices of these products in the market. The research was conducted in the territory of the dominant Pcinja, and they included 19 companies engaged in purchasing, processing and sale of NTFPs. The purchase of forest raspberries, wild strawberries and blackberries and herbs is represented within the Pcinja District. The highest average annual growth rates were recorded in the sales of products with added value of dog rose (Rosa canina) and cornelian (Cornus mas). Export oriented enterprises in this area are at a low level. The total gross revenue earned by the placement of the selected final NWFPs in the domestic market was about 6, 315, 710 €.

40|$|In Mali, {{liberalization}} of seed markets for sorghum and millet, the staple food crops, has not advanced {{at the same}} rate or with the same measurable success as {{liberalization of}} grain markets. Most seed of these crops is uncertified and continues to be supplied to farmers by farmers, according to clan and ethno-linguistic group. After poor harvests or when replanting after a dry spell, farmers rely on local markets for grain as sources of seed. This paper summarizes the findings of a vendor survey conducted in two marketsheds during weekly fairs. No certified seed is sold. Almost all vendors are women who are also farmers. Variety integrity is maintained particularly for millet seed in the marketshed of the Sahelian zone, where the range of variety adaptation is very limited. Grain that is suitable for seed is brought to market directly from granaries. Varieties are identified by their provenance. Socially prescribed behavior is apparent in price-fixing, price discounts, procurement practices, and the spatial organization of vendors. Preliminary hypotheses are tested with a simple regression. Marketshed, which is highly correlated with the ethnic composition of the population, agro-ecology, market infrastructure and crop sold, has a dominant impact on quantities <b>sold.</b> <b>Quantities</b> sold do not respond to expected prices. Greater specialization of the vendor in trade as compared to farming, younger age, and additional years in school positively influence amounts sold. A better comprehension of this type of trade could contribute to policies that improve the access of poor farmers to valuable crop genetic resources, enhancing their seed security and productivity.

However, {{the introduction of new}} technology “pushes” old Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products to non-use. E-waste is defined as the quantities of ICT products which are not in use and is bivariate function of the <b>sold</b> <b>quantities,</b> and the probability that specific computers quantity will be regarded as obsolete. In this paper, an e-waste generation model is presented, which is applied to the following regions: Western and Eastern Europe, Asia/Pacific, Japan/Australia/New Zealand, North and South America. Furthermore, cumulative computer sales were retrieved for selected countries of the regions so as to compute obsolete computer quantities. In order to provide robust results for the forecasted quantities, a selection of forecasting models, namely (i) Bass, (ii) Gompertz, (iii) Logistic, (iv) Trend model, (v) Level model, (vi) AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA), and (vii) Exponential Smoothing were applied, depicting for each country that model which would provide better results in terms of minimum error indices (Mean Absolute Error and Mean Square Error) for the in-sample estimation. As new technology does not diffuse in all the regions of the world with the same speed due to different socio-economic factors, the lifespan distribution, which provides the probability of a certain quantity of computers to be considered as obsolete, is not adequately modeled in the literature. The time horizon for the forecasted quantities is 2014 - 2030, while the results show a very sharp increase in the USA and United Kingdom, due to the fact of decreasing computer lifespan and increasing sales...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Through {{the last}} few years the State Forest Administration in Republic of Bulgaria was searching for the proper model and {{approach}} for reproduction, management and utilization of the Bulgarian forest, aiming sustainable long-term forestry sector development. Parallel with seeking for radical changes for reforming of the forestry sector, the management and expert sta,ff of the State Forest Administration (National Forestry Board - NFB, and its units) through all these years continuously searched for improvement of the acting legislative and budgetary regulations, documents and rules with one major purpose - discovering of optimal types of timber utilization and sales, for increasing the income in the forestry sector, and the opportunity for reinvestment of part of it. In this study different tendencies in the quantitative and value dimensions of separate legislatively postulated types of utilization, harvesting and round timber sales from the State Forestry Fund for the period 2002 - 2004, have been analyzed, and they are an indicator for the sustainable development of the forestry sector. Comprehensive analysis in years of the harvested and <b>sold</b> <b>quantities</b> of round timber, of the changes in single prices pei cubic meter*sold timber and of the income of these sales is presented in details. This publication is focused on growing of the timber utilization, of the harvesting and of the store sales, aiming to reach the foreseen quantities in the Forest Management Plan, and on building up of the relative share of timber sales on the road through {{the last few}} years. These two moments, together with the gradual timber prices lead to significant income increase in the forestry sector, which offers more and more opportunities for reinvestment in forest reproduction, technique and equipments, for constructions, forest roads' repair and maintenance and etc. РЕЗЮМЕ: Анализирани са тенденциите в количествените и стойностните изменения при различните нормативно регламентирани начини на ползване и продажба на дървесина от ДГФ в периода 2002 - 2004 година, както и изменението на ценовите равнища на дървесината при различните начини на ползване и на продажби.
