5|$|In biology, Holliday {{junctions}} {{are a key}} intermediate in {{many types}} of genetic recombination, {{as well as in}} double-strand break repair. These junctions usually have a symmetrical sequence and are thus mobile, meaning that the four individual arms may slide through the junction in a <b>specific</b> <b>pattern</b> that largely preserves base pairing. Additionally, four-arm junctions similar to Holliday junctions appear in some functional RNA molecules.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a <b>specific</b> <b>pattern</b> of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no <b>specific</b> <b>pattern,</b> unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E

25|$|When {{structural}} or neurological impairments are not observed, {{all four}} diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure {{to be assessed}} in terms of functional impairments. Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, {{often referred to as}} developmental disabilities. There is no consensus on a <b>specific</b> <b>pattern</b> of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such, so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems.|$|E

25|$|In {{species such}} as the Coleopteran family Lampyridae, the males fly in the {{darkness}} and emit a species-species <b>specific</b> <b>pattern</b> of light flashes, which are answered by perching receptive females. The color and temporal variation of the flash {{contribute to the success}} in attracting females. Acoustic signals are produced by many groups including several orthopeteran species, neuropterida, cicadas, flies, cave planthroppers, leaf hoppers, and tree hoppers. In crickets and other Orthopeterans, loudness and/or uninterrupted songs often attract more females. In other insects, females may choose a mate in relation to aspects of his songs. In any case, it is possible that females compare the songs of several males before making a choice.|$|E
25|$|Braille {{was based}} on a tactile {{military}} code called night writing, developed by Charles Barbier in response to Napoleon's demand for a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source. In Barbier's system, sets of 12 embossed dots encoded 36 different sounds. It proved to be too difficult for soldiers to recognize by touch and was rejected by the military. In 1821 Barbier visited the Royal Institute for the Blind in Paris, where he met Louis Braille. Braille identified two major defects of the code: first, by representing only sounds, the code was unable to render the orthography of the words; second, the human finger could not encompass the whole 12-dot symbol without moving, and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another. Braille's solution was to use 6-dot cells and to assign a <b>specific</b> <b>pattern</b> to each letter of the alphabet.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the kind}} of {{heuristic}} used by early AV engines was totally different from those used today. The first product with a heuristic engine resembling modern ones was F-PROT in 1991. Early heuristic engines were based on dividing the binary in different sections: data section, code section (in a legitimate binary, it usually starts always from the same location). Indeed, the initial viruses re-organized {{the layout of the}} sections, or overrode the initial portion of section in order to jump to {{the very end of the}} file where malicious code was located—only going back to resume execution of the original code. This was a very <b>specific</b> <b>pattern,</b> not used at the time by any legitimate software, which represented an elegant heuristic to catch suspicious code. Other kinds of more advanced heuristics were later added, such as suspicious section names, incorrect header size, regular expressions, and partial pattern in-memory matching.|$|E

The Ancient Greeks called the constellation προκυων/Procyon, [...] "coming before the dog", transliterated into Latin as Antecanis, Praecanis, or variations thereof, by Cicero and others. Roman writers also appended the descriptors parvus, minor or minusculus ("small" [...] or [...] "lesser", for its faintness), septentrionalis ("northerly", for its position in relation to Canis Major), primus (rising [...] "first") or sinister (rising to the [...] "left") to its name Canis.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of <b>specific</b> <b>patterns</b> in stock price derived from technical stock analysis heuristics, which after occurring {{resulted in a}} predefined price movement, {{was the subject of}} this research effort. The motive was to enhance the profitability of an investment method based on such patterns. To identify the <b>specific</b> <b>patterns</b> resulting in the predefined price movement, artificial neural networks were used. A theoretical model for combining an expert system, filled with knowledge from technical stock analysis heuristics, and artificial neural networks into a hybrid integrated system was presented. Experiments were then conducted in order to evaluate whether the proposed method actually could improve the profitability of the selected investment method. Neural networks were trained in these experiments to classify whether the outcome of an occurred pattern would result in a predefined price movement. The major findings of this research was that; using the proposed method we were able to enhance some <b>specific</b> <b>patterns</b> used in technical analysis, occurring in the Swedish OMX- index during the specific period...|$|R
500|$|The {{complexes}} {{constructed in}} structural DNA nanotechnology use topologically branched nucleic acid structures containing junctions. (In contrast, most biological DNA exists as an unbranched double helix.) One {{of the simplest}} branched structures is a four-arm junction that consists of four individual DNA strands, portions of which are complementary in a <b>specific</b> <b>pattern.</b> Unlike in natural Holliday junctions, each arm in the artificial immobile four-arm junction has a different base sequence, causing the junction point to be fixed at a certain position. [...] Multiple junctions can be combined in the same complex, {{such as in the}} widely used double-crossover (DX) structural motif, which contains two parallel double helical domains with individual strands crossing between the domains at two crossover points. Each crossover point is, topologically, a four-arm junction, but is constrained to one orientation, in contrast to the flexible single four-arm junction, providing a rigidity that makes the DX motif suitable as a structural building block for larger DNA complexes.|$|E
500|$|Andromeda {{was one of}} the {{original}} 48 constellations formulated by Ptolemy in his 2nd-century Almagest, in which it was defined as a <b>specific</b> <b>pattern</b> of stars. She is typically depicted with α Andromedae as her head, ο and λ Andromedae as her chains, and δ, π, μ, Β, and γ Andromedae representing her body and legs. However, there is no universal depiction of Andromeda and the stars used to represent her body, head, and chains. Arab astronomers were aware of Ptolemy's constellations, but they included a second constellation representing a fish at Andromeda's feet. Several stars from Andromeda and most of the stars in Lacerta were combined in 1787 by German astronomer Johann Bode to form Frederici Honores (also called Friedrichs Ehre). It was designed to honor King Frederick II of Prussia, but quickly fell into disuse. Since the time of Ptolemy, Andromeda has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union, although like all modern constellations, it is now defined as a specific region of the sky that includes both Ptolemy's pattern and the surrounding stars. In 1922, the IAU defined its recommended three-letter abbreviation, [...] "And". The official boundaries of Andromeda were defined in 1930 by Eugène Delporte as a polygon of 36 segments. Its right ascension is between 22h 57.5m and 2h 39.3m and its declination is between 53.19° and 21.68° in the equatorial coordinate system.|$|E
500|$|Aries is now {{recognized}} as an official constellation, albeit as a specific region of the sky, by the International Astronomical Union. It was originally defined in ancient texts as a <b>specific</b> <b>pattern</b> of stars, and has remained a constellation since ancient times; it now includes the ancient pattern {{as well as the}} surrounding stars. In the description of the Babylonian zodiac given in the clay tablets known as the MUL.APIN, the constellation now known as Aries was the final station along the ecliptic. The MUL.APIN was a comprehensive table of the risings and settings of stars, which likely served as an agricultural calendar. Modern-day Aries was known as , [...] "The Agrarian Worker" [...] or [...] "The Hired Man". Although likely compiled in the 12th or 11th century BC, the MUL.APIN reflects a tradition which marks the Pleiades as the vernal equinox, which was the case with some precision {{at the beginning of the}} Middle Bronze Age. The earliest identifiable reference to Aries as a distinct constellation comes from the boundary stones that date from 1350 to 1000 BC. On several boundary stones, a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters present. The shift in identification from the constellation as the Agrarian Worker to the Ram likely occurred in later Babylonian tradition because of its growing association with Dumuzi the Shepherd. By the time the MUL.APIN was created—by 1000 BC—modern Aries was identified with both Dumuzi's ram and a hired laborer. The exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of Aries or other ram figures.|$|E
