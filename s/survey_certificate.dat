The Household Electricity Survey monitored electricity consumption at an appliance level in 250 owner-occupied households across England from 2010 - 2011. The aim {{of the project was}} to investigate the potential for electricity savings by replacing existing appliances and lighting with more efficient alternatives. The study also investigated the opportunities for reducing peak electricity demand. Extensive analysis was undertaken on appliance ownership, efficiency labels, actual efficiencies and potential for electricity savings in different social groups. The study has also examined the scope for reducing peak electricity demand. Households were selected {{to take part in the}} survey on the basis of the life-stage of the occupants. Of the 250 households surveyed, 26 were monitored for a period of one year and the rest were monitored for periods of one month at intervals throughout the year. The dwellings were also given an Energy Performance <b>Certificate</b> <b>survey</b> and the occupants were requested to complete survey questions about their environmental attitudes.

Historically, Ardhi University, dates back to 1956 when it started as Surveying Training School offering land <b>surveying</b> technician <b>certificate</b> courses at the present location of Mgulani Salvation Army Camp in Dar es Salaam. In 1958, the School {{was moved to the}} present location (i.e. the Observation Hill). In 1972, the School was transformed to Ardhi Institute. Then the Institute offered two-year diploma programmes in the fields of Land Surveying and Land Management and Valuation. In the same year, a three-year Diploma program in Urban and Rural Planning was introduced. Later in 1975, all the three-year diploma programes were upgraded to Advanced Diplomas. The Building Design and Building Economics courses started in 1976 and 1978 respectively. As pointed out earlier, in 1996 Ardhi Institute was affiliated to the University of Dar es Salaam as a Constituent College of the University; subsequently its name changed to the University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS). Within ten (10) years, UCLAS increased the number of academic programmes from six (6) to thirty nine (39). The programmes ranging from diplomas to PhDs were offered by two faculties, that is, the Faculty of Architecture and Planning (FAP) and the Faculty of Lands and Environmental Engineering (FLEE). As a result of these changes, student enrollment increased from only 400 in 1996 to about 1,400 in 2007. At the same time, the number of academic staff with PhD increased from 3 in 1996 to over 60 in 2012. At present there are over 80 PhD holders who have graduated from over 25 universities worldwide. In 2007 Ardhi University came into being following the signing of the Ardhi University Charter by His Excellency the President of United Republic of Tanzania. Concurrently, the structure and number of programmes and academic units has increased significantly. At present, the University comprises four Schools, one Institute and several centres. Schools includes; The School of Architecture,Construction Economics and Management(SACEM), The School of Earth Sciences, Real Estates, Business and Informatics(SERBI), The School of Environmental Science and Technology(SEST), and The School of Spatial Planning and Social Science(SSPSS), alongside Institute of Human Settlements Studies (IHSS).

Federal initiatives {{such as the}} Welfare-to-Work Program and the Health Marriage Initiative have fallen far short of their goals of fostering economic mobility and intact families. Between 2007 and 2011 the Strong Couples-Strong Children (SC – SC) project enrolled 726 low-income, expecting and new parents into a relationship strengthening program. Participants received a manualized group intervention focusing on communication and problem-solving skills supplemented with family-care wrap-around services. While beneficial treatment effects were found on six of ten critical outcomes variables, families continued to experience chronic economic hardships. In focus groups conducted in the final year, participants conveyed multiple strengths, including {{a strong commitment to}} their families and bettering their lives through gainful employment. They also reported, however, that constant worry about finances had erosive effects on their self-esteem, (particularly males) and partner relationships. Barriers to employment varied by race and gender as did ideas on needed resources. Similarities and differences in strengths and challenges were subsequently supported by survey data. Survey data also refute negative family stereotypes.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aims were (1) to {{identify}} from death certificates regions {{with an increased}} incidence of dementia mortality; and (2) {{to determine whether a}} previously observed excess of patients with Alzheimer disease originating from a small area could be confirmed in a <b>survey</b> of death <b>certificates.</b> DESIGN [...] The study identified all individuals dying with dementia, recorded on death certificates as an immediate, antecedent, underlying, or contributing cause of death. Rather than the usual residence, the birthplace of these individuals was used to determine regional differences in dementia mortality. A comparison was made of two areas to test the significance of a geographical isolate of persons. To test for a possible genetic component of the excess, an analysis was made of the frequencies of family names. To test for a possible environmental component an analysis was made of standard measurements of drinking water quality. SETTING [...] The survey data were derived from all 1985 and 1986 deaths in the province of Newfoundland. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Based on the current census population, the prevalence of dementia at death for 1985 and 1986 was 34 and 37 / 100, 000. For both years there was a significant excess of persons originating from a small area (95 % CI, 1. 1 - 20. 7 %, and 2. 5 - 20. 4 %). This excess could not be explained by differences in age, sex, ethnic origin, or by variation in mobility patterns. The study area has a high concentration of aluminium in the drinking water. An analysis of the family names gave inconclusive evidence of a clustering among the dementia cases. CONCLUSIONS [...] If all contributing causes of death are recorded and the birthplace of individuals is noted, mortality statistics can reveal regional differences in dementia rates. This shows the need to examine areas smaller than census districts {{to identify}} subpopulation variation in the prevalence of dementia. Environmental influences can vary substantially in areas relatively close together, as evidenced in measurements of drinking water chemistry. Genetic influences {{are more likely to be}} revealed from the birthplace of individuals, which may indicate a common ancestry...|$|R
