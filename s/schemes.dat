5|$|In the Royal Navy, dazzle paint <b>schemes</b> reappeared in January 1940. These were unofficial, and {{competitions}} {{were often}} held between ships {{for the best}} camouflage patterns. The Royal Navy's Camouflage Department {{came up with a}} scheme devised by a young naval officer, Peter Scott, a wildlife artist, which were developed into the Western Approaches <b>Schemes.</b> In 1942 the Admiralty Intermediate Disruptive Pattern came into use, followed in 1944 by the Admiralty Standard <b>Schemes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The scheme, {{consisting}} of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Although <b>schemes</b> are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify <b>schemes</b> must do so with lowercase letters. It {{is followed by a}} colon (:). Examples of popular <b>schemes</b> include http(s), ftp, mailto, file, data, and irc. URI <b>schemes</b> should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although non-registered <b>schemes</b> are used in practice.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other <b>schemes</b> for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The <b>schemes</b> were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the <b>schemes</b> east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.|$|E

5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS <b>schemes</b> is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment <b>schemes</b> by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions {{of the costs of}} investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS <b>schemes</b> to investors.|$|E
5|$|Great Southern and its nearest {{industry}} rival Timbercorp {{were estimated}} as having 43 per cent of all managed investment <b>schemes</b> (MIS) business in Australia. In contrast to other MIS industry participants, for which MIS activity {{is only a}} small part of their operations, managed investment <b>schemes</b> were 100 per cent of Great Southern Group and Timbercorp's business.|$|E
5|$|In many languages, {{including}} modern European {{languages and}} Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, {{the use of}} structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme <b>schemes.</b> Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part {{under the influence of}} the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some rhyming <b>schemes</b> have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming <b>schemes</b> have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme <b>schemes.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{nonlinear}} Leland {{equation is}} a Black-Scholes option pricing model with transaction {{costs and the}} research of its numerical methods has theoretical significance and practical application value.

5|$|No Admiralty {{camouflage}} {{section was}} established until October 1940. Admiralty camouflage <b>schemes</b> promulgated in 1941 were not universally adopted because of difficulties with operating schedules and shortages of some paint pigments.

40|$|Abstract. In 2008, Hashimoto and Sakurai {{proposed}} a new efficient signature <b>scheme,</b> {{which is a}} non-commutative ring version of Shamir’s birational permutation signature <b>scheme.</b> Shamir’s <b>scheme</b> is a generalization of the OSS (Ong-Schnorr-Shamir) signature <b>scheme</b> and was broken by Coppersmith et al. using its linearity and commutativity. The HS (Hashimoto-Sakurai) <b>scheme</b> {{is expected to be}} secure against the attack of Coppersmith et al. since the <b>scheme</b> is based on the noncommutative structure. In this paper, we propose an attack against the HS <b>scheme.</b> Our {{proposed a}}ttack is practical under the condition that its step size and the number of steps are small. More precisely, we firstly show that the HS <b>scheme</b> is essentially a commutative <b>scheme,</b> that is, the HS <b>scheme</b> can be reduced to some commutative birational permutation signature <b>scheme.</b> Then we apply Patarin-like attack against the commutative birational permutation signature <b>scheme.</b> We discuss efficiency of our attack by using some experimental results. Furthermore the commutative <b>scheme</b> obtained from the HS <b>scheme</b> is the Rainbowtype signature <b>scheme.</b> We also discuss the security of the Rainbow-type signature <b>scheme,</b> and propose an efficient attack against some class of the Rainbow-type signature <b>scheme.</b> Key words: non-commutative ring, birational permutation, Rainbow, Gröbner basi...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{previous}} regional voting <b>scheme</b> model studies and assumptions, we extend studies from two-level voting <b>scheme</b> models to multi-level voting <b>scheme</b> models. Due to mathematical complexity, {{we use the}} Monte Carlo approach in studying {{the stability of the}} multi-level regional voting <b>scheme</b> with respect to region sizes and levels. Using this model, we are able to obtain the stability characteristics of the national voting <b>scheme,</b> the two-level regional voting <b>scheme,</b> and the multi-level regional voting <b>scheme,</b> and apply it in FERET human face database. According to our study, we verify again that the regional voting <b>scheme</b> (including the two-level regional voting <b>scheme</b> and multi-level regional voting <b>scheme)</b> is always more stable than the national voting <b>scheme.</b> We find that the stability of the multi-level regional voting <b>scheme</b> is not as good as the stability of the two-level regional voting <b>scheme</b> when region size is within a certain range. Out of this range, the multi-level regional voting <b>scheme</b> may compete with the two-level voting <b>scheme.</b> We conclude that the multi-level regional voting <b>scheme</b> may be comparable to the two-level regional voting <b>scheme</b> and prove our conclusion in the face recognition application.
