5|$|<b>Sociobiology</b> is {{the study}} of how social {{behaviour}} and organization have been influenced by evolution and other biological process. The field blends sociology with a number of other sciences, such as anthropology, biology, and zoology. <b>Sociobiology</b> has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving too much attention to gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general (see 'nature versus nurture'). Entomologist E. O. Wilson is credited as having originally developed and described <b>Sociobiology.</b> Besides <b>Sociobiology</b> the bio-communication theory investigates interactions between non-human organisms such as animal communication, plant communication, fungal communication and communication in micro-organisms on the basis of rule-governed sign-use. In this respect any coordination of behaviour between at least two organisms is sign-mediated that underlies combinatorial (syntactic), context-dependent (pragmatic) and content-relevant (semantic) rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of <b>sociobiology</b> to humans (discussed {{only in the}} first and last chapters of the book) was immediately controversial. Some researchers, led by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, contended that <b>sociobiology</b> embodied biological determinism. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to social Darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century, and other more recent developments, such as the IQ controversy of the early 1970s, as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society. They believed that Wilson was committing the naturalistic fallacy, attempting to define moral principles using natural concepts. Academics opposed to Wilson's <b>sociobiology,</b> including Gould, Lewontin, Jon Beckwith, Ruth Hubbard, and Anthony Leeds created the <b>Sociobiology</b> Study Group of Science for the People to counter his ideas.|$|E
5|$|Noam Chomsky, a {{linguist}} {{and political}} scientist, surprised many by {{coming to the}} defense of <b>sociobiology</b> on the grounds that political radicals needed to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature {{in order to be able}} to struggle for a better society, claiming that leaders should know what human needs were in order to build a better society.|$|E
5|$|Advocates {{for higher}} levels of {{selection}} (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) {{suggest that there are}} many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and <b>sociobiology</b> as being excessively reductionist; she has suggested that the popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E
5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human <b>sociobiology</b> and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
5|$|The {{red deer}} {{population}} {{has been the subject}} of research for many years, recently under the leadership of Tim Clutton-Brock of the University of Cambridge. These efforts are based at the remote bay of Kilmory in the north of the island. It has been important in the development of <b>sociobiology</b> and behavioural ecology, particularly in relation to the understanding of aggression through game theory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the century the ideas of {{population}} genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, <b>sociobiology,</b> and, especially in humans, evolutionary psychology. In the 1960s W.D. Hamilton and others developed game theory approaches to explain altruism from an evolutionary perspective through kin selection. The possible origin of higher organisms through endosymbiosis, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the gene-centered view (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the neutral theory (which made genetic drift a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of adaptationism and contingency in evolutionary theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, {{in terms of its}} actual page numbers, {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as <b>sociobiology.</b> The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E
5|$|Observed {{by humans}} {{since the dawn}} of history, the {{behaviour}} of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, myrmecologists, study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. Their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal model organisms. Ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by Sir John Lubbock in 1881. Studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and <b>sociobiology,</b> and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies. Ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria, specially constructed glass framed enclosures. Individuals may be tracked for study by marking them with dots of colours.|$|E
5|$|In {{a set of}} controversies {{over the}} {{mechanisms}} and interpretation of evolution (what has been called 'The Darwin Wars'), one faction is often named after Dawkins, while the other faction is named after the American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould, reflecting the pre-eminence of each as a populariser of the pertinent ideas. In particular, Dawkins and Gould have been prominent commentators in the controversy over <b>sociobiology</b> and evolutionary psychology, with Dawkins generally approving and Gould generally being critical. A typical example of Dawkins's position is his scathing review of Not in Our Genes by Steven Rose, Leon J. Kamin, and Richard C. Lewontin. Two other thinkers who are often considered to be allied with Dawkins on the subject are Steven Pinker and Daniel Dennett; Dennett has promoted a gene-centred view of evolution and defended reductionism in biology. Despite their academic disagreements, Dawkins and Gould {{did not have a}} hostile personal relationship, and Dawkins dedicated a large portion of his 2003 book A Devil's Chaplain posthumously to Gould, who had died the previous year.|$|E

25|$|The {{fields of}} <b>sociobiology</b> and {{evolutionary}} psychology {{attempt to explain}} animal and human behavior and social structures, largely in terms of evolutionarily stable strategies. Sociopathy (chronic antisocial or criminal behavior) may {{be a result of}} a combination of two such strategies.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} an empirically {{identifiable}} meeting point between the non-physical mind and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly {{in the fields of}} <b>sociobiology,</b> computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences.|$|E
25|$|This schema {{constitutes}} a basic {{framework of the}} overlapping behavioural fields of ethology, behavioural ecology, comparative psychology, <b>sociobiology,</b> evolutionary psychology, and anthropology. It was in fact Julian Huxley who identified the first three questions, Niko Tinbergen gave only the fourth question, but Julian Huxley's questions failed to distinguish between survival value and evolutionary history, so Tinbergen's fourth question helped resolve this problem.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} and <b>sociobiology</b> have also discussed and produced theories for some specific forms of male aggression such as sociobiological theories {{of rape and}} theories regarding the Cinderella effect. Another evolutionary theory explaining gender differences in aggression is the Male Warrior hypothesis, which explains that males have psychologically evolved for intergroup aggression {{in order to gain}} access to mates, resources, territory and status.|$|E
25|$|John Hurrell Crook {{studied the}} {{behaviour}} of weaverbirds and demonstrated {{the links between}} ecological conditions, behaviour and social systems. Principles from economics {{were introduced to the}} study of biology by Jerram L. Brown in his work on explaining territorial behaviour. This led to more studies of behaviour that made use of cost-benefit analyses. The rising interest in <b>sociobiology</b> also led to a spurt of bird studies in this area.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{philosophers}} of mind adopt {{either a}} reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different {{ways that the}} mind is not something separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. {{in the fields of}} <b>sociobiology,</b> computer science, evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences. Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} has {{roots in}} cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology but also draws on behavioral ecology, artificial intelligence, genetics, ethology, anthropology, archaeology, biology, and zoology. It is {{closely linked to}} <b>sociobiology,</b> but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on domain-specific rather than domain-general mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current fitness, the importance of mismatch theory, and psychology rather than behavior. Most {{of what is now}} labeled as sociobiological research is now confined to the field of behavioral ecology.|$|E
25|$|Different syntheses followed, {{accompanying}} the gradual {{breakup of the}} early 20th century synthesis, including with social behaviour in E. O. Wilson's <b>sociobiology</b> in 1975, evolutionary developmental biology's integration of embryology with genetics and evolution, starting in 1977, and Massimo Pigliucci's proposed extended evolutionary synthesis of 2007. In {{the view of the}} evolutionary biologist Eugene Koonin in 2009, the modern synthesis will be replaced by a 'post-modern' synthesis that will include revolutionary changes in molecular biology, the study of prokaryotes and the resulting tree of life, and genomics.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, E. O. Wilson {{published}} his controversial book , the subtitle {{alluding to the}} modern synthesis as he attempted to bring the study of animal society into the evolutionary fold. This appeared radically new, although Wilson was following Darwin, Fisher, Dawkins and others. Critics such as Gerhard Lenski noted that he was following Huxley, Simpson and Dobzhansky's approach, which Lenski considered needlessly reductive as far as human society was concerned. By 2000, the proposed discipline of <b>sociobiology</b> had morphed into the relatively well-accepted discipline of evolutionary psychology.|$|E
25|$|David Charles Stove (15 September 1927 – 2 June 1994), was an Australian philosopher. His work in {{philosophy}} of science included criticisms of David Hume's Inductive scepticism, {{as well as}} what he regarded as the irrationalism of Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, and Paul Feyerabend. He offered a positive response to the problem of induction in his 1986 work, The Rationality of Induction. Stove was also a critic of Idealism and <b>sociobiology,</b> describing the latter as a new religion in which genes play the role of gods.|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{psychology}} {{refers to}} {{the scientific study of}} the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethology. Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the <b>Sociobiology</b> of E. O. Wilson. Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.|$|E
25|$|Sociobiological {{research}} is particularly controversial {{with regard to}} its application to humans. The theory established a scientific argument for rejecting the common doctrine of tabula rasa, which holds {{that human beings are}} born without any innate mental content and that culture functions to increase human knowledge and aid in survival and success. In the final chapter of the book <b>Sociobiology</b> and in the full text of his Pulitzer Prize-winning On Human Nature, Wilson argues, that the human mind is shaped as much by genetic inheritance as it is by culture if not more. There are limits on just how much influence social and environmental factors can have in altering human behavior.|$|E

500|$|W. D. Hamilton's work on kin {{selection}} {{contributed to}} the emergence of the discipline of <b>sociobiology.</b> The existence of altruistic behaviors has been a difficult problem for evolutionary theorists from the beginning. Significant progress was made in 1964 when Hamilton formulated the inequality in kin selection known as Hamilton's rule, which showed how eusociality in insects (the existence of sterile worker classes) and many other examples of altruistic behavior could have evolved through kin selection. Other theories followed, some derived from game theory, such as reciprocal altruism. In 1975, E. O. Wilson published the influential and highly controversial book [...] which claimed evolutionary theory could help explain many aspects of animal, including human, behavior. Critics of <b>sociobiology,</b> including Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, claimed that <b>sociobiology</b> greatly overstated the degree to which complex human behaviors could be determined by genetic factors. They also claimed that the theories of sociobiologists often reflected their own ideological biases. Despite these criticisms, work has continued in <b>sociobiology</b> and the related discipline of evolutionary psychology, including work on other aspects of the altruism problem.|$|E
500|$|Wilson and his admirers countered these criticisms {{by saying}} that Wilson had no {{political}} agenda, {{and if he had}} one it was certainly not authoritarian, citing Wilson's environmentalism in particular. They argued that they as scientists had a duty to uncover the truth whether that was politically correct or not. Wilson called the claim that <b>sociobiology</b> is biological determinism [...] "academic vigilantism" [...] and the <b>Sociobiology</b> Study Group response [...] "a largely ideological argument".|$|E
500|$|Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975; 25th anniversary edition 2000) {{is a book}} by E. O. Wilson. It {{helped start}} the <b>sociobiology</b> debate, {{one of the great}} {{scientific}} controversies in biology of the 20th century and part of the wider debate about evolutionary psychology and the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology. Wilson popularized the term [...] "sociobiology" [...] as an attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviour such as altruism, aggression, and the nurturing of the young. It formed a position within the long-running nature versus nurture debate. The fundamental principle guiding <b>sociobiology</b> is that an organism's evolutionary success is measured by the extent to which its genes are represented in the next generation.|$|E
500|$|Most of Gould's {{empirical}} research {{was based on}} the land snail genera Poecilozonites and Cerion. He also contributed to evolutionary developmental biology, and received wide praise for his book Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, <b>sociobiology</b> as applied to humans, and evolutionary psychology. He campaigned against creationism and proposed that science and religion should be considered two distinct fields (or [...] "magisteria") whose authorities do not overlap.|$|E
500|$|Other critics {{believed}} that Wilson's theories, {{as well as}} the works of subsequent admirers, were not supported scientifically. Objections were raised to many of the ethnocentric assumptions of early <b>sociobiology</b> (like ignoring female gatherers in favour of male hunters in hunter-gatherer societies) and to the sampling and mathematical methods used in informing conclusions. Many of Wilson's less well supported conclusions were attacked (for example, Wilson's mathematical treatment of inheritance as involving a single gene per trait, even though he admitted that traits could be polygenic). Sociobiologists were accused of being [...] "super" [...] adaptationists, or panadaptationist, believing that every aspect of morphology and behaviour must necessarily be an evolutionarily beneficial adaptation. Philosophical debates about the nature of scientific truth and the applicability of any human reason to a subject so complex as human behaviour, considering past failures, raged. Describing the controversy, Eric Holtzmans noted that [...] "Given the baleful history of misuse of biology in justifying or designing social policies and practices, authors who attempt to consider human <b>sociobiology</b> have special responsibilities that are not adequately discharged by the usual academic caveats." ...|$|E
500|$|David Barash, a psychologist, {{thought it}} [...] "about time" [...] {{students}} of behaviour were finally becoming Darwinian, starting {{to turn the}} [...] "ramshackle" [...] science into something with firmer intellectual foundations. He defended <b>sociobiology,</b> arguing {{that it does not}} claim that genes somehow control behaviour, but that they along with experience and culture contribute to it. He speculated that {{it might be possible to}} make valid predictions about human behaviour by studying [...] "cross-cultural universals in human behaviour", combining anthropology and evolutionary biology's theorem of fitness maximization.|$|E
500|$|But Gould did {{not rule}} out sociobiological {{explanations}} for many aspects of animal behavior, and later wrote: [...] "Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of inclusive fitness and kin selection to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism—previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior... Here <b>sociobiology</b> has had {{and will continue to}} have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles D. Michener, an entomologist, {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} BioScience. He observed that its scope was far wider than the social insects of Wilson's previous book The Insect Societies, dealing with [...] "social phenomena from the slime molds to man". He found the review of population biology (Part I) excellent. He noted Wilson's statement that altruism is the central problem of <b>sociobiology,</b> and remarks that Wilson's account in fact indicates the solution, kin selection. He describes the chapter on Man as being [...] "from the viewpoint of a very knowledgeable extraterrestrial visitor recording man's social natural history".|$|E
500|$|The list {{of authors}} changed {{again with the}} third edition. [...] Returning authors {{included}} Mittermeier, Louis, Langrand, Hawkins, Rajaobelina, Ratsimbazafy, and Rasoloarison. [...] New authors included Matthew Richardson, writer {{and member of the}} IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group; Christoph Schwitzer, the Head of Research at the Bristol Zoo Gardens; Anthony Rylands, a Senior Research Scientist at Conservation International and Deputy Chair of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group; Christian Roos, a geneticist at the German Primate Center; Peter M. Kappeler, a Professor of <b>Sociobiology</b> and Anthropology at the University of Göttingen in Germany; and James MacKinnon, the Senior Technical Director of Conservation International in Madagascar.|$|E
500|$|Although a proud Darwinist, Gould's {{emphasis}} was less gradualist and reductionist than most neo-Darwinists. He fiercely opposed {{many aspects of}} <b>sociobiology</b> and its intellectual descendant evolutionary psychology. He devoted considerable time to fighting against creationism, creation science, and intelligent design. Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in McLean v. Arkansas. Gould later developed the term [...] "non-overlapping magisteria" [...] (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion could not comment on each other's realm. Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, particularly in the books Rocks of Ages (1999) and The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox (2003). In a 1982 essay for Natural History Gould wrote: ...|$|E
