Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 412 (US412) about two miles (3km) north of Arbyrd. Although signed as an east–west route, the route follows mostly north–south roadways. The route was designated in 1930, and was extended east in 1972.|$|E
5|$|<b>Six</b> <b>miles</b> {{of prairie}} was a buffer zone between Houston and Bellaire. Originally {{the town was}} bounded by Palmetto, First, Jessamine, and Sixth (now Ferris) Streets. In 1910 Edward Teas, a horticulturist, moved his nursery to Bellaire from Missouri so Teas could {{implement}} Sid Hare's landscaping plans. Bellaire was incorporated as {{a city with a}} general charter in 1918, ten years after its founding. Bellaire had a population of 200 at the time. Because of the 1918 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Bellaire's territory into its city limits, while Houston annexed surrounding areas that were unincorporated.|$|E
5000|$|The area {{now known}} as <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> once belonged to the Cherokee Nation. A popular legend says that <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> was named by the Indian maiden, Issaqueena, who rode her horse on a journey of ninety-six miles to warn her lover, an English trader named Francis Allen, of a coming Cherokee attack on the fort where he was staying called Star Fort. Issaqueena {{numbered}} the creeks she crossed until she reached the fort in the area she labeled Ninety Six. There is a town called Ninety Six, and many other “number names” {{on the path to}} it; these include <b>Mile</b> Creek, <b>Six</b> <b>Mile,</b> Twelve <b>Mile</b> River, and <b>Six</b> and Twenty Creek. According to the legend, Issaqueena succeeded in warning Allen and they married and had a child, only later to be pursued by, and escape, the Cherokee. This tale is similar to many of <b>Six</b> <b>Mile’s</b> other legendary events in that it stresses courage, bravery, ingenuity, and determination. In 1777, <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> was signed over to South Carolina in a treaty. The “rugged terrain” of this region was not settled until about 1800 when Scotch-Irish, Dutch-German, and English pioneers slowly moved in, cleared the land, and planted crops. One of the main reasons for this early settlement was that <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> was located along the Keowee Path, “one of the most famous trading paths in our nation”. This path guided the first settlers to the region; and at first there were just a dozen families until about thirty more followed. The early settlers left a legacy of “integrity, industry, and independence” characterized by settling business deals with handshakes and helping one’s neighbors that can be seen in residents today.There were no businesses for several years, but by 1836, <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Baptist Church had been founded, and 1878 brought the town’s first post office. The community was incorporated in 1910, and a few establishments including saw mills, blacksmith, welding, barber shops, furniture stores, groceries, service stations, and a mortuary began to spring up over the next few decades. <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> was chiefly a farming community until World War II when many men went overseas to fight and still others moved to bigger cities to obtain jobs. After the war, it became unprofitable to grow cotton, and textile mills began to spring up around the area. Again, <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> lost some residents to jobs in other counties. Employment opportunities usually require traveling out of town, and the number of businesses has gone down since automobiles have become available. <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> has become a community with strong ties to larger cities where townspeople find more jobs, goods, and services. The modern strength of valuing education had early roots. In the early 1900s, the townspeople of <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> organized to petition the Southern Baptist Convention to build a school in their community. Despite the Convention’s reluctance, the residents did not back down, and the <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Baptist Academy was established in 1910. <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> is now home to the very modern <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Elementary School. There is one person in a small town that shines above others and that person is Dr. David E. Peek. Dr. Peek established the first hospital in Pickens County in the town of <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> as an example of ingenuity. Dr. Peek and his wife moved to <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> from North Carolina and established the 15-bed hospital in 1925. Dr. Peek outgrew his 15-bed hospital, so he bought the girls’ dormitory left over from the closing of the <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Baptist Academy, for $1900 {{and turned it into a}} forty-bed hospital which is now <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Retirement Center. “Dr. Peek had a life-long dream to build a big, beautiful, new hospital on top of <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Mountain, which overlooks the town.” He did get as far as building a nurse’s quarters for the hospital on top of <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Mountain, but “shortly after its completion in 1942, Dr. Peek, only in his early 50's died of a heart attack”. “When Dr. Peek died, so did his dream of a hospital on top of <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Mountain. At one time, Pickens County was home to more Congressional Medal of Honor winners than any county in the Nation (there were only 27 in the whole country), and three of these four men were from <b>Six</b> <b>Mile.</b> A devastating tornado roared through <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> on the night of March 13, 1929. This was the greatest blow ever to hit <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> or Pickens County. Nine people were killed, five elementary students, one high school student and three adults. Those killed in the storm are buried in two large graves at <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> Baptist Church. It is reported that after the storm, within thirty minutes, “hundreds of citizens rushed to the stricken community and offered any aid as they could give.” This continued for days despite heavy rain and nearly impassible roads. In the 1960s, Duke Power began construction of a power generating complex, that would be the largest of its kind in the world, within a few <b>miles</b> of <b>Six</b> <b>Mile.</b> The presence of this mammoth complex was expected to turn <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> into an urban metropolis, and plans were drawn for a “dream city” of over 100,000 people very close by. Fortunately this has not happened and <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> has remained much as it always was. Although there has been several waves of new residents, the town is still populated by descendents of the original settlers. As said by Bill Holder, a citizen of <b>Six</b> <b>Mile,</b> “if you ever come to <b>Six</b> <b>Mile</b> and stay for a month, you’ll never leave. People down here got hearts.” Sources: V.
