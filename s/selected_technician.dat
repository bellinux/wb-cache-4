50|$|Linsky began lecturing {{at various}} local {{libraries}} and colleges to inform people about {{topics such as}} marine mammals or ocean pollution. In 1969, he appeared at a 2-day State Marine Science Convention in Florida to encourage funding for water research. In the same year, he spent 1 month in Mexico City as a lecturer and consultant {{at the invitation of}} the Mexican Government to help develop marine science programs within the Mexican educational system. As part of that effort, he was the first North American educator to be invited to the Congresso Nacional de Oceanografica, where he conducted a 2-day workshop in oceanography for 1,200 <b>selected</b> educators, <b>technicians,</b> and scientists throughout Mexico.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare data on design and {{fabrication}} methods of removable partial dentures (RPDs) in two major cities in Greece. A questionnaire was sent to 150 randomly <b>selected</b> dental <b>technicians.</b> The participation rate was 79. 3 %. The anterior palatal strap, the lingual bar, and the Roach-type clasp arm designs were preferred. Half of the RPDs fabricated were retained using precision attachments. Differences between the two cities were observed in types of major maxillary connectors used, types of attachments and impression materials used, as well as the design of distal-extension RPDs. Postdoctoral education was found to have an impact on RPD fabrication. Despite the differences observed, design and fabrication of RPDs followed commonly used principles...|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} uses a high-powered, hand-held, computer-controlled flashgun {{to deliver}} an intense, visible, broad-spectrum pulse of light, generally in the visible spectral range of 400 to 1200 nm. Various cutoff filters {{are commonly used}} to selectively filter out lower wavelengths, especially potentially damaging ultra violet light. The resulting light has a spectral range that targets specific structures and chromophores (e.g. melanin in hair, or oxyhemoglobin in blood vessels) that are heated to destruction and reabsorbed by the body. IPL shares some similarities with laser treatments, in that they both use light to heat and destroy their targets. But unlike lasers that use a single wavelength (color) of light which typically matches only one chromophore, and hence only one condition, IPL uses a broad spectrum that when used with filters, allows it to be used against several conditions. This can be achieved when the IPL <b>technician</b> <b>selects</b> the appropriate filter that matches a specific chromophore.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} behind {{this work was}} to try and {{establish}} why so many motor vehicle students in the North East of England, having embarked on a course of study, fail to successfully complete it. Briefly, the correlated information indicates:-(a) Students who {{found their way into}} the motor industry as apprentices had not, in general, been given sufficient careers advice, either at home or from outside agencies. (b) It was also apparent that many of the students taking part in this work had obtained their apprenticeships by what {{can only be described as}} 'chance factors'. There is little evidence to support the view that 'constructive selection' is practised in the motor industry. (c) It was discovered that those students who had been <b>selected</b> for <b>technician</b> courses, primarily because of their superior mathematical ability over their craft counterparts, were far less likely to have had previous employment, and were less likely to leave their college course prematurely. (d) The majority of students taking part showed a willingness to participate in college administration, had very definite opinions on their lecturers and on the way courses should be organised and presented to them, and were far more constructive about these matters than lecturers anticipated,(e) Lecturers, even when given clear definitions of intellectual levels, found it difficult to place specific objectives within these levels, particularly at the higher grades. Nevertheless even accepting a certain amount of confusion concerning the correct intellectual levels of objectives, the results obtained from student evaluation tests were encouraging. The indicants were that specific objectives when used for lesson presentation and/or revision purposes enabled the students to score significantly higher than those students who had been taught and had revised in the traditional way...|$|R
40|$|The EU-funded 'Odour {{monitoring}} and information {{system based on}} citizen and technology innovative sensors' ([URL] OMNISCIENTIS) project has made significant inroads in this regard {{with the aim of}} mitigating odour annoyance. To begin with, documents were developed describing the desired specifications for odour measurement, dispersion modelling and information technologies. In parallel, the needs and expectations of all stakeholders, including citizens, regulatory authorities and industrial bodies, were taken into consideration. Citizens' feedback on odour acceptability levels were gathered through smartphones and using the living lab approach. They were further combined with measurements from e-nose and odour dispersion models. Project members developed an Odour Information System that produces validated monitoring statistics and impact levels for local authorities to support environment-related decision-making and for citizens to give them feedback on their complaints. A mobile application is also available, used by citizens to perform odour related observations. Over 5000 observations were sent until now. Besides, two in-situ e-nose sensors and a meteorological station were installed and calibrated in the industrial site in Belgium, serving as pilot. Further 18 industrial parameters are collected in real time and 15 odour field surveys have been performed to understand odour sources and characteristics. The e-nose technology was optimised through tests and improvements to better understand relevant odour parameters at the second pilot site, a pig farm in Austria. Researchers adapted the GRAL-System pollutant dispersion model to develop a fast odour dispersion modelling system using harmonised real-time meteorological data and industrial emission measurements. It was validated with the odour emission rates, olfactometry campaigns and citizens observations. Most of the GRAL-solver components were implemented in Cuda with a speed improved by a factor superior of 100. Project activities were disseminated via project website and factsheets, 3 scientific papers, 13 international conferences and 3 user workshops involving <b>selected</b> citizens, <b>technicians</b> and authorities. Local environmental governance was enhanced through citizen empowerment via monthly meetings and specific methodologies. Better and timely feedback on undesirable odours arising from certain emissions will help in setting evidence-based acceptable odour limits. Ultimately, a particular attention have been addressed by all partners and in particular by involved SMEs in order to ensure the exploitation of the results and enabling the identification of concrete commercial opportunities that may be pursued after the project...|$|R
5000|$|To perform digital colorization, a {{digitized}} copy of {{the best}} monochrome film print available is needed. Technicians, {{with the aid of}} computer software, associate a range of gray levels to each object, and indicate to the computer any movement of the objects within a shot. The software also is capable of sensing variations in the light level from frame to frame and correcting it if necessary. The <b>technician</b> <b>selects</b> a color for each object based on (1) common [...] "memory" [...] colors such as blue sky, white clouds, flesh tones and green grass, and (2) based on any known information about the movie. For example, if there are color publicity photos or props from the movie available to examine, authentic colors may be applied. (3) In the absence of any better information, the technician chooses a color that fits the gray level and that the technician feels is consistent with what a director might have chosen for the scene. The computer software then associates a variation of the basic color with each gray level in the object, while keeping intensity levels the same as in the monochrome original. The software then follows each object from frame to frame, applying the same color until the object leaves the frame. As new objects come into the frame, the technician must associate colors to each new object {{in the same way as}} described above. This technique was patented in 1991.|$|R
40|$|Background: X-ray {{examination}} {{is associated}} with the patient’s exposure to ionizing radiation. The dose values depend on the type of the medical procedure used, the X-ray unit technical condition and exposure conditions <b>selected</b> by X-ray <b>technicians.</b> The aim of this study has been to assess the entrance surface dose (ESD) values received by patients during the limb X-ray examination. The results should help doctors in making the decision about sending patients for X-ray examination. At the same time the X-ray unit condition and examination method performance are important for the radiological protection of the medical staff. Material and Methods: The study covered the total number of 118 X-ray units located in 56 public healthcare entities and private medical centers in the Masovian Voivodeship. The measurement of the radiation dose rate received by patients was based on our own research procedures. Results: The research has found that there are even more than 10 -fold differences in the dose values received by adult patients with several-fold differences in the case of children patients. The broadest dose value range for adult patients was related to femur radiography. The ESD values for this procedure ranged 70. 9 – 765. 2 μGy (with the average value of 319. 7 μGy). The broadest dose value range for children was related to the knee radiography. The range for children aged 5 years old was 11. 8 – 95. 8 μGy (with the average value of 48. 9 μGy). Conclusions: It is essential to immediately implement X-ray room working procedures for the purpose of performing diagnostic examinations based on the existing model procedures.

40|$|Mobility {{is a major}} {{component}} in ensuring freedom of movement and good quality of life. It is strictly associated {{to the concept of}} sustainability, considering that more than 70 % of European citizens live in urban areas. Traffic volumes and congestion, air quality, noise pollution, consumption of non renewable resources, greenhouse gas emissions, social exclusion and urban sprawl are significant challenges to achieve sustainable urban mobility. This {{is one of the most}} important goals of the Coordination Plan of the District of Naples (PTCP). In this paper, we show the process of research, selection, valuation, weighting and synthesis of a set of indicators to monitor sustainable mobility during the realization process of the PTCP. Two urban areas lacking infrastructure connections are considered: North Naples and Giuglianese. According to the Planning Code, the GIS Office and the Planning Office are responsible for choosing the set of indicators and its application, and for evaluating if the goals of the PTCP are achievable and if corrective actions should be undertaken as well. The Environmental Report attached to the Plan sets down to link each topic of the plan to a unique index resulting from a set of specific indicators. One of the results of this study was the selection of 22 indicators for sustainable mobility. They were the outcome of the intersection between the lists available in scientific literature and the databases available for the District of Naples. As set down by the PTCP Planning Code, a top down approach was adopted Therefore indicators were <b>selected</b> by <b>technicians.</b> However, a bottom up approach, i. e. citizenship and stakeholders select indicators, would have resulted in a more transparent process. This study applied a rating method named allocation of budget to weight indicators. Weights determined the importance of each indicator compared to the others. After the weighting procedure, the aggregation of indicators into a single complex index could take place. The main result of this research was the design and implementation of a database via a GIS. Not only could this GIS be updated, but it could also convert information within each indicator into a single complex index. It could immediately give the trend towards sustainable mobility. The database was useful to compare either a zone of the district in different times or different areas of the district at the same time. In addition, the process of building indices could help transparency in planning procedures and social learning through the appraisal process, if citizenship and stakeholders had been involved. The combined use of participatory techniques and multiple criteria analysis takes conflicting interest into account and is the only way to solve them in a common vision. The method implemented in this research should be applied to planning process as well and should involve most of the society. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} {{intended}} to assist the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic improve the production of seedlings for both fruit and forest trees, by expandin g and upgrading existing facilities, so as to meet the ambitious targets of the Five-Y ear Plan for 1986 to 1990. The project provided {{the services of a}} forestry nursery consultant and a fruit tree nursery consultant, who visited Syria in February and March 1986. They rev iewed and analysed the situation of both fruit and forestry nurseries, made detailed recom mendations for improvements, and recommended the equipment to be purchased under the project. Six nurseries were selected to be developed for demonstration purposes. The project provided concrete support to improve nursery management, the propagation of selected spec ies of fruit- trees, and the production of certified grafts. Four nursery-men were sent on st udy tours, two to Italy for training in fruit-tree nurseries, and two to Turkey for training in forest nurseriesIt was recommended that plants always be produced in specialized cen tres, equipped with the appropriate facilities, so as to ensure that they are pest and disease-free. The soil should be efficiently sterilized, so as to protect seedlings in nurseri es against soil- borne diseases and parasites, and mother plant plots should be strictly controll ed for viral diseases. At least one mother plant should be established for each fruit tree s pecies, in order to produce certified planting material. Fruit tree technicians should receive p eriodic training in the country, including guided study tours to advanced Syrian nurseries, and a <b>selected</b> group of <b>technicians</b> would benefit from between six and 12 months of training ab roadIn forest nurseries, it was recommended that some operations be mech anized, in order to improve productivity and minimize operational costs, particularly fo r soil handling. Detailed recommendations were made for weed control, seed treatment, and germination testing. It was recommended that a number of trials be undertaken t o improve the quality of seedlings and the final forestry products, including trial grafti ng of Pinus brutia and graft stock from advanced nursery seedlings, and also feasibility trials to strike cuttings of Pinus brutia, Pinus halepensis and Cedrus libani, for the establishment of se ed orchards. It was recommended that small samples of seeds of some of the more promising spe cies identified by the project be obtained from various provenances, so as to grow se edlings under well-controlled nursery conditions, and to test them under various climatic cond ition...|$|R
