This inflammatory reaction to implanted materials {{is known as the}} foreign body reaction (FBR) and is characterized by 3 distinct phases: onset, progression, and resolution. The FBR proceeds {{in the creation of a}} dynamic microenvironment that is spatially well organized.

Conditioned medium {{was found to be}} a potent stimulus that delayed neutrophil apoptosis up to 72 h, whereas purified and extensively washed tachyzoites had no effect. Delayed apoptosis correlated with up-regulation of the neutrophil antiapoptotic protein, Mcl- 1, and the neutrophil interleukin 3 receptor α subunit (IL- 3 Rα), suggesting a role for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were measurable in conditioned medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Neutralizing antibodies to GM-CSF and G-CSF were additive in abrogating delayed neutrophil apoptosis induced by conditioned medium. Inhibitors of Src family tyrosine kinases, Gi proteins, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, p 44 erk 1 and p 42 erk 2 mitogen-activated protein kinases, and Jak 2 kinases partially attenuated the effect of conditioned medium, consistent with a role for G-CSF and/or GM-CSF. Hence, delayed neutrophil apoptosis is mediated by GM-CSF and G-CSF secreted by T. gondii-infected human fibroblasts.

The secretion of 48 <b>soluble</b> <b>mediators</b> was measured and the effect on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was determined.

Air pollution can activate innate immune signalling in airway {{epithelial cells}} leading to the production of <b>soluble</b> <b>mediators</b> that can influence downstream inflammatory cells. Our objective was to develop and validate a model of dendritic cell exposure to airway epithelial cell-conditioned media. After establishing the model, we explored how <b>soluble</b> <b>mediators</b> released from airway epithelial cells in response to air pollution influenced the phenotype of dendritic cells. Methods: Human airway epithelial cells were cultured under control and urban particulate matter (PM 10) exposure conditions with or without pharmacological inhibitors of the uric acid pathway. Culture supernatants were collected for conditioned media experiments with peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived dendritic cells analysed by flow cytometry. Results: Monocytes derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in interleukin- 4 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor differentiated into immature dendritic cells that phenotypically differentiated into mature dendritic cells in response to conditioned media from phorbol myristate acetate-activated THP- 1 monocytes.

Two functional macrophage subsets were Identified: NK-stimulatory and NK-suppressive subsets. The former function was associated with splenic macrophages, which were predominantly l-A as Identified with a radioautographic immunolabeling technique; the latter function with peritoneai macrophages which were predominantly l-A. Loss of macrophage I-A expression in vitro was delayed In the presence of indo-methacin and enhanced in the presence of PGE 2, Indicating that PGE 2 down-regulates I-A expression on macrophages.

40|$|Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is an {{extremely}} common airway commensal which can cause opportunistic infections that are usually localized to airway mucosal surfaces. During many of these infections, NTHI forms biofilm communities that promote persistence in vivo. For many bacterial species, density-dependent quorum-signaling networks can affect biofilm formation and/or maturation. Mutation of luxS, a determinant of the autoinducer 2 (AI- 2) quorum signal pathway, increases NTHI virulence in the chinchilla model for otitis media infections. For example, bacterial counts in middle-ear fluids and {{the severity of the}} host inflammatory response were increased in luxS mutants compared with parental strains. As these phenotypes are consistent with those that we have observed for biofilm-defective NTHI mutants, we hypothesized that luxS may affect NTHI biofilms. A luxS mutant was generated using the well-characterized NTHI 86 - 028 NP strain and tested {{to determine the effects of}} the mutation on biofilm phenotypes in vitro and bacterial persistence and disease severity during experimental otitis media. Quantitation of the biofilm structure by confocal microscopy and COMSTAT analysis revealed significantly reduced biomass for NTHI 86 - 028 NP luxS biofilms, which was restored by a <b>soluble</b> <b>mediator</b> in NTHI 86 - 028 NP supernatants. Analysis of lipooligosaccharide moieties using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting showed decreased levels of biofilm-associated glycoforms in the NTHI 86 - 028 NP luxS strain.

Because TF represents the initial trigger of the coagulation cascade, its expression in the arterial wall is tightly regulated. Objective: To determine whether and which <b>soluble</b> <b>mediators</b> released during platelet activation may upregulate TF expression in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Methods and results: Rabbit SMCs were challenged with collagen-activated platelets and their effects on TF mRNA transcription and protein expression were evaluated at different time points (30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h) by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and a two-stage colorimetric assay. A progressive increase in TF mRNA, peaking at 2 h, was evident in SMCs stimulated with activated platelets with respect to baseline.

The synovial fluid of patients with symptomatic cartilage defects and OA are each characterized by a distinct profile of <b>soluble</b> <b>mediators,</b> in which several pro-inflammatory but also pro-repair cytokines are elevated compared to donors without joint pathology that may both affect cartilage regeneration. Despite the increased presence of inflammatory mediators, inhibition of individual inflammatory mediators or enzymes did not have large effects on cartilage regeneration, possibly due to counteracting factors.

The unsensitized control spleen cells did not secrete any factor(s) when activated with the antigen. In conclusion, these results indicate that sperm antigens can specifically induce (CMI) factors that have detrimental effects on sperm motility and pre#{ 252 }nplantation embryos. These findings may have potential clinical implications for humans, especially in immwwlogic and unexplained infertility, recurrent abor-tions, and development of antisperm contraceptive vaccines...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} dengue virus to invade human primary Kupffer cells and to complete its life cycle. The virus effectively penetrated Kupffer cells, but the infection {{did not result in}} any viral progeny. Dengue virus-replicating Kupffer cells underwent apoptosis and were cleared by phagocytosis. Infected Kupffer cells produced <b>soluble</b> <b>mediators</b> that could intervene in dengue virus pathogenesis...|$|R
