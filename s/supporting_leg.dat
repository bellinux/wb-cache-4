5000|$|In dance (particularly ballet), arabesque ( [...] ; literally, [...] "in Arabic fashion") {{is a body}} {{position}} in which a dancer stands on one leg (the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg)</b> with the other leg (the working leg) turned out and extended behind the body, with both legs held straight. In classical ballet, an arabesque can be executed with the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> en pointe or demi pointe or with foot flat on the floor.|$|E

In the Russian school the foot is wrapped around the ankle, rather than flexed and does not strike the floor. In this case, the frappé comprises the working foot striking the ankle of the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg.</b> Battements frappés can be executed double, with beats alternating front and back of the standing leg's ankle before striking out.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the biomechanical taekwondo {{roundhouse}} kick (RHK) mechanism of the lower half of the body in the phase before toe off the floor (READY phase) focusing especially on techniques for producing faster kicking speed and shortened time of kicking. The results were summarized as follows: i) motion of hip joint in <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> had relation to the flow of mechanical energy to pelvis, ii) extension of hip joint in <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> produced the translational velocity of pelvis, and iii) players accomplished motion of hip joint extension by providing the torque of hip joint extension in <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> at early time. Taken together, our data suggests that coaches should pay greater attention to <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and READY phase in order to improve the players’ kicking technique for kicking fast and quick...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{function}} of torques exerted by the joints of the lower trunk during maximal velocity sprinting. Eight male track and field athletes volunteered, and sprinted 60 m from a standing start position. The ground reaction force of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> was determined using a force platform (1000 Hz), which was placed at the 50 -m mark from the start position. Simultaneously, 3 D coordinates were recorded with a motion analysis system (250 Hz) using 20 cameras (MX-T 20). The joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. The contribution of joint torques to the right and left hip joint forces, and the torso joint force, was calculated by a method that simultaneously solves equations of motion for each segment and equations of constraint conditions for adjacent segments connected by a joint. The main results were as follows: (1) During the terminal support phase (80 - 100 % normalized time), the angular velocity of anterior rotation of the pelvis decreased and participants in whom this angular velocity decrease was diminished ran faster (p< 0. 10). (2) During terminal support, the hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. The moment of the right and left hip joint forces rotated the pelvis backward. (3) During terminal support, the hip joint force of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> was generated by its hip joint flexion and adduction torque, the hip joint extension torque of the recovery leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. In contrast, the hip joint force of the recovery leg was generated by the hip joint flexion and adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg,</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. (4) During terminal support, the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> rotated the pelvis backward. The hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. Previous studies showed that the hip flexion torque drives the leg forward from the hip joint extension position. This present study has clarified that the hip joint adduction torque of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint nullify backward rotation of the pelvis due to the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the <b>support</b> <b>leg...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{investigate}} the influence of the extension of the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> joints during the repositioning phase of an ice dancing push-off on performance. The second objective was to identify the relevant kinematic parameters of this skating movement. Seven international level skaters were filmed in the sagittal plane while performing two starting push-offs. Extending the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> lower limb joints completed the first push-off. In the second push-off, subjects kept these joints flexed in a static position. Results pointed out that the extension of the <b>support</b> <b>leg's</b> joints significantly increased the push-off length and velocity by 9 % and 6 % respectively. The temporal structure of the push-off was not altered by the two testing conditions. Regarding the angular parameters of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> during the repositioning phase, the knee joint amplitude, average knee angular velocity and peak thigh velocity were positively related to the push-off velocity. Considering the above results, coaches should now focus on the development of the knee extensors' power during off-ice training sessions. This would enhance the velocity of the skater during the repositioning phase solely from the action of one lower limb...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interactive hierarchical motion control system {{dedicated to the}} animation of human figure locomotion in virtual environments. As observed in gait experiments, controlling the trajectories of the feet during gait is a precise end-point control task. Inverse kinematics with optimal approaches are used to control the complex relationships between {{the motion of the}} body and the coordination of its legs. For each step, the simulation of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> is executed first, followed by the swing leg, which incorporates the position of the pelvis from the <b>support</b> <b>leg.</b> That is, the foot placement of the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> serves as the kinematics constraint, while the position of the pelvis is defined through the evaluation of a controlcriteria optimization. Then, the swing leg movement is defined to satisfy two criteria in order: collision avoidance, and control-criteria optimization.

50|$|There {{are many}} types of turns, which are {{differentiated}} {{by a number of}} factors. The performer may be supported by one or both legs or be airborne during a turn. When supported by one leg, that leg is known as the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> and the other as the free, raised, or working leg. During airborne turns, the first leg too leave the floor is the leading leg. Some turns can be executed in either of two directions. In ballet, a turn {{in the direction of the}} raised leg is said to be en dehors whereas a turn in the opposite direction is en dedans. Trunk, arm and head positions can vary, and in turns with one <b>supporting</b> <b>leg,</b> the free leg may be straight or bent. Turns can begin in various ways as well. For example, ballet turns may begin by rising to relevé (supported on the ball of the foot) or by stepping directly onto relevé.|$|E
50|$|Just {{prior to}} the swing phase, the athlete should land on the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> with the knee {{slightly}} flexed so as to absorb some of the impact and thereby stabilize the body for more effective motion of the kicking leg. The best position of the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> {{has been found to}} be 5 to 10 cm to the side of the ball (left of the ball for a right-footed kicker, right of the ball for a left-footed kicker). Skilled athletes have a tendency toward a closer ball-to-support leg side position. For forward to back positioning, there is variability based on the desired action of the ball. Placing the support leg further behind the ball will produce a greater upward direction whereas placing the support leg closer to the ball will produce greater forward propulsion. Ball flight trajectory is dictated by the supporting foot’s position. The support foot should be positioned so as to be parallel to the intended direction of the ball. Other important body positioning to be aware of is to bend the upper body slightly forward over the ball.|$|E
50|$|Virtually all muay Thai camps {{teach the}} {{roundhouse}} or angle kick with the striking leg remaining passive (mostly with the leg allowed to bend slightly but some camps teaching that the knee should be locked except to close range kicking) and {{not using the}} pivot of the lower striking leg around the knee found in most other martial arts. The power is instead entirely created by {{the rotation of the}} <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> and hips; akin to swinging a baseball bat.|$|E

40|$|For {{applications}} requiring {{high performance}} angular rate measurements {{it is important}} to be able to design MEMS rate sensors with high quality factors (Q). This paper considers ring resonator based rate sensors and investigates the influence of design changes to the ring and <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> on thermoelastic damping, which is the dominant dissipation mechanism. A computational method is used to quantify the thermoelastic damping and a detailed parameter study is conducted to understand the influence of ring geometry, <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> and micro-machined slots around the ring circumference. The results show that damping in the <b>support</b> <b>legs</b> can have significant influence on the total energy dissipated from the resonator, and the optimum leg geometry can be identified to achieve high Q. It is also observed that the addition of slots improves Q for resonators having higher energy loss. However, for high-Q, rings slots have a detrimental effect. The results presented are useful for designing ring resonators with reduced levels of damping...|$|R
50|$|The classic speedskating {{technique}} is an alternating cycle of inside-edge pushes and outer-edge glides. The cycle starts as the skater is gliding on one (let us suppose the right) leg with a bent knee. He then straightens (extends) the right knee and hip while leaning to the left. The {{direction of the}} push is therefore outwards (rightwards) {{from the center of}} mass. When the pushing leg reaches full extension he sets down the left (now <b>support)</b> <b>leg</b> and glides on it while picking up the right leg and bringing it back behind and underneath him (recovery) ready to be placed on the ground (set down) and become the new <b>support</b> <b>leg.</b> Once the pushing leg has been recovered, the <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> pushes out in the other direction and the cycle repeats. Note that the pushes are always in a lateral direction: the left leg pushes exclusively leftwards, and the right leg exclusively rightwards.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{rules that}} govern racewalking. The first {{dictates}} that the athlete's back toe cannot leave the ground until {{the heel of}} the front foot has touched. Violation of this rule is known as loss of contact. The second rule requires that the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> must straighten {{from the point of}} contact with the ground and remain straightened until the body passes directly over it. These rules are judged by the unaided human eye. Athletes regularly lose contact for a few milliseconds per stride, which can be caught on film, but such a short flight phase is said to be undetectable to the human eye.|$|E
50|$|A fouetté turn (or fouetté en tournant) {{begins with}} the {{performer}} standing on one flat foot in plié (with knee bent). The working leg is extended and whipped around {{to the side and}} then, once extended to maximum turnout, bent and pulled in to a passe or retiré position. The foot beats behind the knee and then {{to the front of the}} knee of the <b>supporting</b> <b>leg</b> before extending back out to the front. At the same time, the supporting foot transitions to relevé (heel raised), in ballet often rising to en pointe (on toe tips). These movements create the angular momentum needed for one turn, which is executed by rotating in place on the supporting foot.|$|E
