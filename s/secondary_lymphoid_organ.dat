5000|$|L-selectin {{acts as a}} [...] "homing receptor" [...] for {{lymphocytes}} {{to enter}} secondary lymphoid tissues via high endothelial venules. Ligands present on endothelial cells will bind to lymphocytes expressing L-selectin, slowing lymphocyte trafficking through the blood, and facilitating entry into a <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organ</b> at that point. The receptor is commonly found on the cell surfaces of T cells. Naive T-lymphocytes, which have not yet encountered their specific antigen, need to enter secondary lymph nodes to encounter their antigen. Central memory T-lymphocytes, which have encountered antigen, express L-selectin to localize in secondary lymphoid organs. Here they reside ready to proliferate upon re-encountering antigen. Effector memory T-lymphocytes do not express L-selectin, as they circulate in the periphery and have immediate effector functions upon encountering antigen.|$|E

40|$|Inhibition of {{dendritic}} cell (DC) migration into tissues and <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> is an {{efficient way to}} induce immunosuppression and tolerance. CCR 7 and PGE 2 are critical for DC migration to <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> where DC initiate immune response. Triptolide, an active component purified from the medicinal plant Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F., is a potent immunosuppressive drug capable of prolonging allograft survival in organ transplantation by inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation. Considering the essential role in T cell tolerance of DC migration to <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs,</b> here we demonstrate that triptolide can significantly inhibit LPS-triggered upregulation of CCR 7 expression and PGE 2 production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression in DC, thus impairing DC migration towards CCR 7 ligand CCL 19 /MIP- 3 β in vitro. Moreover, triptolide-treated DC display impaired migration into <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> and in vivo administration of triptolide also inhibits DC migration. Further studies show that the triptolide-mediated inhibitory effects of LPS-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase (PI 3 -K) /Akt and nuclear NF-κB activation are involved in down-regulation of COX- 2 and CCR 7 expression resulting in impaired migration to <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> of DC. Therefore, inhibition of DC migration through decreasing COX- 2 and CCR 7 expression via PI 3 -K/Akt and NF-κB signal pathways provides additional mechanistic explanation for triptolide's immunosuppressive effect. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|By {{using an}} oral DNA vaccine carried in an {{attenuated}} non-virulent form of Salmonella typhimurium, which co-encoded secretory chemokine CCL21 and survivin protein in C57BL/6J mice, Xiang et al. {{have been able}} to elicit an immune response carried out by dendritic cells (DCs) and CTLs to eliminate and suppress the pulmonary metastases of non-small cell lung carcinoma. The activation of the immune response is most likely taking place in the <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organ</b> called the Peyer’s Patch in the small intestine where DCs take up the survivin protein by phagocytosis and present them on their surface receptors to naive CD8+ T cells (uninactivated CTL) to achieve a specific immune response targeting survivin exclusively. Activated CTLs specific for a particular antigen kill their target cells by first recognizing parts of the survivin protein expressed on MHC I (immunohistocompatability) proteins presented on the surface of tumour cells and vasculature and then releasing granules that induce the tumour cells to undergo apoptosis. The DNA vaccine contained the CCL21 secretory chemokine as a way to enhance the likelihood of eliciting the immune response by better mediating the physical interaction of the antigen-presenting DCs and the naive CD8+ T cells, resulting in a greater likelihood of immune activation.|$|E

CD 3 � CD 4 � IL- 7 R � hi cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR 5 and might be attracted by its ligand CXCL 13, which is secreted by mesenchymal cells.

40|$|International audienceBackground CD 4 T cell {{lymphopenia}} is {{an important}} T cell defect associated to ageing. Higher susceptibility to infections, cancer, or autoimmune pathologies described in aged individuals is thought to partly rely on T cell lymphopenia. We hypothesize that such diverse effects may reflect anatomical heterogeneity of age related T cell lymphopenia. Indeed, no data are currently available {{on the impact of}} ageing on T cell pool recovered from gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), a crucial site of CD 4 T cell accumulation. Results Primary, <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> of C 57 BL/ 6 animals were analysed at three intervals of ages: 2 to 6  months (young), 10 to 14  months (middle-aged) and 22 to 26  months (old). We confirmed that ageing preferentially impacted CD 4 T cell compartment in <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs.</b> Importantly, a different picture emerged from gut associated mucosal sites: during ageing, CD 4 T cell accumulation was progressively developing in colon and small intestine lamina propria and Peyer's patches. Similar trend was also observed in middle-aged SJL/B 6 F 1 mice. Interestingly, an inverse correlation was detected between CD 4 T cell numbers in <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> and colonic lamina propria of C 57 BL/ 6 mice whereas no increase in proliferation rate of GALT CD 4 T cells was detected. In contrast to GALT, no CD 4 T cell accumulation was detected in lungs and liver in middle-aged animals. Finally, the concomitant accumulation of CD 4 T cell in GALT and depletion in <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> during ageing was detected both in male and female animals. Conclusions Our data thus demonstrate that T cell lymphopenia in <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> currently associated to ageing is not sustained in gut or lung mucosa associated lymphoid tissues or non-lymphoid sites such as the liver. The inverse correlation between CD 4 T cell numbers in <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> and colonic lamina propria and the absence of overt proliferation in GALT suggest that marked CD 4 T cell decay in <b>secondary</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> during ageing reflect redistribution of CD 4 T cells rather than generalized CD 4 T cell decay.
