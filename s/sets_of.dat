5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> elements are defined to be independent, {{in such a}} way that the independent sets satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a vector space.

Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E
