25|$|After Miers {{failed in}} these private meetings, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Sam Brownback began {{drafting}} a letter asking the President's office {{to turn over}} legal memoranda and briefs Miers had written for Bush, in order to elucidate her views on political matters. Brownback and Graham knew the memos were protected by executive privilege, that the White House was not required to turn them over, and that Miers could refuse to deliver the memos and then ostensibly step down on principle. Miers would later use this request {{as part of a}} face-saving exit strategy for stepping down. In her letter withdrawing her nomination, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> senators' request for confidential documents as potentially damaging the executive branch's independence.|$|E
25|$|Robin is Eva Kane's son, Evelyn, {{which in}} England {{can be a}} man's name {{as well as a}} woman's. Mrs Upward had not known who was the mother of her adopted son, but he {{realised}} that any scandal would be to his detriment. Mrs McGinty saw the photo of Eva Kane while working at the Upward house and assumed the photo was of Mrs Upward as a young woman. Robin killed her to prevent her from telling anyone who might recognise the photo, and framed Bentley by stealing the £30, correctly assuming Bentley would incriminate himself by panicking. Mrs Upward thought Kane's photograph to be similar to a photo Robin had shown her of his mother, whose back story he made up. She wanted to confront Robin by herself, so <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrong photo (that of Lily Gamboll) to put Poirot off the scent.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, The New York Times {{wrote that}} the movie had defined {{the image of a}} {{personal}} assistant in the public mind. Seven years later, Dissents Francesca Mari wrote about [...] "the assistant economy" [...] by which many creative professionals rely on workers so titled to do menial personal and professional tasks for them; <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Devil Wears Prada as the best-known narrative of assistantship. The next year, writing about a proposed change in U.S. federal overtime regulations that was seen as threatening to that practice, the Times called it the Devil Wears Prada economy", a term other news outlets also used.|$|E
6000|$|... "My child!--this boy!--he'd sold him! There is his Mas'r," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky shore. [...] "O, Mr. Symmes, you've got {{a little}} boy!" ...|$|R

2500|$|On 6 October 2015, author Nayantara Sahgal {{returned}} her Sahitya Akademi award {{in protest of}} the growing intolerance in the country. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recent murders of M. M. Kalburgi, Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare, and called [...] Dadri lynching her last straw. Later, Ashok Vajpeyi and Rahman Abbas also returned their awards.|$|E
2500|$|Freda Utley, in her 1949 book [...] "The High Cost of Vengeance" [...] {{charged the}} court with amongst other things double standards. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied use of {{civilian}} forced labor, and deliberate starvation of civilians in the occupied territories. She also noted that General Rudenko, the chief Soviet prosecutor, after the trials became commandant of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. (After the fall of East Germany the bodies of 12,500 Soviet era victims were uncovered at the camp, mainly [...] "children, adolescents and elderly people.") ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{door that}} led into the dining-room. Julian hesitated.|$|E
40|$|The author, an {{obstetrician}} and gynecologist, {{relates the}} differences {{she has seen}} in birth delivery procedures between the time of giving birth to her first child in 1968 and her last, in 1991. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increase in choices allowed to women in labor, such as use of analgesics or whether {{to go ahead with}} a caesarean or not, left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressure on mother and child <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> hospital after one day, or two at most. And <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a continuing need to have a doctor 2 ̆ 7 s advice in light of the choices...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{husband is}} dead,' {{answered}} <b>she,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed; and the chamberlain drew back {{the sheet and}} beheld Abu Nowas lying stiff and motionless. Then he gently replaced the sheet and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> palace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit," [...] said <b>She,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> couch. [...] "As yet thou hast {{no cause}} to fear me. If thou hast cause, {{thou shalt not}} fear for long, for I shall slay thee. Therefore let thy heart be light." ...|$|R

60|$|Neither Arnold nor Mrs. Weatherley {{made any}} {{immediate}} reply. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter.|$|E
60|$|Anne's eyes {{dropped to}} the ground. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter for the second time.|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> trip, <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ruin of Hali Tower {{and asks}} what it is. It {{becomes clear that}} she sees the tower as it {{originally}} stood, while everyone else sees the ruins, foreshadowing events in The Shadow Matrix.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, not Mr. Richard, sir; Admiral John, sir, his father; {{he always}} calls him young master, poor old soul!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grizzled beard {{and the face}} scarred and tanned with fifty years of fight and storm.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{encompasses}} {{a critique of}} multiculturalism, alleged weak policing, cultural relativism and what Phillips calls a [...] "victim culture". She argues that these forces combined to create an ideal breeding ground for Islamic terrorists. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centrality of London-based individuals and groups to many terror plots around the world, which she argues were enabled by a semi-formal [...] "covenant of security" [...] between Islamists and the British authorities. Zacharias Moussaoui and the shoe-bomber Richard Reid are two of many such examples <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> in <b>the</b> book.|$|R
60|$|As he {{attended}} {{her through the}} antechamber, <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> statue of the pearl-diver.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Look at Charlie Layton,' said <b>she,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dumb boy. 'That ball {{is perfect}} felicity, he had rather not play with it, the delight is mere possession.' She was turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boy again, when Mr. Wingfield said, not without hesitation--'You {{have not heard}} when to expect your party from Madeira?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> petticoat,--a vague, distant, moving object {{against the}} horizon.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{suggests}} that prospective librarians must establish a positive online identity and presence {{as part of}} the job search process. She proposes that individuals assess themselves as a brand <b>to</b> be marketed. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of personal profiles on online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter on employer hiring decisions...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wooden {{building}} {{which stood}} about fifty {{yards away from}} the house. Craig hesitated.|$|E
60|$|My {{wandering}} eye apparently struck her, {{for after}} the first greeting <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manuscript with a smile.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. Then I felt {{a sudden}} revulsion. I fell {{on my knees and}} seized her hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} it said," [...] quoth she, [...] "that the {{greatest}} liars are ever those that are readiest to take oath." [...] Then, with a sudden gasp of loathing, [...] "I think you have dropped something, monsieur," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. And without waiting for more, she swung round and left me.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a charming}} little study," [...] said Lady Gorgon, seating herself. And {{indeed it was}} very pretty: for Perkins had {{furnished}} it beautifully, and laid out a neat tray with cakes, a cold fowl, and sherry, to entertain his party withal. [...] "And do you bachelors always live so well?" [...] continued <b>she,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little cold collation.|$|R
60|$|As time flies {{her face}} is turned towards us, and lo! it {{is the face of}} Atene, and amid her dusky hair the aura is {{reflected}} in jewelled gold, the symbol of her royal rank. She looks at the shaven priest; she laughs as though in triumph; <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> westering sun and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river, and is gone.|$|R
60|$|One {{morning he}} met Lady Ruth on the {{pavement}} in Bond Street. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vacant seat in her landau.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter. The {{traces of}} heavy tear-drops lay thick {{over the last}} lines of the dead man's writing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just like that.' <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> befouled walls. 'I say.... Let's {{get this}} {{furniture}} a little straight.... You know it too?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> anew <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{portmanteau}} {{with the}} initials 'J. B.,' and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coat beside it.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> then <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. Alicia and Barbara, endeavouring to look grave, {{walked out}} with {{becoming}} dignity.|$|R
2500|$|A {{critical}} part of Weiner's argument is that <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> keep inalienable possessions outside of exchange {{is a source of}} difference, and hence brings high status. The development of Polynesian kingdoms is an example. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inalienable possessions of the Australian aborigines, however, <b>to</b> demonstrate how <b>the</b> creation of hierarchy can be defeated. Australian inalienable possessions are given [...] cosmological authentication through their religious beliefs in the Dreaming.|$|R
