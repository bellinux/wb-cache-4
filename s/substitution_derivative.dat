As the aluminum contents in the series R 2 (Fe 1 -x Alx) 17 are increased the hexagonal Th 2 Ni 17 type structure (or a <b>substitution</b> <b>derivative</b> of that structure) transforms — usually via a hexagonal TbCu type derivative structure — into the rhombohedral Th 2 Zn 17 type structure (or a <b>substitution</b> <b>derivative</b> of that structure). The hexagonal structures dominate at or below the 2 17 molar ratio R/(Fe,Al) 52 / 17 (10. 5 and 9. 5 at. % R), while the rhombohedral structure dominates at higher R contents (11. 5 at. %). The solubility of aluminum in the hexagonal structure increases as the atomic size of R decreases (from x 50 – 3. 42 in Tb 2 Fe 17 -xAlx to x= 0 – 4. 75 in Er 2 Fe 17 -xAlx), while that in the rhombohedral structure decreases (from x= 7. 70 – 9. 41 in Tb 2 Fe 17 -xAlxto x= 5. 70 – 7. 03 in Er 2 Fe 17 -xAlx).

In meteorology it is usual to improve the forecasts by means of some post-processing methods using local measurements and weather prediction model outputs. Neural networks, trained with local real data observations can improve short-term wind speed forecasts with respect to meso-scale numerical meteorological model outcomes of the same data types in the majority of cases. Large-scale forecast models are based on the numerical integration of differential equation systems, which can describe atmospheric circulation processes on account of global meteorological observations.

Expression of the C-terminal domain alone resulted in a photoinactive, dimeric molecule, also lacking normal activity. Thus, both domains are necessary, but neither is sufficient for phyB activity. Deletion of a small region on each major domain (residues 6 to 57 and 652 to 712, respectively) was shown to compromise phyB activity differentially without interfering with spectral activity or dimerization. Deletion of residues 6 to 57 caused a large increase in the fluence rate of continuous red light (Rc) required for maximal seedling responsiveness, indicating a marked decrease in efficiency of light signal perception or processing per mole of mutant phyB. In contrast, deletion of residues 652 to 712 resulted in a photoreceptor that retained saturation of seedling responsiveness to Rc at low fluence rates but at a response level much below the maximal response elicited by the parent molecule. This deletion apparently reduces the maximal biological activity per mole of phyB without a major decrease in efficiency of signal perception, thus suggesting disruption of a process downstream of signal perception.

40|$|Flagella of the {{bacteria}} Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni are important virulence determinants, whose proper assembly and function are dependent upon glycosylation at multiple positions by sialic acid-like sugars, such as 5, 7 -diacetamido- 3, 5, 7, 9 -tetradeoxy-L-glycero-L-manno-nonulosonic acid (pseudaminic acid (Pse)). The fourth enzymatic step in the pseudaminic acid pathway, the hydrolysis of UDP- 2, 4 -diacetamido- 2, 4, 6 -trideoxy- 3 ̆b 2 -L-altropyranose to generate 2, 4 -diacetamido- 2, 4, 6 -trideoxy-L-altropyranose, is performed by the nucleotide sugar hydrolase PseG. To better understand the molecular basis of the PseG catalytic reaction, we have determined the crystal structures of C. jejuni PseG in apo-form and as a complex with its UDP product at 1. 8 and 1. 85 5 resolution, respectively. In addition, molecular modeling was utilized to {{provide insight into the}} structure of the PseG-substrate complex. This modeling identifies a His 92 ̆ 077 -coordinated water molecule as the putative nucleophile and suggests the UDP-sugar substrate adopts a twist-boat conformation upon binding to PseG, enhancing the exposure of the anomeric bond cleaved and favoring inversion at C- 1. Furthermore, based on these structures a series of amino acid <b>substitution</b> <b>derivatives</b> were constructed, altering residues within the active site, and each was kinetically characterized to examine its contribution to PseG catalysis. In conjunction with structural comparisons, the almost complete inactivation of the PseG H 17 F and H 17 L derivatives suggests that His 92 ̆ 077 functions as an active site base, thereby activating the nucleophilic water molecule for attack of the anomeric C 2 ̆ 013 O bond of the UDP-sugar. As the PseG structure reveals similarity to those of glycosyltransferase family- 28 members, in particular that of Escherichia coli MurG, these findings may also be of relevance for the mechanistic understanding of this important enzyme family.

40|$|In Escherichia coli, the GlpT transporter, {{a member}} of the major {{facilitator}} superfamily, moves external glycerol 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) into the cytoplasm in exchange for cytoplasmic phosphate. Study of intact cells showed that both GlpT and HisGlpT, a variant with an N-terminal six-histidine tag, are inhibited (50 % inhibitory concentration ≈ 35 μM) by the hydrophilic thiol-specific agent p-mercurichlorobenzosulfonate (PCMBS) in a substrate-protectable fashion; by contrast, two other thiol-directed probes, N-maleimidylpropionylbiocytin (MPB) and [2 -(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), have no effect. Use of variants in which the HisGlpT native cysteines are replaced individually by serine or glycine implicates Cys- 176, on transmembrane helix 5 (TM 5), as the major target for PCMBS. The inhibitor sensitivity of purified and reconstituted HisGlpT or its cysteine <b>substitution</b> <b>derivatives</b> was found to be consistent with the findings with intact cells, except that a partial response to PCMBS was found for the C 176 G mutant, suggesting the presence of a mixed population of both right-side-out (RSO) (resistant) and inside-out (ISO) (sensitive) orientations after reconstitution. To clarify this issue, we studied a derivative (P 290 C) in which the RSO molecules can be blocked independently due to an MPB-responsive cysteine in an extracellular loop. In this derivative, comparisons of variants with (P 290 C) and without (P 290 C/C 176 G) Cys- 176 indicated that this residue shows substrate-protectable inhibition by PCMBS in the ISO orientation in proteoliposomes. Since PCMBS gains access to Cys- 176 from both periplasmic and cytoplasmic surfaces of the protein (in intact cells and in a reconstituted ISO orientation, respectively) and since access is unavailable when the substrate is present, we propose that Cys- 176 is located on the transport pathway and that TM 5 has a role in lining this pathway...|$|R
