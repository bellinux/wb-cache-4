25|$|The role of Pauline {{was cast}} after Walsh scouted schools all over New Zealand {{to find a}} Pauline 'look-alike'. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> finding an actress who resembled Pauline and had acting talent before {{discovering}} Melanie Lynskey. Kate Winslet auditioned for the part of Juliet, winning the role over 175 other girls. The girls were both so absorbed by their roles that they kept on acting as Pauline and Juliet after the filming was done, as is described on Jackson's website.|$|E

Another message was sent and received but it did not reach Callaghan in time to process and use given his ignorance of radar and an appreciation of its accuracy—especially the reliability of ranges and bearings so obtained—along with the lack of practice coordinating radar information to visual data.|$|E

25|$|The WNCL was {{expanded}} in 2009–10 {{with the addition}} of the ACT, so ten round-robin matches were scheduled, and Edwards—now competing under her married name of Elliott—played in all but one. Having been dropped from the Australian team the previous season, she started well, making 52 and 30 as Victoria won both matches against Western Australia. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> against New South Wales, making 16 and 11 before running into form against South Australia. She took 3/29 from ten overs in a 108-run win in the first match, before amassing 92 the next day and taking 2/45 in a 67-run win. In the next match against the ACT, she took 3/23 from her quota and then scored an unbeaten 53 to help Victoria avoid a defeat, scraping home by one wicket. Victoria met New South Wales in the final and were denied the title for the second season in a row. Elliott took 2/28 from her two overs and made 17 before being run out as the defending champions won by 59 runs. She ended the season with 300 runs at 33.33 and took 14 wickets at an average of 19.64 and an economy rate of 2.93.|$|E

I guess they were kinda right, I had five. [...] "Dangerously in Love", [...] "Naughty Girl", [...] "Me, Myself and I", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love"." [...] Since [...] "Dilemma" [...] was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyoncé's management released, [...] "Work It Out", {{one of the songs}} on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former.|$|E

Rodrigo Santoro, who has been called [...] "the Brazilian Tom Cruise" [...] and [...] "the Brazilian Russell Crowe", was cast in his first major American {{television}} role as Paulo on Lost. Appearing {{in a total of}} seven episodes, Santoro was reportedly paid [...] "between $2634 and $6427 a week". Lindelof called Santoro [...] "talented" [...] and [...] "perfect for Lost because he's a face that the American audience is not familiar with", despite being an award-winning actor in his home country of Brazil. Part of the reason Santoro was cast over other actors was because his physique was deemed attractive; however, the writers said that they were not interested in writing for his character with that in mind, nor did he want them to. Santoro has stated he enjoyed working with Sanchez and hoped to return to work on Lost.|$|E

500|$|Cardinale's {{first film}} work was participating, along with classmates, {{in a short}} film by French {{director}} René Vautier, Anneaux d'or, successfully presented at the Berlin Film Festival. The film made her a minor local celebrity, and led to her being spotted by Jacques Baratier, who offered her a minor role in Goha. She accepted it reluctantly after Baratier explained he wanted a Tunisian actress rather than an Italian to star in the main role opposite the Egyptian actor Omar Sharif. The appearance nonetheless marked her feature-film debut. The turning point came in 1957 during the Italian Cinema Week in Tunis, when she won a competition for the [...] "Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia", with {{a trip to the}} Venice Film Festival as first prize. After being spotted by several film producers at the event, she was invited to study at the Experimental Cinematography Center in Rome under Tina Lattanzi. She attended briefly as, despite her extremely photogenic looks, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> with her acting assignments (partly owing to her difficulties with the Italian language). She left {{at the end of her}} first term and decided to return home, earning herself a cover story in the popular weekly Epoca triggered by her unexpected decision to turn her back on a career as a film star.|$|E

The ship also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. Bernd von Arnim joined the other destroyers in laying minefields off the British coast in November, when Bernd von Arnim, Hermann Künne and Wilhelm Heidkamp laid about 180 magnetic mines {{in the middle of}} the Thames Estuary on the night of 17/18 November. The destroyer , one trawler, and seven other ships totalling 27,565 Gross Register Tons (GRT) were sunk by this minefield. Four days later, she was one of the destroyers escorting the battleships [...] and [...] through the North Sea to break out into the North Atlantic. Together with her sisters Hans Lody and Erich Giese, Bernd von Arnim was to lay a minefield off Cromer during the night of 6/7 December, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> with two of her boilers and had to shut them down.

Her brother Greg later recalled several times she had gone out with a man before moving to Sarasota, but agreed <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> connecting socially in the beach resort town. He believed her constant self-deprecation for being [...] "dateless" [...] contributed to her ongoing depression. In a later interview, Greg stated that Christine had been in two serious relationships: the first had been when she was a teenager and was with a man in his twenties who had subsequently died in a car accident, and the second had been as an adult, but she had broken it off under pressure from her antisemitic father because the boyfriend was Jewish.|$|E
2500|$|Malin Matsdotter were {{questioned}} and cautioned {{to tell the}} truth. She was thoroughly questioned regarding her religious instruction.

[...] Her language difficulties attracted attention when she had difficulty reading the prayers the court instructed her to: she did not know them herself, and even had trouble repeating them when they were read to her. [...] The court noted that she hesitated in a suspicious way when she was to repeat the prayers word by word. [...] The fact that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> reading was in fact uncommon in 17th-century Stockholm: since the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, every citizen regardless of class or sex was by law required to be able to read, so that {{they may be able to}} read the bible. The fact that she seems to have preferred Finnish considered strange by the court, as the capital had a great Finnish minority from the nearby province who even had their own congregation; what was regarded suspicious for a person accused of consorting with the Devil was, rather, the fact that she had difficulty to read and pronounce words from the holy scripture.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes.

Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E

She threw herself into the labour, the child was everything. Her imagination was all occupied here. She was a mother.

All the future rang to {{her out of the}} sound of the baby's crying and cooing, she balanced the coming years of life in her hands, as she nursed the child. The passionate sense of fulfilment, of the future germinated in her, made her vivid and powerful. All the future was in her hands, {{in the hands of the}} woman. And before this baby was ten months old, she was again with child. She seemed to be in the fecund of storm life, every moment was full and busy with productiveness to her.
