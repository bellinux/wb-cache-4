5|$|The Bc5 may not <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> {{useful in}} this attack, but by eyeing e3 {{it makes it}} {{difficult}} for White to play f4 to chase away the black knight; furthermore, the attack on e3 is sometimes intensified with major pieces doubling on the e-file. Besides, the Bc5 can sometimes be recycled to the b8–h2 diagonal via Bc5–a7–b8, to apply still more pressure on h2. It can also stay on the a7–g1 diagonal to put pressure on f2, if White pushes e3–e4 at some stage.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin is a bird of the colder {{waters of}} the North Atlantic Ocean. It breeds on the coasts of north west Europe, the Arctic fringes and eastern North America. More than 90% of the global {{population}} is found in Europe (4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, equalling 9,550,000-11,600,000 adults) and colonies in Iceland alone are home to 60% of the world's Atlantic puffins. The largest colony in the western Atlantic (estimated at more than 260,000 pairs) {{can be found at}} the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve, south of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Other major breeding locations include the north and west coasts of Norway, the Faroe Islands, the Shetland and Orkney islands, the west coast of Greenland and the coasts of Newfoundland. Smaller sized colonies are also found elsewhere in the British Isles, the Murmansk area of Russia, Novaya Zemlya, Spitzbergen, Labrador, Nova Scotia and Maine. Islands <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> attractive to the birds for breeding as compared to mainland sites.|$|E
25|$|The genuine {{color of}} egg spots is a yellow, red or orange inner circle with a colorless ring {{surrounding}} the shape. Through phylogenetic analysis, using the mitochondrial ND2 gene, {{it was hypothesized}} that the true egg spots evolved in the common ancestor of the Astatoreochromis-lineage and the modern Haplochrominis. This ancestor was most likely riverine in origin, based upon the most parsimonious representation of habitat type in the cichlid family. The presence of egg-spots in a turbid riverine environment, would <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> beneficial and necessary for intra-species communication.|$|E

25|$|If a wicket falls {{near the}} end of a day's play, {{especially}} if the light is failing, or if the bowlers <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> confident, the captain may choose to send in a non-specialist batsman, referred to as a nightwatchman. If the nightwatchman does not get out before the end of that day's play then the specialist batsman will have been protected, and will not need to bat until the following day when conditions are likely to have improved. If the nightwatchman does get out, the cost of losing a late wicket will have been minimised, because the specialist batsman is still available to bat.|$|E
500|$|The 2006 IUCN Red List names 1,173 {{fish species}} that are {{threatened}} with extinction. Included are species such as Atlantic cod, Devil's Hole pupfish, coelacanths, and great white sharks. Because fish live underwater they {{are more difficult to}} study than terrestrial animals and plants, and information about fish populations is often lacking. However, freshwater fish <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies. For example, the Devil's Hole pupfish occupies only a single [...] pool.|$|E
500|$|McKay's boxing {{relied on}} brute {{strength}} rather than scientific pugilistic theory, but the fight still lasted for 47rounds before McKay collapsed under a left-handed punch to the throat {{that did not}} <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> powerful. He was carried to his corner where he regained consciousness, complaining of severe headache. He was bled by a surgeon {{on the scene and}} taken to a local inn, the Watts Arms, where he died at 9:00pm the following evening. A post mortem examination found the cause of death to be brain damage. McKay was buried in Hanslope Churchyard with the following inscription on his headstone: ...|$|E

500|$|Philosophers of mind {{call the}} {{subjective}} aspects of mental events [...] "qualia" [...] or [...] "raw feels". There {{is something that}} {{it is like to}} feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – {{what it is like to}} see the color red.|$|E
500|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin and Joseph Johnson, Wollstonecraft's {{publisher}} and close friend, contacted Fanny's father, {{but he was}} uninterested in raising his child. (Neither Wollstonecraft nor her daughter ever saw Gilbert Imlay after 1796.) Wollstonecraft's two sisters, Eliza Bishop and Everina Wollstonecraft, Fanny's only two living female relatives, were anxious to care for her; Godwin, disliking them, turned down their offer. Several times throughout Fanny's childhood Wollstonecraft's sisters asked Godwin {{to allow them to}} raise their niece and each time he refused. Godwin himself did not <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> ready for parenthood and he now had two small children to raise and no steady source of income. However, he was determined to care for them. During these early years of Fanny's life, Joseph Johnson served as an [...] "unofficial trustee" [...] for her as he had occasionally for her mother. He even willed her £200, but Godwin owed Johnson so much money upon his death in 1809 that Johnson's heirs demanded Godwin pay the money back as part of his arrears.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Tom Shales for The Washington Post criticized Morrison as Will, writing: [...] "Morrison is {{definitely}} not gleeful and doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> well equipped to be a high-school impresario; as pipers go, he's not even marginally pied." [...] Shales was more positive regarding Lynch's performance, and concluded that: [...] "Dramatic tension isn't exactly plentiful, but pleasingly staged songs and a general aura of retro ingenuousness come through, and seem awfully if fitfully refreshing". Variety Brian Lowry also highlighted acting and characterization issues with the show, writing that: [...] "It's among the adults, alas – who are mostly over-the-top buffoons – where Glee nearly sails off the rails, from Jane Lynch's tyrannical cheer matron to the salivating football coach, {{a bit like the}} Rydell High gang in Grease." [...] Lowry felt that: [...] "Modest redemption comes from the stammering Emma (Heroes Jayma Mays), who has a clear crush on Will, even though he's married to his high-school sweetheart. Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, said wife (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times has called Glee: [...] "the first show in a long time that's just plain full-throttle, no-guilty-pleasure-rationalizations-necessary fun." [...] She praised Lynch as Sue, writing that [...] "Lynch alone makes Glee worth watching", and claimed that overall: [...] "The music, though by no means edgy, is energetic with a wide audience appeal, like the show itself.|$|E

2500|$|By today's standards, csh may not <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> more C-like {{than many}} other popular {{scripting}} languages. [...] But through the 80s and 90s, the difference was seen as striking, particularly when compared to [...] Bourne shell (also known as sh), the then-dominant shell written by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs. [...] This example illustrates the C shell's more conventional expression operators and syntax.|$|E
2500|$|Hops, a plant used {{in making}} beer, can cause {{malignant}} hyperthermia in dogs, usually with fatal results. Certain breeds, such as Greyhounds, <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> sensitive to hop toxicity, but hops {{should be kept}} away from all dogs. Even small amounts of hops can trigger a potentially deadly reaction, even if the hops are [...] "spent" [...] after use in brewing.|$|E
2500|$|Unger {{therefore}} {{argues that}} different {{responses to these}} sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics – in this new case, he says, the only important {{difference is that the}} man in the yard does not <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> [...] "involved". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not [...] "fair game", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.|$|E

2500|$|A false {{awakening}} is one {{in which}} the subject believes he/she has woken up, whether from a lucid or a non-lucid dream, but is in fact still asleep. [...] Sometimes the experience is so realistic perceptually (the sleeper seeming to wake {{in his or her own}} bedroom, for example) that insight is not achieved at once, or even until the dreamer really wakes up and realises that what has occurred was hallucinatory. [...] Such experiences <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> liable to occur to those who deliberately cultivate lucid dreams. [...] However, they may also occur spontaneously and be associated with the experience of sleep paralysis.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 December 1799, Championnet {{got news}} that the {{government}} accepted his resignation and appointed André Masséna to lead the Army of Italy. The following day he became sick and the senior general [...] Jean-Antoine Marbot assumed temporary command. For a week, Championnet's illness did not <b>seem</b> <b>particularly</b> severe and he granted leave to Suchet on 3 January. However, he rapidly declined and died on 9 January 1800. The general was so impoverished that his staff {{had to pay for}} his burial at Antibes. Championnet was a victim of typhus, which had broken out in Nice in mid-October 1799. The disease was first seen in a military hospital and quickly spread to the army and civilians. The number of deaths soared so that disposal of the numerous corpses became a problem. The epidemic reached its peak at the end of January and only began to recede in March 1800.|$|E
