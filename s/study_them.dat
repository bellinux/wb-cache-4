5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to <b>study</b> <b>them,</b> had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E

5|$|While {{attending}} Columbia, Beebe persuaded his {{professors to}} sponsor him and several fellow students taking research trips to Nova Scotia, where {{he continued his}} hobby of collecting, as well as attempting to photograph difficult-to-observe scenes of birds and other animals. Several of Beebe's photographs from these expeditions were purchased by Columbia professors to use as slides during their lectures. During these trips Beebe also developed an interest in dredging, the practice of using nets to haul up animals that lived deep underwater, and attempting to <b>study</b> <b>them</b> before they died or disintegrated. Beebe never applied to receive a degree from Columbia, although years later he was granted honorary doctorates from both Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E
5|$|The CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made {{friendly}} overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party {{relations with}} the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949). In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can <b>study</b> <b>them.</b> For instance, the longevity of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party is attributed to the personalization {{of power in the}} al-Assad family, the strong presidential system, the inheritance of power, which passed from Hafez al-Assad to his son Bashar al-Assad, and the role given to the Syrian military in politics.|$|E

25|$|The Negrito are a pre-Austronesian {{people who}} {{migrated}} from mainland Asia and {{were among the}} earliest human beings to settle the Philippines.

Their ways of life remain mostly free from Western and Islamic influences. Scholars <b>study</b> <b>them</b> to try to understand pre-Hispanic culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome was}} that the Casket letters were {{accepted}} by the English commissioners as genuine after {{a study of the}} handwriting, and of the information contained therein. However, Queen Mary's commissioners were refused access to the letters to review or to <b>study</b> <b>them.</b> Yet, as Queen Elizabeth had wished, the inquiry reached the conclusion that nothing was proven. The outcome of the enquiry was to prolong doubts about Mary's character that Elizabeth used to prevent the Queens meeting.|$|E

25|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and legends {{belonging}} to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

25|$|Chavchavadze {{was educated}} at the {{elementary}} level by the deacon of the village before he moved to Tbilisi where he attended the prestigious Academy for Nobility in 1848. However, from an early age, Ilia was influenced by his parents who were highly educated in classical literature, Georgian history and poetry. From his parents, Ilia learned the inspiring stories of Georgian heroism in classical historical novels. In his autobiography, Ilia refers to his mother, Princess Mariam Chavchavadze, who knew most Georgian novels and poems by heart and encouraged her children to <b>study</b> <b>them.</b> Ilia also described the influence of the deacon's storytelling, which gave him an artistic inspiration, later applied in his novel writing.|$|E

25|$|Seeing {{that there}} are many reasons for expounding the Madhyamakalankara, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, our {{incomparable}} guide, unbounded in his kindness, whose very name I hardly dare to pronounce, who is the very personification of the compassion of the abbot Bodhisattva, of the master Padmasambhava, and of King Trisongdetsen, who is the sovereign among the learned and accomplished, who is supreme Manjushri appearing {{in the form of a}} monk in saffron robes, and whose renown fills the world, gave to me the Indian and Tibetan commentaries on the Madhyamakalankara, asking me to <b>study</b> <b>them</b> well and to compose a commentary.

25|$|X-rays {{were found}} emanating from Crookes tubes, {{experimental}} discharge tubes invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the cathode rays, that is energetic electron beams, that were first {{created in the}} tubes. Crookes tubes created free electrons by ionization of the residual air in the tube by a high DC voltage of anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the cathode to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the anode or the glass wall of the tube. Many of the early Crookes tubes undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below. Wilhelm Röntgen {{was the first to}} systematically <b>study</b> <b>them,</b> in 1895.|$|E

25|$|Young, naive Canadian {{biologist}} Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) {{is assigned}} {{by the government to}} travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the area's caribou population is declining, believed to be due to wolf-pack attacks; amongst his orders to <b>study</b> <b>them</b> he is also given a gun and required to kill one wolf and examine its stomach contents. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler {{in the middle of a}} sub-zero frozen Arctic lake. Tyler is at a loss of what to do about his situation until he is rescued by a traveling Inuit named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who transports him and his gear off the ice and builds a shelter for him.|$|E
25|$|The above {{fact about}} {{existence}} of nonconstant meromorphic functions {{can be used}} to show that any compact Riemann surface is a projective variety, i.e. can be given by polynomial equations inside a projective space. Actually, it can be shown that every compact Riemann surface can be embedded into complex projective 3-space. This is a surprising theorem: Riemann surfaces are given by locally patching charts. If one global condition, namely compactness, is added, the surface is necessarily algebraic. This feature of Riemann surfaces allows one to <b>study</b> <b>them</b> with either the means of analytic or algebraic geometry. The corresponding statement for higher-dimensional objects is false, i.e. there are compact complex 2-manifolds which are not algebraic. On the other hand, every projective complex manifold is necessarily algebraic, see Chow's theorem.|$|E
25|$|When a young Roman {{inadvertently}} {{fell through}} a cleft in the Esquiline hillside {{at the end}} of the 15th century, he found himself in a strange cave or grotta filled with painted figures. Soon the young artists of Rome were having themselves let down on boards knotted to ropes to see for themselves. The fourth style frescoes that were uncovered then have faded to pale gray stains on the plaster now, but the effect of these freshly rediscovered grottesche decorations was electrifying in the early Renaissance, which was just arriving in Rome. When Pinturicchio, Raphael and Michelangelo crawled underground and were let down shafts to <b>study</b> <b>them,</b> carving their names on the walls to let the world know they had been there, the paintings were a revelation of the true world of antiquity. Beside the graffiti signatures of later tourists, like Casanova and the Marquis de Sade scratched into a fresco inches apart (British Archaeology June 1999), are the autographs of Domenico Ghirlandaio, Martin van Heemskerck, and Filippino Lippi.|$|E
