40|$|This {{contribution}} considers adding customer end-point separation in {{spectrum management}} calculations in Annex A {{of the draft}} Spectrum Management Standard. It is shown that a model with customer endpoint <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> a distribution cable decreases the performance of guarded services. A model with customer end-point <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> drop and inside-wire increases the performance of guarded services, but only very slightly because the separation is only about 100 ft. A model with customer end-point <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> both the distribution cable and the drop wire is briefly examined and its impact is mixed, sometimes the performance of guarded services increases slightly, and sometimes it decreases slightly. The overall change is negligible. Is recommended to use no more than 100 ft customer end-point separation in spectrum management calculations. _______________________________ T 1 E 1. 4 / 99 - 472 1 1.

40|$|When {{guinea pig}} pups are {{isolated}} {{for a few}} hours in a novel environment, they exhibit a distinctive passive behavioral response that appears to be mediated by proinflammatory activity. Recently, we observed that pups separated on two consecutive days show an enhanced (sensitized) passive response on the second day. In Experiment 1, pups receiving intracerebroventricular infusion of 50 ng of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 10 prior to a first separation failed to show a sensitized behavioral response to separation the next day. In Experiment 2, pups separated on Days 1 and 2, or just 2, showed an increase in passive responding during <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> Day 5. Pups injected with the bacterial antigen lipopolysacchride (LPS; 75 μg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) prior to <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> Day 1 showed an increase in passive behavior several days later not shown by pups injected with saline prior to Day 1 separation. However, injection of LPS without <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> the first day did not enhance responding during an initial <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> the second day. These results suggest that immune activation is necessary, but not sufficient, to account for the sensitization of passive behavior of isolated guinea pig pups the following day, that boosting proinflammatory activity during an initial separation may promote sensitization several days later, and that the sensitized response persists for at least several days...|$|R

40|$|The runner cone {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the performance of elbow draft tube and de facto of low head machines. An earlier <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> the runner cone deteriorates the pressure recovery and thus the overall efficiency of the machine. Control of the <b>separation</b> point <b>on</b> the runner cone is therefore of interest to improve efficiency at any regime. One alternative to control the <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> the runner cone may be to rotate the runner cone with a differ-ent angular velocity than the runner blades. In the present work, the effect of runner cone angular rotation on elbow draft tube, typical in Kaplan turbine, is investigated using numerical simulations. The Turbine- 99 test case (T- 99) is used as benchmark {{at the top of the}} propeller curve. Simulations are performed for 4 different angular rotations:- 595 (stipulated in T- 99), 0, + 600 and + 1200 rpm. The results indicate a delay of the <b>separation</b> <b>on</b> the cone at 0, + 600 and + 1200 rpm. The mean pressure recovery increases in all cases. The improvement reaches 6. 6 % for the mean pressure recovery for an angular velocity of + 600 rpm where separation disappear, while the loss factor decreases with 23. 6 %...|$|R
