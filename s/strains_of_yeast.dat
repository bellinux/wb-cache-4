25|$|Instead of yeast, {{bacteria}} play {{a fundamental}} role in malolactic fermentation {{which is essentially}} the conversion of malic acid into lactic acid. This has the benefit of reducing some of the tartness and making the resulting wine taste softer. Depending on the style of wine that the winemaker is trying to produce, malolactic fermentation may take place at the very same time as the yeast fermentation. Alternatively, some <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast</b> may be developed that can convert L-malate to L-lactate during alcohol fermentation. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ML01 (S. cerevisiae strain ML01), which carries a gene encoding malolactic enzyme from Oenococcus oeni and a gene encoding malate permease from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. cerevisiae strain ML01 has received regulatory approval in both Canada and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Although {{pseudoephedrine}} occurs naturally as an alkaloid {{in certain}} plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the Ephedra species, {{also known as}} ma huang, in which it occurs together with other isomers of ephedrine), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from yeast fermentation of dextrose {{in the presence of}} benzaldehyde. In this process, specialized <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast</b> (typically a variety of Candida utilis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC). L-PAC is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via reductive amination.|$|E

25|$|Torrontés {{produces}} some of {{the most}} distinctive white wines in Argentina, characterized by floral Muscat-like aromas and a spicy note. The grape requires careful handling during the winemaking process with temperature control during fermentation and a sensitivity to certain <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast.</b> The grape is most widely planted in the northern provinces of La Rioja and Salta, particularly the Calchaquí Valleys, but has spread to Mendoza. In response to international demand, plantings of Chardonnay have steadily increased. The University of California, Davis produced a special clone of the variety (known as the Mendoza clone) that, despite it propensity to develop millerandage, is still widely used in Argentina and Australia. Argentine Chardonnay has shown to thrive in high altitude plantings and is being increasing planted in the Tupungato region on vineyard sites located at altitudes around nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 meters).|$|E
500|$|Two unique <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast</b> were {{traditionally}} used; one highly flocculent {{strain that}} {{was responsible for}} most of the fermentation in the first few days, and the other, a powdery and less flocculant strain, that was slower and finished off the beer in the fermentation vats and in the bottles. [...] Until the end of the 19th century, the breweries that produced Grodziskie used a single strain of yeast that was characterized by low attenuation and early flocculation. [...] However, that strain was lost in the early 20th century. [...] After World War II, yeast was imported from the Groterjan Brewery in Berlin. That [...] yeast was not well suited for producing Grodziskie and was frequently contaminated with spoilage organisms including Lactobacillus. [...] In the 1960s, the state-owned brewery was able to isolate and maintain suitable <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast</b> that produced the desired characteristics, but only the highly-flocculant strain has been preserved to this day. [...] Without access to the actual yeast used historically, most modern recreations of Grodziskie typically use ale yeasts that do not contribute a significant amount of yeast character to the beer.|$|E
500|$|After the boil, the wort was cooled and {{fermented}} in open wooden vats at [...] [...] The two <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast</b> {{were added}} {{at the same}} time, and fermentation would proceed rapidly. [...] After one day of fermentation, the thick foam that formed {{on the top of}} the fermentation vat was skimmed off and discarded. After 60 hours, up to 50% of the available sugars would have been fermented by the yeast, and thick clumps of yeast were skimmed off of the surface and harvested for reuse. [...] The beer was then pumped with sterile air into clarification tanks. [...] Isinglass was added to clarify the beverage, and then it was bottled.|$|E

2500|$|James Busby's {{collection}} is the likely origin of Hunter Valley Shiraz {{and today the}} Hunter Valley is {{home to some of}} the oldest own rooted Shiraz vine in the world with some vineyards boasting vines that are in excess of 120 years of age. Hunter Valley Shiraz is characterised but its astringent, gamy noted but has a tendency to develop in the bottle over 20 to 30 years into a silky, texture earthy wine with notes reminiscent of a Rhone. Traditionally Hunter Shiraz has carried the descriptor of [...] "sweaty saddle". While this was once thought to be a terroir characteristic of the areas volcanic soils, it is now known to be caused by ethyl-4-phenol that comes from the exposure of the wine to certain <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast</b> in the Brettanomyces family.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{introduction}} of active yeasts to the grape must, phosphates {{are attached to the}} sugar and the six-carbon sugar molecules begin to be split into three-carbon pieces and go through a series of rearrangement reactions. During this process, the carboxylic carbon atom is released in the form of carbon dioxide with the remaining components becoming acetaldehyde. The absence of oxygen in this [...] process allows the acetaldehyde to be eventually converted, by reduction, to ethanol. During the conversion of acetaldehyde, a small amount is converted, by oxidation, to acetic acid which, in excess, can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity (vinegar taint). After the yeast has exhausted its life cycle, they fall {{to the bottom of the}} fermentation tank as sediment known as lees. Yeast ceases its activity whenever all of the sugar in must has been converted into other chemicals or whenever the alcohol content has reached 15% alcohol per unit volume; a concentration strong enough to halt the enzymatic activity of almost all <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In winemaking, {{there are}} distinctions made between ambient yeasts which are {{naturally}} present in wine cellars, vineyards {{and on the}} grapes themselves (sometimes known as a grape's [...] "bloom" [...] or [...] "blush") and cultured yeast which are specifically isolated and inoculated for use in winemaking. The most common genera of wild yeasts found in winemaking include Candida, Klöckera/Hanseniaspora, Metschnikowiaceae, Pichia and Zygosaccharomyces. Wild yeasts can produce high-quality, unique-flavored wines; however, they are often unpredictable and may introduce less desirable traits to the wine, and can even contribute to spoilage. It {{should be noted that}} few yeast, and lactic and acetic acid bacterial colonies naturally live on the surface of grapes, but traditional wine makers, particularly in Europe, advocate use of ambient yeast as a characteristic of the region's terroir; nevertheless, many winemakers prefer to control fermentation with predictable cultured yeast. The cultured yeasts most commonly used in winemaking belong to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (also known as [...] "sugar yeast") species. Within this species are several hundred different <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeast</b> that can be used during fermentation to affect the heat or vigor of the process and enhance or suppress certain flavor characteristics of the varietal. The use of different strains of yeasts is a major contributor to the diversity of wine, even among the same grape variety. Alternative, non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeasts are being used more prevalently in the industry to add greater complexity to wine. After a winery has been in operation for a number of years, few yeast strains are actively involved in the fermentation process. The use of active dry yeasts reduces the variety of strains that appear in spontaneous fermentation by outcompeting those strains that are naturally present.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Examination of the {{antibiotic}} powers towards bacteria and moulds <b>of</b> 150 <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> <b>yeasts</b> from the British National Collection <b>of</b> <b>Yeast</b> Cultures {{has revealed that}} whereas none exhibited marked antibacterial properties certain of them inhibited the growth <b>of</b> moulds. <b>Strains</b> <b>of</b> Cundida pulcherrima, when grown on a malt+yeast+peptone+glucose agar medium inhibited the growth <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> certain MUCOT, Pusarium and Penicillium spp. “he inhibition was due to pulcherriminic acid, a derivative of the red pigment, pulcherrimin, formed by Candidu pulchemvima.
