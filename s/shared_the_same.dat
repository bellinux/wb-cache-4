The fact that two closely related Hebridean rulers, Ragnall and Rǫgnvaldr, <b>shared</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> personal names, the same grandfather, and (at times) the same title, has perplexed modern historians and possibly mediaeval chroniclers as well.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{sisters and}} daughters were made either senior princesses, who <b>shared</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rank as kings, or princesses, who <b>shared</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rank as full marquesses; a princess's fief was {{typically}} {{the size of}} a county. The husband of a princess was ranked as a marquess. The daughters of kings were also princesses, but their fiefs were typically the smaller size of county districts, and could not be inherited by sons. Unlike the fiefs of kings and marquesses, the staffs of the princesses' fiefs answered directly to one of the Nine Ministers: the Minister of the Imperial Clan.|$|E

5|$|The empress, {{the legal}} {{wife of the}} emperor, also had {{an area of the}} palace {{separate}} from that of the emperor's private apartments, where the empress was expected to spend every fifth night with the emperor. Both the empress and the heir apparent received an income from the taxes of forty counties. She also had a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan), and many other subordinates, either male eunuchs or female maids, who took care of domestic needs. The concubines of the harem were subordinates of the empress and were ranked below her in fourteen grades by the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 49–33). However, the founder of Eastern Han abolished the fourteen salary-ranks in favor of three ranks with no definite salary; instead, the concubines were irregularly granted gifts. The chief concubine of Western Han, the Brilliant Companion, <b>shared</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> salary-rank as the Chancellor, while the concubine ranked just below her, the Favorite Beauty, <b>shared</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> salary-rank as any one of the Nine Ministers.|$|E
