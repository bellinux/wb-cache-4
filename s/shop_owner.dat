40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{discover}} what language was used by <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> in Bangor and Caernarfon when they were greeted in either English or Welsh by a customer. The question arised whether <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> would converge to a customer by speaking the same language. Two hypotheses were formulated {{on the basis of}} the Accommodation Theory: when the customer greets the <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> in English, the latter will respond in English because the <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> have a tendency to converge to their customers, and when the customer greets the <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> in Welsh, the latter will respond in Welsh because the <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> have a tendency to converge to their customers. Another aim was to find out the motives behind the language choices. The method consisted of eliciting data on the language choices as an active participant observer and a follow-up interview. The interviews were conducted to find out the reasons behind the language choices. In total, 40 <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> were greeted and interviewed: 20 in Bangor and 20 in Caernarfon. The results showed that when English was spoken in the greeting, the <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> responded in English, and, when Welsh was used by the interviewer, the <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> responded in English as well. The reasons for the language choices were diverse and ranged from the inability to speak Welsh to the interviewer’s accent. Hypothesis 1 turned out to be problematic. Although it seemed correct at first, it cannot be said that the shop owners’ use of English is convergence. Hypothesis 2 should be rejected since the majority of the participants used English to a Welsh greeting. Even when the <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> responded in Welsh, the reasons for the language choice did not suggest that convergence was involved...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study {{which seeks to}} understand how Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> run successful businesses in the township of Soweto in South Africa. This research report has three sections, namely (1) the academic paper which comprises a shortened literature review, the research method, findings, and the discussion; (2) an extended literature review and (3) the research methodology. It is important to mention that these three sections are related and not necessarily stand-alone sections. Despite the hostilities faced by the Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> from the host communities in South Africa, it is notable that they are successful, small-sized entrepreneurs in most townships of South Africa (SA). Previous research on Somalis has predominantly focused on their assimilation into the societies in their host countries, and on how they are led into self-employment because of the unfavourable labour markets in the host country. In this vein, {{there is a need}} to understand how they run successful businesses in the townships of SA. This study seeks to answer the following research question: How Do Somali <b>Shop</b> <b>Owners</b> Succeed in Running Businesses in Soweto, South Africa (SA) ? In pursuit of answers to the above research question, this study was confined to three locations in Soweto, namely Orlando West, Chiawelo and Rockville which have a relatively high number of Somali entrepreneurs who have been in operation for longer than three years. This qualitative study explored the multiple perspectives of reality of Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners.</b> Purposively, 14 Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> were identified initially using purposive sampling. Subsequently, theoretical sampling was used to identify Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> who were interviewed regarding how they successfully run their businesses in the locations of Orlando West, Chiawelo and Rockville in the township of Soweto. A total of eighteen semi-structured, in-depth and face-to-face interviews were conducted with these <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> as a means of gathering data to the point of saturating their perspectives. Data collection ceased when new perspectives were no longer evident as interviewees were being repetitive. Open-coding and constant comparison was used to analyse the data. The findings of the study show that ethnicity plays a predominant role in the success of the Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners.</b> The intra-ethnic networks and trust-based support systems are pivotal to how Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> run successful businesses in Soweto. The key findings manifested showed that various forms of support came from Somali communities, family and fellow countrymen which were also central to their success. Another key finding showed that Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> run their businesses by complementing, rather than predominantly competing with the other local businesses, which ultimately differentiates them in this way. The study also revealed that responsiveness to local customer needs by enhancing the value of their business to the locality is also characteristic of how Somali <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> build customer loyalty. This study contributes to our understanding of how Somali entrepreneurs conduct successful businesses in a hostile host country. The findings have implications for business development training and programmes which support immigrant entrepreneurs. The findings may also be extended to inform how business development programmes would be designed to equally support local entrepreneurs...|$|R

The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to investigate what strategies owners of independent coffee shops in Washington use to survive beyond the first 5 years. Five independent coffee <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> in Washington participated in the study and shared their practices and observations.

Three primary themes appeared from the study: community involvement, customer loyalty, and location. Encouraging community involvement generates product awareness, which creates new business. Based on the independent coffee <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> 2 ̆ 7 descriptions, community involvement, customer loyalty, and location were important strategies to increase profits.
