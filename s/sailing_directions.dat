25|$|The first printed atlas of {{nautical}} charts (De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt or The Mirror of Navigation / The Mariner's Mirror) {{was produced}} by Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer in Leiden in 1584. This atlas was the first attempt to systematically codify nautical maps. This chart-book combined an atlas of nautical charts and <b>sailing</b> <b>directions</b> with instructions for navigation on the western and north-western coastal waters of Europe. It {{was the first of}} its kind in the history of maritime cartography, and was an immediate success. The English translation of Waghenaer's work was published in 1588 and became so popular that any volume of sea charts soon became known as a “waggoner” (an atlas book of engraved nautical charts with accompanying printed <b>sailing</b> <b>directions),</b> the Anglicized form of Waghenaer's surname.|$|E

5000|$|In long-distance {{navigation}} {{through the}} open ocean, the sandglass or [...] "glass" [...] {{used to measure the}} time was a tool as important as the compass (which indicated <b>sailing</b> <b>direction,</b> and so ship's course). Filled with the amount of sand suitable for measuring a lapse of half an hour, each time the sand emptied was also called a [...] "glass"; eight glasses (four hours) defined a [...] "watch". The times determined by the sandglass, along with the record in the logbook of the speed measured with the [...] "chip log", permitted the ship's navigator to plot his map position. Multiplying the ship's speed by the time the course had been kept (measured with the glass), gave traveled distance, a simple, overall method termed dead reckoning.|$|R

40|$|In the IMAGO project, {{the problem}} of finding wooden shipwrecks buried in the {{fine-grained}} sediment bottoms of shallow Dutch inland waterways is addressed. A trial survey was carried out, using a Very High Resolution 3 D seismic acquisition system, which consists of a single source and 8 streamers. With a suitable shot interval and a smart recording strategy we can obtain a subsurface spatial sampling grid of 0. 5 by 0. 5 m. To support this dense grid, accurate navigation data is obtained by two DGPS antennas enabling us to calculate {{the orientation of the}} streamers independent of the <b>sailing</b> <b>direction.</b> Normal move out velocity is not critical to the stacking process, but vertical position variations, together with horizontal (offset) variations can be detrimental. Aided by the multibeam echo sounder and by picking the water bottom reflection times from the seismic data, the image is greatly enhanced...|$|R

2500|$|In October 1820, Phillip Parker King {{suggested}} that the Tryal Rocks were the Montebello Islands: [...] "May not the Tryal Rocks also {{be some of the}} low islands that skirt the coast? ...There remains {{no doubt in my mind}} but that Barrow's Island and Trimouille Island, and the numerous reefs around them, are the identical Tryal Rocks which have been the theme and dread of every voyager to the eastern islands for the two last centuries... the only argument against the probability of this supposition is their longitude; but during the month of July the current sets with great strength to the westward and might occasion considerable errors in ships' reckoning, which, in former days, were so imperfectly kept that no dependence can be placed upon them." [...] This error was repeated in 1846, when John Lort Stokes placed the Tryal Rocks between the Montebello Islands and Barrow Island. Admiralty <b>Sailing</b> <b>Directions</b> of 1917 further claimed that [...] "Tryal Rocks awash at high water are near the outer edge of the S.W. part of Monte Bello Islands reef and five miles (8 km) off the North extreme of Barrow Island".|$|E
2500|$|Working on the {{assumption}} that the discoveries at the Acheron could challenge the traditional assumptions about the Odysseys geography, Tim Severin sailed a replica Greek sailing vessel (originally built for his attempt to retrace the steps of Jason and the Argonauts) along the [...] "natural" [...] route from Troy to Ithaca, following the <b>sailing</b> <b>directions</b> that could be teased out of the Odyssey. Along the way he found locations at the natural turning and dislocation points which, he claimed, agreed with the text much more closely than the usual identifications. However, he also came to the conclusion that the sequence of adventures from Circe onwards derived from a separate itinerary to the sequence that ended with the Laestrygonians and was possibly derived from the stories of the Argonauts. He placed many of the later episodes on the north west Greek coast, near the Acheron. Along the way he found on the map Cape Skilla (at the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf) and other names that implied traditional links with the Odyssey. Severin agrees with the common opinion that the Lotus Eaters are in North Africa (although he placed them in modern Libya rather than Tunisia) and that Scherie is Corcyra.|$|E

5000|$|The volta do mar was a sailing {{technique}} {{discovered in}} successfully {{returning from the}} Atlantic islands, where the pilot first had to sail far to the west in order to catch usable following winds, and return to Europe. This was a counter-intuitive <b>sailing</b> <b>direction,</b> as it required the pilot to steer {{in a direction that}} was perpendicular to the ports of Portugal. Lack of this information may have doomed the thirteenth-century expedition of Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi, who were headed towards the as yet unknown Canary Islands and were lost; once there, without understanding the Atlantic gyre and the volta do mar, they would have been unable to beat upwind to the Strait of Gibraltar and home. Discovering this technique was crucial for returning from future discoveries; for example Christopher Columbus would never have returned from America without applying the volta do mar by sailing northwards from the Caribbean through the Horse Latitudes to catch the prevailing mid-latitude westerlies.|$|R
