40|$|Abstract Based on {{features}} of the reproductive morphology in Curdieaflabellata from New Zealand, Curdiea is adistinct genus within theGracilariaceae. Diagnostic are the complete absence of sterile gonimoblast tissue within the cystocarp; early cytological modification of the inner pericarp; an extensive network of <b>secondary</b> <b>fusions</b> between carposporophytic andgarnetophytic tissues in which gonimoblast cells fuse onto inner pericarp cells, followed by further fusions of cells in {{the floor of the}} cystocarp around existing pit-connections; fusion of gonimoblast cells directly with the fusion cell around primary pit-connections; organisation of all but the most basal gonimoblast cells into long chains; basipetal development of the small carposporangia; production of tetrasporangia in nemathecia.

40|$|The {{development}} of the insect head tagma involves massive rearrangements and <b>secondary</b> <b>fusions</b> of segment anlagen during embryogenesis. Due {{to the lack of}} reliable morphological markers, the number, identity, and sequence of the head segments, particularly in the pregnathal region, are still a matter of ongoing debates. We examined the complex array of internal structures of the embryonic Drosophila melanogaster head such as the sensory structures and nerves of the peripheral and stomatogastric nervous systems, and we used embryonic head mutations causing a lack of overlapping segment anlagen to unravel the segmental identity and the sequence of the neural elements. Our results provide evidence for seven distinct segments in the Drosophila head, each characterized by a specific set of sensory neurons, consistent with the proposal that insects, myriapods, and crustaceans share a monophyletic evolutionary tree from a common annelid-like ancestor...|$|R
40|$|Malunion and {{nonunion}} after {{ankle and}} pilon fractures regularly {{lead to the}} development of painful functional impairment even in cases of only mild axial deviation or residual joint incongruity. Involvement of the tibial pilon results in rapid progression of posttraumatic ankle arthritis. Corrective osteotomy with joint preservation aims at secondary anatomical reconstruction with functional rehabilitation. This requires a careful preoperative analysis and will be possible in carefully selected cases only. Prerequisites for successful reconstruction are intact cartilage, sufficient bone quality, residual joint function and good patient compliance. Since the works of B. G. Weber, joint-sparing osteotomy is an established treatment option for malunited malleolar fractures with reliable long-term results and low rates of complications and <b>secondary</b> <b>fusions.</b> Key to success is the re-establishment of the length of the distal fibula and repositioning into the tibial incisura in cases of syndesmotic instability. Corrections of the medial malleolus and posterior tibial fragment are less frequent. Corrective intra-articular osteotomies for malunited pilon fractures are rarely feasible because of manifest arthritis at the time of patient presentation in most cases. Besides case reports there is only one series of 14 patients available in the literature. At 5 -year follow-up, a good to excellent result was seen in 10 cases and <b>secondary</b> ankle <b>fusion</b> was done in 2 patients with a poor result. Anatomical reconstruction of malunited tibial pilon fractures appears to be a viable treatment option besides arthroplasty and fusion in carefully selected patient...|$|R

Generally these species are small, free swimming and exhibit a vibrant green colour. What sets the genus apart from other photosynthetic species {{is the presence of}} its rigid cytoskeleton (although some species have semi-rigid or plastic cytoskeleton) made up of pellicular strips and its predominantly flat, leaf-shaped structure.

5000|$|In essence, the Teller-Ulam {{configuration}} {{relies on}} at least two instances of implosion occurring: first, the conventional (chemical) explosives in the primary would compress the fissile core, resulting in a fission explosion many times more powerful than that which chemical explosives could achieve alone (first stage). Second, the radiation from the fissioning of the primary would be used to compress and ignite the <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion</b> stage, resulting in a fusion explosion many times more powerful than the fission explosion alone. This chain of compression could conceivably be continued with an arbitrary number of tertiary fusion stages, each ignited more fusion fuel in the next stage although this is debated (see more: Arbitrarily large yield debate). Finally, efficient bombs (but not so-called neutron bombs) end with the fissioning of the final natural uranium tamper, something that could not normally be achieved without the neutron flux provided by the fusion reactions in secondary or tertiary stages. Such designs are suggested to be capable of being scaled up to an arbitrary large yield (with apparently as many fusion stages as desired), potentially {{to the level of a}} [...] "doomsday device." [...] However, usually such weapons were not more than a dozen megatons, which was generally considered enough to destroy even most hardened practical targets (for example, a control facility such as the Cheyenne Mountain Complex). Even such large bombs have been replaced by smaller-yield bunker buster type nuclear bombs (see more: nuclear bunker buster).|$|E

50|$|Energy {{released}} in the primary stage is transferred to the <b>secondary</b> (or <b>fusion)</b> stage. The exact mechanism whereby this happens is highly confidential. This energy compresses the fusion fuel and sparkplug; the compressed sparkplug becomes critical and undergoes a fission chain reaction, further heating the compressed fusion fuel to a high enough temperature to induce fusion, and also supplying neutrons that react with lithium to create tritium for fusion.|$|R
5000|$|Cohen in 1958 {{investigated}} a low-yield [...] "clean" [...] {{nuclear weapon}} {{and discovered that}} the [...] "clean" [...] bomb case thickness scales as the cube-root of yield. So {{a larger percentage of}} neutrons escapes from a small detonation, due to the thinner case required to reflect back X-rays during the <b>secondary</b> stage (<b>fusion)</b> ignition. For example, a 1-kiloton bomb only needs a case one-tenth the thickness of that required for 1-megaton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exact nature}} of how {{conjoined}} twins develop inutero remains unclear. Embryologists have traditionally attributed identical twinning as [...] "splitting or fission" [...] of either the inner cell mass of pleuripotential cells or early embryonic disc at 13-14 days of gestation just before the primitive streak. Some theorists suggested that conjoined twins develop {{as a result of}} the failed fusion of a single fertilized ovum. However a new hypothesis suggests that cranial fusion occurs between two separate embryos prior to the end of the 4th week of gestation. This is able to happen because the cranial neuropore is still open which is responsible for the ultimate fusion and formation of the brain stem and central nervous system. Furthermore, this <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion</b> of embryonic discs could implicate that intact skin will not fuse to other intact skin, including the ectoderm of the embryo. This means that two embryonic discs could only unite in locations where the ectoderm is absent. Moreover, the fusion occurs from neural folds of two separate, dorsally oriented embryonic discs, and the union can occur only after the ectoderm is disrupted to allow the neural and surface ectodermal layers to separate from each other. The union in craniopagus twins may happen at any portion of the calvarium. The juncture can involve either the entire diameter of the head or any portion of the head and can be positioned at a multitude of rotational angles. In fact, craniopagus twins are rarely found in a symmetrical union. Apart from this, the vertebral axes may have a straight line. Despite this, the angle of the vertebrae is the ultimate dictator in how the individuals heads actually face. The majority of twins face either the same way or the exact opposite direction.Many reviews suggest a practical four-category system that breaks down the craniopagus twins on the basis of vertical or angular configuration or on the basis if there were shared dural venous sinuses. This scheme was applied to 64 cases and has adequately described sets of twins for over the last 86 years.|$|E
40|$|During {{exocytosis}} in the pancreatic acinar cell, zymogen granules fuse {{directly with}} the apical plasma membrane and also with granules that have themselves fused with the plasma membrane. Together, these primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion</b> events constitute the process of compound exocytosis. It {{has been suggested that}} the sequential nature of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion</b> is a consequence of the requirement for plasma membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors, such as syntaxin 2, to enter the membrane of the primary fused granule. We have tested this possibility by determining the location of syntaxin 2 in unstimulated and stimulated pancreatic acini. Syntaxin 2 was imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Fused granules were detected both through their filling with the aqueous dye lysine-fixable Texas Red-dextran and through the decoration of their cytoplasmic surfaces with filamentous actin. In unstimulated cells, syntaxin 2 was exclusively present on the apical plasma membrane. In contrast, after stimulation, syntaxin 2 had moved into the membranes of fused granules, as judged by its location around dye-filled structures of 1 -mum diameter that were coated with filamentous actin. At long times of stimulation (5 min), the majority (85 %) of dye-filled granules were also positive for syntaxin 2. In contrast, at shorter times (1 min), more dye-filled granules (29 %) were syntaxin 2 -negative. We conclude that syntaxin 2 enters the membrane of a fused zymogen granule after the opening of the fusion pore, and we suggest that this movement might permit the onset of <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion...</b>|$|E
40|$|Examination of congenitally fused (blocked) {{vertebrae}} in {{this study}} suggests that non-development of the joint between articular facets results in fusion of the vertebral arches which in turn leads to <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion</b> of the bodies and hypoplasia of the intervertebral discs.

40|$|Displaced {{intra-articular}} calcaneal fractures {{are complex}} injuries. Classically these fractures {{are treated with}} open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or conservatively. When comparing these two treatment modalities, ORIF has a significantly higher rate of wound complications and conservative management has a significantly higher rate of <b>secondary</b> <b>fusions.</b> Therefore a minimally invasive surgical procedure was introduced at the Erasmus MC in 1998, combining the benefits of both techniques. The aim of this thesis was threefold: 1. To set a basis for improved translatability of outcome in future trials. 2. To determine the outcome of percutaneous reduction and internal fixation using the modified method of Forgon and Zadravecz. 3. To determine the best practice for delayed complications after displaced-intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Important conclusions were: 1. Uniformity in treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures More uniformity can been obtained {{in the evaluation of}} displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. The classification systems by Crosby and by Sanders are the most frequently applied out of the 64 available fracture classifications, and show the best interobserver agreement. The standard radiographs show little correlation with outcome. Out of 34 different outcome scoring systems the AOFAS and the MFS are the most useful. 2.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{patients}} where a subtalar arthrodesis is the recommended form of treatment, usually the grossly comminuted intra-articular fractures of the posterior facet (Sanders type IV). The timing of arthrodesis is controversial. Primary arthrodesis of the subtalar joint {{is an option}} in the treatment for a subset of calcaneal fractures, usually the most severely comminuted intra-articular fractures. Buckley demonstrated that Sanders type IV fractures have poor outcomes with either operative or non-operative treatment [47]. Several proposed reasons are: in comminuted fractures anatomical reconstruction of the posterior articular facet is not usually possible [10]; in high-energy injuries irreversible cartilage damage occurs {{at the time of}} fracture [59]; post-traumatic arthrosis is reported as high as 71 % and the need for <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion</b> is 5.5 times higher in this subgroup [60].|$|E

The fifth free sclerite of Ephemeroptera should be homologized with the median notal wing process of Neoptera, rather than it being homologous with a part of 1 Ax in Neoptera, as the authors postulated. Hypothesized <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion</b> of the axillary sclerites in Ephemeroptera and Odonata proposed by the authors is premature because the basal phylogeny of Pterygota is still poorly understood, and an alternative interpretation of morphological evolution (i. e., that undifferentiated axillary sclerites represent the ground plan of Pterygota) can also be drawn from the Ephemeroptera + Neoptera hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|Skeletal {{muscle is}} formed via fusion of myoblasts, a well-studied process in Drosophila. In {{vertebrates}} however, {{this process is}} less well understood, and whether there is evolutionary conservation with the proteins studied in flies is under investigation. Sticks and stones (Sns), a cell surface protein found on Drosophila myoblasts, has structural homology to nephrin. Nephrin is a protein expressed in kidney {{that is part of}} the filtration barrier formed by podocytes. No previous study has established any role for nephrin in skeletal muscle. We show, using two models, zebrafish and mice, that the absence of nephrin results in poorly developed muscles and incompletely fused myotubes, respectively. Although nephrin-knockout (nephrinKO) myoblasts exhibit prolonged activation of MAPK/ERK pathway during myogenic differentiation, expression of myogenin does not seem to be altered. Nevertheless, MAPK pathway blockade does not rescue myoblast fusion. Co-cultures of unaffected human fetal myoblasts with nephrinKO myoblasts or myotubes restore the formation of mature myotubes; however, the contribution of nephrinKO myoblasts is minimal. These studies suggest that nephrin plays a role in <b>secondary</b> <b>fusion</b> of myoblasts into nascent myotubes, thus establishing a possible functional conservation with Drosophila Sns.
