5000|$|... the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) {{approved}} color {{schemes for}} <b>street</b> <b>name</b> <b>signs</b> including a green, blue, or brown background with white text, or a white background with black text. [...] Despite the MUTCD restriction {{only to the}} aforementioned color schemes, other color schemes are used in some cities; for example, the city of Mesa, Arizona uses ruby red colored <b>street</b> <b>name</b> <b>signs</b> at signalized intersections in the Fiesta District {{in the western part}} of the city. The city of Houston, Texas allows for <b>street</b> <b>name</b> <b>signs</b> in several of its neighborhoods (usually part of a management district, where property owners assess additional fees to themselves to pay for extra services) to be of significantly different color schemes and fonts than the citywide standard.|$|R

50|$|A <b>street</b> <b>name</b> <b>sign</b> {{is a type}} {{of traffic}} sign used to {{identify}} named roads, generally those that do not qualify as expressways or highways. Street name signs are most often found posted at intersections, and are usually in perpendicularly oriented pairs identifying each of the crossing streets.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{intersection}} {{along the}} thoroughfare has a <b>street</b> <b>name</b> <b>sign</b> that reads [...] "6½ AV" [...] {{and the name}} of the cross street to officially mark the street name. The mid-block stop signs are unusual for Manhattan, and the fractional avenue name is a new idea for the numbered street system of New York City.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>street</b> <b>name</b> <b>sign</b> may {{optionally}} {{indicate the}} range of house numbers found nearby. Some street name signs also indicate an alternative name for the street, such as [...] "Fashion Avenue" [...] for Seventh Avenue in New York City, or [...] "Avenue of the Arts" [...] for Huntington Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts. Multilingual signs are common and may be required by law in some areas, such as French-speaking regions of Canada.|$|E

50|$|<b>Street</b> <b>name</b> <b>signs</b> {{identify}} <b>streets</b> for the unfamiliar, especially benefiting visitors, postal {{workers and}} the emergency services. They may also indicate the district in which a street lies.|$|R

50|$|Most streets have a <b>street</b> <b>name</b> <b>sign</b> at each {{intersection}} {{to indicate}} {{the name of the}} road. The design and style of the sign is usually common to the district in which it appears. The sign has the street name and sometimes other information, such as the block number or the name of the London borough in which the street is located. Such signs are often the target of simple vandalism, and signs on unusually or famously named streets are especially liable to street sign theft.|$|E
5000|$|South Carolina {{utilizes}} a {{numbering system}} {{to keep track}} of all non-interstate and primary highways that are maintained by SCDOT. First appearing around 1950, the [...] "state highway secondary system" [...] carries the number of the county followed by a unique number for the particular road. An example is S-11-154, which defines a secondary road in Cherokee County (11) with a road number of 154 (Whelchel Road). The counties are numbered in alphabetical order, with Abbeville as 1 and York as 46. Secondary road signs may either be integrated with a <b>street</b> <b>name</b> <b>sign</b> or appear separate as a black rectangle with white lettering.|$|E
