40|$|Spontaneous {{coronary}} artery dissection [...] {{the separation of}} the {{coronary artery}} wall layers caused <b>by</b> <b>an</b> intramural hematoma [...] frequently causes an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis is made at angiography by the 'tram-track' appearance of the contrast media in the true and false lumina, <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> radiolucent intimal <b>flap.</b> Here we report two cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection-related ACS managed with minimally aggressive treatment...|$|R
50|$|This species {{grows to}} 64.5 cm long. It {{is similar to}} other rough sharks in having a stout, high trunk, a dorsally {{depressed}} head, and two sail-like dorsal fins with deeply embedded spines. The snout is short, with large nostrils whose lateral and medial apertures are <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> thick nasal <b>flap.</b> The eyes and spiracles are oval in shape. The five pairs of gill slits are very small and vertical. The mouth is small, with thick, fleshy lips; the teeth in the upper jaw are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged, while those in the lower jaw are broad, blade-like, and smooth-edged. Only one row of teeth in the lower jaw are functional.|$|R

50|$|Sudbrook {{is joined}} by the Latchmere Stream just beyond Ham Gate Pond. Sudbrook then flows into Sudbrook Park, Petersham, and is culverted for the {{remainder}} of its course, discharging into the tidal River Thames to the east of 'River Lane' where the culvert outfall is protected from tidal backflow <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> valve.|$|R
40|$|Most {{recent studies}} of insect flight assume that the forces {{produced}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> wing can be determined from measurements on wings exposed {{to a series of}} steady-flow situations duplicating the instantaneous velocities and angles of attack to which the wing would be exposed during flight if the air and wing velocities were constant...|$|R
50|$|A and B are {{precisely}} <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> function if {{there exists a}} continuous function f from X to R such that f−1(0) = A and f−1(1) = B. (Again, you may also see the unit interval in place of R, and again it makes no difference.) Note that if any two sets {{are precisely}} <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> function, then certainly they are <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> function. Since {0} and {1} are closed in R, only closed sets are capable of being precisely <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> function; but just because two sets are closed and <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> function {{does not mean that}} they are automatically precisely <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> function (even a different function).|$|R
30|$|Attempts {{to achieve}} a direct {{approach}} to the fracture <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> procedure and to enable its management have been reported. More than two decades ago, Selden (1996) described the treatment of teeth with incomplete ROFs using silver-glass ionomer cement and a bone graft. However, eventually, all six cases failed (Tsesis et al. 2015; Selden 1996).|$|R
5000|$|An initial {{collapse}} {{occurred in}} June 1978 {{in a section}} of outfall pipe in River Lane (...) , off the main A307. The lane is prone to tidal flooding and the outfall is protected <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> valve. The damage proved to be sufficiently extensive to justify a temporary repair and letting a contract for permanent replacement of a long section.|$|R
50|$|Western eucharistic doves {{were used}} in medieval churches to keep consecrated hosts from the Eucharist (the Blessed Sacrament). These consecrated Hosts are in the Pyx, which could be put into it <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> {{in the back of}} the dove's body. Many were made in Spanish or Limoges enamel, with {{generally}} only the wings and eyes in enamel, the rest being gilded.|$|R
50|$|Kunpengopterus has an {{elongated}} head, 106.9 millimetres long. The cervical vertebrae too are relatively long. The naris is confluent with the antorbital fenestra, but these large openings are still partly <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> broad and anteriorly directed processus nasalis which has itself a small vertical tear-shaped opening. A low bony crest is {{present on the}} skull, just behind the eyes; preserved soft tissue shows it was elongated <b>by</b> cartilage and <b>a</b> yellow discolouration indicates it was perhaps enlarged to the back <b>by</b> <b>a</b> skin <b>flap.</b> There {{is no sign of}} a crest on the snout or of a keel under the lower jaws. The back of the skull is rounded. Kunpengopterus has a long stiff tail. The fifth toe is also long and strongly curved.|$|R

50|$|Pellia epiphylla is monoicous, {{with both}} male and female sex organs on the same thallus. The small male organs are {{scattered}} along the midrib while the female organs grow near the tip of the thallus and are surrounded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flap.</b> The plant produces spherical, greenish-black capsules which are borne on stalks known as setae. These are pale green and up to 5 cm long.|$|R
50|$|The dewclaws are {{not dead}} appendages. They {{can be used}} to lightly grip bones and other items that dogs hold with the paws.

5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is fairly}} narrow-bodied and has greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head lack distinct lobes. The eyes are oval and widely spaced; closely behind are crescent-shaped spiracles with large, boxy projections inside their anterior rims. Each nostril is large and preceded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small <b>flap</b> of skin bearing two barbels; the outer barbel is thin, while the inner barbel has a spoon-like tip and a smooth to slightly fringed flange at the base. The wide mouth is terminally placed and has furrows at the corners. There are 10 tooth rows on either side of both jaws, <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> gap in the middle; the teeth are small, narrow, and pointed. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 15 mm. The forewings are rather dark fuscous, slightly ochreous-tinged, darker posteriorly, the costa and termen suffusedly blackish-fuscous. In males {{there is an}} oval impression beneath the costa at two-fifths, containing a tuft of whitish-ochreous scales from the upper margin, covered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> of long fuscous scales from the anterior margin. The hindwings are blackish-fuscous, with an elongate wedge-shaped ochreous-whitish spot {{in the middle of}} the disc.|$|R
50|$|The {{increasing}} number of summer residences built on Stora Essingen during the 18th century were during the early 20th century gradually transformed into permanent residences. Therefore, a first temporary Stora Essingebron was built in 1917 using the rafts of the X-shaped pontoon bridge once in service on the ice of Lake Riddarfjärden during winters. Across the central seaway, a hand-pulled ferry connected the two pathways until replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flap</b> in 1921.|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{homogeneous}} continua cannot be <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single point. However, {{there is no guarantee}} in general that the subcontinua in such spaces have the same property. This paper establishes the fact that, in all but the most simple case, the nontrivial subcontinua with minimal finite boundary in a homogeneous continuum share the property of the entire space that they cannot be <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single point. More specifically, if X is a homogeneous continuum, then no single point separates X. If the nontrivial subcontinua of X with minimal boundary contain precisely two boundary points, then these subcontinua can be <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single point. However, if these subcontinua have finite boundary containing more than two points, then like X itself, they cannot be <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single point...|$|R
40|$|We study {{experimentally}} {{the vortex}} streets produced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> foil in <b>a</b> hydrodynamic tunnel, using 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). A novel analysis {{in terms of}} <b>a</b> <b>flapping</b> frequency-amplitude phase space allows to identify: 1) {{the transition from the}} well-known Benard-von Karman (BvK) wake to the reverse BvK vortex street that characterizes propulsive wakes, and 2) the symmetry breaking of this reverse BvK pattern giving rise to an asymmetric wake. We also show that the transition from a BvK wake to a reverse BvK wake precedes the actual drag-thrust transition and we discuss the significance of the present results in the analysis of flapping systems in nature...|$|R
