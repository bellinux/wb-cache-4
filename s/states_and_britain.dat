5|$|During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies {{against what}} they saw as their {{potential}} enemy, Britain. The Russian blue-water navy was stationed in San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke out between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain.</b> This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.|$|E

By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district.|$|E

5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in which the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain</b> were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 Secretary of State Daniel Webster {{negotiated}} with Britain the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which determined {{the border between}} Maine and Canada. That issue had caused tension between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain</b> for decades and had brought the two countries {{to the brink of}} war on several occasions. Though the treaty improved Anglo-American diplomatic relations,, Tyler was nevertheless unsuccessful in concluding a treaty with the British to fix the boundaries of Oregon. On Tyler's last full day in office, March 3, 1845, Florida was admitted to the Union as the 27th state.|$|E

5|$|In {{the meeting}} Tecumseh warned Harrison {{that he would}} seek an {{alliance}} with the British if hostilities broke out. Tensions between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain</b> had been high for several months {{as a result of}} British interference in U.S. commerce with France. As early as 1810, British agents had sought to secure an alliance with Native Americans to assist in the defense of Canada should hostilities break out, but the Natives had been reluctant to accept their offer, fearing they had little to benefit from such an arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The 1895 {{dispute between}} the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain</b> over Venezuela was peacefully {{resolved}} through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. American secretary of state Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat Julian Pauncefote. President William McKinley supported the treaty, as did most opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. The main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In January 1896 the British Government {{decided in}} effect to {{recognise}} the US right {{to intervene in}} the boundary dispute, accepting arbitration in principle without insisting on the Schomburgk line as a basis for negotiation. Negotiations between the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain</b> over the details of the arbitration followed, and Britain was able to persuade the US of much of its views, even as {{it became clear that the}} eventual report of the Boundary Commission would likely be negative towards the British claims. An agreement between the US and UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission's work was suspended in November 1896, though it still went on to produce a large report.|$|E

5|$|In September 1943, Italy capitulated {{and signed}} an Armistice with the Allies. Littorio was then renamed Italia. The three active battleships were {{transferred}} to Malta before {{they were to be}} interned in Alexandria. While en route to Malta, German bombers attacked the fleet with Fritz X radio-guided bombs, damaging Italia and sinking Roma. Nevertheless, Italia and Vittorio Veneto reached Malta and were interned. The incomplete Impero was seized by the Germans after Italy withdrew from the war and used as a target, until she was sunk by American bombers in 1945. Italia and Vittorio Veneto were awarded to the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain,</b> respectively, as war prizes. Italia, Vittorio Veneto, and Impero were broken up for scrap between 1952 and 1954.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{the loss of}} Franklin's {{expedition}} inspired a number of paintings in both the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain.</b> In 1861, Frederic Edwin Church unveiled his great canvas The Icebergs; later that year, prior to taking it to England for exhibition, he added {{an image of a}} broken ship's mast in silent tribute to Franklin. In 1864, Sir Edwin Landseer's Man Proposes, God Disposes caused a stir at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on a tattered ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen at the time as in poor taste, but has remained {{one of the most powerful}} imaginings of the expedition's final fate. The expedition also inspired numerous popular engravings and illustrations, along with many panoramas, dioramas, and magic lantern shows.|$|E
5|$|To this end, Stalin and Molotov {{strung out}} the {{negotiations}} with the Japanese, giving them false hope of a Soviet-mediated peace. At the same time, in their dealings with the United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain,</b> the Soviets insisted on strict adherence to the Cairo Declaration, re-affirmed at the Yalta Conference, that the Allies would not accept separate or conditional peace with Japan. The Japanese would have to surrender unconditionally to all the Allies. To prolong the war, the Soviets opposed any attempt to weaken this requirement. This would give the Soviets time to complete the transfer of their troops from the Western Front to the Far East, and conquer Manchuria (Manchukuo), Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang), Korea, South Sakhalin, the Kuriles, and possibly, Hokkaidō (starting with a landing at Rumoi).|$|E
