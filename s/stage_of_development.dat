5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists.

This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E
5|$|Attributed or {{imaginary}} arms {{appeared in}} {{literature in the}} middle of the 12th century, particularly in Arthurian legends.

5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently. They note {{that there is no}} historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E

5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; at this <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant {{it could not be}} run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E
5|$|The next <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> {{was to use}} the T1E2 {{configuration}} on {{the longer}} chassis of the M3 Half-track, since it could store more ammunition. This vehicle, originally designated as the T1E4, was accepted into production as the M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage on 27 July 1942. A total of 1,103 examples of this variant were produced from 27 July 1942 to 15 May 1943. Half of them (583) were converted into M16s by the White Motor Company before reaching the army. Deliveries began in late 1943.|$|E

Thus, on socio-economic issues Periyar was Marxist, but he did not advocate for abolishing private ownership. Immediately after his return, E.V. Ramasamy, in alliance with the enthusiastic communist, M. Singaravelar, began to work out a socio-political scheme incorporating socialist and self-respect ideals. This marked a crucial <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> in the Self-Respect Movement which got politicised and found its compatibility in Tamil Nadu.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began {{after the release of}} Killer Instinct 2, in which a team was split into making Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console. At its first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> Diddy Kong Racing was {{conceived}} as a real-time strategy game with a caveman/time-travel theme worked on by a team of four Rare members; Chris Stamper, Lee Musgrave, Rob Harrison and Lee Schuneman. During later stages of development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to Pro Am 64, an unrelated follow-up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am. According to Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project featured three-wheeled trikes in contrast to radio-controlled cars.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> the game had no {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode; it {{focused on the}} story instead of the cyberpunk element. A year after development began, the game was sent for reworking because the studio thought they had not captured {{the essence of the}} Syndicate series. The team had little experience in making a co-operative games due to technological restraints, but decided to experiment with it. The internal reception of the co-op prototype was positive; testers said it fit with the canonical fiction of the franchise. The team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for the game, but thought it was not original enough for inclusion. As the game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element, the developers abandoned the use of an online pass, unlike most EA games at that time.|$|E
5|$|Early in development, it {{was decided}} that the Jaguar should be offered for export. In 1969, while still in the {{prototype}} <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> formal approaches had been made to Switzerland, India, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale. Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar, but these plans failed {{in part because of the}} high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition. Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not transfer into orders. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead firmed up for F1s. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to an arms embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s.|$|E

5|$|Three more eggs {{containing}} embryos {{from the}} same formation were described in 2016 by Wang et al. Though they noted that these eggs strongly resemble M. yaotunensis, they declined to refer them to any ootaxon lower than Elongatoolithidae because Macroolithus is not clearly defined and {{is in need of}} revision. The embryos within these eggs {{are some of the most}} well-preserved of any oviraptorids, providing new information on oviraptorid ontogeny. The specimens show a relatively shallow head which indicates that as oviraptorids matured, their skulls grew dorsoventrally (top-to-bottom) faster than anteroposteriorly (front-to-back). This growth pattern is unusual among theropods, but is also seen in derived ("advanced") tyrannosaurids. Also unusual is that, even at this early <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> the nasal bones are fused. Coincidentally, tyrannosaurids also show fusion of the nasals early in development.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive shield volcano. This highly dissected volcanic edifice {{consists of a}} variety of rock types, including basanite, hawaiite, trachyte, rhyolite, phonolite and alkali olivine basalt. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity. Two stages of eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8and 3.0million years old and thus over two million years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. A period of dormancy lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield stage of volcanism 2.2to 0.8million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000years to produce cinder cones.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst-case scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E
