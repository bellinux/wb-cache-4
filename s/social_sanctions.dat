25|$|While {{prostitution}} controls {{have been}} relaxed {{at a local}} level, there is no impetus for legalisation at the central government level. Importantly, legalisation does not have much public support. Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there is an argument that legalisation would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women. Surveys conducted in China suggest that clandestine forms of prostitution will continue to proliferate alongside the establishment of legal prostitution businesses, because of <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> against working or patronising a red-light district. Problems associated with female employment also limit the effectiveness of legalisation. These include the lack of independent trade unions, and limited access of individuals to civil redress with regard to {{occupational health and safety}} issues.|$|E
25|$|While {{the link}} between ethnic {{heterogeneity}} and under provision of public goods is generally accepted, there is little consensus around the causal mechanism underlying this relationship. To identify possible causal stories, Humphreys and Habyarimana ran a serious of behavioral games in Kampala, Uganda that involved several local participants completing joint tasks and allocating money amongst them. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, they find that participants did not favor the welfare of their co-ethnics disproportionately. It was only when anonymity was removed and everyone's ethnicity was known did co-ethnics decide to favor each other. Humphreys and Habyarimana argue that cooperation among co-ethnics is primarily driven by reciprocity norms that tend to be stronger among co-ethnics. The possibility of <b>social</b> <b>sanctions</b> compelled those who would not otherwise cooperate with their co-ethnics to do so. The authors find no {{evidence to suggest that}} co-ethnics display a greater degree of altruism towards each other or have the same preferences. Ethnic cooperation takes place because co-ethnics have common social networks and therefore can monitor each other and can threaten to socially sanction any transgressors.|$|E
40|$|Several recent {{experimental}} studies {{have confirmed that}} <b>social</b> <b>sanctioning</b> can enforce cooperation in public good situations. These studies consider situations where the participants, who have monetary interest {{in the outcome of}} the public good game, inflict <b>social</b> <b>sanctioning.</b> The present experimental study, however, considers behavioral effects of <b>social</b> <b>sanctioning</b> from observers with no monetary interest in the outcome of the public good game. The experiment has two treatment effects. First, each participant’s identity and contribution to the public good is revealed to the observers. Second, we introduce information likely to affect participants’ expectations regarding the observers’ approval or disapproval of contributions to the public good. The data provides some evidence that indirect <b>social</b> <b>sanctioning</b> from these monetarily unaffected observers can increase voluntary contributions to public goods, provided that the participants have {{reason to believe that the}} observers have themselves contributed substantially in a similar situation.

40|$|Despite {{differences}} of opinion about the efficacy of corporate social responsibility, {{there is a general}} consensus among academics, policy makers, and practitioners that corporations operate with a <b>social</b> <b>sanction</b> that requires that they operate within the norms and mores of the societies in which they exist.

There are many explanations given for why suicide missionsoccur, such as religion, lethality, poverty and psychological problems, but current explanationsfocus primarily on the presence of suicide missions. However, this paper also looks at the absenceof suicide missions by militant groups in situations of contentious politics and conflict. It does thisusing two case studies: one where suicide missions are absent (the IRA in Northern Ireland) andanother where there is the presence of suicide missions (Hamas in Israel/Palestine). ...|$|R

50|$|Another view distinguishes {{individual}} {{religious belief}} from collective religious belief. While the former {{does not require}} prior development of language, the latter does.
