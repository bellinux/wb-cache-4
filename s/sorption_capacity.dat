2500|$|Concentrations of PAH in {{river and}} estuarine sediments vary {{according}} {{to a variety of}} factors including proximity to municipal and industrial discharge points, wind direction and distance from major urban roadways, as well as tidal regime which controls the diluting effect of generally cleaner marine sediments relative to freshwater discharge. Consequently, the concentrations of pollutants in estuaries tends to decrease at the river mouth. Understanding of sediment hosted PAH in estuaries is important for the protection of commercial fisheries (e.g. mussels) and general environmental habitat conservation because PAH can impact the health of suspension and sediment feeding organism. River-estuary surface sediments in the UK tend to have a lower PAH content than sediments buried 10 to 60cm from the surface reflecting lower present day industrial activity combined with improvement in environmental legislation of PAH. Typical PAH concentrations in UK estuaries range from about 19 to 16,163µg/kg (dry weight sediment) in the River Clyde and 626 to 3766µg/kg in the River Mersey. In general estuarine sediments with a higher natural total organic carbon content (TOC) tend to accumulate PAH due to high <b>sorption</b> <b>capacity</b> of organic matter. A similar correspondence between PAH and TOC has also been observed in the sediments of tropical mangroves located on the coast of South China ...|$|E

50|$|The {{documents}} {{describe a}} non-destructive method {{of determining the}} remaining service life of used and new gas cartridges. Polluted air was pumped through the cartridge. The degree of purification of air {{depends on how much}} unsaturated sorbent is in the cartridge. Therefore, accurate measurement of gas concentration in the cleaned air allows one to estimate the amount of the unsaturated sorbent. Polluted air (1-bromobutane) was pumped for a very short time, and therefore, such tests do not reduce the service life considerably. The <b>sorption</b> <b>capacity</b> decreased due to absorption of this gas by the amount of about 0.5% of the <b>sorption</b> <b>capacity</b> of a new cartridge. The method was also used for 100% quality control of cartridges, manufactured by the English firm Martindale Protection Co (10 microliters 1-bromobutane injected into the air stream), and to check the cartridges issued to workers in firms Waring Ltd and Rentokil Ltd. This method was used in the Chemical Defence Establishment in the early 1970s. The experts who developed this method, received a patent.|$|E

The three biomass types {{are subjected to}} field-emission scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy while the surface tension analyses for liquid-air and oil-water systems have also been conducted. Both kapok fiber and sugarcane bagasse exhibit excellent oil sorption capabilities for diesel, crude, new engine and used engine oils since all their oil <b>sorption</b> <b>capacities</b> exceed 10 g/g. Synthetic sorbent exhibits oil <b>sorption</b> <b>capacities</b> comparable to sugarcane bagasse while rice husks exhibit the lowest oil <b>sorption</b> <b>capacities</b> among all the sorbents. Kapok fiber shows overwhelmingly high oil-to-water sorption (O/W) ratios ranging from 19. 35 to 201. 53 while sugarcane bagasse, rice husks and synthetic sorbent have significantly lower O/W ratios (0. 76 to 2. 69).

50|$|Non evaporable getters (NEG), {{based on}} the {{principle}} of metallic surface sorption of gas molecules, are mostly porous alloys or powder mixtures of Al, Zr, Ti, V and Fe. They help to establish and maintain vacuums by soaking up or bonding to gas molecules that remain within a partial vacuum. This is done through the use of materials that readily form stable compounds with active gases. They are important tools for improving the performance of many vacuum systems. Sintered onto the inner surface of high vacuum vessels, the NEG coating can be applied even to spaces that are narrow and hard to pump out, which makes it very popular in particle accelerators where this is an issue. The main sorption parameters of the kind of NEGs, like pumping speed and <b>sorption</b> <b>capacity,</b> have low limits.A different type of NEG, which is not coated, is the Tubegetter.

[...] The MCC can be synthesized {{by different}} {{processes such as}} reactive extrusion, enzyme mediated, steam explosion and acid hydrolysis.

The MCC particles with size lower than 5 µm must not be more than 10%. The MCC is a valuable additive in pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and other industries. Different properties of MCC are measured to qualify its suitability to such utilization, namely particle size, density, compressibility index, angle of repose, powder porosity, hydration swelling capacity, moisture <b>sorption</b> <b>capacity,</b> moisture content, crystallinity index, crystallite size and mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength.
