Thispaper describes the implementation of two algorithms used inpower generation and management of rural energy supplies:Location-based Solar Energy Potential Prediction Algorithm(LOSEPPA) and Intelligent Fuzzy-controlled PowerGeneration and Management Algorithm (IFPGMA).

The <b>solar</b> <b>factor</b> of such systems strongly depends on the blind tilt angle and on the relative angular positions of the Sun in respect to the window. In the present paper a modified version of Tilmann E. Kuhn model for the complete angular determination of the <b>solar</b> <b>factor</b> is presented and discussed.

An experimental angular characterisation of the <b>solar</b> <b>factor</b> has been carried out on a case study adopting mirror finished blinds.

40|$|Whereas {{the modern}} {{architecture}} trends to an {{extensive use of}} glazing elements, buildings are increasingly required to minimize the external energy demand, cutting down the energy needed and covering the residual demand using local energy generation solutions. In this context, the integration of optimized Semi- Transparent Photovoltaic (STPV) elements seems to present a promising energy saving potential, leading to significant reductions of the heating, cooling and lighting loads while the on-site electricity generation is supplied. In mild climate areas, building glazings are required to perform as solar control systems with a low <b>solar</b> <b>factor</b> {{in order to avoid}} overheating.

40|$|The modern {{design of}} office {{buildings}} shows {{a tendency to}} increase the window share per facade to be more impressive with grand visibility and well daylit rooms. An increased window share results in general in increased use of energy and costs for cooling, but these disadvantages can be reduced considering a more careful design. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the influence of window design and room layout on cooling demand and daylight availability in office buildings in Northern Europe. The study {{is based on a}} literature survey, measurements in a couple of buildings and design calculations for two different room types, together with measurements on two room models in a daylight laboratory. The field monitoring show considerable cooling demands {{as a result of the}} room and window design. Calculations show the influence of window design parameters on the cooling demand. The daylight measurements show the influence of window design parameters on the availability for daylight, as well as the risk for glare due to direct solar radiation. The two studies have then been combined to show the possibilities for daylight in relation to cooling demand for different window orientations. The result is that, in most cases, it is possible to find a combination of window share and window <b>solar</b> <b>factor</b> that is feasible from a cooling, as well as a daylight point of view. The design calculations show that designs with large window shares (> 60 %) and a high window <b>solar</b> <b>factor</b> (0. 7) can result in extreme cooling loads.

40|$|Recent studies {{dealing with}} the {{potential}} of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) for desalination along the Mediterranean Coast and in the Middle East choose to use RES to generate electricity first, and then use this electricity to power desalination. The present work eliminates the phase of electricity generation by using solar thermal energy directly for distillation by evaporation. Saving the thermal to mechanical conversion losses allows the proposed Multi Effect Distillation (MED) process to compete economically with Reverse Osmosis (RO) process of significantly lower energy consumption. The new opportunity to revive direct thermal evaporation, arises from a new collector technology developed by Solel Solar Systems, that is coupled to the familiar MED process modified by I. D. E. Technologies to match the solar steam characteristics. A combination {{of a large number}} of effects of evaporation, together with high pressure saturated solar steam available for recycling, yields a dramatic improvement in the production rate of water desalination, accompanied by relatively modest increase in the desalination installation cost. Economic considerations and technological constraints, dictate continuous operation of the desalination system while the solar radiation is limited to daytime. A heat storage capacity or fossil fuel backup is therefore essential; the optimal use of both is discussed. The study refers to a wide range of desalination capacity from a small 1000 m 3 /day to a large 100, 000 m 3 /day plant. The option of co-generation power/desalination plant provides better economy then direct solar steam MED operation.
