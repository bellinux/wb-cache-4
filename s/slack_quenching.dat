40|$|The {{metallurgy}} of ten armour {{pieces from}} the Palace Armoury Collection in Malta was examined. Results showed that out of ten artefacts examined, six were produced in low carbon steel, one from a high carbon steel and three were made from wrought iron. One of the wrought iron armour pieces was fabricated from a phosphoric iron, an unusual material for these artefacts. All the steel artefacts exhibited a ferrite-pearlite microstructure. In their manufacture, no attempts had been made at producing martensite by full or <b>slack</b> <b>quenching.</b> All metal fragments contained slag inclusions. The elongated nature of the latter suggested that these artefacts were forged into shape. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} ISO 1. 2738 medium-carbon {{low-alloy steel}} {{has long been}} used to fabricate plastic molds for injection molding of large automotive components, such as bumpers and dashboards. These molds are usually machined from large pre-hardened steel blooms. Due to the bloom size, the heat treatment yields mixed microstructures, continuously varying from surface to core. Negative events (such as microcracks due to improper weld bed deposition or incomplete extraction of already formed plastic objects) or too large thermal/mechanical stresses can conceivably cause mold failure during service due to the low fracture toughness and fatigue resistance typically encountered in large <b>slack</b> <b>quenched</b> and tempered ISO 1. 2738 steel blooms. Alternative steel grades, including both non-standard microalloyed steels, designed for the same production process, and precipitation hardening steels, have recently been proposed by steelworks. However, the fracture toughness and the fatigue properties of these steels, and hence their response during the service, are not well known. Results of an experimental campaign to assess the fracture toughness and fatigue properties, {{as well as the}} basic mechanical properties, of a microalloyed and a precipitation hardening plastic mold steel blooms are presented and commented, also in respect to the results previously obtained by two commercial ISO 1. 2738 ones. Experimental results show that these steels generally exhibit low fracture toughness values; in the traditional quenched and tempered bloom steels the brittleness may be caused both by the presence of mixed microstructures and by grain boundaries segregation, while in the precipitation hardened one the brittleness probably stems from the precipitation phenomena. This study suggests that microalloyed and precipitation hardening steels may be used to produce large plastic mold, yet the fracture toughness still remains the most critical propert...|$|R
