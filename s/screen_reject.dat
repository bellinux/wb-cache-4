40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on low consistency (LC) refining of mechanical pulp. Theresearch included evaluations of energy efficiency, development of pulpproperties, {{the influence of}} fibre concentration on LC refining and effects of rotorposition in a two-zoned LC refiner. Trials were made in mill scale in a modern TMP line equipped with an MSDImpressafiner for chip pre-treatment, double disc (DD) first stage refining and aprototype 72 -inch TwinFlo LC refiner in the second stage. Tensile index increasedby 8 Nm/g and fibre length was reduced by 10 % in LC refining at 140 kWh/adtgross specific refining energy and specific edge load 1. 0 J/m. Specific lightscattering coefficient did not develop significantly over the LC refiner. The above mentioned TMP line was compared with a two stage single disc highconsistency Twin 60 refiner line. The purpose was to evaluate specific energyconsumption and pulp properties. The two different process solutions were testedin mill scale, running similar Norway spruce wood supply. At the same tensileindex and freeness, the specific energy consumption was 400 kWh/adt lower in theDD-LC concept compared with the SD-SD system. Pulp characteristics of the tworefining concepts were compared at tensile index 47 Nm/g. Fibre length was lowerafter DD-LC refining than after SD-SD refining. Specific light scattering coefficientwas higher and shive content much lower for DD-LC pulp. The effects of sulphite chip pre-treatment on second stage LC refining were alsoevaluated. No apparent differences in fibre properties after LC refining werenoticed between treated and untreated pulps. Sulphite chip pre-treatment iniiicombination with LC refining in second stage, yielded a pulp without screeningand reject refining with tensile index and shives content that were similar to nonpre-treated final pulp after screening and reject refining. A pilot scale study was performed to investigate the influence of fibreconcentration on pulp properties in LC refining of mechanical pulps. MarketCTMP was utilised in all trials and fibre concentrations were controlled by meansof adjustments of the pulp consistency and by screen fractionation of the pulp. Inaddition, various refiner parameters were studied, such as no-load, gap and baredge length. Pulp with the highest fibre concentration supported a larger refinergap than pulp with low fibre concentration at a given gross power input. Fibreshortening was lower and tensile index increase was higher for long fibre enrichedpulp. The {{results from this study}} support the interesting concept of combiningmain line LC refining and screening, where <b>screen</b> <b>reject</b> is recycled to the LCrefiner inlet. It has been observed that the rotor in two-zoned refiners is not always centred,even though pulp flow rate is equal in both refining zones. This leads to unequalplate gaps, which renders unevenly refined pulp. Trials were performed in millscale, using the 72 -inch TwinFlo, to investigate differences in pulp properties androtor positions by means of altering the pressure difference between the refiningzones. In order to produce homogenous pulp, it was found that uneven plate gapscan be compensated for in LC refiners with dual refining zones. Results from thedifferent flow rate adjustments indicated that the control setting with similar plategap gave the most homogenous pulp...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} batch kraft pulp digester is developed that predicts, ~ priori, the lignin content distribution, the carbohydrate content distribution, and the effective alkali concentration distribution within pulp chips {{as a function of}} cooking time. From this information the kappa number, yield, <b>screen</b> <b>rejects,</b> and kappa number distribution of the pulp are calculated. The model also predicts the bulk phase effective alkali concentration as a function of cooking time. Input to the model are the initial hydroxyl concentration and sulfide concentration, the chip-thickness distribution, the temperature history of the cook, and the chemical composition and density of the species of wood to be pulped. Model predictions are compared with data from pulping experiments in which the reaction rates are kinetically controlled and with experiments in which the diffusion rate restricts the overall reaction rates. In both cases the comparison is good. Model results show that the normalized second moment of the lignin content is a better predictor of rejects than the fiber liberation point. Results also show that in indirect heated batch digesters the inter-chip mass transfer resistence is negligible. The pulping model is coupled with an optimization scheme to find the optimum pulping conditions. One result of the optimization is that an increase in productivity of 19 %can be obtained by optimization of the effective alkali concentration in a kraft cook. The effect of digester temperature gradients on the lignin content distribution of a pulp is shown to be significant, but the effect on <b>screen</b> <b>rejects</b> is negligible. Stratifying the chip by thickness to take advantage of temperature gradients is found to narrow the lignin content distribution, but has no effect on the <b>screen</b> <b>rejects</b> of a cook. ...|$|R
40|$|Impurities in {{harvested}} stumps are {{a quality}} problem because {{high levels of}} mineral contaminants decrease the effective heating value of the stump wood, and can also affect ash melting behaviour during combustion, leading to sintering and drift problems. The aim of this case study was to clarify the productivity and screening efficiency of the Kompetech Crambo 6000 low-speed double-shaft grinder equipped with a Komptech star screen, in the integrated grinding and screening of Norway spruce and Scots pine stumps for fuel at a roadside landing, when using two different sieve sizes (250 x 320 mm and 180 x 180 mm screen baskets). Furthermore, we studied the fuel consumption of the Crambo 6000 grinder, ash content and particle size distribution of ground stump wood, and ash content and particle size distribution of the <b>screening</b> <b>reject.</b> In addition, the heating value of the produced hog fuel and <b>screening</b> <b>reject</b> were analysed. During {{the time of the}} studies, both the grinder and star screen were operating well and there were no delays due to machine breakdowns. The mobile Crambo 6000 grinder was also capable of operating well in constricted roadside landings. The quality of the produced hog fuel was high, due to low ash content (0. 4 – 2. 3 %), and this highlights the significance of screening to guarantee sufficient quality when processing stump fuel. The ash content of the <b>screening</b> <b>reject</b> was 32. 4 – 74. 7 %, and the effective heating value was 5. 2 – 13. 4 MJ/kg. The effective heating value of the produced hog fuel was 17. 9 – 19. 9 MJ/kg. The average grinding productivity, when using the 250 x 320 mm screen basket, was 162 loose m 3 per effective hour, and the fuel consumption of the grinder was 0. 44 litres per loose m 3. With a narrower screen, the average grinding productivity was 101 loose m 3 per effective hour, and the fuel consumption of the grinder was 0. 75 litres per loose m 3...|$|R

The results showed that application of either surfactant improved the pulp yield and decreased the <b>screen</b> <b>rejects.</b> The increase in pulp yield at similar kappa number {{may be due to}} higher selectivity of delignification affected by surfactant, which can act as a co-solvent. Addition of ELA- 7 to cooking liquor didn’t have significant effect on paper properties. But a significant effect was observed with PEG 1500. In fact, it caused a decrease in burst and tensile index but increased the tear index, probably because of a debonding effect of the surfactant.

" Under constant pulping conditions, refractory Douglas-fir underwent less delignification than permeable Douglas-fir, giving higher <b>screened</b> <b>rejects</b> and lower <b>screened</b> yields. Pulp made from refractory Douglas-fir required less refining to achieve a given level of Canadian Standard Freeness. Handsheet properties were direct functions of fiber characteristic variations. Paper made from refractory Douglas-fir heartwood had greater sheet density, tensile strength, zero-span tensile strength, stretch, and fold endurance.

40|$|A unique {{penetration}} instrument {{has been}} developed to evaluate the role of surfactants in kraft pulping process. This instrument can screen surfactants which can improve the wood impregnation more effectively and much faster than pilot-plant experiment. The role of surfactants in wood penetration has been explored. Surfactants can improve wood impregnation by dispersing the extractives in the wood structure and optimizing the interfacial properties between wood surface and kraft liquor. The addition of two blends of anionic and nonionic surfactants into kraft pulping process results in a significant reduction of the <b>screen</b> <b>rejects</b> and an increase of screened yield at the same delignification rate. Six wood species were tested in this study including both non-resinous and resinous wood species. Both sapwood and heartwood of these species were tested.

40|$|In {{this quarter}} we {{completed}} low consistency laboratory pulping trials. Pulping results were analyzed {{in terms of}} defibering index or yield and the concentration of free wax. The objective of these trials is to identify pulping conditions that will give higher yield and higher concentration of free wax. The yields from low consistency pulping trials ranged from 90 to 99 % based on 6 -cut laboratory <b>screen</b> <b>rejects.</b> In general, high temperatures (140 - 150 {degree}F) and high pH (9. 5 - 10) conditions resulted in higher yield and the generation of free wax. Factors such as rotor speed and the gap (between the rotor and grate) were not significant in affecting defibering. Generally, the turbidities of filtrates from wax-contaminated pulps increased with increase in temperature and/or pH. The filtrate turbidity indicated the relative concentration of finely dispersed wax that could be removed from pulp dewatered on a 30 {micro}m filter paper. Preliminary experiments were conducted to study flotation conditions necessary for effective removal of wax from pulp. Factors which are important for effective flotation include flotation time, volume of air, surfactant concentration and type, and low temperature. Future plans include additional flotation trials to better optimize conditions. Other contaminant types include pressure sensitive adhesives and hot melts will also be examined.

40|$|Egyptian cotton stalks were pulped in a blender, using cold {{soda and}} {{alkaline}} peroxide chemimechanical (APMP) processes. Overall yields for both processes were low, but comparable to values found for semichemical pulping in the literature. Strength values {{were lower than}} for chemical pulping but comparable to literature values for semichemical pulping. For the cold soda process, the alkali concentration during soaking decreased the yield for both the soaking and refining stages, but it {{had little effect on}} fiber development during and sheet properties after secondary refining. A similar effect was found for soaking time. Higher soaking temperature increased the freeness level at a given secondary refining time and improved tear strength, but it had no effect on tensile or burst strength. An increase in primary refining time caused a decrease in tear strength. Pulps produced from the APMP process were 50 % brighter and slightly weaker than for the cold soda process, and they required significantly less secondary refining to reach a given freeness level. An increase in the concentration of alkali and peroxide caused a decrease in both soaked and refined yields. Increased chemical concentration slightly reduced the secondary refining time required to reach a given freeness level, but it had no effect on strength at a given freeness. An increase in the alkali/peroxide ratio during soaking caused a decrease in <b>screened</b> <b>rejects</b> and an increase in screened yield. Higher ratios resulted in slightly higher freeness values at a given secondary refining time, and they also produced slightly higher tensile and moderately lower tear strength.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to investigate and improve impregnation of regular (2 - 8 mm thickness range) black spruce wood chips in CMP-AQ pulping. Impregnation and pulping experiments were performed while varying several pulping parameters. Experiments were analyzed in terms of yield, lignin content, percent <b>screen</b> <b>rejects,</b> and strength properties. The goal was to determine optimum pulping conditions that would improve chemical impregnation. Impregnation {{is a function of}} percent screen rejects: well impregnated chips have fewer rejects. Cooking temperature and cooking time were held constant in all experiments at 170 $ sp circ$C and 30 minutes, respectively. The liquor pH was adjusted to 7. 9 and a liquor-to-wood ratio of 6 : 1 was used. Presteaming pressure was held constant at 138 kPa and soaking temperature was maintained isothermal at 90 $ sp circ$C. Process variables which can influence the chemical penetration were investigated. These are: wood chip thickness, pre-treatment agents, compression ratio, partial crushing of wood chips, and also pre-steaming and evacuation prior to chemical treatment as a possible method of entrapped air removal. Additional process parameters investigated were the concentration of pulping chemicals and dosage of AQ catalyst. The advantages provided by the use of thinner wood chips, caustic pretreatment and high compression prex-impregnation were confirmed for improving chemical impregnation. The addition of SAQ catalyst to the CMP pulping process produced pulps of unusually high screened yield for given lignin content. Improvements were also observed in strength properties compared to the control cook where no SAQ was used...|$|R

The intensified process consists of wood softening by means of chip pretreatment with sodium sulphite, high intensity refining followed by low consistency refining.

40|$|Pilot plant coating trials {{compared}} a coating basesheet {{made from}} P. radiata (radiata pine) TMP with several European basesheets. The pine basesheet compared favourably when coated using a metered film press coater though more fibre rising occurred with it during coating. The coated sheet also required more severe calendering conditions {{to meet the}} gloss target. It was suggested that the P. radiata TMP used in the trial basesheet would benefit from additional processing that would promote stripping of material from the long fibre wall {{in order to make}} it more collapsible and promote improved strength and surface roughness. The TMP would also benefit from processes that would generate more split fibres. The properties of TMP originating from the Australasian mills of Norske Skog were examined and compared to TMP from spruce. Some additional measurements of %split fibres and bendability were made on the pulps at PFI. A Fiberlab fibre analyser was used extensively to measure fibre dimensions. Factor analysis of pressing experiments aided in identifying the P. radiata pulps that approached the quality of spruce pulp used for coating and SC grades of paper. Pulps were fractionated and the dimensions of the fibres, the specific surface area determined from sedimentation measurements and the physical and optical properties of each of the fractions were measured. Specific surface area, tensile index, roughness and sheet density were all significantly correlated and could be used as measures of fibre development. The long fibre fraction was identified as being the poorest quality fibre and most in need of development. Mill screening operations were examined to look at their selectivity in removing the long fibre fraction from the rest of the pulp so that it could be further processed to promote fibre collapse and flexibility. High consistency screening was compared with low consistency screening and it was concluded that a multistage low consistency screening system was more selective than a single high consistency screen. When refined in a low consistency refiner the properties of the whole pulp improved but the long fibre component showed no detectable improvement in density, tensile or wall thickness. High consistency refining of <b>screen</b> <b>rejects</b> improved the whole pulp properties and the properties of the long fibre with significant improvements in specific surface area and reduction in the fibre wall thickness. Improved long fibre screen selectivity followed by high consistency refining of the long fibre is a strategy for improving the quality of the fibre for a coating basesheet...|$|R
