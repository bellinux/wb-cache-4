The largest power supply can deliver 75 megawatts (MW) for a 30-minute duration or 150 MW for a 15-second duration. This power capacity, in combination with a high-volume 5-stage <b>steam</b> <b>ejector</b> vacuum-pumping system, enables facility operations to match high-altitude atmospheric flight conditions with samples of relatively large size. The Thermo-Physics Facilities Branch operates four arc jet facilities. The Interaction Heating Facility (IHF), with an available power of over 60-MW, {{is one of the}} highest-power arc jets available. It is a very flexible facility, capable of long run times of up to one hour, and able to test large samples in both a stagnation and flat plate configuration. The Panel Test Facility (PTF) uses a unique semielliptic nozzle for testing panel sections. Powered by a 20-MW arc heater, the PTF can perform tests on samples for up to 20 minutes. The Turbulent Flow Duct provides supersonic, turbulent high temperature air flows over flat surfaces. The TFD is powered by a 20-MW Hüls arc heater and can test samples [...] in size. The Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF) has similar characteristics to the IHF arc heater, offering a wide range of operating conditions, samples sizes and extended test times. A cold-air-mixing plenum allows for simulations of ascent or high-speed flight conditions. Catalycity studies using air or nitrogen can be performed in this flexible rig. A 5-arm model support system allows the user to maximize testing efficiency. The AHF can be configured with either a Hüls or segmented arc heater, up to 20-MW. 1 MW is enough power to supply 750 homes.|$|E

40|$|The rising {{standard}} of living and the changing situation in the energy sector {{have led to the}} development of solar cooling systems in the last years. Previously only "sorptive" cooling systems, which means absorption chillers, adsorption chillers and Desiccative Evaporative Cooling, have been used for solar cooling. These cooling systems are very complicated and there is still a high demand for research and development. Another interesting alternative to the only "sorptive" cooling systems used is a solar driven <b>steam</b> jet <b>ejector,</b> which has a simple construction design and a high coefficient of performance in part load. However, the concept of a solar driven <b>steam</b> jet <b>ejector</b> chiller has only been investigated theoretically or by small test rigs. Up to now there are no demonstration or pilot plants, so that no operational experiences are available. The few existing models for calculation are used to identify parameters for the nominal load and do not describe the operational behaviour. Because of the lack of systems realised and the respective calculation models, the operational behaviour of solar driven <b>steam</b> jet <b>ejector</b> chillers has not been investigated under changing operational conditions yet. This publication first of all gives an overview of the possibilities of solar cooling systems and describes briefly the different techniques. Furthermore, theoretical and practical works concerning solar collectors and <b>steam</b> jet <b>ejectors</b> are presented. Subsequently, a dynamic model of a solar driven <b>steam</b> jet <b>ejector</b> chiller is presented and described. The model is structured into model components, which correspond to the device components. These model components can be combined in different ways to one cooling plant. Consequently, different plant concepts can be modelled and investigated. The validation of the model is done by values taken from literature and measurement data of a small test rig. The validation proves that the model presented simulates the dynamic operational behaviour of a solar driven <b>steam</b> jet <b>ejector</b> chiller. At the end of the work, a concept of a solar driven <b>steam</b> jet <b>ejector</b> chiller for air conditioning is investigated for the location of St. Katrine in Egypt. The concept consists of parabolic trough collectors and a two stage <b>steam</b> jet <b>ejector</b> chiller with a cold capacity of 100 kW. The cooling plant is modelled and its operational behaviour is simulated and discussed. There are three simulations: normal operation of the plant, a start-up of the stand-by mode and a step responds of the plant. The three simulations prove a functional concept of a solar cooling system with a quick dynamic operational behaviour and a high coefficient of performance in part load...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} environmental concerns, ejector refrigeration system which utilizes the low-grade thermal energy, such as industrial waste heat and solar energy, becomes increasingly popular. Nevertheless, {{due to the}} relatively low coefficient of performance of the ejector refrigeration system, {{it is necessary to}} improve its efficiency. As the core component of this system, the effectiveness of the <b>steam</b> <b>ejector</b> is the key factor to improve the overall performance. The complicated flow structure and mixing process within the <b>steam</b> <b>ejector</b> lead to a relatively low entrainment ratio. Many numerical studies based on the ideal gas assumption have been carried out to investigate the flow structure and impact factors of the performance for the <b>steam</b> <b>ejector.</b> Considering the actual experiment cases, spontaneously condensing phenomenon happened in the whole working process, while most simulations focus on only the nozzle part of the <b>steam</b> <b>ejector</b> leading to a significant deviation between numerical and experimental results. In this thesis study, a wet steam model was proposed to investigate the working process and the condensation effect occurred within the <b>steam</b> <b>ejector</b> of the entire system. Compared with simulation results generated by the ideal gas model, the present results utilizing wet steam model show good agreement with the referenced experimental data and improve the accuracy of the numerical prediction on the axial pressure distribution. Furthermore, the geometry of the mixing chamber has been studied and the optimized size of the <b>steam</b> <b>ejector</b> was discovered, which improves the performance of the <b>steam</b> <b>ejector</b> with the same operating conditions. Moreover, the influence of the primary flow pressure on the condensation effect was studied.

30|$|Single flash {{power plants}} are {{classified}} {{according to their}} steam turbines types, i.e., the turbine exit conditions. Two such basic types are the single flash with a condensation system and the single flash back pressure system. In the first type, a condenser operating at very low pressure is used to condensate the steam leaving the steam turbine. The condenser should operate at low vacuum pressure to maintain a large enthalpy difference across the expansion process of the steam turbine, hence resulting in a higher power output. The geothermal fluid usually contains non-condensable gases which are collected at the condenser. Such a collection of gases may raise the condenser pressure, therefore the gases should {{be removed from the}} condenser. This can be achieved by installing vacuum pumps, compressors, or <b>steam</b> <b>ejectors.</b> The condenser heat removal is done either by using a cooling tower or through cold air circulation in the condenser.|$|R
