The pass-by test has {{to be carried out}} at a site that fulfills the TSI requirements. The need has arisen to be able to perform TSI pass-by type testing at non-compliant sites. In the ACOUTRAIN project, procedures have been proposed for the transposition of pass-by measurement results for vehicle and track. This allows for transposition of pass-by data obtained at a non-compliant site to a TSI compliant track, or to another vehicle on the same track. Transposition of track or vehicle requires source separation of the rolling noise contributions of vehicle and track to the total pass-by level. Several methods will be discussed for this purpose, based on combinations of measurement results and calculations. A transposition method is illustrated and validated by a practical case, in which both the reference and the transposed situations have actually been measured...|$|R

Even with less complexity than the others (including Motorola's recent ITU/UAWG proposal in [1]), this new method has complexity feasible only for upstream ADSL, where more than 5 - 6 dB of PAR reduction is achieved. We maintain that our previous methods are best for downstream PAR reductions of 6 - 8 dB.

The measuring wheelset was calibrated as a force transducer and was used to determine the wheel and rail interaction forces for LE-MA 6000 kW electric locomotive made by Softronic Craiova.
