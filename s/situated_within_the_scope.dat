40|$|This work is <b>situated</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of the {{emerging}} complexity sciences and tries to bridge scientific and artistic intentions for understanding complexity by doing experiments. To this end, we propose the use of simple, "minimal" models coupled with expression functions that translate model results to visual elements or properties. Number series appear to be good candidates {{for this type of}} experiment, because they are simple, inflexible and infinite. Expression functions on the other hand may be arbitrary and subjective. Our case study is based on the well-known Fibonacci series and shows that, by constraining some aspect of the visual form, an expression function may translate the number series to a complex visual form. Various expression functions are investigated and their results exemplified by selected images. Several dimensions of future work are also briefly outlined...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project Reform was <b>situated</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> {{of research and}} technological development of steel and its utilisation. The central point of investigation was {{the determination of the}} load capability of preformed and subsequently welded parts made of high-strength steels. In order to cover a wide spectrum of automotive steel applications and with respect to the current development of modern high-strength steels, - two dual phase steels (HCT 780 X, HCT 980 X), - one trip steel (HCT 690 T), and - one complex phase steel (HDT 780 CD) were selected for the investigations at a sheet thickness of 1. 5 mm. For comparison, the micro-alloyed steel HX 340 LAD acts as the low-strength reference and the press hardening steel 22 MnB 5 (quenched) represents the maximum hardening state. For the experimental verification of the material behaviour for different forming conditions, all selected materials (except 22 MnB 5) were preformed by stretching, biaxial stretching, deep drawing and rolling with two different strain levels each. The main result of the Reform project was to demonstrate the 'modus operandi in principle' for the assessment of the residual formability under crash loading conditions of subsequently welded high-strength steel components. Based on the experimental results, a closed loop simulation of the chain 'cold-forming - welding - crash load' for the prediction of the crash behaviour of car body components was evaluated at U-channel profiles as well as at crash bumper reinforcement demonstrator parts. Guidelines for the consideration of the influences of cold forming and subsequently welding on the behaviour under static, cyclic and crash loads are also given...|$|E
30|$|Even after Maharshi Mehi’s {{passing in}} 1986, many monks {{independently}} continue to impart {{the teachings of}} Santmat in various regions of India and experiment with the interpretations of his teachings as seen in their inclusion of lived religions. At the same time, each sub-branch continues to identify itself as “santmat,” despite minor variations in following the path. These sub-branches, which are united by the common Guru Maharshi Mehi, emphasize the four principles of Santmat as articulated by the Guru: 1) Guru (importance of a guru who has experienced Divine Light and Sound within); 2) Dhyāna (mediation {{at least three times}} a day); 3) Satsang (listening to the teaching of sants and inner contemplation); and 4) Sadācār (moral conduct, abstaining from five vices, lying, stealing, intoxicating substances, violence, and sexual misconduct). All of these principles are shown to be present in the texts of Vedic Dharma, including the Rāmāyaṇa and the Bhagavad-Gītā. Through its leadership of sannyāsīs, the tradition affirms the integral relationship between Santmat and Vedic Dharma; it <b>situates</b> itself <b>within</b> <b>the</b> broader <b>scope</b> of <b>the</b> wisdom of Sanātana Dharma, which was defined by Maharshi Mehi as a philosophy of Truth that can be accessed through the inner path of meditation.|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} this thesis were to objectively assess the {{prevalence}} of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) among Māori and non-Māori adults in a community-based sample, {{and to develop a}} questionnaire-based multivariate predictive tool for OSAS, to help improve referral of patients to specialist sleep services, and prioritise waiting lists. This research was <b>situated</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> wider <b>scope</b> of ethnic inequalities in health between Māori and non-Māori, and was conducted within a Kaupapa Māori Research (KMR) framework. Between August 1999 and June 2001 letters and information were progressively sent out to 1200 (600 Māori, 600 non-Māori) Wellington residents aged 30 - 60 years selected randomly from the electoral rolls. Participants were asked to wear a small sleep monitoring device (MESAM 4) for one night in their own homes and to fill out a sleep questionnaire. Contemporaneously, sleep and questionnaire data were collected from 510 consecutive patients aged 30 - 60 years, who were referred to the regional sleep clinic for suspected OSAS. In the community sample, OSA was found to be more prevalent among Māori. Among men, 21. 98 % of Māori had OSA (RDI≥ 5) compared with 11. 37 % of non-Māori. Among women, 6. 28 % of Māori and 3. 02 % of non-Māori respectively had OSA (RDI≥ 5). The higher risk among Māori appeared to be due to well-recognised risk factors such as higher body mass index (BMI) and larger neck circumference, rather than ethnicity per se. Using the combined data from the community and clinical samples, two clinical prediction models were developed using logistic regression modelling. One model (Model 1 a) included age, sex, observed apnoeas, self-reported habitual snoring, subjective excessive daytime sleepiness, and BMI. The second model (Model 2 a) included neck circumference instead of BMI. Model 1 a correctly classified 82. 50 % of participants (sensitivity 72 %, specificity 87 %). Model 2 a correctly classified 81. 10 % of participants (sensitivity 80 %, specificity 82 %). This research indicates that OSA is a common problem among New Zealand adults and that ethnic disparities exist. The results provide important guidance for planning to meet population needs, by identifying differential needs of specific groups. The prediction models provided reliable estimates of a priori probability of OSA, and therefore may be useful tools for screening patients for OSAS...|$|R
40|$|By {{utilizing}} Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) methodology, {{this study}} explores the ideological function {{of language in}} the Kurdish journalistic discourse of the pre-WWI period (1898 - 1914). Informed by the CDA approach, the present study perceives language as a social practice that produces meanings and presumes a dialectical relationship between language and ideology {{in the construction of}} social realities, beliefs and identities. Hence, this study is <b>situated</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> wider <b>scope</b> of discourse analysis that focuses on the link between identity, discourse, power and ideology. The study particularly utilizes, in an eclectic manner, the CDA conceptual frameworks developed by Norman Fairclough and Ruth Wodak in order to examine and explain the ideological function of the Kurdish journalistic discourse in the formation of Kurdish national identity from the prespective of a linguistically informed discursive study. To this end, from the perspective of CDA approach, the study methodically and analytically conducts an exhaustive close textual examination of numerous discourse samples taken from the corpora of three Kurdish journals of the late Ottoman period, i. e., Kurdistan (1898 - 1902), Kürd Teavün ve Terakki Gazetesi (The Kurdish Gazette for Mutual Aid and Progress) (1908 - 1909) and Rojî Kurd (Kurdish Sun) (1913). Given that the historical circumstance have a tremendous effect on the formation of discourses, this study investigates discourse practices and language devices employed in the Kurdish journals by taking into consideration the distinctive sociocultural and political conditions in which each journal was published. The study concludes that contrary to the common misperception in the literature, the Kurdish press of the late Ottoman period served as a platform on which Kurdish intellectuals negotiated, constructed and disseminated a distinctive form of Kurdish national identity and nationalism in their discourse despite –sometimes at the expense of- the hegemonic Ottoman and Pan-Islamic identities. However, although the Kurdish journalistic discourse managed to produce a Kurdish nationalist discourse among the Kurdish intellectuals and a small segment of Kurdish reading public, it failed to imitate the Andersonian notion of ‘imagined communities’ as the ‘cultural products’ of ‘print-capitalism’ that would immensely contributed to the formation of a unified field of communication around a national print-language. As a result the Kurdish identity discourse remained inconsequential in terms of making an impact among a larger Kurdish public that would ultimately lead to the construction of a braoder imagined Kurdish national community. The present study attributes the limited power and influence of the Kurdish journals or the Kurdish printing-press on Kurdish masses to the unfavourable historical circumstances, including the novelty of the newspaper genre, the low literacy rate in Kurdistan, the state-imposed restrictions on the production and dissemination of the journals, the personal and familial concerns and interests of the Kurdish leadership of the period and the lingering effects of both parochial (tribal, linguistic, sectarian, regional) and meta-loyalties (Islamism, Ottomanism) among Kurds in the era of nationalism...|$|R
