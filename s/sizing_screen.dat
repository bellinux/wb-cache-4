50|$|The {{feed into}} the {{concentrate}} processing section {{is made up}} of fines concentrate (<0.5 mm) and DMS concentrate (-9 +0.5 mm), containing mainly wolframite, cassiterite, iron oxides, and some silicates and arsenic minerals. The DMS concentrate is fed into a regrind ball mill which operates in closed circuit with a 450 micron Derrick <b>sizing</b> <b>screen.</b> The fines concentrate reports onto this Derrick screen directly to avoid over-grinding of the finer portion of this stream. The undersize of the regrind mill <b>sizing</b> <b>screen</b> is pumped via a dewatering cyclone into a conditioning tank. In this tank, several chemicals are added to enable sulphide flotation in three Outotec Denver flotation cells, targeting removal of arsenopyrite. The sulphide concentrate (floats) is pumped to the thickener for disposal, and the underflow (roaster feed) is dewatered using a filter belt. In the soft granite the arsenic occurs mainly as scorodite, which cannot be floated.|$|E
50|$|The {{secondary}} DMS circuit further refines {{the primary}} DMS sinks, producing a final DMS concentrate (sinks). The cut {{point of this}} circuit is around 3.2 g/cm^3, allowing rejection of binary particles with excessive silicate content {{as well as any}} heavier gangue particles. The floats are sent to an Ersel ball mill operating in closed circuit with a double-deck <b>sizing</b> <b>screen.</b> The >1.7 mm portion of the mill product returns to the mill for further grinding, the -1.7 +0.5 mm product makes up scavenger DMS feed, and the <0.5 mm product is combined with DMS effluent cyclone underflow to make up additional feed to the fines storage tank. The scavenger DMS circuit is identical to the secondary DMS circuit but operates on a finer feed. Floats report to the mill for further grinding and sinks make up an additional stream of DMS concentrate.|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this project was to reduce the {{aflatoxin}} level in the final coproduct of ethanol bioprocessing [...] DDGS. This was pursued by examining the effects of reduction of aflatoxin in the incoming corn prior to bioprocessing, the degradation of aflatoxin in the intermediate products, namely DWG and CDS, during processing, and aflatoxin degradation in the DDGS. Segregation techniques (<b>size</b> <b>screening</b> and density sorting) and detoxification methods (conventional and microwave heating, food additives, and high voltage atmospheric cold plasma) were evaluated for their effectiveness in aflatoxin reduction. ^ Effectiveness of physical segregation of aflatoxin contaminated corn was investigated by <b>size</b> <b>screening</b> and density sorting in a 737 kg corn lot with an aflatoxin level of 185 ppb. There are statistically significant differences in major and minor diameters, the sphericities and the densities between moldy and healthy corn kernels. The moldy corn kernels had a smaller major diameter, greater sphericity and a lower density. Results indicated that removal of fine material from the corn lot through <b>size</b> <b>screening</b> could significantly reduce aflatoxin in the remaining lot. Further removal of small size kernels through cleaning with a screen cleaner and removal of lower density kernels with a gravity table gave an additional reduction of aflatoxin in the remaining corn lot. ^ Reductions of aflatoxin achieved by conventional heating (using a convection oven and water bath) and microwave heating to degrade the aflatoxin were also investigated. The presence of water is critical to aflatoxin degradation during heating. Aflatoxin is very stable during dry heating and a temperature of 150 ºC is required to initiate decomposition of aflatoxin. HPLC-MS studies revealed that aflatoxin B 1 was converted into its enantiomer by dry heating. During wet heating for 1 h at 80 °C, 73...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to televised thin and average size models on body dissatisfaction and actual food intake were examined. Normal weight female students (N= 104) were exposed to a 30 -min movie clip featuring beautiful girls. Half of them viewed the movie clip in normal <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> (4 : 3) {{and the other half}} viewed the same movie clip in broad <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> (16 : 9), in which the body size of the actresses was slightly stretched breadthways.

Two interaction effects were found between <b>screen</b> <b>size</b> and restrained eating on body dissatisfaction and actual food intake. Restrained eaters tended to feel worse and eat less in the average size condition compared to the thin model condition, whereas unrestrained eaters felt worse and ate less in the thin model condition compared to the average size condition.
