5|$|Hemming's Cartulary is a {{manuscript}} cartulary, or collection of charters and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming {{around the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the British Library as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The <b>second</b> <b>section</b> was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the Liber Wigorniensis, is a collection of Anglo-Saxon charters and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The <b>second</b> <b>section,</b> Hemming's Cartulary proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{present the}} {{microscopic}} lateral tarsal fixation findings in Caucasians, {{focusing on the}} lateral rectus capsulopalpebral fascia (lrCPF), lateral canthal band (LCB), and the tarsus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven Caucasian cadavers (13 eyelids: 7 right and 6 left; age range, 78 - 101 years) were used. Microscopic axial sections parallel to the eyelid margin were made and stained with Masson's trichrome. The first and <b>second</b> <b>sections</b> of the upper eyelids were obtained at 1 mm and 5 mm, respectively, superior to the upper eyelid margin. The first and <b>second</b> <b>sections</b> of the lower eyelid were obtained at 1 mm and 3 mm, respectively, below the lower eyelid margin. RESULTS: All first sections of the upper eyelids (7 specimens: 3 right and 4 left) showed continuity of the lrCPF with the tarsus. The LCB merged with the lrCPF and connected to the tarsus (3 eyelids) or the muscle of Riolan (4 eyelids). All <b>second</b> <b>sections</b> of the upper eyelids (9 specimens: 4 right and 5 left) showed direct communication of the lrCPF, intermingling with the LCB, with the tarsus. All first sections of the lower eyelids (4 specimens: 2 right and 2 left), showed direct insertions of the lrCPF on the tarsus. The LCB, merging with the lrCPF, communicated with the tarsus and the muscle of Riolan (all 4 eyelids). All <b>second</b> <b>sections</b> of the lower eyelids (7 specimens: 2 right and 5 left) showed direct insertion of the lrCPF, intermingling with the LCB, on the tarsus. CONCLUSIONS: The lateral aspect of the tarsal plate in Caucasians {{is supported by the}} lrCPF and the LCB, similar to that in Asians.

5|$|The {{melodic line}} of part B is {{contrasting}} in both its static {{character and the}} vehemence of the piano accompaniment, and by the double forte dynamics, as much by the double forte dynamics which give a brutal character, as {{by the use of}} sequences (E major to begin with, then B major, G major, E major, etc.).

5|$|In 1992, the Norwegian Parliament {{decided to}} build the first {{high-speed}} railway in Norway, from Oslo via the new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen to Eidsvoll. This line would run parallel to the Hoved Line, increasing the speed and capacity along the route. Fast express and regional trains could run along the new section, while slower commuter trains used the old tracks and could make many stops without disturbing other traffic. Projects were launched during the 1990s to create similar high-speed bypasses from Oslo to Ski, and from Skøyen (west of Oslo) to Asker. Construction of the latter—christened the Asker Line—started in 2001, and the first section from Asker to Sandvika opened in 2005, while the <b>second</b> <b>section</b> is expected to open in 2011.|$|E
