500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record the album, tentatively titled Welcome to the Universe. The band and Ezrin chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, starting an intense period of preproduction focused on fifty songs. The isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace. Jared Leto said that while recording in Wyoming, [...] "there was an interesting dichotomy, a kind of contradiction with the technology and the organic world that we were surrounded [...] It's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> ended up in the music". Ezrin helped the band to understand the importance of an album's structure and how to create a progression, rather than a simple series of singles. [...] "We really wanted to create something that had depth," [...] Leto explained. He described the process of working with Ezrin as tumultuous but also fulfilling, having its own dynamics. He also stated that Virtue was a key element in helping the band define their sound.|$|E
500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I {{try not to think about}} things like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, said he would like to try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E

[...] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was [...] "nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him..."

2500|$|At {{the start}} of {{training}} camp Tortorella promised to make changes {{to the way the}} Canucks played. He wanted to make the team tougher to play against. Some of the techniques he felt would accomplish this were hard forechecking, protecting the puck, being strong along the boards, and increasing shot blocking. The Canucks finished the 2012–13 season as the 27th ranked team in blocked shots while the Rangers finished sixth. Tortorella also said that he would use the Sedin twins to kill penalties. The Sedins had asked Vigneault to be used on the penalty kill, but he opted to keep them rested for their offensive role instead. Upon learning that they would be killing penalties Henrik Sedin said: [...] "It's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{is a big part of}} becoming a great player. You have to be on the ice for all situations. For us, we were counted upon to score goals, and if we didn't, then we were terrible. I think you grow as players when you play all situations." [...] Tortorella put the Canucks through a physically demanding training camp. Players were asked to run two miles in 12 minutes and were put through a series of intense skating drills. Tortorella believed he could learn about his players when they were exhausted and asked them to give a little more.|$|E
