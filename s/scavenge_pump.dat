2500|$|Stewart {{had some}} success in other forms of racing during the year, winning the 1966 Rothmans 12 Hour International Sports Car Race and almost winning the Indianapolis 500 on his first attempt, in John Mecom's Lola T90-Ford, only to be denied by a broken <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> while leading by over a lap with eight laps to go. However, Stewart's performance, having had the race fully in hand, sidelined only by {{mechanical}} failure, won him Rookie of the Year honours despite the winner, Graham Hill, also being an Indianapolis rookie.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] Cosworth-tuned {{engine is}} heavily {{modified}} from the stock 2.3 litre Duratec. The cylinder head, block, crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons are upgraded by Cosworth. Cosworth also integrates an advanced dry-sump {{with an extra}} internal <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> to distribute the oil. While a dry-sump system requires more oil (more weight), a dry-sump will keep the engine lubricated under hard cornering unlike a wet-sump system. Cosworth also radicalizes the cam shafts and upgrades the exhaust system. This may cause the engine to run a little more [...] "rough" [...] at low RPMs, but it drastically increases performance. The inlet system is also replaced with an advanced, custom roller-barrel system. This increases airflow at full throttle compared to a butterfly inlet, boosting performance. The engine also has a custom chip designed by Cosworth for a further increase in performance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{particularly}} elaborate {{arrangement for}} the purifying and heating {{of the heavy}} oil used in the main engine was {{a feature of the}} machinery installation. The ship was powered by an eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine of the type Sulzer 8SD72-CRDA, which was built under license by [...] Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico in Trieste. Each cylinder had a bore of [...] and a stroke of [...] The engine's normal service rating was 5,600hp at 125 rpm, driving a Karl Zeise right-hand four-bladed propeller of [...] im diameter. The main engine was generally of standard Sulzer design of the crosshead type, with an independent <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> to each cylinder. It was arranged for operation on heavy oil. The only departure from standard was that the fuel valves had special provisions to enable the fuel to be circulated. The pistons were oil-cooled and the jackets fresh water-cooled. On the starboard side of the engine-room were three AEG 160kW 120-volt generators, each driven by a Sulzer four-stroke Diesel engine. The emergency set comprised a Motorenwerke Mannheim AG generator driving a two-cylinder 31hp engine which drives a 20kW AEG generator, also a two-stage compressor capable of delivering 26 CU.m. of free air per hour. The fuel consumption of the vessel, when running at full speed and on heavy oil, was 24 tons a day, while the Diesel-oil consumption of the three generators was approximately three tons per day. Adele and her sister ship Amelia had for cargo ships of that time a powerful drive: normally they ran with , but their top speed was [...]|$|E

5000|$|Coolant {{exits the}} DB 601 at two points {{located at the}} front of the engine and at the base of each {{cylinder}} block casting immediately adjacent to the crank case. In the Heinkel system, an [...] "S"-shaped steel pipe took the coolant from each side of the engine to one of two steam separators mounted alongside the engine's reduction gear and immediately behind the propeller spinner. The separators, designed by engineers Jahn and Jahnke, accepted the water at about 110 C and [...] of pressure. The vertically mounted, tube-shaped separators contained a centrifugal impeller at the top connected to an impeller-type <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> at the bottom. The coolant was expanded through the upper impeller where it lost pressure, boiled and cooled. The by-product was mostly very hot coolant and some steam. The liquid coolant was slung by the centrifugal impeller to the sides of the separator where it fell by gravity to the bottom of the unit. There, it was pumped to header tanks located in the leading edges of both wings by the <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump.</b> The presence of the <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> was necessary to ensure the entire separator did not simply fill up with high-pressure coolant coming from the engine.|$|E
50|$|Matich {{led from}} the start but was out after just 5 laps with a failed <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump.</b> McRae {{recorded}} {{the first of three}} AGP wins (all won at Sandown) by 3 seconds from the Lola T300-Chevrolet of Frank Gardner who had qualified 3rd. British International driver David Hobbs finished 3rd in his McLaren M18/M22-Chevrolet after starting from 4th on the grid.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Schematic {{diagram of}} a basic dry-sump engine {{lubrication}} system. The oil collects in sump (1), is withdrawn continuously by <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> (2) and {{travels to the}} oil tank (3), where gases entrained in the oil separate and the oil cools. Gases (6) are returned to the engine sump. Pressure pump (4) forces the de-gassed and cooled oil (5) back to the engine's lubrication points (7).|$|E
5000|$|Improved pump {{efficiency}} to maintain oil {{supply to the}} engine. Since <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity {{rather than having to}} be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical pressure pump, which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the pressure pump is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of cornering forces.|$|R
50|$|When {{decompression}} is started, {{the operator}} will notify the occupants and release chamber gas {{to the atmosphere}} or to <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> if it to be recycled. The rate of pressure reduction is controlled to follow the specified decompression schedule within tolerance.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, Auster Aircraft {{utilised}} an uncompleted Autocrat airframe and wing {{structure and}} incorporated a larger fin and rudder {{to compensate for}} the installation of a 130 h.p. de Havilland Gipsy Major engine which had been modified by the fitment of double <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> to match the cooling system.|$|R
50|$|Sulzer ZG9 was a pre-World War II opposed-piston {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} by Sulzer. The engine was available {{with a choice}} of two, three and four cylinders (2ZG9, 3ZG9, 4ZG9); the two-cylinder version developed 120 bhp. It used a piston <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump.</b> This was mounted vertically above one rocker, driven by a bellcrank from the main rockers. This engine is sometimes cited as an inspiration for the Commer TS3 design.|$|E
50|$|First-time starter Jackie Stewart led by over a lap late in {{the race}} in John Mecom's Lola T90-Ford. However, inside ten laps to go, his oil {{pressure}} dropped too low due to a broken <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump.</b> Stewart parked the car, {{and walked back to}} the pits. Fellow rookie Graham Hill inherited the lead and led a total of 10 laps to win, the first rookie winner since 1927. Despite parking the car, Stewart was voted the rookie of the year over Hill.|$|E
5000|$|Two-stroke engines have a total-loss {{lubrication}} system. Lubricating oil {{is mixed}} with the fuel, either manually beforehand (the petroil method), or automatically via an oil pump. Prior to being burned in the combustion chamber, this air/fuel/oil mixture passes through the engine's crankcase, lubricating the moving parts as it does so. In order to reduce exhaust smoke, the Kawasaki H2 [...] 2-stroke triple motorcycle had a <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> with a spring-loaded ball-valve under each crankcase to return surplus oil to the tank for reuse.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scavenging</b> oil <b>pump</b> to {{maintain}} pressure during heavy cornering ...|$|R
50|$|The engine {{had three}} {{horizontal}} cylinders, the outer {{two of which}} were power cylinders and the centre cylinder used as a <b>scavenging</b> <b>pump.</b> Each power cylinder contained two slightly oversquare opposed pistons with uniflow piston-porting. Unusually for a small two-stroke, there was no reliance on the Kadenacy effect. The transfer ports though were angle-drilled to encourage swirl.|$|R
40|$|Development of {{a method}} for calculating the {{volumetric}} efficiency of piston engines with intake pipes. Application of this method to the <b>scavenging</b> <b>pumps</b> of two-stroke-cycle engines with crankcase scavenging and to four-stroke-cycle engines. The utility of the method is demonstrated by volumetric-efficiency tests of the two-stroke-cycle engines with crankcase scavenging. Its practical application to the calculation of intake pipes is illustrated by example...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of the dry}} sump's {{external}} oil reservoir, {{excess air}} can escape the oil before the oil is pumped back through the engine. Dry sumps also allow for more power because they {{reduce the amount of}} windage, oil sloshing up into the rotating assembly, and the vacuum from the <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> improves ring seal. Dry sumps are more popular in racing applications because of the improved power and reduced oil sloshing that would otherwise reduce oil pressure. Disadvantages of dry sumps are increased weight, additional parts, and more chances for leaks and problems to occur.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{wet sump}} engines have one oil pump. It is {{generally}} located inside {{the lower part}} of the engine, usually below and/or to one side of the crankshaft. On dry sump engines, at least two oil pumps are required: one to pressurize and distribute the oil around the engine components, and at least one other 'scavenge pump' to evacuate the oil which has pooled at the bottom of the engine. This <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> is sometimes (but not always) located in the 'sump' of the engine, and crucially, this scavenge pump's flow-rate capacity must exceed that of the pump which pressurizes and distributes oil throughout the engine.|$|E
50|$|It {{is officially}} classed as safe to {{transport}} provided it is labelled as flammable. Although engine starters {{do not require}} an air supply for their basic operation, air was supplied to later designs, {{such as that of}} the English Electric Lightning, by an automatic <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> simply to control these fumes. The history of AVPIN use on the Lightning demonstrated it was both safe and effective in use. The reduced availability of AVPIN is now a restriction on the continued operation of some preserved military aircraft, such as Lightnings in the UK and South Africa and some are thus being converted to electric starting.|$|E

Same as the IO-320-B1D but this model permits installation {{and operation of}} the engine in the inverted position. The differences include a front-mounted propeller governor, two dry oil sumps, dual external oil <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps,</b> an oil tank, three options for {{the position of the}} fuel injector and a Type 1 dynafocal mount.|$|R

50|$|There {{are very}} few similar engines. Opposed-piston diesel engines are rare enough at this size, the rocker lever {{arrangement}} was almost unheard of. Probably the only engine using a similar arrangement was the pre-war Sulzer ZG9. This was an opposed-piston engine {{with a choice of}} two, three and four cylinders (2ZG9, 3ZG9, 4ZG9); the two-cylinder version developed 120 bhp. Its layout was very similar to the Commer engines, but it used a piston <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> rather than a Roots blower. This was mounted vertically above one rocker, driven by a bellcrank from the main rockers. This engine is sometimes cited as an inspiration for the Commer design.|$|E
5000|$|... 1966 saw {{him almost}} win the Indianapolis 500 {{on his first}} attempt, in John Mecom's Lola T90-Ford, only to be denied by a broken <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> while leading by over a lap with eight laps to go. However, Stewart's performance, having had the race fully in hand, sidelined only by {{mechanical}} failure, won him Rookie of the Year honours despite the winner, Graham Hill, also being an Indianapolis rookie. At {{the start of the}} 1966 season, Stewart won the Australasian 8 round championship from his BRM teammate Graham Hill in 2 litre BRMs and also raced closely with his great rival and friend Jim Clark who was somewhat disadvantaged by an unreliable Lotus 39 which was let down by old Climax 2.5s.|$|E
5000|$|A {{supply of}} {{lubricating}} oil must be fed to the crankcase {{to supply the}} crankshaft bearings. Since the crankcase {{is also used to}} supply air to the engine, the engine's lubricating oil is carried into the cylinder with the air charge, burnt during combustion and carried out of the exhaust. The oil carried from the crankcase to the cylinder is used to lubricate the piston. This means that a two-stroke hot-bulb engine will gradually burn its supply of lubricating oil, a design known as a [...] "total-loss" [...] lubricating system. There were also designs that employed a <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> or similar to remove oil from the crankcase and return it to the lubricating-oil reservoir. Lanz hot-bulb tractors and their many imitators had this feature. This reduced oil consumption considerably.|$|E
5000|$|A {{large number}} of small {{two-stroke}} engines use a sealed crankcase as a compression chamber for their mixture. These are hugely common as petrol or gasoline small engines for motorcycles, generator sets and garden equipment. Both sides of the piston are used as working surfaces: the upper side is the power piston, the lower side acts as a <b>scavenging</b> <b>pump.</b> As the piston rises, it pushes out exhaust gases and produces a partial vacuum in the crankcase, which draws in fuel and air. As the piston travels downward, the compressed fuel/air charge is pushed from the crankcase into the cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example is}} the oil pan of an engine. The oil is used to {{lubricate}} the engine's moving parts and it pools in a reservoir known as its sump, {{at the bottom of}} the engine. Use of a sump requires the engine to be mounted slightly higher to make space for it. Often though, oil in the sump can slosh during hard cornering, starving the oil pump. For these reasons, racing and piston aircraft engines are [...] "dry sumped" [...] using <b>scavenge</b> <b>pumps</b> and a swirl tank to separate oil from air, which is also sucked up by the pumps.|$|R
40|$|The author，at first， studied on the {{tracer gas}} method {{which had already}} been {{suggested}} to be applicable method to measuring the trapping efficiency of 2 stroke cycle engines. And in consequence，the most excellent condition of measurement in both accuracy and possibility of reappearance was established. Next，with the aid of tracer gas method， he studied on scavenging of crank case compression type 2 stroke cycle diesel engines，and influences of the engine rpm 2 ̆ 7 s，delivery ratios，fuel injection quantities， crank case compression ratios and guide angles of scavenging ports，upon the scavenging were examined. Furthermore these engines were converted to the type with a <b>scavenging</b> <b>pump</b> and compared with the former type engines. And thus the scavenging characteristics of the crank case compression type engines were made distinct...|$|R
5000|$|To {{build the}} turbo, Kawasaki did not simply add fuel {{injection}} and a turbocharger {{to a standard}} GPz750 motorcycle engine. Some parts are exclusive to the [...] "turbo", such as low-compression (7.8:1) pistons, stronger gearbox internals, a modified oil pan with an extra oil <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump,</b> a boost indicator, the characteristic aluminium [...] "turbo"-spoiler, and a different Unitrak linkage (which gave it a firmer ride). The exhaust system and turbo (except silencers) were strengthened with different tube material, and some dimensions and frame geometry differed (28° rake instead of 26°). The rest came from conventionally aspirated 750 and the 1100 (front fork, brakes and some injection parts) and the entire cylinder head assembly from the KZ 650. The GPz Turbo used a Hitachi HT-10B turbocharger, positioned close to the headers, and electronic fuel injection.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{adoption}} of Formula 5000 regulations into Australian Formula 1 in 1971, Matich and Nehrybecki produced the Matich A50, the first single seater to wear the Matich name. The A50 {{was designed as a}} replacement for Frank Matich's successful McLaren M10B (Frank Matich had taken over development from McLaren of the M10B for F5000 racing in 1970 and dubbed it the M10C). Designed on a modular basis with separate front suspension, cockpit and rear end, the car was powered by a 5.0 L Repco Holden V8 engine. Matich drove an A50 to victory in the car's first race, the 1971 Australian Grand Prix at Warwick Farm after qualifying on pole position. Just three months after his 1971 AGP success, Matich qualified the A50 on pole for the 1972 Australian Grand Prix at Sandown and led early before retiring with <b>scavenge</b> <b>pump</b> failure on lap 5. Frank Matich then {{went on to win the}} 1972 Australian Drivers' Championship at the wheel of his A50. A total of four A50s were built during this period.|$|E
