The British version differed, having <b>shaft</b> <b>drive.</b> That year, {{the names of the}} automotive and aero-engine divisions were changed to Lorraine-Dietrich.|$|E
25|$|The Yamaha XJ650 Maxim is a {{mid-size}} motorcycle by the Yamaha Motor Company {{introduced in}} 1980 as the Maxim I and produced through 1983. Yamaha designed the high-performance XJ650 as a brand-new four-cylinder with <b>shaft</b> <b>drive,</b> and built it specifically {{as a special}} cruiser. The XJ Maxim was the successor of the XS Special introduced in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{begins with}} pedals which rotate the cranks, which {{are held in}} axis by the bottom bracket. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A {{very small number of}} bicycles use a <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shaft</b> <b>drives</b> {{operate at}} a very {{consistent}} rate of efficiency and performance, without adjustments or maintenance, though {{lower than that of}} a properly adjusted and lubricated chain. <b>Shaft</b> <b>drives</b> are typically more complex to disassemble when repairing flat rear tires, and the manufacturing cost is typically higher.|$|R

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of gear change mechanisms, known as derailleurs and hub gears. Both systems have {{advantages}} and disadvantages, and which is preferable depends on the particular circumstances. There are a few other relatively uncommon types of gear change mechanism which are briefly mentioned {{near the end of}} this section. Derailleur mechanisms can only be used with chain drive transmissions, so bicycles with belt drive or <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> transmissions must either be single speed or use hub gears.|$|E
25|$|In some engines, {{bleed air}} is also tapped to provide power for accessories, {{as well as}} a {{mechanical}} <b>shaft</b> <b>drive.</b> Bleed air is particularly useful when a source of compressed air is specifically needed, either to pressurise cabin air, or as a supply of cooling air to other components (to avoid excess heat, this is taken for a low-pressure tapping, or from the LP compressor of a two-shaft engine). One important use for bleed air is for cross-starting of other engines in a multi-engine aircraft.|$|E

50|$|In the {{simplest}} application, clutches connect and disconnect two rotating <b>shafts</b> (<b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> or line shafts). In these devices, one shaft is typically attached to an engine or other power unit (the driving member) {{while the other}} <b>shaft</b> (the <b>driven</b> member) provides output power for work. While typically the motions involved are rotary, linear clutches are also possible.|$|R
2500|$|The Breva 1100, Norge, Bellagio, Stelvio and 1200 Sport feature Guzzi's {{recently}} patented swingarm system, {{marketed as}} Compact Reactive <b>Shaft</b> <b>Drive</b> [...] {{also known as}} Ca. R.C. or CARC [...] introduced with the Breva 1100 in 2005. The system separates the shaft final drive’s torque reaction from the suspension via floating torque arms and thereby eliminates the abruptness typical of <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> systems on acceleration or throttle-release [...] still providing a quiet, reliable and low maintenance drive system. Reviewers have observed excellent braking performance and drive train smoothness attributable to the CARC system.|$|E

25|$|The AC-35 had {{side-by-side}} seating {{with a small}} baggage compartment. The fuselage was {{a combination}} of steel tube in front, and wood construction in the tail with fabric covering overall. The engine was rear mounted with a <b>shaft</b> <b>driven</b> forward propeller. The vehicle had three equal size wheels (two in front, one in the rear). The rear wheel was <b>shaft</b> <b>driven</b> from the engine and the front wheels provided steering.|$|R

The XS-750 (and later 850) a 750cc triple cylinder machine with shaft final drive was introduced almost {{seven years after}} Honda's breakthrough bike. [...] Yamaha's first four-cylinder model, the XS-1100 followed in 1978, again with <b>shaft</b> <b>drive.</b> [...] Despite being heavier and more touring oriented than its rivals it produced an impressive string of victories in endurance racing.|$|E
2500|$|An early war {{military}} {{design by}} Indian {{was based on}} the [...] Scout 640 (and was often compared to Harley-Davidson's WLA), but was either too expensive or heavy, or a combination of both. Indian's later offering, the [...] 741B was not selected to gain a US Military contract. Indian also made a version based on the [...] Chief, the 344. Approximately 1,000 experimental versions mounting the 750cc motor sideways and using <b>shaft</b> <b>drive,</b> as on a modern Moto Guzzi, the 841, were also tried.|$|E
2500|$|Attempts {{were made}} to diversify: a {{contract}} to build fishing boats was accepted, and another for a motorcycle which was produced at Suresnes. [...] At the 15th Paris Motor Show, in October 1919, [...] the company was promoting a motorcycle then in 1921 a stylish little cyclecar with a 2-cylinder 750cc two-stroke engine and <b>shaft</b> <b>drive.</b> The French Blériot cyclecars are sometimes confused with the Blériot-Whippet chain-driven cycle cars made at the Blériot-owned factory in Addlestone, England, {{but in fact the}} two vehicles had [...] "little save size in common".|$|E

2500|$|The 1980 to 1983 XJ650 Maxim {{combined}} an air-cooled, 653cc DOHC two valves per cylinder transverse inline-four {{engine and}} <b>shaft</b> <b>drive.</b> The engine employed a one-piece crankshaft with plain bearings {{and placed the}} alternator and starter behind the engine to minimize width. A chain drives the two overhead camshafts, which used shim-and-bucket adjustment. A second chain drives the oil pump located in the crankcase, while a third (Hy-Vo) chain spins the alternator. The power unit is fed by four Hitachi constant velocity carburetors and lit by electronic ignition. Four-into-two headers extracts the waste gases, which exit through two shortened mufflers.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian 841 {{was heavily}} {{inspired}} by the BMW R71 motorcycle (which, though not used by the German Army later {{was the basis for}} the Soviet M72, which is the basis for the Ural and Chiang Jiang motorcycle) as was its competitor, the Harley-Davidson XA. [...] However, unlike the XA, the 841 was not a copy of the R71. Although its tubular frame, plunger rear suspension, and <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> were similar to the BMW's, the 841 was different from the BMW in several aspects, most noticeably so with its 90-degree longitudinal-crankshaft V-twin engine and girder fork.|$|E
2500|$|The 4 cylinder, air-cooled, twin-cam 650cc {{engine is}} housed in a {{cross-braced}} duplex steel tube frame. Yamaha made the engine narrower by locating the alternator behind the cylinder block and above the gearbox {{rather than on the}} end of the crankshaft. The Maxim had <b>shaft</b> <b>drive.</b> Contemporary reports praised the Maxim's performance and braking. Criticism was aimed at engine vibration and under-damped suspension. [...] Succeeding Maxim models were refinements; the 1982 Maxim 650 had a more comfortable handlebar, an air-adjustable fork, and a more luxurious seat. A turbocharged variant, the XJ650 Seca Turbo, was featured in the 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again.|$|E
25|$|Early exchanges were {{electromechanical}} systems using motors, <b>shaft</b> <b>drives,</b> rotating {{switches and}} relays. Some types of automatic exchanges were the Strowger switch or step-by-step switch, All Relay, X-Y, panel switch and the crossbar switch.|$|R

50|$|Early {{turboshaft}} engines were {{adaptations of}} turboprop engines, delivering power through a <b>shaft</b> <b>driven</b> {{directly from the}} gas generator shafts, via a reduction gearbox. Examples of direct-drive turboshafts include marinised or industrial Rolls-Royce Dart engines.|$|R
2500|$|The car {{was fitted}} with a purpose built 18.3-litre V12 engine based on a hybrid of the Sunbeam Manitou and Sunbeam Arab aero engines. [...] This engine had four blocks of three {{cylinders}} arranged in two banks set at 60 degrees (unlike the Arab which were set at 90 degrees). Each cylinder had one inlet and two exhaust valves actuated by a single overhead camshaft. The two camshafts were driven by {{a complex set of}} 16 gears {{from the front of the}} crankshaft - a very similar arrangement to that used on the Maori engine which had two OHC per bank of cylinders. A 4-speed transmission initially drove a back axle with differential with a <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> rather than the hazardous chains of other cars. Harry Hawker drove the car in 1920 at Brooklands but suffered a burst tyre, spinning off the circuit. The differential was replaced with a simple crown wheel and pinion so that the rear wheels were locked together and it was more successful in the hands of Kenelm Lee Guinness. Brakes were crude, as was usual in the period, with a foot brake acting on the transmission and a hand brake on the rear drums. Suspension was also typical, with half-elliptic springs all round damped by Andre Hartford friction shock absorbers.|$|E
5000|$|BMW has {{produced}} <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> motorcycles since 1923; and Moto Guzzi have built shaft-drive V-twins since the 1960s. The British company, Triumph {{and the major}} Japanese brands, Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha, have produced <b>shaft</b> <b>drive</b> motorcycles.|$|E
