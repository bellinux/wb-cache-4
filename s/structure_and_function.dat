5|$|Antibodies {{are heavy}} (~150kDa) {{globular}} plasma proteins. They have sugar chains (glycans) added to conserved amino acid residues. In other words, antibodies are glycoproteins.

Among other things the expressed glycans can modulate an antibody's affinity for its corresponding FcR(s).|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the general similarity in <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of the electron transport chains in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea possess a large variety of electron-transfer enzymes. These use an equally wide set of chemicals as substrates. In common with eukaryotes, prokaryotic electron transport uses the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to pump ions across a membrane and generate an electrochemical gradient. In the bacteria, oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli is understood in most detail, while archaeal systems are at present poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, new {{techniques}} were {{developed for the}} study of plants, including methods of optical microscopy and live cell imaging, electron microscopy, analysis of chromosome number, plant chemistry and the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of enzymes and other proteins. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of molecular genetic analysis, including genomics and proteomics and DNA sequences to classify plants more accurately.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{have their}} termini located close together in 3D space. Because of this, {{it is often}} possible to design circular permutations of proteins. Today, circular permutations are generated routinely in the lab using standard genetics techniques. Although some permutation sites prevent the protein from folding correctly, many permutants have been created with nearly identical <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> to the original protein.|$|E

5|$|Progressively more {{sophisticated}} scientific technology has aided {{the development of}} contemporary botanical offshoots in the plant sciences, ranging from the applied fields of economic botany (notably agriculture, horticulture and forestry), to the detailed examination of the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of plants and their interaction with the environment over many scales from the large-scale global significance of vegetation and plant communities (biogeography and ecology) through to the small scale of subjects like cell theory, molecular biology and plant biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Proteins may be {{purified}} {{from other}} cellular components {{using a variety}} of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification.

Understanding the <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences.

5|$|The organelles of the endomembrane {{system are}} related through direct contact {{or by the}} {{transfer}} of membrane segments as vesicles. Despite these relationships, the various membranes are not identical in <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>function.</b> The thickness, molecular composition, and metabolic behavior of a membrane are not fixed, they may be modified {{several times during the}} membrane's life. One unifying characteristic the membranes share is a lipid bilayer, with proteins attached to either side or traversing them.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>function</b> are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E
