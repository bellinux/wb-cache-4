5|$|Taxes and tariffs {{are high}} for private {{enterprises}}, while state enterprises are strongly subsidised. <b>State</b> <b>regulation</b> is costly to companies; starting or closing a business {{is slow and}} costly. Government spending was predicted to reach 67% of GDP in 2007.|$|E
5|$|National {{and state}} AFL-CIO officials, fearing the New Jersey law might {{open the door}} to {{extensive}} new <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of labor unions, asked Local 54 to test the New Jersey law in court. After a regulatory appeal, the Casino Control Commission unanimously rejected the union's contention that the law was unconstitutional and preempted by the NLRA.|$|E
5|$|Night market: The {{concept of}} the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang {{government}} put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards {{the end of the}} Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night markets {{played a central role in}} medieval Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business and red light districts.|$|E

25|$|After the {{expiration}} {{of the charter}} of the Second Bank of the United States, federal revenues were handled by the Independent Treasury beginning in 1846. The Second Bank of the U.S. had also maintained some control over other banks, but in its absence banks were only under <b>state</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to exaggerate the good effect (of).... this twin system of Reformatory and Industrial Schools. The latter have been particularly successful in Ireland; and the combination of voluntary effort and private management, with <b>State</b> <b>regulation</b> and partial support—a rather dangerous experiment—has been completely justified by the result.|$|E
25|$|After the Contagious Diseases Acts were {{repealed}} {{the branch}} concentrated on eliminating regulation of prostitution in the British Empire, and in India in particular.

25|$|In 1987 the Supreme Court of the United States {{ruled that}} federally {{recognized}} tribes could operate gaming facilities on their sovereign reservation land free from <b>state</b> <b>regulation.</b> In 1988 the U.S. Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA); it set the terms for Native American tribes to operate casinos and negotiate terms with states, for instance, paying {{a portion of}} revenues in lieu of taxes.|$|E

25|$|As {{illustrated}} in the state report referenced in the previous sentence, the price of insurance that covered about 600,000 people in the small group market (about 10% of the population) was rising faster than the prices {{for the vast majority}} of the non-senior-citizen population, most of which were – and still are – covered by self-insured group insurance from large employers (self-insured plans are not subject to <b>state</b> <b>regulation).</b>|$|E
25|$|Ghénia Avril de Sainte-Croix (1855 – 21 March 1939) was a French author, {{journalist}} and feminist. For many years {{she led the}} French branch of the International Abolitionist Federation, which sought to abolish <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of prostitution and fought trafficking in women. She advised the French government and the League of Nations on women's issues. She was vice-president of the International Council of Women from 1920 and President of the National Council of French Women from 1922 to 1932.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century Adam Smith {{presented}} a philosophical foundation for explaining {{the relationship between}} law and economics. The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. antitrust law. The most influential proponents, such as Richard Posner and Oliver Williamson and the so-called Chicago School of economists and lawyers including Milton Friedman and Gary Becker, are generally advocates of deregulation and privatisation, and are hostile to <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> or {{what they see as}} restrictions on the operation of free markets.|$|E
25|$|Some of the <b>state's</b> <b>regulations</b> {{failed to}} {{adequately}} address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, {{it was reported}} that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under <b>state</b> <b>regulations</b> at the time, that meant that the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty.|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238 (1984), which was decided {{the same year as}} Pacific Gas, the Supreme Court ruled that the Atomic Energy Act did not preempt the award of punitive damages for state tort claims {{involving}} radioactive contamination. One criticism is that Silkwood is inconsistent with Pacific Gas as the purpose of the punitive damages awarded was to punish and to alter conduct involving the safety of radiological controls, giving the <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> over these activities through tort law.|$|E
25|$|The {{study also}} {{concluded}} that the Smith River was a navigable waterway, which made the water and riverbed state property (and subject to much more intensive <b>state</b> <b>regulation).</b> This was a critical finding, for the United States Constitution, various rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Montana statehood act, and federal law gave title to the beds of navigable waters to the state, and the state {{had the right to}} regulate access and use of its property. Moreover, Montana state law declared all navigable waters open for public use.|$|E
25|$|Experts, {{including}} {{director of}} the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies David Rejeski, have testified that successful commercialization depends on adequate oversight, risk research strategy, and public engagement. Berkeley, California is currently the only city in the United States to regulate nanotechnology; Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2008 considered enacting a similar law, but ultimately rejected it. Relevant for both research on and application of nanotechnologies, the insurability of nanotechnology is contested. Without <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of nanotechnology, the availability of private insurance for potential damages is seen as necessary to ensure that burdens are not socialised implicitly.|$|E

25|$|In 1911 a new California Assembly {{created a}} new {{railroad}} commission with vastly enlarged powers and brought public utilities under state supervision. Organized businessmen were the leaders of both of these reforms. The driving force for railroad regulation came less from an outraged public seeking lower rates than from shippers and merchants who wanted to stabilize their businesses. Public utility officers spearheaded campaigns for the passage, and later the enlargement of the Public Utilities Act. They expected that <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> would reduce wasteful competition between their companies, improve {{the value of their}} companies' securities, and allow them to escape continual wrangling with county and municipal authorities.|$|E
25|$|Roe v. Wade, , is a {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} United States Supreme Court {{on the issue of}} abortion. It was decided simultaneously with a companion case, Doe v. Bolton. The Court ruled 7–2 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life. Arguing that these state interests became stronger {{over the course of a}} pregnancy, the Court resolved this balancing test by tying <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of abortion to the third trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Following the <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of {{stallion}} inspections in 1820, the breeders of Oldenburg horses formed {{their own}} registry in 1861 and the breeders of the Ostfriesen horses {{did the same}} in 1869. Both employed rigorous selection along similar breeding goals, though up until the 20th century, few breeders kept pedigrees, and many mares and stallions were unregistered. However, participation improved as the 19th century {{came to a close}} and the threat of obsoletion became quite real. At this time, technological and economic developments were rendering irrevocable changes for the horse. Suited for the simple labor of unmechanized agriculture, the horses were now overshadowed by the versatile, powerful horses of Hanover, England, and Normandy.|$|E
