5000|$|Tersina is a genus of tanager. It {{contains}} a single species, the <b>swallow</b> <b>tanager</b> (Tersina viridis) [...] It is found widely throughout South America, from eastern Panama to far northern Argentina.|$|E
50|$|Golden-naped tanagers have plumage {{similar to}} those of the metallic-green tanager, the <b>swallow</b> <b>tanager</b> and the blue-and-black tanager as adults of all three species are {{primarily}} blue with black facial masking, however, the golden-naped tanager is the only primarily blue tanager with a golden or reddish crown patch or nape. Females have a similar pattern to males, but have duller colors and a narrower nape patch. Juveniles of both genders have a primarily dull blue-gray coloration with a lighter breast and belly, and lack the distinctive golden nape.|$|E

50|$|Twelve {{species of}} hawks and eagles {{are found in}} Central Oregon. There are also five falcon species. These birds of prey include bald eagle, golden eagle, {{northern}} goshawk, northern harrier, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel, prairie falcon, and peregrine falcon. There are thirteen owl species, including barn owl, barred owl, boreal owl, burrowing owl, great gray owl, and great horned owl. Turkey vultures are also common. Central Oregon is home to seven woodpecker species, including downy woodpecker, hairy woodpecker, and Lewis's woodpecker. Northern flickers {{are found in the}} Central Oregon woodlands. There are a number of smaller birds as well. These include various larks, <b>tanagers,</b> <b>swallows,</b> jays, crows, chickadees, wrentits, dippers, nuthatches, wrens, thrushes, and grosbeaks.|$|R
50|$|Given the fruit's {{attractive}} {{color and}} the conspicuous display at the branch-tips, this tree appears to be distributed by birds which eat the fruit and spread the seeds. Perching birds, namely tanagers (Thraupidae), thrushes (Turdidae) and tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), are most commonly seen to feed on the fruit. Some birds, such as the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), prune off the seedcoat and eat it, discarding the seed, but most swallow the entire fruit. Species such as the <b>swallow</b> <b>tanager</b> (Tersina viridis) and the pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), but perhaps most of all the sayaca tanager (Thraupis sayaca), appear to be particularly fond of them. Indeed, the sayaca tanager will defend richly fruiting A. glandulosa trees against similar-sized birds such as the blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana) or the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). It may be that at least locally, T. sayaca is crucial for the tree's reproduction and survival.|$|E
