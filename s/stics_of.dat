40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} the feasibility to examine the morphology and area of the atrioventricular (AV) valves in normal fetuses and fetuses with cardiac defects using spatiotemporal image correlation (STIC). METHODS: Atrioventricular valves were analyzed longitudinally in <b>STIC</b> volumes <b>of</b> 74 normal fetuses between the 15 th and 36 th week of pregnancy. The valve area was measured in a rendered view in diastole, the number of valve leaflets in systole. Longitudinal data analysis was performed using linear mixed models. Fifty fetuses with cardiac defects were examined. RESULTS: Examination <b>of</b> 355 <b>STIC</b> volumes <b>of</b> normal fetuses showed in 82. 5 % sufficient quality. The tricuspid valve leaflets were seen in 200 (68. 3 %) volumes and the mitral valve leaflets in 219 (74. 7 %) volumes. The tricuspid valve showed in 61. 1 % a round, 29. 0 % rectangle, and 8. 9 % elliptical shape and the mitral valve in 60. 1 % round, 28. 0 % rectangle, and 10. 9 % elliptical. Regression analysis revealed a positive relationship of the valve area with gestational age (p < 0. 0001). Most heart defects with stenosis showed an area below the 5 th percentile.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{differential}} {{insertion of}} the atrioventricular valves is the ultrasonographic {{representation of the}} more apical attachment of the tricuspid valve to the septum {{with respect to the}} mitral valve. A linear insertion is present when both valves form a linear continuum and has been suggested as a marker for atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs). The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the anatomical substratum of differential and linear insertions of the atrioventricular valves in normal fetal hearts and fetal hearts with an AVSD. METHODS: The extent and position of the fibrous skeleton and attachment of the atrioventricular valves to the septum were studied in histological sections of 17 normal hearts and four hearts with an AVSD from 10 + 0 weeks' gestation to 3 days postpartum with various immunohistochemical tissue markers. In addition, spatiotemporal image correlation (<b>STIC)</b> volumes <b>of</b> 10 normal hearts and <b>STIC</b> volumes <b>of</b> eight hearts with an AVSD at 13 + 6 to 35 + 5 weeks' gestation were examined. RESULTS: The differential insertion of the atrioventricular valves was visible in normal hearts in the four-chamber plane immediately beneath the aorta, but nearer the diaphragm a linear insertion was found. In hearts with an AVSD, a linear appearance was observed in the four-chamber plane immediately beneath the aorta. Towards the diaphragm, however, first a differential insertion and, more caudally, a linear insertion was found. CONCLUSIONS: Both differential and linear insertions can be found in normal fetal hearts and fetal hearts with AVSD, depending on the plane in which the four-chamber view is visualized. Therefore, measurement of the differential insertion is likely to be useful only in experienced hands. Copyright (c) 2014 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the efTect of the supram ammillary nucleus (SuM) on the hippocampus. Methods : Neurons within the SuM of rats were destroyed by local injections of an excitotoxin, ibotenic acid, and the efTects of the SuM-lesion on behaviors in an open field were investigated. Results: SuM lesions increased distance traveled, movement time and latency to start grooming, while they decreased time spent grooming.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} color and bidirectional power Doppler ultrasound combined with Fetal Intelligent Navigation Echocardiography (FINE) in examining the fetal heart. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted of fetuses {{in the second and}} third trimesters with a normal heart or with congenital heart disease (CHD). One or more spatiotemporal image correlation (STIC) volume datasets, combined with color or bidirectional power Doppler (S-flow) imaging, were acquired in the apical four-chamber view. Each successfully obtained STIC volume was evaluated by STICLoop™ to determine its appropriateness before applying the FINE method. Visualization rates for standard fetal echocardiography views using diagnostic planes and/or Virtual Intelligent Sonographer Assistance (VIS-Assistance®) were calculated for grayscale (removal of Doppler signal), color Doppler and S-flow Doppler. In four cases with CHD (one case each of tetralogy of Fallot, hypoplastic left heart and coarctation of the aorta, interrupted inferior vena cava with azygos vein continuation and asplenia, and coarctation of the aorta with tricuspid regurgitation and hydrops), the diagnostic potential of this new technology was presented. Results A total <b>of</b> 169 <b>STIC</b> volume datasets <b>of</b> the normal fetal heart (colorDoppler, n= 78; S-flow Doppler, n = 91) were obtained from 37 patients. Only a single <b>STIC</b> volume <b>of</b> color Doppler and/or a single volume of S-flow Doppler per patient were analyzed using FINE. Therefore, 60 STIC volumes (color Doppler, n = 27; S-flow Doppler, n = 33) comprised the final study group. Median gestational age at sonographic examination was 23 (interquartile range, 21 – 27. 5) weeks. Color Doppler FINE generated nine fetal echocardiography views (grayscale) using (1) diagnostic planes in 73 – 100 % of cases, (2) VIS-Assistance in 100 % of cases, and (3) a combination of diagnostic planes and/or VIS-Assistance in 100 % of cases. The rate of generating successfully eight fetal echocardiography views with appropriate color and S-flow Doppler information was 89 – 100 % and 91 – 100 % of cases, respectively, using a combination of diagnostic planes and/or VIS-Assistance. However, the success rate for the ninth echocardiography view (i. e. superior and inferior venae cavae) was 33 % and 30 % for color and S-flow Doppler, respectively. In all four cases of CHD, color Doppler FINE demonstrated evidence of abnormal fetal cardiac anatomy and/or hemodynamic flow.

In normal NaCl-containing external solution {{the decay of}} spontaneous Ca 2 +-activated Cl− currents (STICs) and Ca 2 +-activated Cl−‘tail’ currents (Itail) was described by a single exponential with a time constant (τ) that was prolonged by external anions which are more permeable than Cl− (Br−, I− and SCN−) and accelerated by less permeant anions. However, intracellular I− {{did not affect the}} τ <b>of</b> <b>STICs</b> and Itail.

External permeating anions were not obligatory for activation <b>of</b> ICl(Ca) and <b>STIC</b> τ was not altered in Cl−-free external solution.

In conclusion, external anions affect the decay of ICl(Ca) by a mechanism compatible with an interaction with a binding site which modulates Cl− channel kinetics...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} using the spatiotemporal image correlation (STIC) technology for prenatal cardiac screening, finding factors that influence the offline evaluation of reconstructed fetal heart, and establishing an optimal acquisition scheme. The study included 452 gravidae presenting for routine screening at 3 maternity centers at 20 - 38 gestational weeks. The factors influencing the quality <b>of</b> <b>STIC</b> volume data were evaluated using t test, chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. The predictive power was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Among the 452 fetuses enrolled, 353 (78. 1 %) were identified as successful and 99 (21. 9 %) as failure of evaluation of the reconstructed fetal heart. The total success rate <b>of</b> qualified <b>STIC</b> images was 78. 1 %. The display rates of reconstructed cardiac views were 86. 5 % (four-chamber view), 92. 5 % (left ventricular outflow tract view), 92. 7 % (right ventricular outflow tract view), 89. 9 % (three-vessel trachea view), 63. 9 % (aortic arch view), 81. 4 % (ductal arch view), 81 % (short-axis view of great vessels), 80. 1 % (long-cava view), and 86. 9 % (abdominal view). A logistic regression analysis showed that more than 28 gestational weeks [OR = 0. 39 (CI 95 % 0. 16, 0. 19), P = 0. 035], frequent fetal movements [OR = 0. 37 (CI 95 % 0. 16, 0. 87), P = 0. 022], shadowing [OR = 0. 36 (CI 95 % 0. 19, 0. 72), P = 0. 004], spine location at 10 - 2 o'clock [OR = 0. 08 (CI 95 % 0. 02, 0. 27), P = 0. 0], and original cardiac view [OR = 0. 51 (0. 25, 0. 89), P = 0. 019] {{had a significant impact}} on the quality <b>of</b> <b>STIC.</b> The area under the ROC curve was 0. 775. Fetal cardiac-STIC seems a feasible tool for prenatal screening of congenital heart diseases. The influence factors on the quality <b>of</b> <b>STIC</b> images included the intensity of training, gestational age, fetal conditions and parameter settings. The optimal acquisition scheme may improve the application and widespread use <b>of</b> cardiac <b>STIC...</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the liberation}} of the Philippines from Japanese {{occupation}} by the U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth Armed Forces, the freed internees <b>of</b> <b>STIC</b> joined with the remaining refugees in Manila to try to rebuild their devastated community. Temple Emil and Bachrach Hall had been totally destroyed. All had been victimized by the Japanese occupying forces, {{which resulted in the}} death of 70 members of the Jewish community. The American military took steps to assist the Jewish community in its recovery. U.S. and Filipino soldiers provided not only food, water, supplies, and medicine for the victims, but also donated $15,000 for the rebuilding of the synagogue.|$|R
