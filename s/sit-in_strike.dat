5000|$|Radical {{unionism}} {{started after}} the first world war. The movement {{was a result of}} increasing internal commissions or [...] "faculty councils". Around November of 1918, the councils/commissions had morphed into a national problem.

In May of 1919, these commissions began to transfer into councils that were managing the factories and were dominating the power structure of said workplaces. The contract also prevented democratic elections of these council members or [...] "stewards". In April 1920, at Fiat, there was the beginning of <b>sit-in</b> <b>strikes</b> by the workers, which eventually grew to 500,000 workers striking at its peak.|$|R

25|$|The {{widespread}} strikes of 1980 {{were far}} from being the first clashes between the ruling party and the working class in Poland after World War II. Despite having a “socialist” government, the elite of the Polish ruling class averaged an income twenty times that of the blue-collar worker. This elite ruling class owned or largely controlled the police, media and industry of the state, including the state-organized unions. Insufficient pay and food shortages, in addition to a growing movement in favor of independent union activism led to strikes in 1956 and 1970 which left hundreds of workers dead from clashes with police, and both the 1970 and 1976 strikes ended with some concessions but subsequent additional repressions from management. Workers were increasingly dissatisfied with their standard of living and the half-hearted responses of the government to their calls for social justice, and when in July 1980 the government attempted to raise the price of meat even further, <b>sit-in</b> <b>strikes</b> started up again.|$|R

40|$|The “Solidarity period” from August 1980 to December 1981 today {{stands out}} as the early {{beginning}} of {{the transition to democracy}} in Eastern Europe.

In retrospect {{it is obvious that the}} Solidarity movement not only pre-figured the democratic take-over in Poland in 1989, but also the peaceful revolutions in Belgrad in 2000, in Tbilisi in 2003 and in Kiev in 2004. We are used to analyse all this in terms of political science, as political history. However, it is my intention to suggest that we here may have a case of virtual history becoming real history. The peaceful revolutions had endogenous origins, but each successive one was inspired by television covering and video tapes of the earlier ones...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a seminal}} but largely ignored episode in Australian labour history. Jn 1979, the Altona Petrochemical Complex {{was the scene}} of a historic materialisation of class struggle, when 52 workers occupied the Union Carbide plant for a period of 51 days. It was, and remains, the longest factory occupation in Australian history. Occupations, generally, represent not only a challenge to the immediate party involved but a fundamental critique of the existing social, political and economic order, and in that sense must be understood within a broader milieu of resistance to the imperatives of power. Furthermore, the act of occupation is an occurrence that can be designated as a "weapon of the weak. " Factory occupations are the highest and most audacious form of occupation as they, like all occupations, challenge the supposed inviolability of property, but transcend the potentialities of other occupations by challenging the property and privileges of the ruling class. The Union Carbide <b>Sit-in</b> <b>Strike</b> constituted one such challenge. This thesis, which is situated within the broader narrative of "history from below", has been enabled by the recent acquisition of the private papers of one of the leading participants. Until now, these archival sources have not been the subject of any previous scholarly study...|$|E
5000|$|Direct action [...] {{occurs when}} a group takes an action which is {{intended}} to reveal an existing problem, highlight an alternative, or demonstrate a possible solution to a social issue. This can include nonviolent and less often violent activities which target persons, groups, or property deemed offensive to the direct action participants. Examples of nonviolent direct action (also known as nonviolence, nonviolent resistance, or civil resistance) can include <b>sit-ins,</b> <b>strikes,</b> workplace occupations, blockades, or hacktivism, while violent direct action may include political violence or assaults. Tactics such as sabotage and property destruction may be considered violent if people are hurt in the action. By contrast, electoral politics, diplomacy, negotiation, and arbitration are not usually described as direct action, as they are politically mediated. Non-violent actions are sometimes a form of civil disobedience, and may involve a degree of intentional law-breaking where persons place themselves in arrestable situations {{in order to make}} a political statement but other actions (such as strikes) may not violate criminal law.|$|R

He {{was influenced by the}} figure of Mahatma Gandhi and by the theory of civil disobedience of Henry David Thoreau. As soon as he arrived in Montgomery, Alabama, he organized and directed a massive boycott during almost one year against segregation in the municipal buses. In 1960, he took advantage of a general <b>sit-in</b> <b>strike</b> of black students in Birmingham, Alabama, to begin a campaign of national importance. Martin Luther King, Jr. worked for desegregation of blacks and obtained access for his people to all available, such as schools, public transportation, libraries, restaurants, and theatres. In the summer of l 963, his struggle reached its culminating moments when he headed a gigantic march on Washington, in which two hundred and fifty thousand people participated. At this time he presented the beautiful speech for peace and equality among human beings titled, I Have a Dream.

40|$|Excerpt] The Coke workers 2 ̆ 7 {{victory was}} all the more {{remarkable}} given the killings that had decimated the Guatemalan labor movement. Between 1978 and 1984, tens of thousands of Guatemalan civilians were murdered by the Army and its death squads, including hundreds of trade unionists. The Coca-Cola workers 2 ̆ 7 bold action helped break through the curtain of fear left by the massacres, and helped inspire a cautious renewal of union activity. Now the Lunafil workers were following the example of the Coke workers, and no one was quite sure what would happen. 2 ̆ 2 Only 2 ̆ 2 five unionists had been murdered since the Army allowed a civilian to take office as President in 1986. But the Army was still the real power in the country, and the danger to trade unionists was still very real. A <b>sit-in</b> <b>strike</b> was pushing the boundaries of what would be allowed. So like the Coca-Cola workers, the union at Lunafil was appealing for international support. The events that followed illustrate how crucial support actions by U. S. unionists can be for the heroic struggles of Third World workers. That phone call from Guatemala to New York City ended up helping keep open a hole in the wall that Lunafil 2 ̆ 7 s owners built to isolate the strikers. And the Lunafil workers 2 ̆ 7 fight shows the importance of penetrating the walls of distance, language and culture that separate workers and unionists around the world...|$|E
