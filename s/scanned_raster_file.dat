40|$|Abstract—A {{compliant}} nanopositioner {{is presented}} in this brief. The device is designed {{to have a very}} low cross-coupling between the- and-axis. Despite this, during high-speed <b>raster</b> <b>scans,</b> the cross-coupling effect can not be ignored. In this brief, a controller is designed and implemented to minimize the-to- cross-coupling of the nanoscale positioning stage, par-ticularly at its mechanical resonance frequencies. The controller is augmented with integral action to achieve accurate tracking, as well as sufficient damping. <b>Raster</b> <b>scan</b> results over an area of 10 m 10 m with small positioning errors are demonstrated.

30|$|The file of roof {{segments}} {{with appropriate}} slope and aspect was created, {{and then run}} through a dissolve function which merges contiguous polygons with a specific common characteristic to produce continuous suitable areas. Next, the rooftop polygon file was converted to a <b>raster</b> <b>file</b> and reclassified. The reclassified hourly hillshade <b>raster</b> <b>files</b> were combined with the rooftop raster by applying Raster Calculator. Employing Python syntax, Raster Calculator accomplishes Map Algebra expressions consisting of various geoprocessing operators on multiple inputs to create a desirable raster [44]. To evaluate the actual practicable roof expanse and the PV installed (nameplate or nominal or rated) capacity, the projected roof areas were determined from building footprints and {{used to calculate the}} oblique area of each suitable roof segment.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a design of a new raster {{sub-system}} intended for modern GIS systems open for client and server operation, database connection and strong application interface (API). Motivation for such a design comes from {{the current state of}} API working in GRASS 6. If found attractive, the here presented design and its implementation (referred as RG 7) may be integrated to the future new generation of the GRASS Geographical Information System version 7 - 8. The paper describes in details the concept of raster tiling, computer storage of rasters and basic raster access procedures. Finally, the paper gives a simple benchmarking experiment of random read access to <b>raster</b> <b>files</b> imported from the Spearfish dataset. The experiment compares the early implementation of RG 7 with the current implementation of rasters in GRASS 6. As the result, the experiment shows the RG 7 to be significantly faster than GRASS in random read access to large <b>raster</b> <b>files...</b>|$|R

This data set provides: (1) estimates of soil carbon stocks by horizon based on soil survey data and analyses of data from individual soil profiles; (2) estimates of soil carbon fluxes based on stocks, fire history, drain-age, and soil carbon inputs and decomposition constants based on field work using radiocarbon analyses; (3) fire history data estimating age ranges of time since last fire; and (4) a raster image and an associated soils table file from which area-weighted maps of soil carbon and fluxes and fire history may be generated. This data set was created from <b>raster</b> <b>files,</b> soil polygon data files, and detailed lab analysis of soils data that were received from Dr. Hugo Veldhuis, who did the original mapping in the field during 1994.
