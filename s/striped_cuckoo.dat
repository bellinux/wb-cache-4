50|$|This spinetail is {{parasitised}} by the <b>striped</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Tapera naevia), which lays {{one or two}} eggs in the nest, but it is {{not known}} how the cuckoo enters the nest or whether it or its offspring eject the host's young.|$|E
50|$|Dromococcyx is a genus of {{uncommon}} to rare cuckoos found in forests and woodlands of the Neotropics. They have strikingly graduated tails, and {{are among the}} few cuckoos of the Americas that are brood parasites (the only other is the <b>striped</b> <b>cuckoo).</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>cuckoo</b> eats large insects, {{often taken}} off the ground. This is a solitary and fairly shy species which tends to keep to the cover of bushes, {{although}} it will sing from more open perches. It has a whistled call usually {{of two or three}} notes, wu-weee or wu-wu-wee, and can be attracted by imitations of this.|$|E
50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>cuckoo</b> {{is found}} in open country with trees or shrubs, and the edges of {{mangrove}} forests. It is among the very few brood parasitic cuckoos of the Americas (only other are Dromococcyx), and typical hosts are spinetails, but often also wrens, and other species with domed nests. The female cuckoo lays one, sometimes two, white or bluish eggs in the host's large stick nest. The eggs hatch in 15 days, with a further 18 days until the cuckoo fledges. The young spinetails disappear.|$|E
