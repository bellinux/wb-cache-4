40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Previous {{studies on}} process {{integration}} have generally considered reaction and separation as processes that occur sequentially in a flowsheet. In this paper, a unified formalism is presented for {{the synthesis of}} reaction-separation systems, while ensuring 2 ̆ 7 optimal 2 ̆ 7 energy management. The synthesis model stems from a target-based approach for reactor networks due to an earlier study. It is shown that by postulating a species dependent residence time distribution function, one can arrive at a general representation for a reaction-separation network. Optimization of this distribution function leads to a <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> {{as a function of}} time {{along the length of the}} reactor. The synthesis model is formulated as a mixed integer optimal control problem, where the integer variables account for the fixed costs of separation. The control profiles include the temperature, the <b>separation</b> <b>profile,</b> and residence time distribution defined for the network. Costs for maintaining a <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> are handled through a separation index (defined to model the intensity of separation), and a fixed charge for any separation between two components in the reaction mixture. Also, using an energy targeting formulation, the maintenance of the optimal temperature profile is integrated to the energy flows within the flowsheet. Strategies based on simultaneous optimization and model solution are presented for the optimization problem and demonstrated for two case studies. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} {{reflection}} high‐energy electron diffraction {{to study the}} surface periodicity of the growth front of InAs/GaInSb strained‐layer superlattices (SLSs). We found that the apparent surface lattice spacing reproducibly changed during layers which subsequent x‐ray measurements indicated were coherently strained. Abrupt changes in the measured streak spacings {{were found to be}} correlated to changes in the growth flux. The profile of the dynamic streak spacing was found to be reproducible when comparing consecutive periods of a SLSs or different SLSs employing the same shuttering scheme at the InAs/GaInSb interface. Finally, when the interface shuttering scheme was changed, {{it was found that the}} dynamic streak <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> also changed. Large changes in the shuttering scheme led to dramatic differences in the streak <b>separation</b> <b>profile,</b> and small changes in the shuttering scheme led to minor changes in the profile.

The analysis concentrates on the destabilizing effect of a delay existing in the control loop. This delay is inevitable and corresponds to the time needed for {{the effect of the}} controller to propagate into the flow and reach the <b>separation</b> <b>profile.</b> For the setting discussed in this paper, the delay is large relative to the time scales of the system.

The level of proteins and lipids in hydrolysed flours was changed significantly. In comparison to the raw flours also fatty acid composition in treated flours was altered. In the lentil flours both trypsin and pepsin digestion conditions have decreased the level of unsaturated fatty acid. It is noteworthy that in all investigated, hydrolysed flours ratio linoleic: oleic fatty acid was significantly decreased in comparison to unhydrolysed flours (about 40 %-pea; 60 %- -lentil). Our investigations were also focused on the potential implementations of IMAC method in the separation and purification of peptides. Generally, peptides <b>separation</b> <b>profiles,</b> performed on immobilized Zn (II), were dependent on the kind of flour and enzyme used in the hydrolysis process.

40|$|Abstract: A {{disulfide}} bond, {{formed by}} two oxidized cysteines, {{plays an important}} role in the protein folding and structure stability, and it may regulate protein functions. The disulfide connectivity prediction problem is to reveal the correct information of disulfide connectivity in the target protein. It is difficult because the number of possible patterns grows rapidly with respect to the number of cysteines. In this paper, we discover some rules to discriminate the patterns with high accuracy in various methods. Then, we propose the pattern-wise and pair-wise BKS (behavior knowledge space) methods to fuse multiple classifiers constructed by the SVM (support vector machine) methods. Furthermore, we combine the CSP (cysteine <b>separation</b> <b>profile)</b> method to form our hybrid method. The prediction accuracy of our hybrid method in SP 39 dataset with 4 -fold cross-validation is increased to 69. 1 %, which is better than the best previous result 65. 9 %. ...|$|E
40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the effect}} of finite elasticity on the attractive power-law interaction of two solids separated by a thin liquid (or gas) film. A new asymptotic technique is developed to determine the deformed shape of the surfaces and to calculate the elasticity contribution to the total force, i. e., an additional term present between the deformed bodies. Both the deformation and the elasticity contribution {{are found to be}} nonnegligible well before contact is reached, although they are of much shorter range than the surface force that caused them. This range can be characterized by a reference elasticity length, which depends on elastic constants and size of the solids, {{as well as on the}} attractive force that led to deformation. The total force vs <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> for elastic surfaces is found to depend on how the measurements are made, namely, how the separation is detected: it can lead to either less or more attractive force compared with the case of rigid surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Presented {{here is an}} {{experimental}} investigation of the kinematic theory of separation in unsteady two-dimensional flows, and an evaluation of a novel optical shear stress sensor. Fixed separation in the rotor-oscillator flow is studied for steady, periodic, and quasi-periodic fluid motion. Experimental results are directly compared to numerical simulations, which provide the shear-stress and pressure data required for detecting fixed separation in an unsteady flow. Good agreement between theory and experiments in determining both {{the location of the}} separation point and the angle of the <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> is found. With the goal of directly measuring shear stress to high accuracy, an optical shear stress sensor is evaluated on a flat plate boundary layer.

40|$|Motivation: Disulfide bonds play an {{important}} role in protein folding. A precise prediction of disulfide connectivity can strongly reduce the conformational search space and increase the accuracy in protein structure prediction. Conventional disulfide connectivity predictions use sequence information, and prediction accuracy is limited. Here, by using an alternative scheme with global information for disulfide connectivity prediction, higher performance is obtained with respect to other approaches. Result: Cysteine <b>separation</b> <b>profiles</b> have been used to predict the disulfide connectivity of proteins. The separations among oxidized cysteine residues on a protein sequence have been encoded into vectors named cysteine <b>separation</b> <b>profiles</b> (CSPs). Through com-parisons of their CSPs, the disulfide connectivity of a test protein is inferred from a non-redundant template set. For non-redundant pro-teins in SwissProt 39 (SP 39) sharing less than 30 % sequence identity, the prediction accuracy of a fourfold cross-validation is 49 %. The prediction accuracy of disulfide connectivity for proteins in SwissProt 43 (SP 43) is even higher (53 %). The relationship between the sim-ilarity of CSPs and the prediction accuracy is also discussed. The method proposed in this work is relatively simple and can generate higher accuracies compared to conventional methods. It may be also combined with other algorithms for further improvements in protein structure prediction. Availability: The program and datasets are available from the authors upon request.

It is known that the expression profile for some proteins in the aqueous humor (AH) changes in some diseases. Accordingly, determinations of these AH proteins may serve to understand their potential role in this pathogenesis. To identify the possible mechanism in myopia development, a proteomic analysis of the AH composition from high myopic eyes (patients) was performed and {{compared with that of}} the AH composition from non-myopic cataract eyes (controls). Methods: Total protein concentration in AH was determined by the Bradford method, and <b>separation</b> <b>profiles</b> were analyzed by two-dimensional (2 D) gel electrophoresis. Protein in gel was determined by silver stain, and the <b>separation</b> <b>profiles</b> were analyzed to assess spot density changes between myopia and non-myopia patients. These spots in gel were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Results: The total protein concentration in AH with high myopia was significantly greater than that of non-myopia. A total of six spots were significantly increased in 2 D gels from high myopia. The spots were derived from albumin, transthyretin, and a vitamin D-binding protein. Conclusions: The protein composition in AH was significantly different between myopia and non-myopia.

40|$|We present two new {{experimental}} methods of realizing the desired kinematics in a filament stretching rheometer. Due {{to the presence}} of the rigid plates connecting the fluid filament in this device, a homogeneous uniaxial elongational flow cannot be imposed throughout the entire fluid filament. However, if the fluid element at the midpoint of the filament is forced to contract {{in the same manner as}} a cylindrical column undergoing ideal uniaxial extension, then the measured rheological response will be virtually identical to that experienced in a homogeneous shearfree flow. We investigate both a real-time active control scheme and a second, original technique based on a one-dimensional slender-filament approximation of the kinematics as possible methods of realizing this form of nearly-ideal filament stretching experiment.

The local stress intensity factors (model I and II) {{and the location of}} the equivalent elastic crack tip are calculated during the loading. The variation of the location of the equivalent crack tip is used to track the initiation and growth of the process zone, up to the onset of crack propagation.

It provides information on patient’s oxygen carrying capacity, immune system functionality, and the overall hemapoiesis process for disease diagnosis and drug side-effect monitoring. Traditionally blood count is performed either manually or by conventional automated blood analyzers. With the advance of microfabrication, on-chip blood count has become a target for miniaturization aiming at providing cost-effective, functional, capable point-of-care devices and systems that use less than 100 nL of blood sample and generate measurement results within minutes. The focus of this thesis is on investigation of erythrocyte/leukocyte counting and leukocyte differential, which are the two key components in blood count, in microdevices. Due to the large number ratio of erythrocytes to leukocytes and their property overlap, conventional automated blood analyzers accomplish blood count in several different channels by measuring different parameters. Similarly, in microdevices, it is desirable that erythrocytes and leukocytes can be separated before further analysis. Two types of hydrodynamic separation devices were investigated to continuously separate erythrocytes and leukocytes based on size.

In 1991, the Australian military moved from a system very similar to the U.

The contents of non-protein nitrogen and free $ alpha$-amino nitrogen increased from 2. 34 to 15. 14 %, and 2. 03 to 5. 22 %, respectively after 48 h fermentation. SDS electrophoresis showed that a substantial quantity of the proteins in raw soybeans were hydrolysed by the Rhizopus to low molecular species (molecular weight $<$ 13, 000 Daltons). Trypsin inhibitor activity found in tempe was {{lower than that of}} soybean and soaked soybean (an intermediate step in tempe preparation). The protein digestibilities of tempe and soaked soybean were higher than that of soybean. Reversed phase HPLC showed that the peptide <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> of tempe was different from that of soybean and soaked soybean.

40|$|Aims. Combining {{high-resolution}} and synoptic observations aims {{to provide}} a comprehensive description of flux emergence at photospheric level and of the growth process that eventually leads to a mature active region. Methods. Small active region NOAA 12118 was observed on 2014 July 18 with the 1. 5 -meter GREGOR solar telescope on 2014 July 18. High-resolution time-series of blue continuum and G-band images acquired in the blue imaging channel (BIC) of the GREGOR Fabry-Pérot Interferometer (GFPI) were complemented by LOS magnetograms and continuum images obtained with the HMI onboard the SDO. Horizontal proper motions and horizontal plasma velocities were computed with local correlation tracking (LCT) and the differential affine velocity estimator, respectively. Morphological image processing was employed to measure the photometric/magnetic area, magnetic flux, and the <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> of the EFR during its evolution. Results. The computed growth rates for photometric area, magnetic area, and magnetic flux are about {{twice as high as}} the respective decay rates. The space-time diagram using HMI magnetograms of five days traces a leaf-like structure, which is determined by the initial separation of the two polarities, a rapid expansion phase, a time when the spread stalls, and a period when the region slowly shrinks again. The separation rate of 0. 26 km is highest in the initial stage, and it decreases when the separation comes to a halt. Horizontal plasma velocities computed at four evolutionary stages indicate a changing pattern of inflows. In LCT maps we find persistent flow patterns such as outward motions in the outer part of the two major pores, a diverging feature near the trailing pore marking the site of upwelling plasma and flux emergence, and low velocities in the interior of pores. We detected many elongated rapidly expanding granules between the two major polarities. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the repeatability of the flush tear collection technique and the Schirmer strip for Substance P tear analysis. METHODS: The tears of 10 healthy non-contact-lens wearers were collected via Schirmer strip and microcapillary following instillation of either 20 μL (F- 20) or 60 μL (F- 60) of saline. Each technique {{was conducted on}} two occasions and in a randomized order. Total protein content (TPC) and Substance P concentrations were determined. The overall protein <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> of each type of tears was examined using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1 DGE). RESULTS: Collection rates were significantly faster for the F- 60 compared to F- 20 (17. 3 ± 6. 9 μL/min and 11. 9 ± 5. 3 μL/min, respectively, P <. 001), with an average Schirmer strip length of 1. 5 ± 2. 1 mm/min. The coefficient of repeatability between days and eyes was greatest for the Schirmer strip, with eyes and days being significantly different (P =. 03 and P =. 03, respectively) for Schirmer strip Substance P. TPC was 3. 8 ± 2. 6 mg/mL, 3. 3 ± 1. 8 mg/mL, and 3. 6 ± 3. 0 mg/mL for F- 20, F- 60, and Schirmer strip techniques, respectively, with {{no significant difference between}} techniques (P =. 85). Substance P concentration was 13. 1 ± 14. 8 ng/mL, 9. 1 ± 6. 1 ng/mL, and 14. 9 ± 10. 6 ng/mL for F- 20, F- 60, and Schirmer strip tears, respectively, with no significant difference between techniques (P =. 57). 1 DGE profile showed similar electrophoresis patterns among F- 20, F- 60, and basal tears. CONCLUSIONS: The F- 60 method allows faster collection than F- 20, but the latter results in better repeatability than both the F- 60 and Schirmer sampling techniques. All three techniques return the same concentrations of TPC and Substance P. This indicates that tear collection using the F- 20 may be more appropriate when conducting comparative analysis, whereas the F- 60 may be more appropriate when more volume is required...|$|E
40|$|Neurotransmitters, the {{substances}} neurons use for communication, {{and their}} precursors and metabolites are of obvious {{importance for the}} wellbeing {{of the individual and}} when the neurotransmitter balance is off it can lead to catastrophic suffering as in the addiction to drugs or in neurodegenerative diseases. By understanding how neurons communicate with the environment, treatment may be found to aid in the symptoms of unbalance. Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, {{has been shown to be}} an excellent model for understanding neuronal processes and behaviors. Although the adult fly has a simpler nervous system than those of vertebrates, it is capable of higher-order brain functions, including aversive and appetitive learning, and recalling learned information from prior experiences. Invertebrate models, such as Drosophila melanogaster have been used previously to investigate neurochemical changes in the CNS associated with drug addiction as well as in the of study of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease by Drosophila mutants. Many of the neurotransmitters associated with these diseases occur in minute amounts and can be difficult to detect in the small volume of the fly brain. As such, it is essential to develop analytical tools for these unique biological systems that can be quickley performed and accurately analyses the neuronal substances as well as requiring extremely small sample volume. Capillary electrophoresis and in vivo voltammetry are two methods that meet these requirements. In Paper I a new separation scheme for capillary electrophoresis was devised to allow resolution of 23 neurotransmitters, metabolites, and precursors. In fly homogenates a focus on six of the substances thought to be involved in the response to alcohol were identified. In Paper II the removal of the cuticles and eyes leaving only the brains further enhanced the <b>separation</b> <b>profile</b> of neurotransmitters from Paper I. In Paper III a method for sample preparation by freeze drying the Drosophila brains was presented. The use of freeze-dried samples offers a way to preserve the biological sample while making dissection of the tiny brain samples easier and faster. This provides more concentrated samples and with that higher signals and better detection limits. In Paper IV the effect of cocaine on the dopamine transporter was shown to be reduced by the ADHD drug methylphenidate using in vivo voltammetry...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a wide-angle electron beam splitter {{capable of producing}} 1 cm beam separation at the detection plane. The beam splitter utilizes a nanofabricated periodic grating in combination with a bi-prism element. In contrast to devices utilizing only bi-prism elements, {{the use of the}} periodic grating causes amplitude, and not wavefront, splitting. Even at maximum <b>separation,</b> beam <b>profiles</b> remain undistorted, providing evidence that coherence is intact. This is a step towards the realization of a large area electron interferometer using such a grating bi-prism combination...|$|R
40|$|A {{system of}} high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) {{was used for}} the development and validation of efficient method for quantitative determination of three aminoacids involved in the inherited metabolic disease Branched-Chain Ketoaciduria (BCK), also called maple syrup urine disease. The analytical conditions were selected in order to obtain baseline <b>separation</b> <b>profiles</b> of the amino acids known to be altered in blood plasma of BCK patients, namely L-valine, L-isoleucine, and L-leucine. Most accurate data were obtained using HPLC/diode detector. As the analytes do not have chromophore groups, they were pre-derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA), yielding an unsaturated adduct, making thus possible the detection of amino acids. The validation was conducted according to National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) and Guidance for Industry (Bioanalytical Method Validation) United States Food and Drug Administration (U. S. FDA). The results were satisfactory, with high sensitivity, good linearity, precision and accuracy, limit of detection and quantification, all within the established parameters for bioanalytical methods, showing its applicability and low cost compared to other existing techniques such as sequential mass spectrometry. For the three amino acids, L-valine, L-isoleucine and L-leucine, the detection limits (LOD) found were: 1. 61, 1. 84 and 1. 88 mmol L- 1 and the quantification limits (LOQ) 4. 37, 6. 13 and 6. 27 mmol L- 1, respectively...|$|R
40|$|DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam methylase) {{has been}} {{crosslinked}} with its cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) by UV irradiation. About 3 % of the enzyme was radioactively labelled after the crosslinking reaction performed either with (methyl- 3 H) -AdoMet or with (carboxy- 14 C) -AdoMet. Radiolabelled peptides were purified after trypsinolysis by high performance liquid chromatography in two steps. They {{could not be}} sequenced due to radiolysis. Therefore we performed the same experiment using non-radioactive AdoMet {{and were able to}} identify the peptide modified by the crosslinking reaction by comparison of the <b>separation</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained from two analytical control experiments performed with 3 H-AdoMet and Dam methylase without crosslink, respectively. This approach was possible due to the high reproducibility of the chromatography profiles. In these three experiments only one radioactively labelled peptide was present in the tryptic digestions of the crosslinked enzyme. Its sequence was found to be XA-GGK, corresponding to amino acids 10 - 14 of Dam methylase. The non-identified amino acid in the first sequence cycle should be a tryptophan, which is presumably modified by the crosslinking reaction. The importance of this region near the N-terminus for the structure and function of the enzyme was also demonstrated by proteolysis and site-directed mutagenesis experiments...|$|R
