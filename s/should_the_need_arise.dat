Additionally, the mission scanner may double as a satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage.

5|$|Nevertheless, due {{to further}} cuts in defence {{spending}} and an eagerness {{of the government}} to implement those recommendations that could assist in achieving this goal, units that were unable to meet attendance requirements were disbanded or amalgamated with others, thus further diffusing the community links units had established in their local areas and thus further impacting upon recruitment and retention.

Centralisation of training was also a result of the Millar Report; beforehand, recruit training had been an ad hoc process managed mainly by the units themselves.

On April 10, 2008, Seattle asked the Federal District Court to order the NBA to release {{documents}} related to the financial situation of each team, the claim that the SuperSonics' lease with KeyArena was financially unworkable, and the league's involvement in requiring PBC to make a good-faith effort to stay in Seattle. On April 28, the trial's presiding judge, Loretta Preska, ruled that the NBA must supply the internal documents about the possible relocation of the Sonics that the city of Seattle had requested.

Douglas animosity was intensifying because of the activities of Orkney and Fleming who continued to expand their involvement in border politics and foreign relations with England. Although a decision to send the young prince to France and out of Albany's reach was taken {{in the winter of}} 1405–06, James's departure from Scotland was unplanned. In February 1406 Bishop Wardlaw released James to Orkney and Fleming who, with their large force of Lothian adherents, proceeded into hostile Douglas east Lothian. James's custodians may have been giving a demonstration of royal approval to further their interests in Douglas country. This provoked a fierce response from James Douglas of Balvenie and his supporters who, at a place called Long Hermiston Muir, engaged with and killed Fleming while Orkney and James escaped to the comparative safety of the Bass Rock islet in the Firth of Forth. They endured more than a month there before boarding the France-bound Maryenknyght, a ship from Danzig. On 22 March 1406 the ship was seized, in an act of piracy, by an English vessel part-owned by the MP and royal official Hugh Fenn that resulted in James becoming the hostage of King Henry IV of England. Robert III was at Rothesay Castle when he learned of his son's capture, and he died soon after on 4 April 1406 and was buried in the Stewart foundation abbey of Paisley.|$|E

However, it was not known whether this modification of the MCMV genome by removing the SwaI site would affect the biological properties of MCMV, or whether the SwaI mutation could be reversed <b>should</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>arose.</b> To this end, two recombinant bacterial artificial chromosomes, pMCMV_ETwt and pMCMV_ETSwa-*, were constructed and characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis, demonstrating that only the expected genome modifications were present. Recombinant viruses were then reconstituted in tissue culture and their biological properties were compared to the Smith strain of MCMV as well as the parental MCMV_EGFP virus. Viral DNA isolated from infected cells showed the expected restriction patterns for MCMV-ETwt and MCMV-ETSwa-. The expression of MCMV proteins M 112 - 113, ppM 44 and gB, representative of those expressed in the early, delayed early, and late phases of infection, respectively, did not differ significantly between the recombinant viruses or the Smith strain of MCMV. In addition, virus growth in permissive Balb/ 3 T 3 cells at both low and high multiplicities of infection, and semi-permissive COS- 1 cells at a high multiplicity of infection showed growth kinetics or patterns of infection that were similar to the Smith strain of MCMV. Results from these preliminary experiments suggested that the modification of the MCMV genome by removal of the SwaI site did not appear to affect the biological properties of MCMV in vitro. Furthermore, analysis of MCMV_ETwt demonstrated that we could reconstitute the SwaI site in the MCMV genome if necessary, resulting in a virus that should be identical to the Smith strain of MCMV. Therefore, these results suggest that the SwaI- MCMV genome will enable easier construction of recombinant MCMVs with desired alterations in any region of the viral genome...|$|R
