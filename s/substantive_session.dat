40|$|This paper {{builds on}} an earlier study that {{developed}} a 10 question framework for {{improving the quality of}} criteria sheets (also known as rubrics) used in Master of Education programmes. To test that framework 15 rubrics were independently evaluated by seven teachers using the above mentioned framework. Raw data from the evaluations were collated and coded and then further analysed in three sequential, <b>substantive</b> conversation <b>sessions,</b> in order to investigate the inter-connectedness of three assessment concepts, namely, grading, moderation and feedback. The study revealed that the key to criteria sheet effectiveness is the explicitness of the standards descriptors. The research also identified three broad questions that can help teachers evaluate the quality of their criteria sheets. These questions focus on the clarity of the task description and ways of improving the criteria and standards by which student responses are to be judged. The revised questions provide an effective framework for assuring the quality of these three aspects of assessment within units (also known as courses) in postgraduate programmes...|$|R

40|$|When I was {{initially}} contacted {{to do this}} presentation by Frances Hagopian, I was told {{that it could be}} a loose collection of thoughts around the designated theme. In particular, the communiqué read, “We envision six <b>substantive</b> working <b>sessions,</b> each of which will be anchored by one brief, thought paper (it can be as short as five to ten pages) that I hope will pull together the state of our knowledge on the subject, and point {{to some of the most}} exciting questions that will be salient in the years ahead. ” I agreed to do this since it sounded fun and I’ve never been to Notre Dame. One of my life goals is to get a picture of me by Touchdown Jesus. With this in mind, the readers of this paper should realize that this is a very rough “thought paper. ” Some may even think it is thoughtless. My goal here is to pull together several strands of research that I and others have worked on in the past and toss them into the arena of Latin America. Some of the ideas are pulled from research that isn’t necessarily focused on Latin America, but that I think has some relevance. I will try to cite my references where appropriate, though much of this will be working from memory. The tenor of the paper may be a bit “irreverent ” and seemingly “unintellectual. ” This i...|$|R

40|$|Including {{mental health}} as an {{integral}} part of development is relatively new to the United Nations and its development partners. There is growing recognition within the international community that mental health is one of the most neglected yet essential development issues in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Mental health represents a critical indicator of human development, serves as a key determinant of well-being, quality of life, and hope, has an impact on a range of development outcomes, and is a basis for social stability. The adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006 by the United Nations General Assembly provided momentum to highlight the importance of the nexus between disabilities and mental health in the context of human rights, humanitarian activities and in development work. In addition, the Ministerial Declaration on Implementing the Internationally Agreed Goals and Commitments in Regard to Global Public Health, in the high-level segment of the <b>substantive</b> <b>session</b> of the Economic and Social Council in July 2009, highlighted the importance of integrating mental health into the implementation of the MDGs and other internationally agreed development goals and commitments, in order to reduce poverty, promote better health, and achieve other development outcomes. Poor mental health is both a cause and a consequence of poverty, compromised education, gender inequality, ill-health, violence and other global challenges. It impedes the individual's capacity to work productively, realize their potential and make a contribution to their community. 1 On the other hand, positive mental health is linked to a range of development outcomes, including enhanced productivity and earnings, better employment, higher educational achievement...|$|E
40|$|The Economic and Social Council, by its {{resolution}} 1745 (LIV) of 16 May 1973, {{invited the}} Secretary-General {{to submit to}} it, at five-year intervals starting from 1975, periodic updated and analytical reports on capital punishment. The Council, by its resolution 1995 / 57 of 28 July 1995, recommended that the quinquennial reports of the Secretary-General should continue to cover also {{the implementation of the}} safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. By the same resolution, the Council requested the Secretary-General, in preparing the quinquennial report, to draw on all available data, including current criminological research. The present eighth quinquennial report reviews the use of and trends in capital punishment, including the implementation of the safeguards during the period 2004 - 2008. In accordance with Economic and Social Council resolutions 1745 (LIV) and 1990 / 51 of 24 July 1990 and Council decision 2005 / 247 of 22 July 2005, this report is submitted to the Council at its <b>substantive</b> <b>session</b> of 2010, and will also be before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its nineteenth session, and the Human Rights Council, in accordance with its decision 2 / 102. The report confirms a very marked trend towards abolition and restriction of the use of capital punishment in most countries. The rate at which States that retained the death penalty {{at the start of the}} quinquennium have abolished its use either in law or in practice is comparable with that of previous reporting periods, and may even be accelerating slightly. Moreover, countries that retain the death penalty are, with rare exceptions, significantly reducing its use in terms of numbers of persons executed and the crimes for which it may be imposed. Nevertheless, where capital punishment remains in force, there are serious problems with regard to the respect of international norms and standards, notably in the limitation of the death penalty to the most serious crimes, the exclusion of juvenile offenders from its scope, and guarantees of a fair trial...|$|E
