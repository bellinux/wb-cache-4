Some other carbohydrates can possibly be used as substrates for further enzymatic transformation (e. g. isomerose; lactose, fructose, or gulcose). They also can be prepared enzymatically, thus replacing chemical processes (for sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, or even ascorbic acid) or fermentative procedures (for the production of L-sorbose from sorbitol or gluconic acid from glucose).

40|$|AbstractThe hydrolytic enzymes, α-amylases, and the {{cyclodextrin}} glycosyltransferases (CGTases) are key enzymes in the depolymerization of starch. These {{two groups}} of enzymes are evolutionarily related. We propose that the transferase activity {{is likely to have}} evolved from an ancestral hydrolase. Sequence analysis provides support for this hypothesis. Consequently, we have conducted an experimental study to test the possible adaptive value for evolving a CGTase. We found that when an α-amylase and a CGTase are combined more glucose is generated from starch than would be expected from the independent action of either of these enzymes. Thus, we propose that the biological role of CGTases is to work in concert with α-amylases for the efficient <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch.</b> This observation can be useful in industrial processes aimed at producing syrups with high contents of glucose or maltose...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work has been to investigate the principle of combined bioreaction and separation in a simulated counter-current chromatographic bioreactor-separator system (SCCR-S). The SCCR-S system consisted of twelve 5. 4 cm i. d x 75 cm long columns packed with calcium charged cross-linked polystyrene resin. Three bioreactions, namely the <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> modified <b>starch</b> to maltose and dextrin using the enzyme maltogenase, the hydrolysis of lactose to galactose and glucose {{in the presence of}} the enzyme lactase and the biosynthesis of dextran from sucrose using the enzyme dextransucrase. Combined bioreaction and separation has been successfully carried out in the SCCR-S system for the <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> modified <b>starch</b> to maltose and dextrin. The effects of the operating parameters (switch time, eluent flowrate, feed concentration and enzyme activity) on the performance of the SCCR-S system were investigated. By using an eluent of dilute enzyme solution, <b>starch</b> conversions <b>of</b> up to 60 % were achieved using lower amounts of enzyme than the theoretical amount required by a conventional bioreactor to produce the same amount of maltose over the same time period. Comparing the SCCR-S system to a continuous annular chromatograph (CRAC) for the <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> modified <b>starch</b> showed that the SCCR-S system required only 34. 6 - 47. 3 % of the amount of enzyme required by the CRAC. The SCCR-S system was operated in the batch and continuous modes as a bioreactor-separator for the hydrolysis of lactose to galactose and glucose. By operating the system in the continuous mode, the operating parameters were further investigated. During these experiments the eluent was deionised water and the enzyme was introduced into the system through the same port as the feed. The galactose produced was retarded and moved with the stationary phase to be purge as the galactose rich product (GalRP) while the glucose moved with the mobile phase and was collected as the glucose rich product (GRP). By operating at up to 30 %w/v lactose feed concentrations, complete conversions were achieved using only 48 % of the theoretical amount of enzyme required by a conventional bioreactor to hydrolyse the same amount of glucose over the same time period. The main operating parameters affecting the performance of the SCCR-S system operating in the batch mode were investigated and the results compared to those of the continuous operation of the SCCR-S system.. During the biosynthesis of dextran in the SCCR-S system, a method of on-line regeneration of the resin was required to operate the system continuously. Complete conversion was achieved at sucrose feed concentrations of 5 %w/v with fructose rich. products (FRP) of up to 100 % obtained. The dextran rich products were contaninated by small amounts of glucose and levan formed during the bioreaction.

The optimization strategy is thus solved in a nonsingular framework. Experimental studies carried out using the results of the optimization demonstrated the accuracy and utility of the approach.

(2) In <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch,</b> after it has reached its limit, the glucose quantity does not manifest any increase, even if we augment the concentration of taka-diastase solution (ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 0 %), or lengthen the incubation time (to the extent of 72 hours). (3) In case the concentration of starch solution proves fixed (in 0. 5, 1. 0 or 2. 0 %), (a) the greater the concentration of taka-diastase solution is, (as to range from 0. 1 to 1. 0 %), the rapider in its saccharification; besides, time needed {{in order to}} reach limit, short, and, glucose amount at a certain time (1 / 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours) proves abundant, but not correspond to the concentration of enzyme solution. (b) When concentration of takadiastase solution is 1. 0 and 0. 5 %, glucose quantity for both at the limit of saccharification proves equal, which has been estimated as about 80 % or more of the amount of the final product of starch hydrolysis (by Liebermann's method); moreover, nearly corresponds to concentration of enzyme solution. (c) If the concentration for taka-diastase solution indicates 0. 1 %, the glucose quantity at the limit of saccharification is to prove approximately 70 % or more of the amount of the final product of starch hydrolysis, proving less compared to that shown in 1. 0 and 0. 5 % cases of enzyme solution. (4) When the concentration of taka-diastase solution remains fixed (in 0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. 0 %), (a) as the concentration (that ranges from 0. 5 to 2. 0 %) of starch solution proves higher, time needed for it to reach saccharification limit becomes longer.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} has been to {{investigate}} the behaviour of a continuous rotating annular chromatograph (CRAC) under a combined biochemical reaction and separation duty. Two biochemical reactions have been employed, namely the inversion of sucrose to glucose and fructose {{in the presence of}} the enzyme invertase and the <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> liquefied <b>starch</b> to maltose and dextrin using the enzyme maltogenase. Simultaneous biochemical reaction and separation has been successfully carried out for the first time in a CRAC by inverting sucrose to fructose and glucose using the enzyme invertase and collecting continuously pure fractions of glucose and fructose from the base of the column. The CRAC was made of two concentric cylinders which form an annulus 140 cm long by 1. 2 cm wide, giving an annular space of 14. 5 dm 3. The ion exchange resin used was an industrial grade calcium form Dowex 50 W-X 4 with a mean diameter of 150 microns. The mobile phase used was deionised and dearated water and contained the appropriate enzyme. The annular column was slowly rotated at speeds of up to 240 °h- 1 while the sucrose substrate was fed continuously through a stationary feed pipe to the top of the resin bed. A systematic investigation of the factors affecting the performance of the CRAC under simultaneous biochemical reaction and separation conditions was carried out by employing a factorial experimental procedure. The main factors affecting the performance of the system were found to be the feed rate, feed concentrations and eluent rate. Results from the experiments indicated that complete conversion could be achieved for feed concentrations of up to 50 % w/v sucrose and at feed throughputs of up to 17. 2 kg sucrose per m 3 resin/h.

40|$|What are amylases? Amylases are {{enzymes that}} break down starch or glycogen. Amylases are {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} living organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants and humans. Bacteria and fungi secrete amylases to the outside of their cells to carry out extra-cellular digestion. When they have broken down the insoluble starch, the soluble end products such as (glucose or maltose) are absorbed into their cells. Amylases are classified based on how they break down starch molecules i. α-amylase (alpha-amylase) - Reduces the viscosity of starch by breaking down the bonds at random, therefore producing varied sized chains of glucose ii. ß-amylase (Beta-amylase) - Breaks the glucose-glucose bonds down by removing two glucose units at a time, thereby producing maltose iii. Amyloglucosidase (AMG) - Breaks successive bonds from the non-reducing end of the straight chain, producing glucose Many microbial amylases usually contain a mixture of these amylases.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} products and functional foods {{can be obtained}} from cheap and renewable raw agricultural materials. For example, starch can be converted to bioethanol as biofuel to reduce the current demand for petroleum or fossil fuel energy. On the other hand, starch can also be converted to useful functional ingredients, such as high fructose and high maltose syrups, wine, glucose, and trehalose. The conversion process involves fermentation by microorganisms and use of biocatalysts such as hydrolases of the amylase superfamily. Amylases catalyze the process of liquefaction and <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch.</b> It is possible to perform complete hydrolysis of starch by using the fusion product of both linear and debranching thermostable enzymes. This will result in saving energy otherwise needed for cooling before the next enzyme can act on the substrate, if a sequential process is utilized.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Microbiology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Reliable energy {{resources}} {{could be considered}} {{as one of the}} cornerstones of the prosperity of the human race. The growing human population is constantly exerting more pressure on the world’s natural resources, which include natural fossil fuels that are non‐renewable. There are concerns regarding the use of fossil fuels due to its growing scarcity and its negative impact on the environment. There is thus a growing need in the world for energy sources that are renewable, more or less carbon neutral and therefore with a minimum environmental impact. Renewable energy is currently being harnessed from the wind, water and sun, but to a limited extent. These forms of natural resources are very attractive for the production of renewable energy, but these technologies are difficult to apply in the current transportation sector. Biofuels provide an alternative to the current use of liquid fossil fuels and it could be able to sustain the current fleet of automobiles worldwide in the intermediate to long term with minimal adjustment to the engines of these vehicles. Extensive research has been done on the production processes for biofuels. Previous processes included the use of high temperatures and acids that further increased the total production cost and thus making biofuels less attractive as an alternative energy source. Recent research has suggested a wide range of organic materials as substrate for the production of biofuels, which include lignin, hemi‐cellulose, cellulose and starch. Processes based on hemi‐cellulose, cellulose and lignin as substrate are still in its early research stages and commercial application of these processes will only occur over the medium‐ to long‐term. Starch is a very good alternative source for the production of biofuels, but {{there is a need for}} a microbial system for the conversion of starch to bio‐ethanol in a single step, referred to as Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP). This would reduce the overall production cost of bio‐ethanol and thus making starch‐based substrates more attractive as an alternative energy source. The cost saving will be mainly due to the elimination of the pre‐treatment of raw starch at high temperatures and the addition of enzymes for the liquefaction and <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> to simple sugars. However, as there is no currently no known microbial organism known that can produce the required enzymes (i. e. amylases) as well as ferment the resulting sugars to ethanol, heterologous expression of these enzymes in a host strain able to ferment sugars could provide the best alternative system. In the first part of this study, 36 fungal strains known for the production of amylases were screened and compared for the highest extracellular enzyme activity on raw corn starch. The best two candidates, i. e. Aspergillus tubingensis (T 8. 4) and Mucor cincinelloides (1180), were then further evaluated to determine which organism has the highest efficiency when combined with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strain. In fermentation experiments, A. tubingensis (T 8. 4) in combination with S. cerevisiae Y 102 yeast strain resulted in the highest yield of ethanol. Literature on A. tubingensis is limited compared with other Aspergillii and it was previously accepted that A. tubingensis has the highest homology with Aspergillus niger. However, other reports – including the present study ‐ found that A. tubingensis is closer related to other Aspergillus spp. with regard to its amylolytic enzymes. The α‐amylase gene of A. tubingenis has a homology of 99. 00 % with that of Aspergillus kawachii whereas the glucoamylase gene has a homology of 99. 26 % with that of Aspergillus shirousami. In the second part of this study, two recombinant S. cerevisiae strains were constructed to express the wild type A. tubingensis α‐amylase (Atamy) and glucoamylase (Atglu), respectively. The combination of the two recombinant yeast strains was able to completely hydrolyse and also utilize raw corn starch for the production of bio‐ethanol, with a yield of 11. 04 g/l of ethanol, which translates to 98 % of the theoretical yield from starch with a 52 % conversion of the total raw starch. This rate of conversion is lower than other reports which indicated up to 82 % and 96 % of the theoretical yield of ethanol from raw and soluble starch, respectively, by α‐ and glucoamylase. Furthermore, the combined expressed of the two genes was much more effective than when only one of the two genes were expressed, with a yield of 0. 32 g/l ethanol for only Atamy and 2. 52 g/l ethanol for Atglu. This proved that the combination of the A. tubingensis genes were best suited for the production of biofuels from raw starch. This also proved that the concept of constructing an amylolytic yeast strain capable of raw starch hydrolysis and fermentation was indeed feasible.

Die groeiende menslike populasie is gedurig besig om meer druk op die wêreld se natuurlike hulpbronne te plaas, insluitende nie‐hernubare fossielbrandstowwe. Daar is kommer rakende die gebruik van fossielbrandstowwe weens ‘n afname in die beskikbaarheid en die negatiewe impak wat dit op die omgewing het. Daar is dus ‘n groeiende behoefte in die wêreld vir ‘n hernubare, min of meer koolstof‐neutrale energiebron wat ‘n minimale omgewingsimpak sal hê. Hernubare energie word tans tot ‘n beperkte mate uit wind, water en die son verkry. Hierdie vorms van natuurlike energie hulpbronne is baie aanloklik vir die vervaardiging van hernubare energie, maar hierdie tegnologië is moeilik toepasbaar in die huidige vervoersektor. Biobrandstowwe voorsien ‘n alternatief vir die huidige gebruik van fossielbrandstowwe en kan moontlik die huidige voertuigvloot wêreldwyd oor die medium‐ tot langtermyn onderhou met minimale enjinaanpassings van hierdie voertuie. Deeglike navorsing is alreeds op die vervaardigingsprosesse vir biobrandstowwe gedoen. Vorige prosesse het die gebruik van hoë temperature en sure ingesluit wat produksiekostes verder verhoog en gevolglik die gebruik van biobrandstowwe as ‘n alternatiewe energiebron minder aantreklik gemaak het. Onlangse navorsing het die gebruik van organiese materiaal as substraat vir die produksie van biobrandstowwe voorgestel, wat lignien, hemi‐sellulose, sellulose en stysel insluit. Prosesse met die gebruik van hemi‐sellulose, sellulose en lignien as substraat is nog in die beginfase van ontwikkeling en kommersialisering van hierdie prosesse sal eers oor die medium‐ tot langtermyn plaasvind. Stysel is ‘n baie goeie alternatiewe bron vir die produksie van biobrandstowwe, maar ‘n mikrobiese sisteem word vir die omskakeling van stysel in bio‐etanol in ‘n enkele stap benodig, bekend as gekonsolideerde bioprosessering (GBP). Dit sal die algemene produksiekoste van bio‐etanol verlaag en dus styselsubstrate as ‘n alternatiewe energiebron meer aantreklik maak. Die kostebesparing sal hoofsaaklik realiseer omdat die vooraf‐behandeling van rou stysel byhoë temperature en die toevoeging van ensieme vir die vervloeiing en versuikering van stysel tot eenvoudige suikers, uitgeskakel word. Aangesien daar tans geen bekende mikrobe organisme is wat die nodige ensieme (nl. amilases) kan produseer en ook die suikers wat daardeur vrygestel is, na etanol kan fermenteer nie, kan die heteroloë uitdrukking van hierdie ensieme in ‘n gasheer‐ras wat die suikers kan fermenteer, moontlik die beste alternatief verskaf. In die eerste deel van hierdie studie is 36 fungi rasse wat bekend is vir hul amilase produksie geevalueer en met mekaar vergelyk vir die hoogste ekstrasellulêre ensiemaktiwiteit op rou mieliestysel. Die beste twee kandidate, naamlik Aspergillus tubingensis en Mucor cincinelloides, is verder ge‐evalueer om te bepaal watter organisme het die hoogste effektiwiteit in kombinasie met ‘n Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratorium gisras. In fermentasie‐eksperimente het A. tubingensis in kombinasie met S. cerevisiae Y 102 gisras die hoogste etanol opbrengs gelewer. Inligting rakende A. tubingensis is beperk relatief tot ander Aspergillii en dit was voorheen aanvaar dat A. tubingensis die hoogste homologie met Aspergillus niger het. Ander verslae – insuitende die huidige studie ‐ het egter gevind dat A. tubingensis nader verwant aan ander Aspergillus spp. in terme van amilolitiese ensieme is. Die α‐amilase geen van A. tubingensis het ‘n homologie van 99. 00 % met dié van Aspergillus kawachii en die glukoamilase ‘n homologie van 99. 26 % met dié van Aspergillus shirousami getoon. In die tweede gedeelte van hierdie studie is twee rekombinante S. cerevisae gisrasse gekonstrueer om onderskeidelik die α‐amilase (Atamy) en glukoamilase (Atglu) van A. tubingensis uit te druk. Die kombinasie van die twee rekombinante gisrasse was in staat om die volledige hidrolise en benutting van rou mieliestysel vir die produksie van bio‐etanol deur te voer met ‘n opbrengs van 11. 04 g/l wat gelykstaande is aan 98 % van die teoretiese opbrengs vanaf stysel met ‘n omskakeling van 52 % van die totale rou stysel. Hierdie omskakelingskoers is laer as ander studies wat onderskeidelik 82 % en 96 % van die teoretiese opbrengs van rou en oplosbare stysel vir α‐ en glukoamilase getoon het. Verder was die kombinasie van die twee gene meer effektief as wanneer slegs een gebruik is, met ‘n 0. 32 g/l opbrengs vir Atamy en 2. 52 g/l vir Atglu. Hierdie het bewys dat die kombinasie van die A. tubingensis meergeskik vir die produksie van bio‐etanol was. Dit het ook bewys dat die beginsel van ‘n amilolitiese gisras wat in staat is om rou stysel te hidroliseer en te fermenteer, inderdaad moontlik is...|$|E

In everyday life people enjoy fermented beverages and particularly when having guests, they like to treat them to traditional alcoholic beverages. Tella, tej, areki, borde, and shamita are drinks that each household brews to treat guests. Substrates for their production are from locally available raw materials. Therefore, the basic production method is the same, but the tastes may vary. One of the most consumed fermented alcoholic beverages is tella, which is made mostly with barley but wheat, maize, sorghum, and teff are utilized depending on the region. Its production process shows the similarity to beer: addition of malt and gesho which has the same function as hops in beer. The main fermentation yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae and <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> cereal <b>starch</b> seems to depend on malt. However, the degree of alcoholic fermentation is low and alcohol content varies between 2 and 6 %. Lactic acid bacteria are very active in tella so pH ranges 4 – 5 give typical tastes such as sourness, sweetness, and bitterness. As the Ethiopian economy improves, more people drink western style beers. Tella has not been commercialized yet, so the process has not been standardized and modernized. Considering the case of Korean makgeolli and the Ethiopian creativity of utilizing gesho in tella, Ethiopia should {{pay more attention to}} tella for globalization...|$|R
40|$|Kinetic {{modelling}} <b>of</b> enzymatic <b>starch</b> hydrolysis – {{a summary}} K. A. Bednarska The dissertation entitled ‘Kinetic modelling <b>of</b> enzymatic <b>starch</b> hydrolysis’ describes the enzymatic hydrolysis and kinetic modelling <b>of</b> liquefaction and <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>starch.</b> After the background {{information about the}} enzymes, the substrate and the basics of the model in the first chapter, we describe a model predicting the outcome <b>of</b> wheat <b>starch</b> liquefaction by α-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis at 50 °C in chapter 2. We demonstrate {{the ability of the}} model to predict starch hydrolysis products larger than the oligosaccharides considered in the existing models. The model in its extended version follows all the products <b>of</b> wheat <b>starch</b> hydrolysis separately, and despite the quantitative differences, the qualitative predictions are satisfactory. We also show that the difference between the experimental and computed data might stem from the inaccuracy of the subsite map. In the following chapters the model is used to find a better description of the hydrolysis data at two temperatures (50 °C and 80 °C), by varying the energy values of the subsite map and evaluating the inhibition. We hypothesize that a subsite map that is based on the cleavage patterns of linear, short molecules does not account for the complexity of hydrolysis of amylopectin. The branched structure of amylopectin molecules influences the composition of the hydrolysis products by restricting the access to some of the bonds. The presence of branches creates steric obstacles for the enzyme. The used α-amylase has difficulties hydrolysing and accommodating α-(1, 6) -glycosidic bonds, which imposes on the hydrolysis of the α-(1, 4) -glycosidic bonds located in its proximity. On this basis, we analyse the subsite maps in detail and suggest which of the subsites are crucial when making predictions about the product composition <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> hydrolysates. On top of that we propose new subsite maps that allow a quantitative description of the experimental data. After the model was shown to work at different experimental conditions, we also test it at increased the dry matter content during wheat starch hydrolysis. We follow both the liquefaction by BLA and the saccharification process by glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger at low moisture content. The liquefaction model, is used to predict all of the products <b>of</b> wheat <b>starch</b> hydrolysis at higher dry matter contents (30 - 60 w/w%). The liquefaction model also creates the substrate matrices representing maltodextrins {{to be used in the}} saccharification model. The <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> liquefacts to glucose is followed with a new mechanistic model, also using the assumptions of the subsite theory. The saccharification model predicts all of the reaction products using the subsite maps of glucoamylase available in literature. The findings described in the thesis are summarized and put in context in the general discussion. We demonstrate how the parameters of the liquefaction model at low moisture contents were chosen. The outcomes of the model are also compared with the experimental data at 30 - 60 w/w%. Next, we test our liquefaction model with starch hydrolysis data at 5 and 60 w/w% taken from literature, to verify both the approach we used and the validity of the parameters we obtained in previous chapters. The method used to improve the subsite maps is also tested on another enzyme, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens α-amylase. After discussing the factors that influence saccharification at high dry matter contents, we conclude the chapter with describing the potential of stochastic modelling and its practical use.  ...|$|R

This paper was investigated the possibility of Amorphophallus campanulatus or known as âiles-ilesâ by Javanese people, which is known have a high carbohydrate content, as a raw material to produce bioethanol. The first stage of the process was hydrolyzes the starch, combined by liquefaction and <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>starch</b> from âiles-ilesâ using Î± and Î² amylase. The process was followed by fermentation of glucose with the help of S. cerevisiae. To obtain the maximum ethanol content, several parameter had been studied, such as the type S. cerevisiae (pure, dry, wet and instant), the dosage of Î±-amylase, Î²-amylase and also DAP dosage as a nutrient support for S. cerevisiae. The result shows that the highest ethanol concentration obtained in fermentation using dry S. cereviseae for 72 h with 10. 2 % (v/v) of ethanol. The highest total sugar content by hydrolysis was achieved by 0. 0032 mL Î±-amylase/g, while Î²-amylase was 0. 0064 mL Î²-amylase/g (12. 5 % of glucose). This is show that with increasing of Î± and Î² amylase dosages, the total sugar formed was increased. The DAP (Diammonium phosphate) was used as a Nitrogen supply which is needed by S. cerevisiae to growth and as a results can increase the level of ethanol produced. The additional of DAP in the fermentation prove that it can enhance 8. 45 % (v/v) of ethanol. Therefore, it can be concluded that the highest levels of ethanol with conventional methods of âiles-ilesâ was obtained at 72 h using the dry S. cerevisiae, with 0. 0032 and 0. 0064 mL enzyme/g of Î± and Î² amylase, respectively.

40|$|Biotechnical {{processes}} are often integrated to increase productivity and yield. It {{is difficult to}} predict the effects of process integration and to find optimum conditions for the process. A valuable tool {{for the evaluation of}} a complete process is mathematical modelling. In this thesis, a computer program developed for simulation and optimisation of integrated biotechnical processes is presented. The computer program can be used for simulation, parameter fitting, optimisation, economical evaluation and Monte Carlo simulation. The computer program has been used to evaluate a process for the fermentative production of lactic acid from wheat flour. In this process, wheat starch is hydrolysed to glucose in two steps: liquefaction and saccharification. The glucose is fermented to lactic acid by lactic acid bacteria, using components from the wheat flour as nutrients. Fermentation is performed at a pH higher than the pKa for lactic acid and the end product of the fermentation step is thus mainly lactate. In the downstream processing the lactate is separated from cells and wheat flour particles using centrifugation and membrane techniques. The lactate is converted to lactic acid by electrodialysis and is concentrated by evaporation. The work presented in this thesis comprises the development of kinetic models for the <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>starch</b> and for the fermentation of glucose to lactic acid. The computer program has been used to determine the values of the parameter in the kinetic models, using experimental data. These models have been used to study the integration <b>of</b> the <b>saccharification</b> and fermentation steps. The computer program has also been used to perform an economical evaluation of the entire process for the production of lactic acid with a concentration of 70 wt-%. A number of process configurations have been suggested and compared, and the optimal wheat flour concentration has been determined. To investigate the influence of variations in operational and investment costs on the lactic acid production cost, a Monte Carlo simulation has been performed...|$|R

In this study, enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) pre-treated Tetraselmis suecica biomass was carried out by using cellulase enzyme obtained from Trichoderma longibrachiatum. Initially, the pre-treatment conditions were optimised by changing alkali reagent concentration, retention time for reaction, and temperature. The T. suecica biomass after pre-treatment was also characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra and Scanning Electron Microscope. These analyses revealed that the functional group such as acetyl and hydroxyl groups, structure and surface of T. suecica biomass were changed through pre-treatment, which is favourable for enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> process. Comparison <b>of</b> enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> untreated and pre-treated microalgal biomass indicated that higher level of reducing sugar can be obtained from pre-treated T. suecica. Enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> pre-treated T. suecica biomass was optimised by changing temperature, pH, and enzyme concentration to solid ratio ([E]/[S]). Highest conversion of carbohydrate into reducing sugar of 95 % amounted to reducing sugar yield of 20 (wt%) from pre-treated T. suecica was obtained from saccharification, at temperature: 40 °C, pH: 4. 5 and [E]/[S] of 0. 1 after 72 h of incubation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} the effect of lignosulfonate (LS) on enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> lignocelluloses. Two commercial LSs and one laboratory sulfonated kraft lignin were applied to Whatman paper, dilute acid and SPORL (sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocelluloses) pretreated aspen, and kraft alkaline and SPORL pretreated lodgepole pine. All three lignin samples inhibited cellulose <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> Whatman paper, but enhanced the <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> the four lignocellulosic substrates. The level of enhancement was related to the molecular weight and degree of sulfonation of the lignin as well as the substrate lignin structure. When different molecular weight (MW) fractions of one commercial LS (SXP), generated from sulfite pulping of hardwood, were applied to the Whatman paper, the large MW fraction (SXP 1) with the lowest degree of sulfonation inhibited cellulose saccharification while the intermediate (SXP 2) and smallest (SXP 3) MW fractions enhanced saccharification. All MW fractions enhanced <b>saccharification</b> <b>of</b> the four lignocellulosic substrates with maximal enhancement by the smallest MW fraction, SXP 3. The enhancement was most significant for the kraft lodgepole pine substrate and least significant for the SPORL pretreated lodgepole pine using all three LS and SXP fractions. The results suggest that LS acts as a surfactant to enhance pure cellullose saccharification. When LS is applied to lignocelluloses, it acts as a surfactant to block bound lignin from binding cellulase nonproductively leading to enhanced <b>saccharification.</b> Enzymatic hydrolysis <b>of</b> cellulose has been identified as one o...|$|R
