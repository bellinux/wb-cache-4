50|$|<b>Synchysis</b> <b>scintillans</b> is a {{degenerative}} {{condition of}} the eye resulting in liquefied vitreous humor and the accumulation of cholesterol crystals within the vitreous. It {{is also known as}} cholesterolosis bulbi. The vitreous liquifies in a process known as syneresis. <b>Synchysis</b> <b>scintillans</b> appears as small white floaters that freely move in the posterior part of the eye, giving a snow globe effect. It is most commonly seen in eyes that have suffered from a degenerative disease and are end-stage.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY â€“ The aim is {{to present}} a patient with severe {{bilateral}} corneal complications after long-term antiglaucoma treatment with 1 % pilocarpine hydrochloride (Pilokarpin, Pliva, Zagreb, Croatia) and its management. A patient with narrow-angle glaucoma treated with 1 % topical pilo-carpine hydrochloride eye drops for {{the last twenty years}} complained of impaired vision, intermi-ttent visual haloes and eye redness. Ophthalmologic examination showed bilateral band keratopathy, peripheral laser iridotomy, medicamentous myosis, brown nuclear cataract, and <b>synchysis</b> <b>scintillans</b> of his right eye. Band keratopathy was thought to have resulted from the presence of the preserva-tive phenylmercuric nitrate in the pilocarpine hydrochloride eye drops. Treatment of the patient consisted of two separate procedures for both eyes, i. e. phaco trabeculectomy and six months later corneal procedure including abrasion of corneal epithelium followed by removal of the superficial stromal calcium deposits by means of a 3. 75 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) solution. After phaco trabeculectomy, visual acuity was 0. 8 on both eyes. Bilateral visual improvement with visual acuity 1. 0 was recorded after corneal treatment with EDTA. In conclusion, one must be aware of preservative complications in long-term topical use, such as band keratopathy that can be visually in-capacitating. Surgical treatment using EDTA is safe and effective treatment for band keratopathy...|$|E
