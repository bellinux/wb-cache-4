5|$|Uppercase and {{lowercase}} prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., {{the quantities}} 1mW and 1MW represent two different quantities; {{the former is}} the typical power requirement of a hearing aid (1milliwatt or 0.001watts), and the latter the typical power requirement of a <b>suburban</b> <b>train</b> (1megawatt or watts).|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw costs further reduced on {{the rail}} network. Guards were removed from {{passenger}} trains in 1989, and driver only suburban trains commenced running in 1993, with the last <b>suburban</b> <b>train</b> crewed by a guard running in November 1995. In 1994 the National Rail Corporation was established, taking profitable steel, and intermodal trafficks from V/Line; and the Melbourne to Adelaide standard gauge line was opened in 1995 moving the break of gauge.|$|E

5|$|Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System's current {{coverage}} area was once served by an electrified streetcar and <b>suburban</b> <b>train</b> system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower {{deck of the}} Bay Bridge, but the system was dismantled in the 1950s and operated its last transbay crossing in 1958. By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs.|$|E

50|$|Until 1987, the Bridgewater line carried <b>suburban</b> <b>trains</b> {{further into}} the Adelaide Hills {{as far as the}} town of Bridgewater. The Bridgewater trains were {{withdrawn}} in 1987, attributed to high cost of operation and low passenger numbers. Platform 2 was used to terminate some <b>suburban</b> <b>trains</b> for a while after the closure of the line. Stations beyond Belair were closed and all <b>suburban</b> <b>trains</b> now terminate at platform 1 at Belair.|$|R

The <b>suburban</b> <b>train</b> service is fast, and unbeatably safe {{in terms of}} traffic accidents.

25|$|National Express renamed Swanston Trams as M>Tram, {{similarly}} {{along with}} its M>Train <b>suburban</b> <b>train</b> business, on 1 October 2001. After several years of failing to make a profit, {{more than a year}} of negotiations over revised financing arrangements with the government, and grave concern over its future viability, National Express Group announced on 16 December 2002, its decision to walk away from all of their Victorian contracts and hand control back to the state government, with funding for its operations to stop on 23 December 2002. The government ran M>Tram until negotiations were completed with Yarra Trams for it to take-over responsibility of the whole tram network from 18 April 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a <b>suburban</b> <b>train.</b> Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E
