5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Burger's Daughter came when Gordimer {{was waiting to}} visit a political detainee in prison, and amongst the other visitors she saw a school girl, {{the daughter of an}} activist she knew. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> this child was thinking and what family obligations were making her stand there. The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother. Gordimer said that children like these, whose activist parents were frequently arrested and detained, periodically had to manage entire households on their own, and it must have changed their lives completely. She stated that it was these children who encouraged her to write the book.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> he meant. But {{she was all}} aglow {{with her}} reception, carried away by this little {{flattering}} ceremonial on her behalf.|$|E
6000|$|A shiver {{passed through}} Renouard. <b>She</b> had <b>wondered!</b> <b>What</b> about? Malata was himself. He and Malata were one. And <b>she</b> had <b>wondered!</b> <b>She</b> had [...] .|$|R

50|$|Dark shapes huddle on her porch - coyotes {{from the}} nearby forest. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>what</b> could have frightened such animals into leaving the {{sanctuary}} of the deep woods to brave the proximity of human beings. Disturbed, she steps outside, to stand among the wild beasts, and is frightened herself - not by the animals, but by the strange, oddly luminescent rain. On an instinctual level, she realizes {{that there is something}} unclean about the rain.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Cornelia. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> Charmian {{would say}} if she knew this; <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> the Synthesis would say; the Synthesis held Mr. Ludlow in only less honor than the regular Synthesis instructors, and Mr. Ludlow {{had asked her to}} come and paint with him! She took shelter in the belief that Mrs. Burton must have put him up to it, somehow, but she ought to say {{something}} grateful, or at least something. She found herself stupidly and aimlessly asking, [...] "Is it Mrs. Westley?" [...] as if that {{had anything to do with}} the matter.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] she said, {{lifting her}} hand, her face {{laughing}} with her peculiar, blind, almost dazzling laugh. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> he was doing, when he stooped and kissed her. He should be shaking hands and going.|$|E
60|$|Katharine laughed. She {{looked at}} Ralph. His eyes were meditative, and <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> {{he found in}} this old gossip to make him ponder so contentedly. She felt, she hardly knew why, a curious pity for him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> lay <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> it was, why Siegmund had not written, {{what could}} have {{happened}} to him. She imagined all of them terrible, and endued with grandeur, for she had kinship with Hedda Gabler.|$|R
