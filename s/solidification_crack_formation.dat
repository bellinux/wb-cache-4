40|$|As a {{solid-state}} welding process, Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{offers a}} variety of advantages over traditional welding processes. Problems that are typically occurring due to the cooling of the liquid phase, such as <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> and <b>formation</b> of porosity, generally do not occur in FSW. Nevertheless, as a result of suboptimal settings of the welding process parameters and certain uncontrollable conditions, FSWs are still associated with a number of specific flaws, e. g. root flaws and wormholes. Ultrasonic non-destructive testing and evaluation techniques (NDT&E) can be used for quality assessment of friction stir welded joints. In this paper, a novel approach for the detection of root flaws is proposed using an immersion ultrasonic testing method in oblique incidence and backscatter mode. The backscattered energy C-scan images obtained after an empirical positioning and proper time gating can be straightforwardly interpreted by direct comparison with typical ‘flaw’ patterns, allowing for identification and localization of the root flaws in the weld. The method is illustrated for FSW butt joints of the AlZnMgCu (7 XXX series) alloy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of ferrosilicon {{is important}} since it controls {{the disintegration of}} the material during crushing and thus the generation of fines. Therefore a study of the microstructure formation during solidification of pure FeSi(75 wt%Si) and FeSi(75 wt%Si) containing 1. 2 wt%Al and 0. 2 wt%Ca has been initiated. The material has been cast into rods of 8 mm diameter, which have been remolten by induction heating and directionally solidified in a Bridgman apparatus. This allows the temperature gradient and the growth rate to be controlled independently. The temperature history during solidification has been recorded by a thermocouple in the melt.

40|$|Weld <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> is an {{important}} issue in fusion welding. If undetected, the cracking defects can act as stress concentration sites which lead to premature failure via fatigue, as well as offer favourable sites for hydrogen assisted cracking and stress corrosion cracking. For welded steel products such as deep sea oil and gas transportation pipes, such defects heighten the risk of catastrophic in-service failures. Such failures can lead to devastating environmental, economic, and social damage. In this thesis, a comprehensive review of literature associated with steel linepipe and <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> defects is first presented. Fluid flow prior to solidification is then observed and quantified in situ using a novel synchrotron X-ray radiography approach. The flow is dynamic at velocities up to 0. 52 m/s and primarily driven via Marangoni flow. The relationship between the microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded linepipe are extensively characterised, with a new equation derived to assess fracture toughness based on the size and distribution of carbonitride precipitates. Weld residual stresses are measured both before and after linepipe expansion in the U-forming, O-forming and expansion process for the first time using a neutron diffraction technique. To further understand the fundamental mechanisms of <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> during welding of high strength steels for subsea linepipe, a novel small-scale Varestraint test rig was developed for use in synchrotron X-ray imaging experiments and a Transvarestriant test rig utilised for industrial scale weldability tests. <b>Solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> during the welding of steel is observed in situ for the first time using a micro-radiography approach and the 3 D crack network is rebuilt using a micro-tomography technique. It is proposed that <b>solidification</b> <b>cracks</b> nucleate from sub-surface cavities associated with: i) residual liquid high in solute and impurity concentration (hot cracks), ii) Ti (C,N) precipitated during solidification (that induce ductile microvoids). <b>Solidification</b> <b>cracks</b> then propagate via inter-dendritic hot tearing...|$|R

In this study, the PT-GMAW process was used in pulse-pulse mode to butt joint weld 5 -mm DH 36, 8 -mm HSLA 65, 9. 5 -mm 350 WT, and 11 -mm HSLA 65 steel plate with ER 70 S- 6 wire in order to assess its suitability as a replacement for submerged arc welding (SAW) and {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW) in panel lines of Australian naval shipyards. In the pulse-pulse mode, the wire feed rates for the leading and trailing welding wires are set independently and they alternately transfer metal into a single molten weld pool at deposition rates almost comparable with single-wire SAW. Radiographic inspection and subsequent analyses of the 8 -, 9. 5 -, and 11 -mm single-bead butt joint welds unexpectedly showed varying degrees of weld-end <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking,</b> which occurred within ∼ 30 mm from the run-off tab and was different than weld crater cracking.

40|$|Grain {{refinement}} is {{an important}} possibility to enhance the weldability of aluminium weld metal that is usually defined by its susceptibility to <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking.</b> In this study, grain refinement was achieved through the addition of commercial grain refiner containing titanium and boron to the GTA weld metal of aluminium alloy 6082. The weld metal mean grain size could be reduced significantly from about 70 µm to a saturated size of 21 µm with a change in grain shape from columnar to equiaxed. The grain refinement prevented the <b>formation</b> of centreline <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> that was present only in welds with unrefined grain structure. A variation of torch speed led to a strong change of solidification parameters such as cooling rate that was measured in the weld metal and the corresponding solidification rate and thermal gradient.

40|$|Aluminum alloy welding {{suffers from}} {{problems}} such as <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> and hydrogen-induced porosity, which are sufficiently severe to limit its potential applications. Because mitigated porosity incidence and <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> are observed in aluminum welds using double pulsed {{gas metal arc welding}} (DP-GMAW), a comprehensive review of the mechanism is necessary, but absent from the literature. The oscillation of arc force and droplet pressure causes a weld pool stir effect. The expansion and shrinkage of the weld pool cause unusual remelting and resolidification of the previously solidified metal. DP-GMAW has an increased solidification growth rate and cooling rate, compared with conventional pulsed welding at same heat input. Both numerical and experimental results reveal the remarkable concept that refined microstructure in the fusion zone is obtained by using DP-GMAW.

HR-I 60 alloy is a solid solution strengthened Ni-Co-Cr-Si alloy. The alloy is designed to resist corrosion in sulfidizing and other aggressive high temperature environments. Silicon is added ({approx} 2. 75 %) to promote the formation of a protective oxide scale in environments with low oxygen activity. HR- 160 alloy has found applications in waste incinerators, calciners, pulp and paper recovery boilers, coal gasification systems, and fluidized bed combustion systems. HR- 160 alloy has been successfully used in a wide range of welded applications. However, the alloy can be susceptible to <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> under conditions of severe restraint. A previous study by DuPont, et al. [1] showed that silicon promoted <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> in the commercial alloy.

In order to compensate for both the mechanical properties and appearance deficiencies such as: underfilling, spattering, <b>solidification</b> <b>cracks,</b> excessive <b>formation</b> of Fe-Al intermetallic compounds in addition to lack of sufficient shear strength, various combinations of pre-placed powder-based activating fluxes including oxide- based TiO 2 (titanium dioxide) and halide-based CaF 2 (calcium fluoride) powders {{in addition to the}} mixture of pure iron-aluminum powder filler were utilized in order to investigate their effects on the metallurgical and mechanical properties of the joints. To characterize the joints, shear tests were carried out in order to identify the influence of laser welding parameters and powders on welded joints' strength. The elemental composition, crystallographic characteristics in addition to failure mechanism of the welded joints were evaluated using Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) respectively, beside that the Vickers microhardness was employed in order to identify the location of various FexAly intermetallic compound phases across the fusion, heat affected and unaffected zones. Furthermore, the microstructure and morphology of the weld fillets were characterized using Field emission scanning electron (FESEM) and Optical microscopes. The obtained results show that, the application of oxide and halide activating fluxes led to remarkable decrease in welding defects including the hot cracks, pores and inclusions which resulted in tensile properties improvement up to 1. 66 and 2. 14 times in average respectively compared with autogenous joints welded without any powder. The enhancement in mechanical properties and appearance of the joints is related to special mechanism of activating fluxes through which the laser plasma can be formed in a shorter period of time leading to faster laser-material coupling, shorter thermal history and better heat conduction throughout the whole thickness of welding materials, which can promote the uniform heat distribution leading to an increase in penetration depth, decrease in surface depression and material ejection, restriction of intermetallic compounds and preservation of hardness across the weld nuggets. Moreover, the enhanced convection after usage of activating fluxes led to better molten pool circulation which resulted in constitution of joints with root-shape morphology possessing mechanical interlock characteristics. Correspondingly, the severe underfilling and spattering observed during the welding process as a result of alloying elements evaporation was eliminated completely after the application of pre-placed Fe-Al powder filler which led to significant enhancement in weldments' appearance and shear strength...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the efforts to}} develop and validate a finite element based model to predict weld <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> behavior. Such a model must capture the solidification behavior, the thermal behavior in the weld pool region, the material mechanical response, and some failure criteria to determine when <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> will occur. For such a program to be successful, each aspect of the model had to be accurately modeled and verified since the output of one portion of the model served as the input to other portions of the model. A solidification model which includes dendrite tip and eutectic undercooling was developed and used in both the thermal and mechanical finite element analysis. High magnification video techniques were developed to measure strains for validation of the mechanical predictions using a strain rate and temperature dependent constitutive model. This model was coupled with a ductile void growth damage model and correlated with experimental observati [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalent}} {{method of}} irrigation in paddy fields in Iran is continuous ponding, which changes to intermittent method {{at the time}} of water shortage. Soil cracks are the main problem in intermittent irrigation. In this study, effects of adding rice straw on some soil physical characteristics and cracks were studied in paddy soils of the Guilan Province of Iran. The experiment was performed as split-split plots based on a complete randomized blocks design. Treatments included four soil textures (silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, and sandy loam), seven rates of rice straw (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 % by weight), and three soil moisture stages of drying conditions [primary stage (T 1), initial crack stage (T 2), final crack stage (T 3) ]. Results revealed that soil texture, rice straw rate, crack treatments, and their interactions had significant (P< 0. 01) effects on soil moisture content, bulk density, and time to <b>crack</b> <b>formation.</b> During the drying stage (from T 1 to T 3), moisture content decreased, however, bulk density and time to <b>crack</b> <b>formation</b> increased. In silty clay soil, addition of 2 - 3 % rice straw expedited <b>crack</b> <b>formation,</b> and an addition of 4 - 7 % straw delayed <b>crack</b> <b>formation.</b> In silty clay loam soil, addition of 3 - 5 % straw enhanced <b>crack</b> <b>formation,</b> and addition of 6 - 7 % delayed <b>crack</b> <b>formation.</b> The addition of rice straw in clay loam and sandy loam delayed <b>crack</b> <b>formation.</b> In general, addition of rice straw increased soil moisture content, decreased bulk density, and delayed <b>crack</b> <b>formation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} of this work is to compare the compatibility and reliability of the theoretical andexperimental methodologies {{in the evaluation of}} the <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> susceptibility of austenitic stainlesssteel weld metal, using three different electrodes. Design/methodology/approach: The cracking susceptibility of welds is described here through an experimentalprocedure using the transvarestraint test, and a theoretical procedure developed {{as a function of the}} chemicalcomposition and microstructure of the material. The theoretical procedure requires knowledge of the weld metalchemical composition and microstructure, which was taken from the literature. Findings: Results obtained by means of tables, parameter evaluation and fitting, micrographs and macrographsindicate that the experimental and theoretical methodologies are consistent with one another, and are bothreliable, regardless of the welding process employedPractical implications: The results of our theoretical analysis were in complete agreement with thoseobtained from the transvarestraint test, thus indicating that, if correctly applied, either of these methodscan be used to determine the susceptibility of austenitic stainless steels to form <b>solidification</b> <b>cracks.</b> Thechoice between the experimental or the theoretical method should depend only on the availability and easeof application for each specific case. Originality/value: It is possible to make a theoretical assessment of the <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> susceptibilityof a given steel as a function of the: chemical composition, Creq/Nieq, ferrite number FN, microstructure,percentage of (S+P), and percentage of ferrite. Another way to measure the susceptibility of steel to solidificationcracking is through experimental tests. The originality of this study is the numerical comparison made betweenthe results provided by two different methods: the theoretical assessment and the practical technique, using thetransvarestraint test...|$|R

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{cast steel}} {{has been used}} in broad fields of industries, such as power generation, construction, vessels, and automobiles. In the solidification process of a hummer used for press machine, for example, sometimes defects such as shrinkage cavity, segregation and cracks appear at hummer 2 ̆ 7 s surface. Shrinkage cavity and segregation can be predicted by performing non-steady state heat transfer analysis; and therefore such two types of defects can be eliminated by using chills which control solidification process. However, uneven cooling rates at different regions of the large-scale cast steel generate thermal stresses, which cause <b>solidification</b> <b>cracks,</b> between the chills. For causing those cracks, thermal stress may be important; however, there have been few studies for this thermal stress analysis. In this study, a three dimensional thermal elasto-plastic stress analysis has been performed by using finite element method in connection with three dimensional non-steady state heat transfer analysis, including interaction between the temperature and stress field. The results provide further understanding of the observed <b>solidification</b> <b>crack</b> failure for large-scale cast steel...|$|R
