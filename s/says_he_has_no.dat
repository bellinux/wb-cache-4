25|$|Judah Ben-Hur {{trains in}} wrestling {{for five years}} in the Palaestra in Rome before {{becoming}} the heir of Arrius after his death. While traveling to Antioch on state business, Judah learns that his real father's chief servant, the slave Simonides, lives in a house in this city, and has the trust of Judah's father's possessions, which he has invested so well that he is now wealthy. Judah visits Simonides, who listens to his story but demands more proof of his identity. Ben-Hur <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> proof, but asks if Simonides knows of the fate of Judah's mother and sister. He says he knows nothing and Judah leaves the house. Simonides sends his servant Malluch to spy on Judah to see if his story is true and to learn more about him. Shortly afterwards, Malluch meets and befriends Judah in the Grove of Daphne, and they go to the games stadium together. There, Ben-Hur finds his old rival Messala racing one of the chariots, preparing for a tournament.|$|E
2500|$|Benny would {{sometimes}} {{joke about the}} propriety of [...] "Love in Bloom" [...] as his theme song. On a segment often played in Tonight Show retrospectives, Benny talks with Johnny Carson about this. Benny <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> objections to the song in and of itself, only as his theme. Proving his point, he begins reciting the lyrics slowly and deliberately: [...] "Can it be the trees. That fill the breeze. With rare and magic perfume. Now what the hell has {{that got to do}} with me?" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} Detroit {{productions}} to receive wider attention was Derrick May's [...] "Strings of Life" [...] (1987), which, together with May's previous release, [...] "Nude Photo" [...] (1987), helped raise techno's profile in Europe, especially the UK and Germany, during the 1987–1988 house music boom (see Second Summer of Love). It became May's best known track, which, according to Frankie Knuckles, [...] "just exploded. It was like something you can't imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record {{when it was first}} heard. Mike Dunn <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> idea how people can accept a record that doesn't have a bassline." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the opening}} {{monologue}} of Saturday Night Live on January 19, 2014, Drake apologized about culture's {{adoption of the}} phrase, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea it would become so big.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{comes to}} tell you! Nay, never <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> resolution! Such debts as those, {{what are they}} {{compared}} with other young men's, of which they do not tell their fathers?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{what is to}} be {{done about}} Fielding major?' inquired another. 'He has not paid his boating money, and I <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> right to play among the Aquatics before <b>he</b> <b>has</b> paid his money.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Smailey <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> {{desire to}} be hard on her, but that [...] "it is a fraud". Ruth points out he was guilty of fraud, and she has {{evidence}} to prove it. Smailey tries to buy it from her, but she's respectable now: She won't take his money, though she keeps the papers as she [...] "ain't a fool"; Smailey leaves. Fitz-Partington interviews Ruth, to her confusion. Mrs. Van Brugh re-enters, and Fitz-Partington warns her about Smailey, explaining that his detective agency was called on {{to find out about}} Smailey's fraud, but as Smailey then hired him to investigate Mrs. Van Brugh, they had combined the cases. However, Fitz-Partington goes on to ask several further questions about Mrs. Van Brugh's marriage, and she begins to realise what Smailey is looking for: if Mrs. Van Brugh's godfather had called her Captain Van Brugh's wife in his will, her secret might be revealed. Smailey returns with the will, and reads out the relevant section about the farm, ending with the section referring to her as [...] "Catherine Ellen, wife of Captain Richard Van Brugh." [...] She faints into a chair.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Ziska, {{he knows}} where to find you; but, as he <b>says,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> {{business}} with you--no business as to which he can make a demand. He thinks, therefore, you would merely bid him begone." ...|$|E
50|$|Mark Sullivan, one of Al Dossarys lawyers, {{challenged}} the {{points in the}} Embassys statement. The Gulf Daily News quoted Sullivan as <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> knowledge of any judicial action by US authorities following allegations of abuse.|$|R
50|$|February 20: Newly {{appointed}} Canadian foreign-affairs minister Peter MacKay drew criticism after telling reporters he {{is confident}} the hostages will be released. He later apologized {{to the families of}} the hostages for his speculation, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> new information.|$|R
25|$|The judge {{gave the}} men light sentences. Langston and Bushnell sued for a writ {{of habeas corpus}} in 1859 in the Ohio Supreme Court, but it ruled against them, with the judge <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice but to uphold the federal law.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure {{my uncle}} will give way if Aunt Emmeline will ask him. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> {{complaint}} to make against Ayala. I {{think it is}} Augusta, and Augusta will be married, and will go away very soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man speaks up and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> assets or {{valuables}} of any sort. But Bassett {{takes his}} hand-satchel and opens it. Out comes some collars and socks {{and a half}} a page of a newspaper clipped out. Bill reads the clipping careful, and {{holds out his hand}} to the held-up party.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} teacher, {{looking at the}} log, [...] "I don't wonder. I know that log. I saw him before. His name is Old Gnarly. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> idea of coming open for a parcel of boys, {{even if they have}} got beetle and wedges. It takes a man, he says, to split him." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{who says}} that he sees is blind. He who knows his own {{blindness}} sees. He who <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> sin in him is the sinner. He who confesses his sins is the righteous man; for God is faithful and just to forgive him, as he did St. Peter, and to cleanse him from all unrighteousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, she <b>says,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> great {{purpose in}} life. She will marry {{no one who}} will not devote himself, and all he has, to some great, chivalrous, heroic enterprise; whose one object is to be of use, {{even if he has}} to {{sacrifice}} his life to it. She says that there must be such men still left in the world; and that if she finds one, him she will marry, and no one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let the {{defendant}} stand up," [...] said Cornelius, [...] "and receive the just and merciful sentence of the Court for licentious and disgraceful conduct unbecomin' a supercargo. The defendant <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> money. Very well. The Court regrets {{it has no}} calaboose. In lieu thereof, and {{in view of the}} impoverished condition of {{the defendant}}, the Court fines said defendant one white silk shirt of the same kind, make and quality at present worn by defendant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘When I <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> stomach,’ {{explained}} the chatty little Mrs. Tibbs, ‘I mean that his digestion {{is so much}} impaired, and his interior so deranged, that his stomach {{is not of the}} least use to him;—in fact, it’s an inconvenience.’ ...|$|R
50|$|Anthony Atkinson later {{qualified}} {{his statement}} to claim {{his father had}} not been in engaged in activity that equated to the scope and scale of Jimmy Savile's alleged activities, even <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> evidence that his father ever had relations with anyone underaged.|$|R
50|$|Souper had a {{wife and}} {{children}} and expected acquittal or short imprisonment, but the jury returned the verdict of ‘Guilty of Murder’. Souper feinted but then, ‘pathetically’ apologised, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> fear death <b>having</b> been in battle and having faced the West Indies climate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{like this}} illness of Anthony's, my dear. The doctor {{does not seem}} to {{understand}} it, or at any rate so he pretends, and <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> doubt it will pass off. But I cannot help remembering the case of his brother George; also that of his mother before him.. In short, Barbara, do you think--well, that {{it would be wise to}} marry him? I know that to break it off would be dreadful, but, you see, health is so very important." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had Jerry in my {{thoughts}} when I spoke to you last night, Tom," [...] the latter said. [...] "I {{knew he was}} just starting west again, and thought I would put the matter to him. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> objection to your travelling with him as far as Fort Bridger, where maybe he will make a stay himself. There ain't no one as knows the plains much better than he does, and he can put you up to more {{in the course of}} a month than you would learn in a year just travelling with a caravan with farmers bound west" ...|$|E
6000|$|WALPOLE. He's {{all right}} {{as to the}} cheque, for a while at all events. He talked to me quite frankly before dinner as to the {{pressure}} of money difficulties on an artist. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> vices and is very economical, but that theres one extravagance he cant afford and yet cant resist; and that is dressing his wife prettily. So I said, bang plump out, [...] "Let me lend you twenty pounds, and pay me when your ship comes home." [...] He was really very nice about it. He took it like a man; {{and it was a}} pleasure to see how happy it made him, poor chap.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Gwynne {{really could}} not <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> doubt Mrs. Grantly {{would be most}} happy to see Mrs. Proudie any day Mrs. Proudie would do her the honour of calling: that was, of course, if Mrs. Grantly should happen to be at home.|$|R
2500|$|Tufton {{was only}} 25 {{when he died}} soon after the 1799 English cricket season began.

5000|$|In March 1977, a state Superior Court Judge {{refused to}} remove Feldman from office, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{authority}} {{to override the}} Senate's decision.

6000|$|... "No, he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> way {{of doing}} so. We {{do not know if}} Captain Harmon had any {{relatives}} or even where his home was, and it was his own ship in which he sailed. Father would be glad to think that Frank Harmon was dead, but he does not think he is. He says he was always a fickle-minded fellow, one fancy driving another out of his mind. Oh, I can bear my own misery--but to think what I have brought on you! I never dreamed that you could care for me. I was so lonely and your friendship was so pleasant--can you ever forgive me?" ...|$|E
60|$|The party arrived off the Custom-house {{at about}} two o’clock on the Thursday morning dispirited and worn out. The Tauntons were {{too ill to}} quarrel with the Briggses, and the Briggses were too wretched to annoy the Tauntons. One of the guitar-cases was lost on its passage to a hackney-coach, and Mrs. Briggs has not scrupled to state that the Tauntons bribed a porter to throw it down an area. Mr. Alexander Briggs opposes vote by ballot—he says from {{personal}} experience of its inefficacy; and Mr. Samuel Briggs, whenever he is asked to express his sentiments on the point, <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> opinion on that or any other subject.|$|E
60|$|And {{the generous}} {{influence}} of that social virtue, hospitality (to make {{no mention of}} wine and good cheer), opens Mr Toots's heart, and warms him to conversation. He does not tell Mr Feeder, B.A., what passed {{at the corner of}} the Square; but when Mr Feeder asks him 'When it is to come off?' Mr Toots replies, 'that there are certain subjects'--which brings Mr Feeder down a peg or two immediately. Mr Toots adds, that he don't know what right Blimber had to notice his being in Miss Dombey's company, and that if he thought he meant impudence by it, he'd have him out, Doctor or no Doctor; but he supposes its only his ignorance. Mr Feeder <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> doubt of it.|$|E
5000|$|... "In the {{beginning}} everybody recognized {{me from the}} movie," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> [...] "Many would even point at me with their whole arm outstretched and talk about me very loud.

25|$|General Terry protested, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{available}} {{officers of}} rank qualified to replace Custer. Both Sheridan and Sherman wanted Custer in command {{but had to}} support Grant. General Sherman, hoping to resolve the issue, advised Custer to meet personally with President Grant before leaving Washington. Three times Custer requested meetings with Grant, but each request was refused.|$|R
2500|$|... — The Turkish {{president}} Abdullah Gül sent el-Sisi {{a message}} congratulating him <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> doubts that the deep-rooted relations between Turkey and Egypt would continue, and sent his best wishes for the peace, stability {{and well-being of}} the Egyptian people.
