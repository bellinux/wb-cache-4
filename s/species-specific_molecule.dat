40|$|Aggregative amoebae of Dictyostelium minutum are not {{attracted}} by cyclic AMP; they {{are sensitive to}} various attracting sources from which yeast extract was chosen to purify the chemoattractant. A small acrasin-like <b>species-specific</b> <b>molecule</b> which contains glycine and C 5 H 5 N 5 has been purified 30, 000 -fold. Several characteristics of this chemotactic molecule, which is inactivated by an enzyme that is not species specific, are described...|$|E
40|$|ComX and CSF are Bacillus subtilis {{extracellular}} signaling peptides. Many different {{strains of}} B. subtilis do not communicate due to strain-specific variation of ComX. We demonstrate that CSF is a <b>species-specific</b> signaling <b>molecule</b> that partially compensates {{for the lack}} of ComX-mediated communication between different strains of B. subtilis...|$|R
40|$|CTL clones {{were derived}} from HLA-A 2. 1 {{transgenic}} mice by immunization with a human cell expressing HLA-A 2. 1. None of these clones lysed murine transfectants, and only 3 of 23 lysed monkey transfectants expressing HLA-A 2. In contrast, all of these clones lysed {{a wide variety of}} human cells expressing HLA-A 2. 1. These results demonstrate the existence of species-specific epitopes on the HLA-A 2. 1 molecule, and suggest that these epitopes are formed by the association of class I MHC products with one or more endogenous <b>species-specific</b> <b>molecules.</b> These results provide an explanation for the frequently observed failure of HLA class I-specific CTL to recognize these antigens on murine transfectants. These results also suggest that such endogenous proteins may also contribute to the formation of epitopes recognized by allospecific CTL...|$|R
40|$|SummaryDomestic cats spray urine with species-specific odor for {{territorial}} marking. Felinine (2 -amino- 7 -hydroxy- 5, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -thiaheptanoic acid), a putative pheromone precursor, is excreted in cat urine. Here, {{we report}} that cauxin, a carboxylesterase excreted as a major urinary component, regulates felinine production. In vitro enzyme assays indicated that cauxin hydrolyzed the felinine precursor 3 -methylbutanol-cysteinylglycine to felinine and glycine. Cauxin and felinine were excreted age dependently after 3 months of age. The age-dependent increases in cauxin and felinine excretion were significantly correlated. In mature cats, cauxin and felinine levels were sex-dependently correlated and were higher in males than in females. In headspace gas of cat urine, 3 -mercapto- 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -mercapto- 3 -methylbutyl formate, 3 -methyl- 3 -methylthio- 1 -butanol, and 3 -methyl- 3 -(2 -methyldisulfanyl) - 1 -butanol were identified as candidates for felinine derivatives. These findings demonstrate that cauxin-dependent felinine production is a cat-specific metabolic pathway, and they provide information for the biosynthetic mechanisms of <b>species-specific</b> <b>molecules</b> in mammals...|$|R
40|$|Identification of <b>species-specific</b> {{trypanosome}} <b>molecules</b> {{is important}} for laboratory- and field-based research into epidemiology and disease diagnosis. Although Trypanosoma congolense {{is the most important}} trypanosome pathogen of cattle in Africa, no <b>species-specific</b> <b>molecules</b> found in infective bloodstream forms (BSF) of the parasites have been identified, thus limiting development of diagnostic tests. Immuno-mass spectrometric methods were used to identify a protein that is recognized by a T. congolense-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) Tc 6 / 42. 6. 4. The identified molecule was expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli and was tested in several immunoassays for its ability to interact with the mAb. The three dimensional structure of the protein was modeled and compared to crystal- and NMR-structures of the homologous proteins from T. cruzi and T. brucei respectively, in order to examine structural differences leading to the different immunoreactivity of the T. congolense molecule. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure antibodies produced by trypanosome-infected African cattle in order to assess the potential for use of T. congolense calflagin in a serodiagnostic assay. The antigen recognized by the T. congolense-specific mAb Tc 6 / 42. 6. 4 was identified as a flagellar calcium-binding protein, calflagin. The recombinant molecule showed immunoreactivity with the T. congolense-specific mAb confirming that it is the cognate antigen. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that Ca 2 + modulated the localization of the calflagin molecule in trypanosomes. Structural modelling and comparison with calflagin homologues from other trypanosomatids revealed four non-conserved regions {{on the surface of the}} T. congolense molecule that due to differences in surface chemistry and structural topography may form species-specific epitopes. ELISAs using the recombinant calflagin as antigen to detect antibodies in trypanosome-infected cattle showed that the majority of cattle had antibody responses. Area under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, associated with host IgG and IgM, were calculated to be 0. 623 and 0. 709 respectively, indicating a positive correlation between trypanosome infection and the presence of anti-calflagin antibodies. While calflagin is conserved among different species of African trypanosomes, our results show that T. congolense calflagin possesses unique epitopes that differentiate this protein from homologues in other trypanosome species. MAb Tc 6 / 42. 6. 4 has clear utility as a laboratory tool for identifying T. congolense. T. congolense calflagin has potential as a serodiagnostic antigen and should be explored further for its utility in antigen-detection assays for diagnosis of cattle infections...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is a human}} pathogen, Vibrio cholerae is {{a regular}} member of aquatic habitats, such as coastal regions and estuaries. Within these environments, V. cholerae often takes {{advantage}} of the abundance of zooplankton and their chitinous molts as a nutritious surface on which the bacteria can form biofilms. Chitin also induces the developmental program of natural competence for transformation in several species of the genus Vibrio. In this study, we show that V. cholerae does not distinguish between species-specific and non-species-specific DNA at the level of DNA uptake. This is in contrast to what has been shown for other Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae. However, species specificity with respect to natural transformation still occurs in V. cholerae. This is based on a positive correlation between quorum sensing and natural transformation. Using mutant-strain analysis, cross-feeding experiments, and synthetic cholera autoinducer- 1 (CAI- 1), we provide strong evidence that the <b>species-specific</b> signaling <b>molecule</b> CAI- 1 {{plays a major role in}} natural competence for transformation. We suggest that CAI- 1 can be considered a competence pheromone...|$|R
40|$|African trypanosomes are insect-borne parasites {{that cause}} {{sleeping}} sickness in humans and nagana in domesticated animals. Successful transmission is {{the outcome of}} crosstalk between the trypanosome and its insect vector, the tsetse fly, This enables the parasite to undergo successive rounds of differentiation, proliferation and migration, culminating in the infection of a new mammalian host. Several stage- and <b>species-specific</b> parasite surface <b>molecules</b> have been identified and there are new insights into their regulation in the fly. Tsetse flies are often refractory to infection with trypanosomes. While many environmental and physiological factors are known to influence infection, our detailed understanding of tsetse-trypanosome relationships {{is still in its}} infancy. Recent studies have identified a number of tsetse genes that show altered expression patterns in response to microbial infections, some of which have also been implicated in modulating trypanosome transmission...|$|R
40|$|Principal {{component}} analysis (PCA) multivariate analysis {{was applied to}} study the cytotoxic activity of essential oils from various species of the Pistacia genus on human tumor cell lines. In particular, the cytotoxic activity of essential oils obtained from P. lentiscus, P. lentiscus var. chia (mastic gum), P. terebinthus, P. vera, and P. integerrima, was screened on three human adenocarcinoma cell lines: MCF- 7 (breast), 2008 (ovarian), and LoVo (colon). The results indicate that all the Pistacia phytocomplexes, {{with the exception of}} mastic gum oil, induce cytotoxic effects on {{one or more of the}} three cell lines. PCA highlighted the presence of different cooperating clusters of bioactive molecules. Cluster variability among species, and even within the same species, could explain some of the differences seen among samples suggesting the presence of both common and <b>species-specific</b> mechanisms. Single <b>molecules</b> from one of the most significant clusters were tested, but only bornyl-acetate presented cytotoxic activity, although at much higher concentrations (IC 50 = 138. 5 µg/mL) than those present in the essential oils, indicating that understanding of the full biological effect requires a holistic vision of the phytocomplexes with all its constituents...|$|R
40|$|Sea urchin egg {{fertilization}} {{requires the}} <b>species-specific</b> interaction of <b>molecules</b> on the sperm and egg surfaces. Previously, we isolated an extracellular, 70 -kD glycosylated fragment of the S. purpuratus egg receptor for sperm by treating the eggs with lysylendoproteinase C (Foltz, K. R., and W. J. Lennarz. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 111 : 2951 - 2959). To characterize the receptor further, we have generated a polyclonal antiserum (anti- 70 KL) against the purified 70 -kD fragment. Anti- 70 KL {{was found to}} react with a single polypeptide of approximately 350 kD on Western blots, presumed to be the intact receptor, in an egg cell surface preparation. This polypeptide appeared to be tightly associated with the plasma membrane/vitelline layer complex, as it was released from these preparations only by detergent treatment. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the receptor was distributed evenly over the egg surface. The anti- 70 KL was species specific both {{in its ability to}} recognize the egg surface protein and to inhibit sperm binding. Fab fragments generated from affinity-purified anti- 70 KL also bound to the egg surface and inhibited sperm binding in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, treatment with Fabs caused a small percentage of eggs to undergo cortical granule exocytosis, {{even in the absence of}} external Ca 2 +. These results confirm earlier findings indicating that the receptor is a cell surface glycoprotein of high molecular weight that species specifically binds sperm. This antiserum provides a powerful tool for further investigation of gamete interactions and the structure of the sperm receptor...|$|R
