40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the repercussions}} from {{the connection of}} Wind Parks on the operation of weak electricity distribution systems, based on simulation results. Three different cases concerning Fixed <b>Speed</b> Wind <b>Turbines</b> are studied. Also Variable <b>Speed</b> Wind <b>Turbines</b> are examined, using (i), doubly-fed induction machines, and (ii), a dual voltage-source converter cascade. All these types of wind turbines {{are assumed to be}} equipped with asynchronous machines. The effects on the voltage profile caused by both Fixed and Variable <b>Speed</b> Wind <b>Turbines</b> are compared. The advantages of the variable speed operation are confirmed. The possible increase in the installed capacity of a Wind Park with variable <b>speed</b> <b>turbines,</b> as compared with fixed <b>speed</b> <b>turbines</b> maintaining the same power quality standards, is estimated. The distribution system studied is an actual feeder located in a rural area at the southeast of mainland Greece. This area presents excellent wind potential and as a result independent power producers have expressed a considerable interest for the installation of Wind Parks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. If {{deviating}} {{from the}} optimal operation conditions, flow separation will {{occur on the}} blade of the runner in a low specific <b>speed</b> <b>turbine.</b> At this time, the turbulent flow of flow field in the blade duct {{will be in a}} strong non-equilibrium state, and thus the blade duct vortexes will be generated. To further study the mechanism of blade duct vortexes and to control the generation of these vortexes, Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model was used to numerically simulate and calculate the internal flow in the low specific <b>speed</b> <b>turbine</b> runner under low load conditions. The blade duct vortexes in the turbine runner were accurately predicted. The effect of short blade in eliminating and reducing the vortexes in the low specific <b>speed</b> <b>turbine</b> runner was analyzed and compared. 1...|$|R
50|$|As already mentioned, {{variable}} <b>speed</b> wind <b>turbines</b> {{cannot be}} {{directly connected to}} a transmission system. One of the drawbacks {{of this is that}} the inertia of the transmission system is reduced as more variable <b>speed</b> wind <b>turbines</b> are put online. This can result in more significant drops in the transmission system's voltage frequency in the event of the loss of a generating unit. Furthermore, variable <b>speed</b> wind <b>turbines</b> require power electronics, which increases the complexity of the turbine and introduces new sources of failures. It has also been suggested that additional energy capture achieved by comparing a variable <b>speed</b> wind <b>turbine</b> to a fixed <b>speed</b> wind <b>turbine</b> is approximately 2%.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work is to validate wind turbine models available in commercial simulation tools with measurements. Results are shown for two turbines located in two different wind farms; wind turbine 1 is a fixed <b>speed</b> <b>turbine</b> with induction generator, and wind turbine 2 is a variable <b>speed</b> <b>turbine</b> with converter-interfaced synchronous generator. Simulated active and reactive power transient responses to voltage dips have been compared to measured responses, as suggested by IEA Wind Annex 21. For the fixed <b>speed</b> <b>turbine</b> quite good agreement between measurement and simulation is obtained. Shaft parameters are seen to have significant influence on the simulated active power response. For the variable <b>speed</b> <b>turbine</b> the active and reactive power responses are to a high degree determined by the power electronics interface and corresponding controllers, and particularly the control strategy applied during voltage dips. Wind turbine manufacturers are generally very restrictive on giving out this type of information, and thus typical configurations and parameters {{have been used in}} this work. The agreement between measurement and simulation can to some degree be improved by changing the inverter controller parameters by trialand error, but detailed knowledge on the control of the converter would be required in order to achieve a very good agreement...|$|R

Proposed application at a university campus is used as a case study to demonstrate that wind power is unlikely to be economically competitive where grid-connected electricity is available. The need for improved low wind <b>speed</b> <b>turbine</b> performance for Thai applications is highlighted by comparing the output of commercially available wind turbines with the characteristics of Thai wind; the challenges of improving low wind <b>speed</b> <b>turbine</b> performance are discussed. It is concluded that for Thailand in the foreseeable future the benefits of economic wind power electricity generation will probably be confined to small remote isolated installations including traditional applications...|$|R
