DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the preparation of (I).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} rod-bipolar <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> on visual sensitivity. Two observations indicate that rod-rod bipolar <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> is nonlinear. First, responses of rods increased linearly with flash strength, while those of rod bipolars increased supralinearly. Second, fluctuations in the responses of rod bipolars were larger than expected from linear summation of the rod inputs. Rod-OFF bipolar <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> did not share this strong nonlinearity. Surprisingly, nonlinear rod-rod bipolar <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> eliminated many of the rod’s single-photon responses. The impact on sensitivity, however, was more than compensated for by rejection of noise from rods that did not absorb photons. As a consequence, rod bipolars provide a nearoptimal readout of rod signals at light levels near visual threshold...|$|R

40|$|A new Monolithic InGaAs Active Pixel Multispectral Image Sensor is described. This Infrared sensor will utilize {{high quality}} InGaAs grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on InP {{substrate}} for the fabrication {{of a high}} speed Junction Field Effect Transistor array. In-X Ga As is a Ill-V alloy whose cutoff wavelength can be tuned from 0. 8 jim (GaAs) to 3. 5 jim (InAs). Due to the spectral windows of 3 - 5 jim and 8 - 12 pin in atmosphere, this material has not received much attention to date for infrared focal plane arrays even though the responsivities for the 0. 8 - 1. 0 jtm, and 2. 0 - 2. 5 jun windows for the water and carbon dioxide molecules in air are excellent. Steady advancements of InGaAs material growth and devices have been made, primarily driven by the optoelectronics industry and the high speed electronics community. Most of this knowledge exists {{in the public domain}} and is readily accessible. Detectors at 1. 7 pm cutoff can be ideally implemented as lattice matched In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As/InP PIN devices. PIN detectors require high material quality to reduce dark current and decrease bit errors. Additionally, the high intrinsic mobility of In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As enables very high speed transistors for monolithic microwave integrated circuit applications.

40|$|Among the <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> {{systems in}} {{bacteria}} two types predominate: two-component regulatory systems and quorum sensing systems. Both types of system can mediate <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> across the bacterial cell envelope; however, the signalling molecule typically is {{not taken up}} into the cells in the former type of system, whereas it usually is in the latter. The Two-component systems include the recently described (eukaryotic) phosphorelay systems; quorum sensing systems can be based upon autoinducers of the N-acylated homoserine lactones, and on autoinducers of a peptidic nature. A single bacterial cell contains many signalling modules that primarily operate in parallel. This may give rise to neural-network behaviour. Recently, however, for both types of basic <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> modules, it has been demonstrated that they also can be organised in series (i. e. in a hierarchical order). Besides their hierarchical position in the signal transduction network of the cell, the spatial distribution of individual signalling modules may also {{be an important factor}} in their efficiency in <b>signal</b> <b>transfer.</b> Many challenges lie hidden in future work to understand these <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> processes in more detail. These are discussed here, with emphasis on the mutual interactions between different <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> processes. Successful contributions to this work will require rigorous mathematical modelling of the performance of signal transduction components, and -networks, as well as studies on light-sensing signal transduction systems, because of the unsurpassed time resolution obtainable in those latter systems, the opportunity to apply repeated reproducible stimuli, etc. The increased understanding of bacterial behaviour that already has resulted - and may further result - from these studies, can be used to fine-tune the beneficial activities of bacteria and/or more efficiently inhibit their deleterious ones...|$|R
