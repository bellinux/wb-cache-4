We present a statistical method that provides locally calibrated, probabilistic wind speed forecasts at any desired place within the forecast domain based on the output of a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Three approaches for wind speed post-processing are proposed, which use either truncated normal, gamma or truncated logistic distributions to make probabilistic predictions about future observations conditional on the {{forecasts of}} an ensemble prediction system (EPS). In order to provide probabilistic forecasts on a grid, predictive distributions that were calibrated with local wind speed observations need to be interpolated.

This project therefore sought to develop and pilot a cognitive analytic informed guided self-help treatment for mild-to-moderate anxiety for delivery by Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs). METHOD: Medical Research Council treatment development guidelines were used. Phase I included development of the six-session treatment manual using practice guidelines, <b>small-scale</b> <b>modelling</b> (n = 3) and indicated manual iterations. Phase II consisted of a mixed methods case series design (n = 11) to index feasibility, uptake and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Cognitive analytic guided self-help (CAT-SH) met established quality parameters for guided self-help. A high treatment completion rate was observed, with 10 / 11 patients who attended the first treatment session subsequently completing full treatment. Six out of ten patients completing full treatment met reliable recovery criteria at follow-up. Effect sizes and recovery rates equate with extant PWP outcome benchmarks. Practitioner feedback indicated that delivery of CAT-SH was feasible.

The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to determine the parameters of the Gaussian distributions. On the other hand, the <b>small-scale</b> <b>modelling</b> of the game deals with specific basketball actions which can be defined in the form of action templates that are used by the basketball experts to pass their instructions to the players. For the recognition purposes we define the basic game elements which are the building blocks of the more complex game actions.

However, {{there are not}} enough studies on similitude law for analogizing prototype structures accurately with <b>small-scale</b> <b>models,</b> although conventional similitude law based on geometry is not well consistent in the inelastic seismic behavior. When fabricating prototype and <b>small-scale</b> <b>model</b> of reinforced concrete structures by using the same material, added mass is demanded from a volumetric change and scale factor could be limited due to size of aggregate. Therefore, it is desirable that different material is used for <b>small-scale</b> <b>models.</b> Thus, a modified similitude law could be derived depending on geometric scale factor, equivalent modulus ratio and ultimate strain ratio. In this study, compressive strength tests are conducted to analyze the equivalent modulus ratio of micro-concrete to normal-concrete. Then, equivalent modulus ratios are divided into multi-phase damage levels, which are basically dependent on ultimate strain level. Therefore, an algorithm adaptable to the pseudodynamic test, considering equivalent multi-phase similitude law based on seismic damage levels, is developed. In addition, prior to the experiment, it is numerically verified if the developed algorithm is applicable to the pseudodynamic test...|$|R

Such recent large-scale RC column tests have been compared with results of small-scale RC column tests. As a result, results of these large-scale model experiments show shortcomings in <b>small-scale</b> <b>model</b> experiments. At least one study showed that the <b>small-scale</b> <b>model</b> does not reproduce the observed damage on the large-scale model. Therefore, {{in order to develop}} <b>small-scale</b> <b>model</b> experiment results, experiment tests of <b>small-scale</b> <b>model</b> which might agree well with large-scale model should be undertaken. In an authors’ previous study, experimental cyclic loading study on 0. 1 - and 0. 2 -scale RC column models was carried out and results have been compared with full- and 0. 5 -scale RC column models performed in the JR-Tokai test facility. Although the authors’ experimental study clearly shows agreements and differences between large-scale <b>model</b> and <b>small-scale</b> <b>model,</b> the results still remain to be validated with respect to bond behavior between longitudinal steel bars and concrete. This study analyses full-, 0. 5 -, 0. 2 -, and 0. 1 -scale RC columns models using fiber model analyses to investigate the bond behavior analytically. This analytical study focuses on differences in hysteresis curves. Validity of the analysis results was determined by comparing experimental results of full- and 0. 5 -scale model. It is shown that fiber model analysis results agree well with the full- and 0. 5 -scale model. Although results of 0. 1 -scale models, which are scaled correctly for not only steel bar radius but also steel bar ribs, are capable to full- and 0. 5 scale model, analytical results of 0. 2 - and 0. 1 -scale model with different steel bar ribs seem to be less agreements.

Most estimates of sea-ice production are based on the surface energy balance equation and use global reanalyses as atmospheric forcing, which are too coarse {{to take into account the}} impact of polynyas on the atmosphere. Additional errors in the estimates of polynya ice production may result from the methods of calculating atmospheric energy fluxes and the assumption of a thin-ice distribution within polynyas. The present study uses simulations using the mesoscale weather prediction model of the Consortium for <b>Small-scale</b> <b>Modelling</b> (COSMO), where polynya area is prescribed from satellite data. The polynya area is either assumed to be ice-free or to be covered with thin ice of 10 cm. Simulations have been performed for two winter periods (2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09).

In a process-based comparison of two aerosol and chemistry schemes within the regional atmospheric modeling framework COSMO-ART (Consortium for <b>Small-Scale</b> <b>Modelling,</b> Aersosol and Reactive Trace gases extension), we identify key sensitivities of aerosol parameterizations.

For a Saharan dust outbreak reaching Europe, modeled aerosol populations are more sensitive to structural differences between the schemes, in particular the consideration of aqueous-phase sulfate production, the selection of aerosol species and modes, and modal composition, than to parametric choices like modal standard deviation and the parameterization of aerosol dynamics. The same observation applies to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Differences in the concentrations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are masked by uncertainties between two ice-nucleation parameterizations and their coupling to the aerosol scheme.

In Antarctica, measurements are scarce and models {{are essential for}} the investigation of polynyas. A robust quantification of polynya exchange processes in simulations relies on a realistic representation of atmospheric conditions in the forcing dataset. The sensitivity of simulated coastal polynyas in the south-western Weddell Sea to the atmospheric forcing is investigated with the Finite-Element Sea ice-Ocean Model (FESOM) using daily NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data (NCEP), 6 hourly Global Model Europe (GME) data and two different hourly datasets from the high-resolution Consortium for <b>Small-Scale</b> <b>Modelling</b> (COSMO) model. Results are compared for April to August in 2007 – 09. The two coarse-scale datasets often produce the extremes of the data range, while the finer-scale forcings yield results closer to the median. The GME experiment features the strongest winds and, therefore, the greatest polynya activity, especially over the eastern continental shelf. This results in higher volume and export of High Salinity Shelf Water than in the NCEP and COSMO runs.

To account for this, we have implemented a thermodynamic sea-ice module in COSMO and performed simulations at a resolution of 15 km and 5 km for the Laptev Sea area in April 2008. Temporal and spatial variability of surface and 2 -m air temperature are verified by four automatic weather stations deployed {{along the edge of the}} western New Siberian polynya during the Transdrift XIII- 2 expedition and by surface temperature charts derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. A remarkable agreement between the new model results and these observations demonstrates that the implemented sea-ice module can be applied for short-range simulations. Prescribing the polynya areas daily, our COSMO simulations provide a high-resolution and high-quality atmospheric data set for the Laptev Sea for the period 14 - 30 April 2008. Based on this data set, we derive a mean total sea-ice production rate of 0. 53 km 3 /day for all Laptev Sea polynyas under the assumption that the polynyas are ice-free and a rate of 0. 30 km 3 /day if a 10 -cm-thin ice layer is assumed.

40|$|The {{planetary}} {{boundary layer}} (PBL) over the Tibetan Plateau (with a mean elevation about 4 km above sea level) reaches an unmatched height of 9515 m above sea level. The proximity of this height to the tropopause facilitates an exchange between the stratosphere and the boundary layer. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this unique PBL have remained uncertain. Here, the authors explore these mechanisms and their relative importance using measurements of the PBL, the associated surface fluxes, and single-column and regional numerical simulations, as well as global reanalysis data. Results indicate that the dry conditions of both ground soil and atmosphere in late winter cannot explain the special PBL alone. Rather, the results from a single-column model demonstrate the key influence of {{the stability of the}} free atmosphere upon the growth of extremely deep PBLs over the Tibetan Plateau. Simulations with the numerical weather prediction model Consortium for <b>Small-Scale</b> <b>Modelling</b> (COSMO) exhibit good correspondence with the observed mean PBL structure and realistic turbulent kinetic energy distributions throughout the PBL. Using ERA-Interim, the authors furthermore find that weak atmospheric stability and the resultant deep PBLs are associated with higher upper-level potential vorticity (PV) values, which in turn correspond to a more southerly jet position and higher wind speeds. Upper-level PV structures and jet position thus influence the PBL development over the Tibetan Plateau...|$|E

KENDA provides a state-of-the-art ensemble data assimilation system on the convective scale for operational data assimilation and forecasting based on the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). In this study, the Efficient Modular VOlume RADar Operator is applied for the assimilation of radar reflectivity data to improve short-term predictions of precipitation. Both deterministic and ensemble forecasts have been carried out. A case-study shows that the assimilation of 3 D radar reflectivity data clearly improves precipitation location in the analysis and significantly improves forecasts for lead times up to 4 h, as quantified by the Brier Score and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score. The influence of different update rates on the noise in terms of surface pressure tendencies and on the forecast quality in general is investigated. The results suggest that, while high update rates produce better analyses, forecasts with lead times of above 1 h benefit from less frequent updates. For a period of seven consecutive days, assimilation of radar reflectivity based on the LETKF is {{compared to that of}} DWD's current operational radar assimilation scheme based on latent heat nudging (LHN).
