40|$|Abstract—The authors {{report a}} case of swine urolithiasis caused by {{improper}} administration of <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> and which was diagnosed by examination of urinary sediments and analyzing {{the composition of the}} uroliths. The chemical composition of urinary calculi obtained from affected pigs with urolithiasis was further confimed as <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> by fourier transform infrared (FTIR). It is suggested that appearance of typical fanlike or wheat bunchy crystals in urinary sediments under observation of lightmicroscope and determination by FTIR for the crystals are helpful in diagnosing sulfa calculi causced swine urolithiasis.

40|$|The autors have {{described}} the separation and identification of seven kinds of sulfonamides {{by means of the}} thin-layer chromatograghy and an example for the detection of <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> sodium in the cadaveric blood. In the separation of these sulfonamides, the developers of chloroform-methanol system which consist of two or more kinds of polar and non-polar solvents, gave the satisfactory result. All these sulfonamides could be detected even in a very small quantities of 0. 1 μg by using p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde or diazo reagent and the color was very clear. As a result, both reagents would be expected to be available for the detecting reagent in the usual analysis of sulfonamides. From the blood (8 ml) of a man aged 52 who ”Daimeton” injection was intravenously received and suddenly died, <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> sodium was separated and identified through the analysis coupled with the thin-layer chromatography and ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry.

40|$|Only 3 out of 8 South African {{isolates}} of Plasmodium durae used in 524 turkeys in 161 passages caused approximately 50 % mortality, {{a further}} 3 produced approximately 10 % mortality while 2 {{were found to}} be apathogenic. Exoerythrocytic schizonts were the main pathogenic stage. In most survivors the effect on mass gains was minimal. Twelve drugs currently available for use in poultry, as well as chloroquin phosphate, were tested for their activity against experimental infections with Plasmodium durae in domestic turkeys. While chloroquin phosphate showed a certain degree of effectivity, Amprolium, Amprolium + Ethopabate, Maduramycin, Toltrazuril, Metronidazole, Furazolidone, Enrofloxacin and Sulfamethoxypyridazine + Trimethoprim were ineffective. Halofuginone and Penta-Sulfa at a high dose had some protective effect. At high doses Sulfachloropyrazine protected from mortality without affecting the parasitaemia, while <b>Sulfamonomethoxine</b> suppressed parasitaemia without entirely protecting from mortality. From these data it is concluded that Halofuginone has a potential as possible chemoprophylactic.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the oral pharmacokinetics of the acidic drugs, diclofenac (DF) and <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> (SMM), which have different physicochemical properties, in Shiba goats. DF and SMM were intravenously and orally administered to 5 male goats using a crossover design. The Tmax of DF and SMM were reached 1. 5 and 5. 6 hr {{after they have been}} orally administered, respectively, and this was followed by their slow elimination. The elimination of both drugs was markedly faster after being intravenously rather than orally administered, which indicated flip-flop phenomena after the oral administration. The mean absorption times (MATs) of DF and SMM were 6 and 15 hr, respectively. This slow absorption may have been due to slow gastric emptying in goats. The large difference observed in MATs between DF and SMM may have been because DF, which is more lipophilic than SMM, was partly absorbed from the forestomach. Therefore, these results suggest that the absorption of highly lipophilic drugs from the forestomach may be markedly high in Shiba goats. In case of drugs whose elimination is quite fast, their efficacies may appear from the early stage after oral administration even in ruminants, because elimination rate is the determinant factor of Tmax in flip-flop phenomena. Such drugs may be used orally even in ruminants. KEY WORDS: diclofenac, flip-flop phenomena, goat, oral pharmacokinetic, <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> doi: 10. 1292 /jvms. 14 - 0261; J. Vet. Med.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{presence}} and distribution of 22 antibiotics, including eight quinolones, nine sulfonamides and five macrolides in mollusks from the Bohai Sea of China. 190 samples of eleven species were collected in 2006, 2007 and 2009. Laboratory analyses revealed that antibiotics were widely distributed in the mollusks with quinolones as the major compounds with concentrations of 0. 71 similar to 1575. 10 mu g/kg, which were up to two orders of magnitude {{higher than those of}} sulfonamides (0 similar to 76. 75 mu g/kg) and macrolides (0 similar to 36. 21 mu g/kg). The contents of quinolones and macrolides did not show significant changes from 2006, 2007 to 2009, while sulfonamides decreased significantly from 2006 to 2009. Compared with other sites, the city of Dalian was more polluted with quinolones, while Beidaihe was more contaminated with erythromycin and sulfapyridine. In addition, Mactra venenformis and Meretrix merehjgntrix Linnaeus contained higher concentrations of quinolones and <b>sulfamonomethoxine,</b> while Mytilus edulis had higher levels of erythromycin and sulfapyridine.

40|$|Six sulfonamides, i. e., sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, {{sulfamethoxazole}} and <b>sulfamonomethoxine,</b> {{were applied}} to spike whole hen eggs at 0. 1 mg kg- 1 eggs. The spiked hen eggs were heated at 80 and 100 °C to investigate the degradation kinetics of the sulfonamides under simu­lated cooking conditions. The sulfonamides added were extracted twice from the spiked eggs with dichloromethane by an ultrasonic-assisted extraction, and analyzed by a HPLC method after purification. The first-order rate constants and half-life times of the sulfonamides were calculated, and the corresponding apparent activation energy of their degradation was also obtained by applica­tion of the Arrhenius equation. The results indicated that all six sulfonamides degraded faster at the higher heating temperature, with first-order rate constants ranging from 0. 0056 to 0. 0108 min- 1 at 80 °C and from 0. 0147 to 0. 0394 min- 1 at 100 °C.

40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} determination of 22 sulfonamides in pork, including sulfabenzamide, sulfacetamide, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, sulfamera-zinesulfadoxine, <b>sulfamonomethoxine,</b> sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethoxydiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, sulfamoxole, sulfaphenazole, sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline, sulfathiazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfaguanidine, trimethoprim and sulfisomidine, with matrix solid phase dispersion and high pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane. After centrifugation, the lower solution was gone through a 0. 22 μm filter membrane and then separated by Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 150 mm, 2. 7 μm), after that it was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Results The linear range of 22 sulfonamides were 10 ~ 100 μg/kg, r> 0. 99. The recoveries of sulfamethizole, trimethoprim and sulfaguanidine were below 40 %, the others were above 60 %. The limits of quantitation were 5 ~ 10 μg/kg. Conclusion The advantages of this method are fast, efficient, less organic reagent and low cost. It is suitable for the determination of sulfonamides residues in pork...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} encapsulated cells such as chondrocytes in {{the carrier}} matrix {{have been widely}} used to repair cartilage defects. However, chondrocyte phenotype is easily lost when chondrocytes are expanded in vitro by a process defined as &# 8220;dedifferentiation&# 8221;. To ensure successful therapy, an effective pro-chondrogenic agent is necessary to overcome the obstacle of limited cell numbers in the restoration process, and dedifferentiation is a prerequisite. Gallic acid (GA) has been used in the treatment of arthritis, but its biocompatibility is inferior to that of other compounds. In this study, we modified GA by incorporating <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> sodium and synthesized a sulfonamido-based gallate, JJYMD-C, and evaluated its effect on chondrocyte metabolism. Our results showed that JJYMD-C could effectively increase the levels of the collagen II, Sox 9, and aggrecan genes, promote chondrocyte growth, and enhance secretion and synthesis of cartilage extracellular matrix. On the other hand, expression of the collagen I gene was effectively down-regulated, demonstrating inhibition of chondrocyte dedifferentiation by JJYMD-C. Hypertrophy, as a characteristic of chondrocyte ossification, was undetectable in the JJYMD-C groups. We used JJYMD-C at doses of 0. 125, 0. 25, and 0. 5 µg/mL, and the strongest response was observed with 0. 25 µg/mL. This study provides a basis for further studies on a novel agent in the treatment of articular cartilage defects...|$|E

The validation scheme was built in accordance with the target level of 50 μgkg(- 1) for all analytes. The sulfonamides investigated were as follows: sulfaguanidine (SGN), sulfanilamide (SNL), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfathiazole (STZ), sulfamerazine (SMR), sulfamethizole (SMZ), sulfadimerazine (SDM), <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> (SMNM), sulfamethoxypiridazine (SMP), sulfadoxine (SDX), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfaquinoxaline (SQX) and sulfadimethoxine (SDT). Several extraction procedures were investigated during the development phase. Finally, the best results were obtained with a procedure using acidic hydrolysis and cation exchange purification. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C 18 analytical column. Matrix effects were also investigated. Data acquisition implemented for the confirmatory purpose was performed by monitoring 2 MRM transitions per analyte under the positive electrospray mode. Mean relative recoveries ranged from 85. 8 % to 110. 2 % and relative standard deviations lying between 2. 6 % and 19. 8 % in intra-laboratory reproducibility conditions. The decision limits (CCα) ranged from 1. 8 to 15. 5 μgkg(- 1). High resolution mass spectrometry was used to investigate the possible formation of sulfonamide metabolites in honey.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{method of}} combining solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was evaluated for determination trace amount of sulfonamides in meat products. Eight commonly used sulfonamides, sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfathiazole (STZ), sulfamerazine (SMR), sulfamethazine (SMT), <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> (SMMX), sulfamethoxazole (SMXZ), sulfaquinoxaline (SQX) and sulfadimethoxine (SDMX), were investigated in this study. Chromatography {{was performed on}} a C(18) reversed-phase column using an isocratic, acetonitrile in water as the mobile phase. Fiber coated with a 65 mu m thickness of polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) was used to extract sulfonamides at optimum conditions. Analytes were desorbed with static desorption in an SPME-HPLC desorbed chamber for 15 min and then determined by LC-MS. The detection limits of these sulfonamides in pork were from 16 mu g kg(- 1) (SMT) to 39 mu g kg- 1 (SMMX). According to the analysis, the linear range was from 50 to 2000 mu g kg(- 1) with relative standard deviation (R. S. D. s) value below 15 % (intra-day) and 19 % (inter-day). The proposed method was tested by analyzing meats. from a local market for sulfonamides residues. Some sulfonamides in our study were detected in the meat samples. The concentration of these residual sulfonamides ranged from 66 mu g kg- 1 (SDZ) to 157 mu g kg(- 1) (SQX) in a chicken sample. The results demonstrate that the SPME-LC-MS system is highly effective in analyzing trace sulfonamides in meat products. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{effect of}} a 3 : 1 {{combination}} of <b>sulfamonomethoxine</b> and ormetoprim (SMM-OMP) against edwardsiellosis was studied in two experiments with artificially infected Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. Flounder, average weight of 25. 8 ± 4. 8 g in experiment 1 and 38. 4 ± 7. 2 g in experiment 2, were challenged by immersing for 15 min in sea water containing about 108 colony forming unit (CFU) /ml of Edwardsiella tarda NUF 251. Slurry made up of ground commercial pellet feed and water containing SMM-OMP was administrated orally into the stomach of experimental fish with a plastic cathetel for 7 days in experiment 1 or 5 days in experiment 2 from the following day of challenge. Dosages of the drug containing 30 mg of SMM and 10 mg of OMP per 100 mg were 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day in experiment 1 and 0, 12. 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg/day in experiment 2. Therapeutic effect of oxytetracycline (OTC) was also studied at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day in experiment 2. As a result high therapeutic effects of SMM-OMP were achieved even at the lowest dosage (12. 5 mg/kg). In experiment 1, however, the fish at higher dosages were died more than those at lower dosages. Such fish did not show the disease signs of edwardsiellosis, and also E. tarda was not reisolated from the fish. From the results such deaths {{may be due to}} a harmful effect of the drug.

40|$|In this study, two new, {{sensitive}} and selective LC {{methods have been}} developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of several sulfonamides, {{in the presence of}} putrescine as internal standard, after precolumn derivatization with fluorescamine. In the first method, the derivatives of eight sulfonamides (sulfaguinidine, sulfanilamide, sulfisomidine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine and sulfamethoxazole) were separated on a reversed-phase column, Inertsil ODS- 3 (250 x 4 mm I. D., 5 μm) using a 20 min gradient elution with a binary system of methanol– 0. 05 mol L- 1 acetate buffer (pH 3. 4) and fluorescence detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 406 and 496 nm respectively. Fluorescamine was chosen as the derivatization reagent. The following conditions that influence the pre-column derivatization of sulfonamides, such as: reaction medium pH-value, fluorescamine concentration and reaction time were examined by varying one parameter at a time, while keeping the others constant. Linearity of derivatization was obtained for concentrations from 1. 0 to 300 μg L- 1 in standard solutions. The within- and between-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0. 8 to 3. 4 % and 1. 0 to 3. 8 % respectively. The method was applied to the determination of sulfonamides in human serum and urine and in poultry muscle and eggs, after solid-phase extraction and subsequent derivatization of the extracts. The whole procedure was evaluated and fully validated according to the European Union Decision 2002 / 657 /EC for the determination of sulfonamides in foods of animal origin. The detection limits varied from 0. 25 to 0. 30 μg L- 1 in serum, 0. 10 to 0. 25 μg L- 1 in urine samples, 1. 0 το 8. 0 μg kg- 1 in poultry muscle and 1. 0 to 5. 0 μg kg- 1 in egg samples and were much lower than the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). In the second method, the derivatives of twelve sulfonamides (sulfaguinidine, sulfanilamide, sulfisomidine, sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, <b>sulfamonomethoxine,</b> sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) were separated on a monolithic silica column, Chromolith Performance RP- 18 (100 x 4. 6 mm) using the same binary system (methanol- 0. 05 mol L- 1 acetate buffer pH 3. 4) as above, but with different gradient elution programme. In order to maximize the reaction yield and the sensitivity of the method, the critical derivatization parameters (medium pH, fluorescamine concentration and reaction time) were studied using the univariate approach and optimized. Linearity of derivatization was obtained for concentrations from 3. 0 to 300 μg L- 1 in standard solutions. The withinand between-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0. 6 to 3. 2 % and 0. 9 to 3. 3 % respectively. The whole procedure was evaluated and fully validated, according to the European Union Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, for the determination of sulfonamides in poultry muscle and eggs following solid-phase extraction. The method was also applied in human serum and urine. The detection limits varied from 2. 0 to 17. 0 μg kg- 1 in poultry muscle, 2. 0 to 15. 0 μg kg- 1 in egg, 0. 30 to 5. 0 μg L- 1 in human serum and 0. 25 to 2. 5 μg L- 1 in urine samples. In terms of sensitivity, the conventional column, Inertsil ODS- 3, offers lower detection limits for all sulfonamides. On the other hand, correlation coefficients are higher with the monolithic column, indicating better linearity. Seperation efficiency is also superior with the monolithic column, which enables analytical runs under lower back pressure at shorter time. Both analytical procedures were new, fast, simple, selective and highly sensitive. Additionally, the combined use of a monolithic column with fluorescence detection in order to determine sulfonamides by pre-column derivatization with fluorescamine, in human biological fluids, poultry muscle and egg samples, was applied {{here for the first time}} in the literature. ...|$|E
