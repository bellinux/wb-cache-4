Throughout 480 days, blood samples were taken to measure lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, urea, albumin and creatinine. The animals were euthanized, and the anatomical components (lungs, heart, spleen, liver, kidneys, tongue, empty stomach, empty intestines, omentum, cardiac and renal adipose tissue), carcass and commercial cuts (<b>shoulder,</b> <b>ham,</b> loin, ribs and neck) were weighed. Thereafter, an anatomic dissection of the loin was performed, separating the muscle, adipose and bone tissues. On the muscular part of the loin, longissimus dorsi, the proximate composition, fatty acid profile and the expression of SEW- 1, IGF-I and IGF-II were analyzed. A higher incidence of bone tissue was observed in the anatomical dissections of the loin and a lower incidence of fat in the proximate composition of the longissimus dorsi of the DCO group compared to the WDCO group (p< 0. 05). The expression of the IGF-II and SEW- 1 genes was higher (p< 0. 001 for each) in the muscle tissue of the DCO animals. Thus, using detoxified castor bean meal for long periods does not produce significant changes in the anatomical composition of the loin or the proximate composition of the longissimus dorsi. However, the differences in gene expression suggest the need for new investigations and care when using this product for animal feeding. ...|$|E

40|$|Competition {{in global}} pork markets has {{increased}} as trade barriers have opened {{as a result}} of free trade agreements. Japanese prefer both loin and Boston butt, while Chinese prefer pork offal. Frozen pork has increased in terms of imports into China. Japanese consumers consider pork meat origin along with pork price when making purchase decisions. While the Chinese prefer a strong tasting pork product, South Korean consumers show very strong preferences to pork that is higher in fat. Therefore, South Korean consumers have a higher demand for pork belly and Boston butt. Consequently, the supply and demand of pork in Korea is hardly met, which means that importation of high fat parts is inevitable. In Korea there is lower preference toward low fat parts such as loin, picnic <b>shoulder,</b> and <b>ham.</b> During the economic depression in South Korea there have been observable changes in consumer preferences.

The objective of the current work consisted of checking the existence of G×E interaction in carcass traits and in intramuscular fat content (IMF) in Iberian pigs fattened in two free-range systems. Genetic component and estimated breeding values (EBV) {{of the percentage of}} <b>hams,</b> <b>shoulders</b> and loins and IMF in loin were obtained from records of 4, 348 and 1, 818 pigs fattened in campo (C) and montanera (M) systems, respectively. A multitrait model where the performances of each system are considered as different traits was implemented. Three selection indexes were built with different treatments about the quality trait, two of them based in the optimal trait theory. The Pearson correlation between EBV and indexes and the Spearman correlation between the rankings of progenies of 21 boars fattened in both systems were calculated. Heritability results were different in both systems (h 2 range from 0. 43 to 0. 66 and from 0. 24 to 0. 33 in C and M system, respectively) and genetic correlation of same traits expressed in the two systems also pointed out to a weak G×E interaction (0. 64, 0. 67 and 0. 66 in <b>hams,</b> <b>shoulders</b> and IMF, respectively). Pearson and Spearman correlations were always significantly different to 1.

50|$|Prices {{of related}} goods: For {{purposes}} of supply analysis related goods refer to goods from which inputs are derived {{to be used}} in the production of the primary good. For example, Spam is made from pork <b>shoulders</b> and <b>ham.</b> Both are derived from pigs. Therefore pigs would be considered a related good to Spam. In this case the relationship would be negative or inverse. If the price of pigs goes up the supply of Spam would decrease (supply curve shifts left) because the cost of production would have increased. A related good may also be a good that can be produced with the firm's existing factors of production. For example, suppose that a firm produces leather belts, and that the firm's managers learn that leather pouches for smartphones are more profitable than belts. The firm might reduce its production of belts and begin production of cell phone pouches based on this information. Finally, a change in the price of a joint product will affect supply. For example beef products and anani sikim leather are joint products. If a company runs both a beef processing operation and a tannery an increase in the price of steaks would mean that more cattle are processed which would increase the supply of leather.|$|R

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was made}} of data from a total of 211 growing-finishing Iberian (IB) pigs from four separate and independent sets of trials. Within each set of trials, a factorial arrangement of treatments was used, involving several concentrations of ideal protein in the diets {{and two or three}} levels of feed intake. Pigs were slaughtered at several stages of growth from 10 to 150 kg body weight (BW). The partition of dietary protein {{in the body of the}} pigs, the empty-body gain (EBG), the chemical composition of EBG, growth of primal cuts in the cold eviscerated carcass (without head, feet, and tail), and mass of dissected tissues in trimmed <b>shoulder</b> and <b>ham</b> were determined. Linear regression equations allowed estimating N requirements for maintenance as 175 mg/(kg BW 0. 75 · kg dry-matter intake) · d - 1 and an average value for the net efficiency of utilization of the dietary protein apparently absorbed of 0. 386. In pigs offered adequate protein to energy diets, EBG was predicted as a function of average BW and feeding level (p < 0. 001). Multiple regression equations were constructed, which derived nutrient (g kg - 1) or energy (MJ kg - 1) composition of EBG as a function of empty-body weight (EBW), dietary protein to energy ratio, and level of feeding (p < 0. 001).

Within litter and sex, each of three pigs was assigned randomly to a light, intermediate or heavy slaughter weight group such that each mating type was represented by six barrows and six gilts from four different litters. Thirteen measurements were obtained for each pig; body weight, body length, body circumference, front leg circumference, front leg length, shoulder depth, <b>shoulder</b> width, <b>ham</b> width, head width, shoulder fat, last rib fat, last lumbar fat and loin muscle depth. Fat measurements and loin depth were taken ultrasonically. Pigs were slaughtered, chilled and manually separated into lean and fat, bone, skin and feet and tail components.

40|$|Ninety-six {{crossbred}} pigs {{of known}} stress-susceptibility genotype {{were used to}} determine effects of a recombinantly-derived analog of porcine somatotropin (rpST) on performance traits, quantitative and qualitative carcass characteristics and leg soundness. Feed consumption was significantly reduced with rpST and feed conversion improved across all genotypes. A treatment x genotype interaction suggested greater rpST-elicited improvement in feed efficiency within stress-negative genotype. Barrows also responded in a differential manner to rpST with a more definitive improvement in feed conversion relative to controls than was observed for treated gilts. Treatment with rpST increased lean accretion and reduced fat deposition of all genotypes as depicted by increased longissimus muscle areas and reduced average backfat thicknesses. Lean, bone and skin weights increased as a percentage of side weight while adipose tissue decreased in carcasses from treated animals. Proximate analysis of dissected lean and adipose tissues revealed increased percent protein and moisture but a reduction in percent lipid associated with rpST-treatment. Trimmed wholesale cuts of the ham, loin, Boston butt and picnic shoulder also increased as a proportion of side carcass weight due to the repartitioning effect of rpST. Qualitative muscle trait measurements of ultimate pH, visual color, reflectance and transmittance values improved markedly within animals of the stress-positive genotype receiving rpST;Front leg structure and movement as well as rear leg movement scores were observed reflecting a less smooth, more choppy stride for rpST-treated animals. Enhanced muscle development within <b>shoulder</b> and <b>ham</b> regions was the primary cause of this reduced mobility. Rear hock angulation and rear toe size did not differ between rpST-treated groups. Higher composite osteochondrosis score in the forelimb of treated animal resulted from greater incidence of joint lesions at the proximal humerus and proximal radius-ulna locations. Osteochondrosis values were similar for the distal humerus and distal radius-ulna and for the composite value generated from the four joint surface evaluations of hind limb;In summary, rpST improved feed:gain and lean:fat ratios within treated animals, had a beneficial effect on several muscle quality characteristics of the stress-positive genotype, and slightly reduced fore- and rear-leg mobility...|$|R

Carcass data from 233 pigs from a feeding study that involved 3 batches of 80 crossbred pigs each were used. Pigs, offspring of 12 boars, were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments (10 pigs per pen, gilts and barrows, and 2 pens per treatment in each batch) with diets formulated to contain 146 to 117 and 133 to 108. g/kg of CP and 7. 3 to 5. 8 and 5. 7 to 4. 7. g/kg of total Lys in early (90 to 130. kg BW) and late (130 to 165. kg BW) finishing, respectively. After slaughter, the carcasses were processed {{and the weight of}} the commercial lean (neck, loin, <b>shoulder,</b> and <b>ham)</b> and fat cuts (backfat, belly, and jowl) was recorded. The coefficient of variation was used to describe uniformity of the most important carcass traits, and the corresponding confidence intervals were computed to make comparisons across dietary treatments. Carcass weight and midline backfat thickness averaged 137. kg and 31. mm, respectively, and were not affected by diets. Diets did not influence the weight of commercial cuts and their proportion on carcass weight, with the sole exception of loins. Pigs fed diets containing the 2 lowest CP content had a slight lower proportion of loins in the carcass compared with pigs fed the conventional CP diet (P< 0. 05). Most carcass traits were affected by sex and by sire effects, but interactions between diet and sex or sire was only episodic. Uniformity of carcass weight, backfat thickness, and weight of loins and dressed hams was not influenced by the dietary treatments. In conclusion, the content of CP, Lys, and other indispensable AA of conventional diets for finishing heavy pigs may be reduced by 20 % without impairing the weight of carcass and primal cuts and the yields of dressed hams.

From 2, 404 carcasses, carcass temperature and pH were measured 45 min post-mortem; 48 h post-mortem pH, electrical conductivity, drip loss and meat colour were registered. During the raising period gender, conditions at weaning (purchased or not as piglet, vaccination against Mycoplasma) and (type of) room during fattening (i. e. from about 22 kg to 105 kg) were registered to relate with pork quality. Transport season, weather parameters, regrouping or not during loading, transport combination (truck, trailer and driver), transport compartment and transport conditions (loading density, transport duration and unloading time) nbsp;monitored. At the slaughterhouse, duration of lairage and carcass conformation were followed up to examine correlations with meat quality parameters. In conclusion, effects of farm management, climate parameters during transport, transport and slaughterhouse conditions on pork quality were demonstrated. In the next chapter, the effects of transport and lairage conditions on skin lesions of carcasses of fattening pigs, heterozygous for the halothane gene, were studied. A total of 4, 507 fattening pigs were transported from a farm to a commercial slaughterhouse (distance 110 km) in 111 transports spread over 5 years. Skin lesions were visually assessed in the slaughter line {{in different parts of the}} carcass, i. e. <b>shoulder,</b> middle and <b>ham,</b> using a 4 -point scale. The incidence of skin lesions was most prevalent (31 %) in the shoulder region of the pig carcass. Gender, wind velocity, regrouping, transport combination, transport compartment, lairage time and ham angle affected the skin lesion incidence. In conclusion, scoring the incidence of skin lesions is an indicator of the level of welfare exercised during transport and the slaughterhouse conditions. Furthermore, skin lesion monitoring can be used to determine critical control points in the transport procedure. Given the importance from both a commercial and welfare perspective, it should be a powerful incentive to handle fattening pigs with care duringnbsp;transport process and the lairage period. In chapter 4 the effect of olfactory substances on the heart rate and lying behaviour of pigs during transport simulation is investigated. Five treatments were tested in which a substance was applied to pigs’ snouts with a paintbrush. These consisted of: 1) control treatment (wiping without product); 2) 2 ml of a synthetic, maternal-like pheromone; 3) 5 ml of a synthetic, maternal-like pheromone; 4) a commercial, non-relevant odour and 5) 2 ml of a placebo (solvent of the synthetic pheromone without active ingredients). In total, 90 pigs took part in this study and each treatment was tested on a group of three pigs with six replicates per treatment. Pigs were vibrated in the vertical direction in a transport simulator with a frequency of 8 Hz and an acceleration of 3 m s– 2. Cardiac activity and lying behaviour during vibration were quantified. The effect of vibration was found to be statistically significant, i. e. causing an increase in heart rate and numbers of ventricular ectopic beats (VEB). Both 2 and 5 ml of synthetic pheromone were found to decrease minimum heart rate significantly. However, the number of VEB was highest for these two synthetic pheromone groups during vibration. No dose-dependent synthetic pheromone effects were found and there were no differences in the amount of time pigs spent lying. In practice, unfamiliar pigs are frequently mixed prior to loading in order to obtain groups of uniform weight and to adjust the group size to the dimensions of the trailer compartments. Mixings pigs induces aggressive interactions to establish a new social rank. Fighting results innbsp;lesions and pre-slaughter stress and on his turn reduced meat quality. A three-year study was performed to compare the effect ofnbsp;and regrouping at fattening, loading and lairage. A total of 1, 332 pigs were included over 30 transports from one pig farm to one slaughterhouse (110 km). Skin lesions were determined on 1, 314 carcasses. Meat quality was measured on 620 pigs. The temperature and pH in the longissimus dorsi muscle were measured 45 min post-mortem. Forty-eight hours later pH, electrical conductivity, drip loss and the colour of the longissimus dorsi muscle were measured. The non-regrouped treatment showed less skin lesions and better meat quality than the groups regrouped at loading or in lairage. Pigs mixed at 80 kg at the farm have in general a comparable amount of skin lesions and comparable meat quality as the non-mixed group. If mixing is unavoidable, due to large within-group weight variations, mixing at 80 kg can be an alternative to reduce skin lesions at slaughter and to optimise meat quality. Finally, from previous studies, it appears that the transport of fattening pigs is characterized by a strong human-animal interaction. Consequent handling is important because of animal welfare, meat quality and matching economic consequences. Therefore, chapter 6 presents practical information to ease the handling of fattening pigs. During road transport, human impact can be divided in different steps: 1) driving pigs from the pens via an alley to the trailer, 2) loading, 3) actual transport, 4) unloading to the lairage, and 5) driving pigs in the final stage to the stunning. Inadequate design and poor condition of the facilities will negatively affect the ease of handling. Because of the consequences, acute stress during transport and slaughter should be minimized by improving education of people, equipment and preparation of animals for the journey. Education programmes have to be repeated regularly so that knowledge can be refreshed. In general, it can be concluded that there are some main effects (see chapter 2 and 3) affecting welfare and meat quality. Initially, animal welfare and meat quality can be optimised by focusing on thesenbsp;effects. Preparing animals with olfactory substances, odours or feed additives has minor effects. After more than 30 years, there is still research going on about the impact of transport on welfare of animals and meat quality. Thereby, the optimization of welfare monitoring and training programmes are important study aspects. status: publishe...|$|R
