25|$|Bloom's {{critique}} of contemporary social movements {{at play in}} universities or society at large is derived from his classical and philosophical orientation. For Bloom, the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in 1942, the Methodist-affiliated University of San Antonio was failing.

The university left Waxahachie and took over the campus and alumni of the University of San Antonio. (The old Waxahachie campus is currently home to Southwestern Assemblies of God University). For the next decade the Woodlawn campus, on the city's near-west side, was Trinity's home while it developed a permanent home. Lacking adequate facilities, the university functioned by using military barracks and Quonset huts to house <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> provide library and classroom space.|$|E
25|$|The Friend of Singa Award was {{the brain}} child of Vincent Lam, {{a member of}} the Singapore Courtesy Council in 1991 as a means to {{recognise}} courteous conduct by <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> function symbiotically with the school's efforts to teach courteous behaviour within students as well. It was established with the hope that other students would see winners of the Friend of Singa Award as role models, and follow the example set by them as well. The award, opened to any school in Singapore, involved the nomination of a student from each school by recounting the respective student's act of kindness and courtesy. Among all the nominations, a student would then be chosen for the Most Courteous Student Award and 10 other students for Merit Awards.|$|E
