As a consequence of non-linear {{transaction costs}}, welfare losses occur compared to a first-best setup under zero transaction costs. In practice, <b>smaller</b> <b>emitters</b> will emit less (abate more) compared to larger emitters and vice versa due to economies of scale {{in the management of}} emissions trading.

Because the solar cell designs are characterized by an overlap of the B-doped emitter and the P-doped base with metal fingers of the other polarity, insulating thin films with excellent electrical insulation properties are required to prevent shunting in these overlapping regions.

Various methods including chemical, electro-chemical, and physical deposition techniques have been employed to synthesize 1 D ZnO nanostructures [3 – 5]. On the other hand, the wet-chemical methods [6 – 8] {{have been used for}} producing varied ZnO one-dimensional (1 D) nanostructures, such as nanotube [9], nanopencil [10], nanoneedle [11], and nanoscrew [12]. Recent experiments have shown that the ZnO 1 D nanostructures have excellent field emission properties, far better than other semiconductors [10, 11, 13, 14]. An important advantage of using aligned nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts, and nanotubes for field emission is their high aspect ratio. The field enhancement factor β is a key parameter which is determined by turn-on field, threshold field, and work function. Also, the value of β relates to the structure, shape, size, alignment, crystalline, aspect ratio, etc. [15]. Many effects, such as morphological effects [16], surface states [17], and densities of nanorods [18] have been studied. Zhao et al. [16] investigated the morphological effects on the field emission of ZnO nanorod arrays. The result showed that the ZnO nanoneedle arrays exhibit excellent properties due to their <b>small</b> <b>emitter</b> radius and high nanorod density remarkably reduces the local field at the emitters owing to the screening effect. Wang et al. [18] investigated the density effects on the field emission of ZnO nanorods and pointed out that the mezzo density of ZnO nanorods had the best field emission properties. But there is no report about the aspect ratio effects on the field emission properties of ZnO nanorod arrays. In this work, ZnO nanrod arrays with different aspect ratios and densities are synthesized by controlling the reaction times and concentrations of solution. The field emission properties of ZnO nanorod arrays with different aspect ratios and densities have been investigated for showing the enhancement factor β was enhanced with increasing the aspect ratio of ZnO nanorods and the enhancement factor β was decreased with reducing the density of nanorods. An optimum density and aspect ratio of ZnO nanorod arrays (sample C) have high efficiency of field emission. A model has been used for the explanation of the results.|$|E

40|$|There is extreme {{heterogeneity}} of firms regulated under the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{in terms of}} emissions evels and employed technology. We present a model that shows that behavior of firms under quantity regulation can differ strongly, dependent {{on the characteristics of}} the firms when the assumption of full information is relaxed. If there are informational costs with regard to abatement options and costs, relatively <b>small</b> <b>emitters</b> and emitters with relatively complex technology will face a threshold for evaluating abatement options and costs. We compare the EU ETS to the US SO 2 trading scheme and show that 'adjoining' markets to quantity regulation, supplying goods (i. e. abatement technology) or services (i. e. assistance in permit trading), play a crucial role to reduce transactions costs. Given high complexity of technology and/or strongly limited demand for certain technologies, markets will fail to provide appropriate assistance, generating efficiency losses. The presence of technological complexity and heterogeneous firms can have major consequences for the design of environmental regulation, when considering transaction costs.

40|$|Miniaturized {{electrical}} thrusters {{based on}} electrospray (or colloid) emitters could rev-olutionize the spacecraft industry by providing efficient propulsion capabilities to micro and nano satellites (1 - 100 kg). We report on our {{recent advances in}} the development of this technology within the MicroThrust (www. microthrust. eu) European consortium. We present the design and operation of the currently fabricated and next generation emitter arrays, describing their microfabrication process and measured performance. The emitters are out-of-plane internally fed capillaries micromachined in monolithic silicon. They are 100 µm tall and have an inner diameter of 5 - 10 µm. We operate the devices in both unipolar and bi-polar modes and find that the latest devices operate in a mixed regime, with the emitted spray a composition of ions and droplets. Their specific impulse is consequently in the few hundred seconds, highlighting the need for higher impedance, <b>smaller</b> <b>emitters.</b> Onset voltages are of than 800 - 850 V for 200 µm inner diameter extractors, current levels for 19 emitter arrays of 2 - 3 µA. Preliminary analysis hints to plume half-angles of 35 - 40 ◦, although these values depend on the operation mode and beam composition...|$|R
