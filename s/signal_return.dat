5000|$|The {{inversion}} effectively reduces {{sky wave}} radiation from a transmitter [...] - [...] normally VHF and UHF signals travel on into space {{when they reach}} the horizon, the refractive index of the ionosphere preventing <b>signal</b> <b>return.</b> With temperature inversion, however, the signal is {{to a large extent}} refracted over the horizon rather than continuing along a direct path into outer space.|$|E
50|$|On 12 August 2015, Z Rock & Pop's <b>signal</b> <b>returned</b> to Lima via 98.7 MHz. That {{is because}} {{numerous}} listeners made the reiterated {{request of the}} return to the dial.

In addition, Z Rock & Pop's <b>signal</b> <b>returned</b> to its frequency in Piura (89.5 MHz), {{as well as in}} Mollendo via 93.9 MHz.

50|$|Both {{signal and}} <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> may {{be applied to}} the primary of a {{transformer}} or balun, with the signal taken from the secondary. As common mode interference will not cause current to be induced in the primary, no signal from this source will be seen in the secondary, while differential signals on the primary will cause current in the primary and so cause induced voltage in the secondary.|$|E
50|$|The {{separate}} {{shield of}} a balanced audio connection also yields a noise rejection advantage over an unbalanced two-conductor arrangement (such as used in typical home stereos) where the shield must also act as the <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> wire. Any noise currents induced into a balanced audio shield will not therefore be directly modulated onto the signal, whereas in a two-conductor system they will be. This also prevents ground loop problems, by separating the shield/chassis from signal ground.|$|E
50|$|In the October 2009 {{issue of}} the American Journal of Physics Greaves, Rodriguez and Ruiz-Camacho {{reported}} a new method of measurement of the one-way speed of light. In the June 2013 {{issue of the}} American Journal of Physics Hankins, Rackson and Kim repeated the Greaves et al. experiment obtaining with greater accuracy the one way speed of light. This experiment proves with greater accuracy that the <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> path to the measuring device has a constant delay, independent of the end point of the light flight path, allowing measurement {{of the time of}} flight in a single direction.|$|E

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{characteristics of}} radar return from vegetation targets are investigated through a simulation study {{based upon the}} first-order scattered field. For simulation purposes, the vegetation targets are modeled as a layer of randomly oriented and spaced finite cylinders, needles, or discs, {{or a combination of}} them. The finite cylinder is used to represent a branch or a trunk, the needle for a stem or a coniferous leaf, and the disc for a decidous leaf. For a plane wave illuminating a vegetation canopy, simulation results show that the <b>signal</b> <b>returned</b> from a layer of disc- or needle-shaped leaves follows the Gamma distribution, and that the <b>signal</b> <b>returned</b> from a layer of branches resembles the log normal distribution. The Gamma distribution also represents the <b>signal</b> <b>returned</b> from a layer of a mixture of branches and leaves regardless of the leaf shapes. Results also indicate that the polarization state does not {{have a significant impact on}} signal distribution...|$|R
50|$|Challenges to {{perimeter}} {{surveillance radar}} include high clutter area operations. In {{the range of}} frequencies used almost all objects return some reflection from the radar. So foliage presents both a barrier to the radar energy {{as well as an}} area in which it is difficult to detect a moving target due to the high <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> from the foliage. To a degree, Doppler based radars can detect movement in such areas, as long as the component of movement velocity towards or away from the radar is significant enough to generate a signal that overcomes the foliage return signal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amount of}} shift {{varies with the}} angle forward or {{backward}} from the ortho-normal direction. By knowing {{the speed of the}} platform, target <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> is placed in a specific angle [...] "bin" [...] that changes over time. Signals are integrated over time and thus the radar [...] "beam" [...] is synthetically reduced to a much smaller aperture - or more accurately (and based on the ability to distinguish smaller Doppler shifts) the system can have hundreds of very [...] "tight" [...] beams concurrently. This technique dramatically improves angular resolution; however, it is far more difficult {{to take advantage of this}} technique for range resolution. (See pulse-doppler radar).|$|E
50|$|Radar {{altimeters}} are {{an essential}} part in ground proximity warning systems (GPWS), warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low or descending too quickly. However, radar altimeters cannot see terrain directly ahead of the aircraft, only that below it; such functionality requires either knowledge of position and the terrain at that position or a forward looking terrain radar. Radar altimeter antennas have a fairly large main lobe of about 80° so that at bank angles up to about 40°, the radar detects the range from the aircraft to the ground (specifically to the nearest large reflecting object). This is because range {{is calculated based on}} the first <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> from each sampling period. It does not detect slant range until beyond about 40° of bank or pitch. This is not an issue for landing as pitch and roll do not normally exceed 20°.|$|E

The averaged <b>signals</b> of the <b>return</b> <b>signals</b> of all the signal bursts at the different frequencies are processed to provide a combined signal, whose amplitude is related to the microfracture density of the substructure adjacent to the borehole...|$|R

40|$|Spectral {{estimation}} {{is considered}} in the paper as an additional instrument towards {{a better understanding of}} the physical phenomena behind the layover scattering decomposition. A super-resolution technique is employed to derive the fringe frequencies characterizing the layover portion. Due to the limited estimation support, only the dominant frequency is found to be reliable information. The non-linear relationship with slopes is employed to derive a principal slope map. A bistatic interferometric scenario is tested. It is found that for the majority of the detections the facade contribution is the prevailing one due to the presence of targets with a high backscattered <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> at the vertical slope. The number of layover contributors is assessed prior to the spectral estimation. It has been estimated that the <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> is dominated by a single contribution for the majority of the layovers...|$|E

However, GPR <b>signal</b> <b>return</b> is very susceptible to ground bounce and reflection of clutter objects, which makes the detection a difficult problem to date.
