I do not, indeed, {{know if the}} {{examples}} I have given from natural scenes, though they are as characteristic as I could well choose, are enough to accustom the reader {{to the character of}} true mountain lines, and to enable him to recognize such lines in other instances; but if not, at all events they may serve to elucidate the main points, and guide to more complete examination of the subject, if it interests him, among the hills themselves. And if, after he has pursued the inquiry long enough to feel the certitude of the laws which I have been endeavoring to illustrate, he turns back again to art, I am well assured it will be with a strange recognition of unconceived excellence, and a newly quickened pleasure in the unforeseen fidelity, that he will trace the pencilling of Turner upon his hill drawings. I do not choose to spend, in this work, the labor and time which would be necessary to analyze, as I have done the drawing of the St. Gothard, any other of Turner's important mountain designs; for the reader must feel the disadvantage they are under in being either reduced in scale, or divided into fragments: and therefore these chapters are always to be considered merely as memoranda for reference before the pictures which the reader may have it in his power to examine. But this one drawing of the St. Gothard, as it has already elucidated for us Turner's knowledge of crest structure, will be found no less wonderful in the fulness with which it illustrates his perception of the lower aqueous and other curvatures. If the reader will look back to the etching of the entire subject, Plate +21+, he will now discern, I believe, without the necessity of my lettering them for him, the lines of fall, rounded down from the crests until they plunge into the overhanging precipices; the lines of projection, where the fallen stones extend the long concave sweep from the couloir, pushing the torrent against the bank on the other side; in the opening of the ravine he will perceive the oblique and parallel inclination of its sides, following the cleavage of the beds in the diagonal line A B of the reference figure; and, finally, in the great slope and precipice on the right of it, he will recognize one of the grandest types of the peculiar mountain mass which Turner always chose by preference to illustrate, the [...] "slope above wall" [...] of d in Fig. 13, p. 148; compare also the last chapter, §§ 26, 27. It will be seen, by reference to my sketch of the <b>spot,</b> <b>Plate</b> +20+, that this conformation does actually exist there with great definiteness: Turner has only enlarged and thrown it into more numerous alternations of light and shade. As these could not be shown in the etching, I have given, in the frontispiece, this passage nearly of its real size: the exquisite greys and blues by which Turner has rounded and thrown it back are necessarily lost in the plate; but the grandeur of his simple cliff and soft curves of sloping bank above is in some degree rendered.|$|E

40|$|THESIS 7882 Candida dubliniensis is apathogenic yeast {{that was}} first {{identified}} as a novel species in 1995. It is phylogenetically very closely related to C. albicans. However, despite the close {{relationship between the two}} species, C. dubliniensis is significantly less pathogenic. Candida dubliniensis, unlike C. albicans, grows poorly or not at all at temperatures greater then 42 ?C and when the thermoprotectant disaccharide trehalose is the only available source of carbon. In order to investigate whether the decreased ability of C. dubliniensis to tolerate environmental stresses might contribute to the difference in virulence between the two species the phenotypic and molecular responses of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis to thermal, osmotic and oxidative stress was compared. Growth of representative isolates of the two species in liquid media at temperatures ranging between 30 ?C- 44 ?C, and with NaCl concentrations ranging between 0. 6 M- 1. 6 M was examined. The results confinned that C. albicans strains SC 5314 and 132 A have a significantly shorter mean doubling time than C dubliniensis strains CD 36, CD 539, CD 514 and p 7718 at temperatures > 42 ?C (F< 0. 04). The lower survival rates of C. dubliniensis and heat sensitive phenotype observed on agar spot plates further confirmed this data. Similarly, C. dubliniensis, unlike C. albicans, grows relatively poorly in media containing 0. 8 M- 1. 6 M NaCl as determined by the observed differences in doubling times, survival and <b>spot</b> <b>plate</b> assays.

40|$|Although a {{large body}} of {{literature}} exists on the systematics and ecology of free-living marine and brackish-water nematodes, key questions on the nature and magnitude of interactions between nematodes and other organisms in the benthos remain unanswered. Relatively few authors have investigated live nematodes in food web studies or in experiments dealing with the nematodes' response to a varying environment. It is mainly for the latter purpose that {{attempts have been made to}} maintain, rear and cultivate selected species. This paper describes the methodology used for the maintenance, rearing, and eventual permanent agnotobiotic cultivation of a variety of estuarine nematodes. <b>Spot</b> <b>plates,</b> where small samples of sediment or macrophyte material are inoculated on a sloppy agar layer, have been used for the purpose of maintenance and initial cultivation. Those species that reproduce on <b>spot</b> <b>plates</b> are then selected for monospecific cultivation on agar layers with different nutrient enrichments and with micro-organisms cotransferred from the <b>spot</b> <b>plates</b> as food. Mixtures of bacto and nutrient agar prepared in artificial seawater were specifically suitable for the xenic cultivation of nine bacterivorous and, when supplied with Erdschreiber nutrients, two algivorous/bacterivorous nematode species. Up to three generations of five other nematode species have been reared under laboratory conditions, and several more were kept alive and active for variable periods of time on agar. Generation times observed on <b>spot</b> <b>plates</b> for Adoncholaimus fuscus and Oncholaimus oxyuris were substantially shorter than previously published estimates and suggest a correspondingly higher predatory and scavenging potency for these and related enoplids. A procedure for the long-term storage of nematodes at - 80 degrees C with glycerol as a cryoprotectant was successfully used for Diplolaimella dievengatensis, Panagrolaimus sp. 1, and Pellioditis marina, but not for Diplolaimelloides meyli. The authors have also summarized the existing literature on the cultivation of marine and brackish-water nematodes. Continuous cultivation appears to have been successful mainly for Aufwuchs and epiphytic nematodes; only few sediment-dwellers have been established in permanent culture. Of only just over 30 species that have ever been cultivated, more than half belong to one family (Monhysteridae) and three are Rhabditida, an order poorly represented in the marine environment. Four species have been grown in monoxenic and one in axenic culture, the latter though with limited success. It is concluded that our understanding of the basic nutritional requirements of marine nematodes is as yet insufficient, and that the culture techniques which have so far mainly deployed agar or Liquid substrates, while being suitable for the cultivation of Aufwuchs and epiphytic nematodes, do not accurately enough mimic gradients specific of the natural habitat of many sediment-dwellers...|$|R

40|$|Selected cephalosporins, {{including}} cefamandole, cephaloridine, cephaloglycin, and cefoxitin, {{were examined}} {{for their ability}} to inhibit the enzymatic activity of and act as substrates for beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus. Enzyme inhibition was determined by Michaelis-Menten kinetic measurements and by a <b>spot</b> <b>plate</b> assay using a chromogenic substrate (Glaxo compound 87 / 312). These two methods provide comparable estimates of kinetic parameters. Inhibition of beta-lactamase, as measured by these two methods, was generally found to correlate with resistance to hydrolysis and is proposed as a preliminary method of assessing susceptibility of cephalosporins to beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Four 7 -αOCH 3, 7 -αH cephalosporin analogue pairs were also examined. The presence of the 7 -αOCH 3 substituent invariably resulted in reduced susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis, regardless of the other C 7 substituent. The 7 -αOCH 3 compounds were also better inhibitors than were their 7 -αH analogues, with the exception that 7 -αOCH 3 compounds having C 7 adipic acid substituents were less inhibitory to the S. aureus enzyme than were the corresponding 7 -αH analogues.

Strain S. arboricolus 2. 3319 was selected for further investigation due to its genetic variability among the Saccharomyces species as related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and availability of two sibling strains: S. arboricolus 2. 3317 and 2. 3318 in the lab. The tolerance of S. arboricolus strains (2. 3317, 2. 3318 and 2. 3319) to formic acid was further investigated by lab-scale fermentation analysis, and compared with S. cerevisiae NCYC 2592.

The spontaneous self-ignition of B 5 H 9 was quenched by the addition of small concentrations of the ethers THF (tetrahydrofuran) or DME (1, 2 -dimethoxy ethane). It was found that 10 % (volume) of either provided total quenching with a large margin of safety. When these stabilized solutions were exposed to air, they decomposed and evaporated leaving a residue that was identified by NMR analysis as boric acid. Most of the laboratory solvolysis experiments used the 90 % B 5 H 9, 10 % THF solution.

40|$|The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{contains}} 150 - 200 tandem repeats of the ribosomal RNA genes. The rDNA acquires {{a special}} chromatin structure called silent chromatin that represses RNA Polymerase (Pol) II transcription and homologous recombination {{to protect the}} integrity of this ~ 1. 8 Mb locus. To better understand rDNA silent chromatin, sixteen yeast strains, each with a single Pol II-transcribed HIS 3 reporter gene in a different rDNA repeat unit, were analyzed to compare silent chromatin in individual rDNA repeats across the rDNA array. Experiments comparing the level of HIS 3 mRNA {{and the rate of}} recombination at the rDNA revealed that chromatin within individual rDNA repeats does not equally silence Pol II transcription and recombination. Repeat-specific variation in the strength of silent chromatin is called rDNA Position Effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the association of Sir 2, a protein required for silent chromatin, varies at the HIS 3 promoter; more Sir 2 is associated with more silent rDNA repeats. The mechanism by which the association of Sir 2 varies has not yet been identified. Until now, rDNA silent chromatin was assumed to be uniform across the rDNA array; the discovery of rDNA Position Effect alters this basic understanding and indicates rDNA silent chromatin is dynamic. For further insight, a Tet-Off system is being developed to control the expression of Sir 2. Depleting Sir 2 by the addition of doxycycline to growth media compromises rDNA silent chromatin; removal of doxycycline allows for Sir 2 to accumulate and rDNA silent chromatin to re-establish. Once optimized, this Tet-Off system will be used in experiments to investigate the establishment of rDNA silent chromatin in a single rDNA repeat unit by controlling the level of Sir 2 in the cell.
