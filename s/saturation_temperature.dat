25|$|Pressure in {{the primary}} circuit is {{maintained}} by a pressurizer, a separate vessel that {{is connected to the}} primary circuit and partially filled with water which is heated to the <b>saturation</b> <b>temperature</b> (boiling point) for the desired pressure by submerged electrical heaters. To achieve a pressure of , the pressurizer temperature is maintained at 345°C (653°F), which gives a subcooling margin (the difference between the pressurizer temperature and the highest temperature in the reactor core) of 30°C (54°F). As 345°C is the boiling point of water at 155 bar, the liquid water is {{at the edge of a}} phase change. Thermal transients in the reactor coolant system result in large swings in pressurizer liquid/steam volume, and total pressurizer volume is designed around absorbing these transients without uncovering the heaters or emptying the pressurizer. Pressure transients {{in the primary}} coolant system manifest as temperature transients in the pressurizer and are controlled through the use of automatic heaters and water spray, which raise and lower pressurizer temperature, respectively.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the metastable zone width of aqueous solutions of glycine for non-seeded batch crystallizations. The saturation curve was determined by studying the heating rate influence on the apparent <b>saturation</b> <b>temperatures</b> of several solutions. A linear regression was then applied to obtain the <b>saturation</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The spontaneous nucleation curve was obtained by measuring the crystallization temperatures of several solutions at different cooling rates. The results show that the apparent nucleation order of the glycine aqueous solutions was around 3. 5 ± 0. 5. Moreover, from the experimental data, a second-order polynomial model was established by using the experimental design method. This model enables the expression of crystallization temperature to be defined as a function of concentration and cooling rate. The results show that the model fits well (R 2 > 0. 99; Q 2 > 0. 98) and that the cooling rate is the most influential parameter...|$|R

2500|$|If {{the coolant}} {{temperature}} {{is too close}} to its boiling point, cavitation can occur in the pumps and their operation can become erratic or even stop entirely. The feedwater temperature is dependent on the steam production; the steam phase portion is led to the turbines and condensers and returns significantly cooler (...) than the water returning directly from the steam separator (284°C). At low reactor power, therefore, the inlet temperature may become dangerously high. The water is kept below the <b>saturation</b> <b>temperature</b> to prevent film boiling and the associated drop in heat transfer rate.|$|E
