5000|$|A virtual <b>security</b> <b>switch</b> is a {{software}} Ethernet switch with embedded security controls within it that runs within virtual environments such as VMware vSphere, Citrix XenDesktop, Microsoft Hyper-V and Virtual Iron.

50|$|This {{concept of}} a virtual network {{introduced}} a number of problems, as it related to security within virtual environment, due to only having virtual switching technology within the environment and not security technologies. Unlike physical networks that have switches with access control lists (ACLs), firewalls, antivirus gateways, or intrusion prevention devices, the virtual network was wide open. The virtual <b>security</b> <b>switch</b> concept is one where switching and security have joined forces, so that security controls could be placed within the virtual switch and provide per-port inspection and isolation within the virtual environment. This concept allowed security to get {{as close as possible}} to the end points that it intends to protect, without having to reside on the end points (host-based on virtual machines) themselves.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{regulation}} of C-function genes controlling reproductive organ {{identity in the}} centre of the flower can be achieved by adjusting the level of their expression within the genuine central expression domain in Antirrhinum and Petunia. Loss of this control in mutants is revealed by enhanced C-gene expression in the centre and by lateral expansion of the C-domain. In order to test whether the level of central C-gene expression and hence the principle of ‘regulation by tuning’ also applies to spatial {{regulation of}} the C-function gene AGAMOUS (AG) in Arabidopsis, we generated transgenic plants with enhanced central AG expression by using stem cell-specific CLAVATA 3 (CLV 3) regulatory sequences to drive transcription of the AG cDNA. The youngest terminal flowers on inflorescences of CLV 3 ::AG plants displayed homeotic features in their outer whorls indicating ectopic AG expression. Dependence of the homeotic feature on the age of the plant is attributed to the known overall weakening of repressive mechanisms controlling AG. Monitoring AG with an AG-I::GUS reporter construct suggests ectopic AG expression in CLV 3 ::AG flowers when AG in the inflorescence is still repressed, although in terminating inflorescence meristems, AG expression expands to all tissues. Supported by genetic tests, we conclude that upon enhanced central AG expression, the C-domain laterally expands necessitating tuning of the expression level of C-function genes in the wild type. The tuning mechanism in C-gene regulation in Arabidopsis is discussed as a late <b>security</b> <b>switch</b> that ensures wild-type C-domain control when other repressive mechanism starts to fade and fail...|$|E
40|$|I {{worked with}} some of the most {{prominent}} British scientists in the field of holography to develop and establish a holographic-based encryption standard for CDs, DVDs and other electronic publishing devices which are currently the target of large scale organised piracy. It has successfully resulted in the actual and proposed filings of several British and European patents covering the application of the holographic technology to the watermarking and digital copy-protection of data storage devices. My innovation relates to digital versatile discs and in particular a holographic switch that acts as analogue signal within the digital content. My innovation is the creation of an analogue hologram on the surface of a compact disc. The hologram provides information that will be unique to the disc in question and to its originator, thus providing a <b>security</b> <b>switch</b> to identify the disc as a genuine product. The major benefits of this revolutionary digital disc protection process are essentially three-fold: •	Illegal copies of CDs and DVDs can be spotted at a glance (literally), •	The holographic-switch technology deployed in new players will prevent the disc from being copied OR can serve to limit the numbers of copies made from each original •	The process is extremely cost-efficient as no additional manipulation to existing mass-stamping processes is required once the master disc has been created. The project was one of only 4 runners-up on EPSRC 2003 / 04 Research Council’s Business Plan Competition from an entry application of over 800, and was awarded £ 10, 000 by Lord Sainsbury for its further development.

40|$|Aiming at the {{security}} requirement of the Intranet {{that is different from}} Internet, an security architecture for Intranet is proposed. In physical layer and data link layer, based on network switch the intranet is divided into several parts separated from each other as required. In network layer, making use of the NAT gateway integrated in virtual server the intranet or its part is hidden to ensure its security, {{and at the same time}} the other part of the intranet can securely access to the part of hidden resources. Using reliable IP address management and distribution mechanism the IP addresses are kept from being stolen or abused. In application layer, using bi-directional proxy server each part of the Intranet is separated, but the hosts can access each other based on application and user authority. The <b>security</b> <b>switches</b> are used to connect each separate part of the Intranet, based on application as well as user authorization control to carry out network access control.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} a {{two-phase}} underlay cog-nitive relay network, where there exists an eavesdropper who can overhear the message. The {{secure data transmission}} from the secondary source to secondary destination is assisted by two decode-and-forward (DF) relays. Although the traditional opportunistic relaying technique can choose one relay {{to provide the best}} secure performance, it needs to continuously have the channel state information (CSI) of both relays, and may result in a high relay switching rate. To overcome these limitations, a secure switch-and-stay combining (SSSC) protocol is proposed where only one out of the two relays is activated to assist the secure data transmission, and the secure relay switching occurs when the relay cannot support the secure communication any longer. This <b>security</b> <b>switching</b> is assisted by either instantaneous or statistical eavesdropping CSI. For these two cases, we study the system secure performance of SSSC protocol, by deriving the analytical secrecy outage probability as well as an asymptotic expression for the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER) region. We show that SSSC can substantially reduce the system com-plexity while achieving or approaching the full diversity order of opportunistic relaying {{in the presence of the}} instantaneous or statistical eavesdropping CSI.

40|$|Recent strong {{population}} growth in Australian cities has drawn attention {{to a range of}} national transport, and transport-related, sustainability issues. Key areas of national sustainability concern in relation to urban land transport include traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, road fatalities and serious injury accidents, social exclusion associated with poor mobility options and the risks that are associated with Australia’s high reliance on fossil fuels for transport. Effectively tackling these national concerns requires an integrated policy and program focus on desired outcomes in each of the critical problem areas. The national dimension demands federal leadership and a number of recent initiatives are promising in this regard (for example, Infrastructure Australia processes, the Council of Australian Governments’ Capital City Strategic Planning initiative, and high speed broadband). Sustainable solutions will require concerted action over a number of years, with a clear focus on intended outcome goals for congestion, GHG emissions, safety and health, social inclusion and energy <b>security.</b> <b>Switching</b> funding programs from a modal focus to an outcome focus should assist progress. In addition to targeted transport infrastructure investment, significant initiatives will be needed in areas such as urban settlement policies and programs, road pricing reform, travel behaviour change programs and better management of freight movements. Federal leadership can play an important catalytic role in helping to drive change towards sustainability, across areas that include investment funding support, integrating policy and program frameworks, reforming pricing and planning systems and stimulating research and development. ________ Professor John Stanley is an Adjunct Professor in the Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies at The University of Sydney...|$|R
