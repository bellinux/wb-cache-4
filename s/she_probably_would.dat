5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E
25|$|After {{snapping}} the photograph, Ut took Kim Phúc and {{the other}} injured children to Barsky Hospital in Saigon, where {{it was determined that}} her burns were so severe that <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not survive. After a 14-month hospital stay and 17 surgical procedures including skin transplantations, however, she was able to return home. A number of the early operations were performed by Finnish plastic surgeon Aarne Rintala (1926–2014).|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether Kiya ever used the rich funerary equipment that was prepared against her death. If her disappearance resulted from disgrace or exile, {{the answer would}} be no. On the other hand, if she died in good standing with Akhenaten, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have received a lavish burial appropriate to her station. In the latter case, a likely site for her interment would be the Amarna Royal Tomb, which includes a suite of three chambers evidently used to house female members of Akhenaten's family. At least two and possibly as many as three different individuals were interred in this suite, including Akhenaten's daughter Meketaten, the only one whose name survives. Two of the chambers originally included painted plaster reliefs depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti, certain of their daughters, and other mourners lamenting the deceased. Some Egyptologists have suggested that one of these scenes of mourning refers to Kiya, although no specific evidence supports this claim.|$|E

25|$|The third White Rose {{trial was}} {{scheduled}} for 20 April 1943, Hitler's birthday, which was a public holiday in Nazi Germany. Judge Freisler had intended to issue death sentences against Wilhelm Geyer, Harald Dohrn, Josef Söhngen and Manfred Eickemeyer. Because {{he did not want}} to issue too many death sentences in a single trial, he therefore wanted to postpone his judgment against those four until the next day. However, the evidence against them was lost, and the trial finally took place on 13 July 1943. In that trial, Gisela Schertling—who had betrayed most of the friends, even fringe members like Gerhard Feuerle—changed her mind and recanted her testimony against all of them. Since Freisler did not preside over the third trial, the judge acquitted for lack of evidence all but Söhngen, who was sentenced to a six months' term in prison. After her acquittal on 19 April, Traute Lafrenz was placed under arrest again. She spent the last year of the war in prison. Trials kept being postponed and moved to different locations because of Allied air raids. Her trial was finally set for April 1945, after which <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been executed. Three days before the trial, however, the Allies liberated the town where she was held prisoner, thereby saving her life.|$|E

500|$|After the song's release, {{the phrase}} [...] "material girl" [...] became another {{nickname}} for Madonna. She often remarked that [...] "Material Girl" [...] is the song she most regrets recording, {{as it became}} a label that has been attached to her for decades. She also said if she had known this, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> never have recorded it. After making the video, Madonna said she {{never wanted to be}} compared to Monroe, despite posing as the Hollywood icon and recreating many of Marilyn's signature poses for various photos shoots, most notably a 1991 issue of Vanity Fair. Reflecting on the song, Madonna told author J. Randy Taraborrelli: ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2013, Bush was in {{attendance}} {{at a news}} conference, where she said the recently built George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum was not a monument for her husband but instead {{a representation of the}} White House and the struggles of America during his tenure. She also mentioned not having trouble donating clothes to the library, admitting that <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have never worn them again in the first place. That month it was announced that she would serve as a keynote speaker for the 2013 Global Business Travel Association Convention in August. At the convention, she stressed the importance of child literacy, continuing her advocating of an issue that she had become associated with since her tenure as First Lady. In early August 2013, she reported that her husband was in stable condition after having a stent implanted in his heart, calling it [...] "terrific" [...] that it was caught in time, and stressed the importance of regular check ups with doctors. In September, she appeared at a fundraiser for the organization Solutions for Change.|$|E
2500|$|Blavatsky's Theosophy {{has been}} {{described}} as representing [...] "a major factor in the modern revival" [...] of Western esotericism. Godwin deemed there to be [...] "no more important figure in modern times" [...] within the Western esoteric tradition than Blavatsky. For Johnson, Blavatsky was [...] "a central figure in the nineteenth-century occult revival". Lachman claimed that [...] "practically all modern occultism and esotericism" [...] can trace its origins back to her influence. [...] Blavatsky's published Theosophical ideas, particularly those regarding Root Races, have been cited as an influence on Ariosophy, the esoteric movement established in late 19th- and early 20th-century Germany and Austria by Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels. Hannah Newman stated that via Ariosophy, Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas [...] "contributed to Nazi ideology". Nevertheless, Lachman has asserted that Blavatsky should not be held accountable to any of the antisemitic and racist ideas that the Ariosophists promoted, commenting that were she alive to witness the development of Ariosophy <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have denounced its ideas regarding race. Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas regarding Root Races have also been cited as an influence on Anthroposophy, the esoteric movement developed by Rudolf Steiner in early 20th-century Germany, with Steiner's Anthroposophical Society being termed a [...] "historical offshoot" [...] of the Theosophical Society.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s before her death, Washington {{occasionally}} {{performed on the}} Las Vegas Strip. Tony Bennett said of Washington during a recording session with Amy Winehouse: [...] "She {{was a good friend}} of mine, you know. She was great. She used to just come in with two suitcases in Vegas without being booked. And she'd just come in and put the suitcases down. And she'd say [...] "I'm here, boss". And she'd stay as long as she wanted. And all the kids in all the shows on the Strip would come that night. They'd hear that she's in town and it would be packed just for her performance". According to Richard S. Ginell at AllMusic: [...] " [...] was at once one of the most beloved and controversial singers of the mid-20th century – beloved to her fans, devotees, and fellow singers; controversial to critics who still accuse her of selling out her art to commerce and bad taste. Her principal sin, apparently, was to cultivate a distinctive vocal style that was at home in all kinds of music, be it R, blues, jazz, middle of the road pop – and <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have made a fine gospel or country singer had she the time. Hers was a gritty, salty, high-pitched voice, marked by absolute clarity of diction and clipped, bluesy phrasing..." ...|$|E

You might show her what violence would be done in such association to her duties and principles, and you might preserve her for a better fate. You might point out to her that <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would,</b> in good time, find a husband at Chesney Wold by whom she would not be--" [...] Sir Leicester adds, after a moment's consideration, [...] "dragged from the altars of her forefathers." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{went up to}} the house, keeping {{within the}} shrubbery, and went round it, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows. Most of them were open, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights yet, and all was silent. She tried the garden with no better effect. She thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long grass and briers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the {{creeping}} things that be. With her dark eyes and her hook nose warily in advance of her, Mrs. Sparsit softly crushed her way through the thick undergrowth, so intent upon her object that <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have done no less, if the wood had been a wood of adders.|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} {{somewhat}} natural misgivings, the next afternoon, that Nasmyth strolled forward along the Tillicum's deck toward {{the place where}} Mrs. Acton was sitting. Immaculately dressed, as usual, she reclined in a canvas chair with a book, which she had been reading, upon her knee. As Nasmyth approached her he became conscious that she was watching him with a curious expression in her keen, dark eyes. The steamer had dropped anchor in a little land-locked bay, and Nasmyth had just {{come back in the}} dinghy, after rowing {{one or two of the}} party ashore. Mrs. Acton indicated with a movement of her hand that he might sit upon the steamer's rail, and then, turning towards him, looked at him steadily. She was a woman of commanding personality, and imperiously managed her husband's social affairs. If he had permitted it, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have undertaken, also, to look after his commercial interests.|$|E

60|$|But Melmotte {{knew that}} his {{daughter}} would not believe him on such a subject. This girl <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> believe. And though Melmotte himself {{found it difficult to}} trust anybody, he thought that there was more possible good than evil to be expected from the proposed interview. 'Oh, you shall see her,' he said. 'I don't suppose she's such a fool as to try that kind of thing again.' Then the door in Bruton Street was opened, and Hetta, repenting her mission, found herself almost pushed into the hall. She was bidden to follow Melmotte upstairs, and was left alone in the drawing-room, as she thought, for a long time. Then the door was slowly opened and Marie crept into the room. 'Miss Carbury,' she said, 'this is so good of you,--so good of you! I do so love you for coming to me! You said you would love me. You will; will you not?' and Marie, sitting down by the stranger, took her hand and encircled her waist.|$|E
6000|$|In a {{neighbouring}} box Cicely Yeovil {{presided over}} a large and lively party, which of course included Ronnie Storre, who was for once {{in a way in}} a chattering mood, and also included an American dowager, who had never been known to be in anything else. A tone of literary distinction was imparted to the group by the presence of Augusta Smith, better known under her pen-name of Rhapsodic Pantril, author of a play that had had a limited but well-advertised success in Sheffield and the United States of America, author also of a book of reminiscences, entitled [...] "Things I Cannot Forget." [...] She had beautiful eyes, a knowledge of how to dress, and a pleasant disposition, cankered just a little by a perpetual dread of the non-recognition of her genius. As the woman, Augusta Smith, <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have been unreservedly happy; as the super-woman, Rhapsodic Pantril, she lived within the border-line of discontent. Her most ordinary remarks were framed with the view of arresting attention; some one once said of her that she ordered a sack of potatoes with the air of one who is making enquiry for a love-philtre.|$|E
6000|$|These manners did not please Catherine; {{but he was}} James's {{friend and}} Isabella's brother; and her {{judgment}} was further bought off by Isabella's assuring her, when they withdrew {{to see the new}} hat, that John thought her the most charming girl in the world, and by John's engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening. Had she been older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where youth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the consequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with the Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen's, and James, as the door was closed on them, said, [...] "Well, Catherine, how do you like my friend Thorpe?" [...] instead of answering, as <b>she</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have done, had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, [...] "I do not like him at all," [...] she directly replied, [...] "I like him very much; he seems very agreeable." ...|$|E
