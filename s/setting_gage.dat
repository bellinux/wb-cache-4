40|$|Abstract Background Gene set {{analysis}} (GSA) is {{a widely}} used strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge. GSA focuses on sets of related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological relevance. However, previous GSA methods have limited usage as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs. Results To address these limitations, we present a new GSA method called Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE). We successfully apply GAGE to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques. GAGE shows significantly better results when compared to two other commonly used GSA methods of GSEA and PAGE. We demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3) biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred. GAGE reveals novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data <b>sets,</b> <b>GAGE</b> derived a more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished BMP 6 study, GAGE predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for BMP 6 induced osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical BMP-TGF beta signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways–all of which are supported by the experimental literature. Conclusion GAGE is generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes and experimental designs. GAGE consistently outperformed two most frequently used GSA methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant regulatory pathways. The GAGE method is implemented in R in the "gage" package, available under the GNU GPL from [URL]. </p...|$|R

A special test rig was designed and manufactured for this objective. A <b>set</b> of strain <b>gages</b> were bonded to the shaft and to the blades to measure the shaft twisting and blade bending deformations respectively. A controlled frequency exciter excited the blade vibration. The shaft torsional and blade bending vibration signals were simultaneously recorded and presented in the time and frequency domains. The blade bending vibration frequencies appeared dominantly in the shaft torsional vibration signals for all blade vibration frequencies up to 100 Hz. For frequencies higher than 100 Hz, less sensitivity of the torsional vibration to blade vibration was observed...|$|R
40|$|A wind {{velocity}} measurement system employs two different principles of physics to measure wind speed: (1) the aerodynamic force imparted {{to a low}} profile, rigidly mounted cylindrical rod, and (2) the vibrating frequency of the rod as vortices are shed from the rod's cylindrical surface. A <b>set</b> of strain <b>gages</b> {{is used as a}} common sensor for both measurements, and these provide force measurements imparted by the wind on the rod. The signals generated by the strain gages are fed to processing circuitry that calculates the wind speed and direction from the signals. The force measurement is proportional to the square of the wind speed. Since it is a vector quantity, it {{can also be used to}} derive wind direction. The vortex shedding frequency is a scalar quantity and is linearly proportional to wind speed. This frequency can be calculated by analyzing the force measurements generated by the strain gages over time. Both of the {{wind velocity}} calculations can be advantageously used by the processing circuitry to generate an accurate wind velocity reading...|$|R
40|$|This {{report will}} provide a review of efforts to {{establish}} a <b>set</b> of strain <b>gage</b> selection guidelines for textile reinforced composite materials. A variety of strain gages were evaluated in the study to determine the sensitivity of strain measurements {{to the size of}} the strain gage. The strain gages were chosen to provide a range of gage lengths and widths. The gage aspect ratio (the length-to-width ratio) was also varied. The gages were tested on a diverse collection of textile composite laminates. Test specimens featured eleven different textile architectures: four 2 -D triaxial braids, six 3 -D weaves, and one stitched uniweave architecture. All specimens were loaded in uniaxial tension. The materials' moduli were measured in both the longitudinal (parallel to the O deg. yarns) and the transverse (perpendicular to the O deg. yarns) directions. The results of these measurements were analyzed to establish performance levels for extensometers and strain gages on textile composite materials. Conclusions are expressed in a summary that discusses instrumentation practices and defines strain gage selection criteria...|$|R
40|$|There are {{situations}} {{that require the}} determination of loads being transmitted to a structure. It is not always possible to insert a load cell, so it is proposed that the structure itself and a <b>set</b> of strain <b>gages</b> {{be used to determine}} each of the applied loads (forces and moments) that caused the measured strains. In essence, the structure has become a transducer;Although a set of loads will uniquely deform a structure, the measurements can only be made at a finite number of points.

Scope and limitations of the technique are discussed along with the associated error estimates. The penultimate chapter describes an actual experiment performed in the laboratory to confirm the theoretical developments described in the first three chapters. Important conclusions are drawn in the last chapter, which also points to future developments anticipated by the author...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{structural}} loads are measured using strain gages. A loads calibration test {{must be done}} before loads can be accurately measured. In one measurement method, a series of point loads {{is applied to the}} structure, and loads equations are derived via the least squares curve fitting algorithm using the strain gage responses to the applied point loads. However, many research structures are highly instrumented with strain gages, and the number and selection of gages used in a loads equation can be problematic. This paper presents an improved technique using a genetic algorithm to choose the strain gages used in the loads equations. Also presented are a comparison of the genetic algorithm performance with the current T-value technique and a variant known as the Best Step-down technique. Examples are shown using aerospace vehicle wings of high and low aspect ratio. In addition, a significant limitation in the current methods is revealed.

Periodic updating of these analyses and maps is essential when additional data and new technologies become available. The objective {{of this study is}} to update the existing rainfall {{frequency analysis}} by using up-to-date data and detailed analysis, and to prepare maps showing contours of rainfall depths (isohyetal maps) for selected durations and return periods. The South Florida Water Management District collects and archives rainfall data from various rain gages.

Unfortunately, the real time measurement of physical quantities in propellers 2 ̆ 7 tests is a great challenge because of several intrinsic setups 2 ̆ 7 complications due to submersed and rotating parts, restricted space for sensors and acquisition systems as well as data storage and transmission.

Statistical distributions of 24 -hr motion and of the intensity of the depression, the relation between 24 -hr motion and concurrent 24 -hr rainfall, and the relation between the intensity of the depression and subsequent 24 -hr rainfall are examined. In addition, the average rainfall per depression day and its standard deviation, the contribution of depression rainfall to the total rainfall, and the efficiency of the depression as a rain giver are computed. Mean patterns of 24 -hr rainfall within 500 km of the center of the depression along longitudes 87 'E, 80 °E, and 75 'E are obtained, and the main points of difference between them are discussed. In the quadrants {{to the right of the}} depression track, the rainfall field is flat. In the quadrants to the left, however, large gradients of rainfall exist, particularly along and west of 80 °E; the maximum rainfall is located in the left front quadrant, about 150 km from the center and 50 - 150 km from the depression track. Heavy rainfall extends about 250 km from the depression track in the left sector. Reasons for maximum rainfall in the left front quadrant were sought. We examined statistical distributions of 24 -hr rainfall in the four quadrants of depression along the three longitudes and found that the gamma probability model gives a good fit to 24 -hr rainfall in each of the four quadrants of depression. Using the gamma model, we computed probabilities of rainfall of different intensities in the four quadrants. In this study, orography within the sector is kept constant by considering the rainfall from the same <b>set</b> of rain <b>gage</b> stations along each of the three longitudes. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of the {{research}} deals with the estimation of extreme rainfalls for locations where rainfall records are sufficiently available (gaged sites); the second part is concerned with cases where rainfall data are limited (partially-gaged sites); and finally the third part involves the most complex situation where rainfall data are unavailable (ungaged sites). For gaged sites, two methods were developed for estimating the annual extreme (AE) rainfalls based on the simple scaling behaviour of the first three non-central moments (NCMs) of the AE rainfall processes and using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution as the parent distribution. The first estimation method was called one-moment (OM) method since it only relied on the first-order NCM of AE rainfall series in the computation of the rainfall quantiles, while the second method was called three-moment (TM) procedure since it used all first three NCMs of AE rainfalls in the estimation of the quantiles. For partially-gaged and ungaged sites, a new approach to defining rainfall homogeneous regions has been proposed based on the similarity of rainfall occurrences at different raingage stations. In addition, a Principal Component Analysis technique was used to assess the similarity of raingages and to delineate homogeneous regions. On the basis of the proposed method for identifying rainfall homogeneous regions, two new methods (PG- 1 and PG- 2) were developed for estimating annual maximum (AM) rainfalls at partially gauged sites. These methods were also based on the scaling properties of AM rainfall series for different durations. For ungaged sites, three methods (UG- 1, UG- 2, and NR) were proposed for estimating AM rainfalls. Method UG- 1 was based on the NCMs of AM rainfalls at an ungaged site that were computed by direct interpolation of the corresponding NCM values from the gaged sites within the same homogeneous region. Method UG- 2 used the pooled data <b>set</b> from all <b>gaged</b> sites in the homogeneous region for this computation. On the other hand, the NR method estimated the NCMs of AM rainfalls for an ungaged site using the regional regression between the first three NCMs and the number of rainfall occurrence (NR) values that were interpolated from the NR values of the gaged sites. Finally, to assess the uncertainty of extreme rainfall estimates, two new methods (CI- 1 and CI- 2) were developed for computing the confidence limits (CLs) based on these estimated values. The proposed methods were based on the bootstrap technique and the scaling properties of the NCMs of extreme rainfall series...|$|R
40|$|A {{dense network}} of rain <b>gages,</b> <b>set</b> {{up in the}} Upper Oueme Valley in Benin is used to study the spatial {{organization}} and the kinematics of the convective systems that cross the region. The study area is situated under Soudanian climate and set up {{as part of the}} AMMA-CATCH (African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis - Couplage de l'Atmosphere Tropicale et du Cycle Hydrologique) observing system. Previous works focusing on the rainy events that occur in the Sahelian region of Niamey have shown that most of the rainfall in that region is provided by Organized Convective System that cover several thousand km(2) and usually propagate with a strong westward component. It was shown also that the time evolution of these Sahelian rainy events usually exhibits a convective peak followed by longer lasting and weaker stratiform rainfall. The aim of the present study is to analyze the spatial organization and kinematics of the rainy events occurring further south under the distinct, much more humid, Soudanian climate. These events have been poorly documented so far {{and the extent to which}} the Soudanian rainfall events behave like their Sahelian counterparts remains unclear. Seven years of rainfall data gathered over the AMMA-CATCH Benin site are studied. A new method called the 'Average Synchronized Hyetograph' (ASH) is proposed to analyze the kinematics of the rain patterns. The method also allows the assessment of the spatial organization of the system. A classification of the rainy events is proposed. It is based on assessing if (i) the rain patterns show a global propagation velocity and direction and (ii) if the time evolution of the rain rate within the network is typical of organized tropical Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) with a well-defined convective peak. The present study shows that about 55 % of the events have a signature typical of those of MCS. Conversely, about 27 % of rainfall events do not show evidence of being associated with MCS or even propagating. The kinematic properties of the events classified as MCS appear to be globally consistent with what was observed for the Sahelian zone from satellite tracking; the dominant direction is south-southwest but with a large departure from this average trend; their velocity ranges mostly between 20 and 50 km/h but a significant number of events are faster than that. MCS remains the dominant type of events during the whole rainy season but the period between mid July and mid August. The classification of rainfall events resulting from ground tracking has been compared with METEOSAT satellite tracking for the years 2003 and 2004. There is a significant correspondence of classes of rainfall events between the two tracking methods despite differences of scales and criterions in their definition...|$|R
40|$|L-shaped six {{component}} {{force transducer}} {{was developed to}} measure six component forces {{on the basis of}} bending strains being interfered with the components. The component transducer has three sections for measuring. Two bending strains at each section are measured independently in axial directions. 　To continue, it is necessary to define the general theme; The bending strain {{on each side of the}} beam consists of three portions. It is expressed by a equation summing these portions. Each portion is the strain that is brought about by a moment with a coefficient of sensitivity in each axial direction. Consequently, the one equation is concerned in three coefficients. When the measured strains are equal to the compound strains in consideration of interference, six equations bring about six component forces. They will be obtained by a solution of these equations. Then,it is most important that calibration is performed with accuracy as to the coefficients of sensitivity. There are two methods in calibration. One of them is linear regression that is used to determine the coefficients on the basis of relation of the strain and moment. The other is multiple regression. It depends on relation of the strain and two or three moments. We obtained 18 coefficients of sensitivity by both methods, and investigated the coefficients to compare the two cases. On the other hand, the known forces can be restored to the original state by the calculation using equations with coefficients. So, we explored restorable possibilty as to six known forces in three axial directions. The following matters were made clear as a result. 1. Main coefficient of sensitivity is nearly equal to 1 /EZ among three coefficients in each equation, and the difference to the calculated values is 5. 5 %. E: modulus of elasticity, Z: section modulus. 2. The values of coefficients on interfering strains among three portions are 3. 7 % of the main on an average. It becomes clear that twisting moment on L-shaped beam interferes remarkably in bending strains of measuring section 3 in comparison with other sections. Preceding ratios to the main are at most 7 %. 3. There is a shade of difference between coefficients by linear regression and ones by multiple regression without α₁α₆. 4. We librated the three known forces in each axial direction at the point being apart from L-shaped beam end. Then, we calculated to reconstruct these forces on the basis of measured bending strains and simultaneous equation. The average of error in unit load is 5. 3 % on all reconstructions with both methods. In these cases, the reconstructions depending on coefficients by multiple regression are better than ones of linear regression. Its difference is about 0. 8 % on an average. 5. The reconstruction of moments is more difficult than that of axial forces. The difference of error is about 1 %. 6. The measuring limit is about 300 kgf on this transducer, and we can obtain six component forces under 5 - 7 % error as to accurate values. It will be better for the user to attach this transducer to measuring apparatus in consideration of the axial directions. It will be selected on the basis of greater flexural rigidity to estimated large force. Then, main specifications are as follows: Cross section of the beam is 70 × 31 mm. Material is SS 41 P. Approximate dimension is 530 × 388 mm. Distance of <b>gage</b> <b>setting</b> is 100 mm and 150 mm...|$|R
