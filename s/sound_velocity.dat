Since temperature and <b>sound</b> <b>velocity</b> normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.|$|E

25|$|In general {{there are}} two ways to set up a {{transducer}} system to measure the <b>sound</b> <b>velocity</b> in a solid. One is a setup with two or more transducers where one is acting as a transmitter, while the other(s) is acting as a receiver. The <b>sound</b> <b>velocity</b> measurement can then be done by measuring the time between a signal is generated at the transmitter and when it is recorded at the receiver while assuming to know (or measure) the distance the acoustic signal have traveled between the transducers, or conversely to measure the resonance frequency knowing the thickness over which the wave resonate. The other type of setup is often called a pulse-echo system. Here one transducer is placed in the vicinity of the specimen acting both as transmitter and receiver. This requires a reflective interface where the generated signal can be reflected back toward the transducer which then act as a receiver recording the reflected signal. See ultrasonic testing for some measurement systems.|$|E
25|$|Note that in {{this example}} we have assumed that {{temperature}} is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see heat capacity). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas gives the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and <b>sound</b> <b>velocity.</b> Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase {{the difference between the}} speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.|$|E

According to linear response theory, the Fourier transform of K or G describes how the system returns to equilibrium after an external perturbation; for this reason, the dispersion step in the GHz..THz region is also called structural relaxation. According to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, relaxation towards equilibrium is intimately connected to fluctuations in equilibrium. The density fluctuations associated with sound waves can be experimentally observed by Brillouin scattering.|$|E

2500|$|The acoustoelastic effect {{describes}} how the <b>sound</b> <b>velocities</b> (both longitudinal and shear wave velocities) of an elastic material change if subjected to an initial static stress field. This is a non-linear effect of the constitutive relation between mechanical stress and finite strain in a material of continuous mass. In classical linear elasticity theory small deformations of most elastic materials can be described by a linear relation between the applied stress and the resulting strain. This relationship {{is commonly known as}} the generalised Hooke's law. The linear elastic theory involves second order elastic constants (e.g. [...] and [...] ) and yields constant longitudinal and shear <b>sound</b> <b>velocities</b> in an elastic material, not affected by an applied stress. The acoustoelastic effect on the other hand include higher order expansion of the constitutive relation (non-linear elasticity theory) between the applied stress and resulting strain, which yields longitudinal and shear <b>sound</b> <b>velocities</b> dependent of the stress state of the material. In the limit of an unstressed material the <b>sound</b> <b>velocities</b> of the linear elastic theory are reproduced.|$|R

A different study predicts 0.08–0.16% (weight) hydrogen in the inner core, while others proposed from 50% to 95% FeH (by mole count) If the core has this much hydrogen it would amount to ten times as much as in the oceans.|$|E

The compression behavior of titanium disulfide is anisotropic. The axis parallel to S-Ti-S layers (c-axis) is more compressible than the axis perpendicular to S-Ti-S layers (a-axis) because of weak van der waals forces keeping S and Ti atoms together.

2500|$|As {{explained}} above, a set {{of three}} orthonormal polarizations (...) of the particle motion exist for a given propagation direction [...] in a solid. For measurement setups where the transducers can be fixated directly to the sample under investigation {{it is possible to}} create these three polarizations (one longitudinal, and two orthogonal transverse waves) by applying different types of transducers exciting the desired polarization (e.g. piezoelectric transducers with the needed oscillation mode). Thus it is possible to measure the <b>sound</b> <b>velocity</b> of waves with all three polarizations through either time dependent or frequency dependent measurement setups depending on the selection of transducer types. However, if the transducer can not be fixated to the test specimen a coupling medium is needed to transmit the acoustic energy from the transducer to the specimen. Water or gels are often used as this coupling medium. For measurement of the longitudinal <b>sound</b> <b>velocity</b> this is sufficient, however fluids do not carry shear waves, and thus to be able to generate and measure the velocity of shear waves in the test specimen the incident longitudinal wave must interact at an oblique angle at the fluid/solid surface to generate shear waves through mode conversion.
