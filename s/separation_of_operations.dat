50|$|In {{this chapter}} Braverman {{addresses}} {{the division of}} labor and compares the social division of labor with the form {{the division of labor}} has taken under capitalism. Braverman points out that the division of labor in capitalist industry {{is not the same as}} the division of labor that arises in society naturally, which is known as the social division of labor. He asserts the latter is the division of work into productive specialties, while the former is merely the systematic subdivision of work into limited operations. He asserts that the social division of labor is far more common throughout human history than the capitalist division of labor. “The division of labor in society is characteristic of all known societies; the division of labor in the workshop is the special product of capitalist society.” Braverman also points out the negative aspects of the capitalist division of labor: “While the social division of labor subdivides society, the detailed division of labor subdivides humans, and while the subdivision of society may enhance the individual and the species, the subdivision of the individual, when carried on without regard to human capabilities and needs, is a crime against the person and against humanity.” Braverman acknowledges something known as the Babbage Principle, and the role it has played in the capitalist division of labor. The capitalist division of labor is driven in large part by the Babbage principle. According to Charles Babbage, “The greatest saving is embodied in the analysis of the process, and a further saving, the extent varying with the nature of the process, is to be found in the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> among different workers.” Braverman quotes Babbage again by writing: “… The master manufacturer, by dividing the work to be executed into different processes, each requiring different degrees of skill or of force, can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process; whereas, if the whole work were executed by one workman, that person must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult, and sufficient strength to execute the most laborious, of the operations into which the art is divided.” In other words, by dividing the production process into multiple different tasks, the capitalist pays for exactly the amount of skill he or she needs.|$|E

40|$|It {{is about}} 20 {{years since the}} rail reform process in Europe began with the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> {{infrastructure}} from <b>operations</b> in Sweden. This paper reviews the entire process, examining the objectives of reform, the different models adopted, and the key elements <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure from <b>operations,</b> competition both through open access and franchising and regulation and infrastructure charging. It is concluded that <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure from <b>operations</b> involves costs, but {{is the most effective}} way of achieving within mode competition. Where operations do not greatly overlap and open access passenger and freight are unimportant, leasing infrastructure to passenger franchisees may be effective, but the model of vertical integration as separate subsidiaries within a holding company structure makes it difficult to ensure a level playing field for new entrants and is only effective where the vertically integrated operator remains dominant. ...|$|R
40|$|The report {{focuses on}} the {{establishment}} of the Red River Basin Organization (RRBO) in Vietnam, but expands its analysis to the wider transformations of the water sector that impinge on the formation and effectiveness of this organization. A few reflections on the policy process are drawn from this analysis, albeit in a tentative form given the relatively limited period of time considered here. The report shows that the promotion of IWRM icons such as RBOs by donors has been quite disconnected from the existing institutional framework. However, the establishment of RBOs might eventually strengthen a better <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and regulation roles. Institutional change is shown to result from the interaction between endogenous processes and external pressures, in ways that are barely predictable...|$|R

Pixel-level operations are acceler-ated by coprocessors, whereas high level application code is implemented fully programmable on standard PowerPC CPU cores to allow flexibility for new algorithms. In addi-tion, the application code is able to dynamically reconfig-ure the coprocessors available on the system, allowing for a much larger set of hardware accelerated functionality than would normally fit onto a device. This process makes use of the partial dynamic reconfiguration capabilities of Xilinx Virtex FPGAs. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2004 Estonia {{joined the}} European union - for rail {{transport}} this has clear consequences, an EU directive of 1991 (EU Directive 91/440) suggested the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> railway <b>operation</b> structure into track, and train operators {{with the intention}} of encouraging or allowing new railway operators to be able to run trains on other companies tracks ("de-monopolisation or railways"), a related directive extends the encouragement of competition to inter-state railway operations. For the railways of Estonia this means the possibility of new companies operating on Estonian railways such as the Haapsalu Raudtee which sees restarting passenger operations on the Haapsalu line as a possible option, and increased competition from other railways, such as the Russian company SeverStal.|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{there is}} a long {{tradition}} of economic analysis of charging for the use of road infrastructure, the situation relating to rail is quite different. In most cases until recently railways have been integrated organisations with the same body responsible for infrastructure and operations. Rail infrastructure charging, if practised at all, has therefore been largely an internal transfer within the organisation. The principal exception to this has been the presence of access rights by one company over infrastructure owned by another in the case of North America. But the dominance of integrated national rail companies in Europe, and the fact that international traffic was operated by cooperation between the national railways rather than by one railway operating over the tracks of another, made the issue of no relevance here. The change in this situation started with the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure from <b>operations</b> in Sweden, which was undertaken with the aim of putting rail infrastructure on an equivalent footing to road. Later on the European Commission began pushing for <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure from <b>operations</b> in order to encourage new entry and to promote competition between different rail companies.

40|$|Abstract—Since the “invention ” of free flight, an {{outstanding}} {{question is how}} much traffic demand can safely be accommodated by airborne self separation. In order to answer this question, within the iFly project an advanced airborne self <b>separation</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> (ConOps) has been developed. This paper shows the results of an assessment of this ConOps on safety risk under very high en-route traffic demand. The accident risk assessment is conducted using advanced techniques in agent based modelling and rare event Monte Carlo simulation. The results obtained show which en-route traffic demand can safely be accommodated by advanced airborne self separation.

40|$|Abstract: Model-driven {{architecture}} aims at {{describing a}} system using a platform-independent model in sufficient detail {{so that the}} full implementation of the sys-tem can be generated from this model and a platform model.

We propose a declarative language for describing the behavior of platform-independent models based on a hybrid notation that uses graphical elements as well as textual elements in the form of OCL code snippets. Compared to existing approaches based on action languages it is situated at a higher level of abstraction and, through a clean <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> modifier <b>operations</b> and query operations, simplifies the comprehension of the behavioral aspects of the platform-independent system...|$|R
