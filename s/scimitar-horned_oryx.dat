5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} common eland is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx.</b>|$|E
25|$|Marwell Zoo has had notable success {{breeding}} various endangered animals including: {{black and}} white ruffed lemur (critically endangered), <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx,</b> Amur leopard (critically endangered) and snow leopard. In July 2015 a critically endangered Sulawesi-crested macaque baby was born.|$|E
25|$|The main, current Marwell Wildlife {{conservation}} programmes include Managing Biodiversity in Hampshire, assisting Grevy's zebra and its ecosystem in Kenya; supporting {{threatened species}} in Zimbabwe and managing {{the population of}} small, vulnerable populations; and reintroducing the <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> to the Sahara.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the species}} kept here are, American bison, hooded cranes, red-crowned cranes, white-naped crane, maned wolves, cheetahs, a mariana crow, black-footed ferrets, persian onagers, Hartmann's {{mountain}} zebras and <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryxs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sahara {{is largely}} undisturbed. The most {{degradation}} {{is found in}} areas where there is water, such as aquifer oases or along the desert margins where some rain usually falls most years. In these areas, animals such as addaxes, <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryxes,</b> and bustards are over-hunted for their meat. Only one area of conservation is recorded in the Sahara: the Zellaf Nature Reserve in Libya.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, a new, {{much larger}} prairie dog exhibit opened {{and can be}} seen by the Woodland Express Train Station. <b>Scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryxes</b> were added to the Savannah Exhibit. There is a two-toed sloth exhibit by the {{chimpanzee}} exhibit. New additions for 2014 included cotton-top tamarins and Wolf's guenons. Plus a new cheetah exhibit behind the yak exhibit opened on June 2013. A new addition for 2015 included vicunas.|$|R
25|$|The zoo {{is highly}} {{proactive}} in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

25|$|The Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated {{monorail}} ride, which travels {{around the}} watering hole (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pallicans, Goliath herons, blue cranes), arid desert (<b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx,</b> addra gazelle), semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (gerenuk, red-crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial {{views of the}} Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but {{after two decades of}} use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials to shut down the attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars. Additionally, a diesel powered tug is now on standby to nudge the trains back to the station {{in the event of a}} power failure.|$|E
2500|$|Wild Explorers [...] Opened in July 2015, {{at a cost}} of £3.6m, this {{exhibits}} {{focuses on}} the natural history and conservation of southern white rhino, Grevy's zebra and <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This is {{an outdoor}} exhibit {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} African savanna and educate visitors about cheetahs and {{what is being done}} to preserve them in the wild. The main part of the Cheetah Conservation Station consists of two enclosures separated by a fence. One enclosures houses two South African cheetahs (both males; Gat [...] and Bakari), while the other houses two male Grevy's zebras. Other animals on display in the area include <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryxs,</b> dama gazelles, Rüppell's vultures, sitatungas, red river hogs, maned wolves (a species native to South America), an Abyssinian ground hornbill and three lesser kudu. A female tammar wallaby named Maji had been on display until December 2013, when she was euthanized at the very old age of 18 (most do not live beyond 10).|$|R
2500|$|In 1975, the zoo {{established}} the Conservation and Research Center (CRC). In 2010, the complex was renamed the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), a title also {{used as an}} umbrella term for the scientific endeavors that take place on both campuses. On [...] in the Virginia countryside, rare species, such as Mongolian wild horses, <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx,</b> maned wolves, cranes, and others live and breed in spacious surroundings. SCBI's modern efforts emphasize reproductive physiology, analysis of habitat and species relationships, genetics, husbandry and the training of conservation scientists.|$|E
2500|$|Russian {{zoologist}} [...] Peter Simon Pallas introduced [...] "oryx" [...] into {{scientific literature}} in 1767, applying {{the name to}} the common eland as Antilope oryx (Pallas, 1767). In 1777, he transferred the name to the Cape gemsbok. At the same time, he also described {{what is now called}} the Arabian oryx as Oryx leucoryx, giving its range as [...] "Arabia, and perhaps Libya". In 1816, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville subdivided the antelope group, adopted Oryx as a genus name, and changed the Antilope oryx of Pallas to Oryx gazella (de Blainville, 1818). In 1826, Martin Lichtenstein confused matters by transferring the name Oryx leucoryx to the <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> (now Oryx dammah) which was found in the Sudan by the German naturalists Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (Lichtenstein, 1826). The Arabian oryx was then nameless until the first living specimens in Europe were donated to the Zoological Society of London in 1857. Not realizing this might be the Oryx leucoryx of previous authors, Dr. John Edward Gray proposed calling it Oryx beatrix after HRH the Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (Gray, 1857). Though this name was to persist for many years, Oldfield Thomas renamed the <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> as Oryx algazal in 1903 (it has since been renamed Oryx dammah), and gave the Arabian oryx back its original name. The confusion between the two species has been exacerbated because both have been called white oryx in English.|$|E
2500|$|African Plains {{represents}} {{many regions}} and habitats. East Africa displays cape buffalo, southern white rhinoceros, Rothschild's giraffe,Grant's Gazelle,fringe-eared oryx, impala,Thomson's Gazelle,nile lechwe,waterbuck, and a lagoon with East African crowned cranes The North Africa exhibit represents the Sahel and Sahara that houses [...] <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx,</b> barbary stag, red-fronted gazelle, and Ankole-Watusi cattle. [...] The Southern Africa field exhibits Grévy's zebras. The Central Africa region features a wooded waterhole with an island for pink-backed pelicans, saddle-billed storks, and Rüppell's vultures. On {{the shores of}} the lake are bongo antelope, red river hogs,greater kudu,Vaal rheboks, and other forest animals. A number of smaller enclosures visible only from the tram are home to Somali wild ass, kiangs (one of the world's only captive populations of this endangered wild equine), Arabian oryx, gorals, Japanese serows, black rhinoceroses, and Przewalski's horses.|$|E
2500|$|African Plains is an Africa-themed {{area that}} covers 13 {{hectares}} and was opened in 2001. The main exhibit in African Plains is the [...] "African Savanna", which houses ostriches, <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx,</b> white rhinoceros, giraffes and common zebras, {{all of which}} share a large, outdoor paddock. Gorilla Rainforest, an exhibit opened in 2012, houses a troop of western lowland gorillas: a silverback male named Harry, two adult females named Lena and Mayani, and two young gorillas named Kituba (the son of Lena) and Kambiri (the daughter of Mayani), {{both of which were}} born in 2011. Other animals displayed in the African Plains area include common chimpanzees, African wild dogs, hippopotamus, sooty mangabeys, African spurred tortoises, Abyssinian ground hornbills, okapis and eastern bongo. The area also features an Africa-themed restaurant (named the Nakuru restaurant) and gift shop. The last African lion living in the zoo died in 2012, so the zoo later received two female and one male Asian lions. A baby scimitar horned oryx was born in December 2016.|$|E

5000|$|The Arabian oryx, {{a species}} of large antelope, once {{inhabited}} much of the desert areas of the Middle East. However, the species' striking appearance made it (along with the closely related <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> and addax) a popular quarry for sport hunters, especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region. The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage: speed, and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972. The <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> followed suit, while the addax became critically endangered. However, the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from [...] "extinct in the wild" [...] to [...] "vulnerable" [...] due to conservation efforts like captive breeding ...|$|E
50|$|The host {{specificity}} of this parasite is uncertain. Either it was {{specific to the}} <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> and became extinct during captive breeding of the host, or - alternatively - it may be specific to the addax and possibly still surviving in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The Sahel was {{formerly}} home to large populations of grazing mammals, including the <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> (Oryx dammah), dama gazelle (Gazella dama), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons), the giant prehistoric buffalo (Pelorovis) and Bubal hartebeest (Alcelaphus busephalus buselaphus), along with large predators like the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), the Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki), the Northeast African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), the West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis) and the East African lion (Panthera leo nubica). The larger {{species have been}} greatly reduced in number by over-hunting and competition with livestock, and several species are vulnerable (Dorcas gazelle, cheetah, lion and red-fronted gazelle), endangered (Dama gazelle and African wild dog), or extinct (the <b>Scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> is probably extinct in the wild, and both Pelorovis and the Bubal hartebeest are now extinct).|$|E
50|$|The sanctuaries {{currently}} house approximately six Asian elephants, five African elephants, 41 exotic cats such as tigers, lions, cougars, a black leopard, a serval, and a bobcat, eight bears (mostly American black bears), eight primates (mostly White-headed capuchins), one coyote, emu, rhea, fallow deer, eland, Muntjack {{deer and}} {{a herd of}} <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx.</b>|$|E
50|$|According to {{the current}} IUCN Red List (2008), 37 animal species are extinct in the wild.

5000|$|SCI {{counters}} hunting can be {{an integral}} part of management of these species and provides needed funds for habitat preservation and enhancement. [...] SCI, along with other hunting and non-hunting organizations, intervened in a federal suit where HSUS challenged regulations that allow hunting of captive <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx,</b> dama gazelle and addax. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) found that, “captive breeding in the United States has enhanced the propagation or survival of the <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx,</b> addax, and dama gazelle worldwide by rescuing these species from near extinctions and providing the founder stock necessary for reintroduction. Sport hunting of surplus, captive-bred animals generates revenue that supports these captive-breeding operations and may relieve hunting pressure on wild populations.” As of February 2008, this case is still pending. [...] In the case of the black rhino, 83% of those countries represented at the 2004 CITES meeting approved sport hunting of the species in very limited numbers.|$|E
50|$|The scimitar oryx, {{also called}} <b>scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> (Oryx dammah), of North Africa, is now listed as {{possibly}} extinct in the wild. However, unconfirmed surviving populations {{have been reported}} in central Niger and Chad, and a semiwild population currently inhabiting a fenced nature reserve in Tunisia is being expanded for reintroduction to the wild in that country. Several thousand are held in captivity around the world.|$|E
50|$|Two {{pairs of}} rare <b>Scimitar-horned</b> <b>oryx</b> were {{transferred}} in 1979. Oryx symbolise what the Park’s founders hoped for when Orana was formed. Oryx were declared extinct {{in the wild}} in 1984 but captive breeding programmes resulted in the species being re-established in protected areas. Orana was the first institution {{in the world to}} breed oryx by artificial insemination and over 80 oryx have been bred at the zoo.|$|E
