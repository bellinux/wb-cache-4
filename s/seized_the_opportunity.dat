5|$|In March 1935, Chadwick {{received}} {{an offer of}} the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the University of Liverpool, in his wife's home town, to succeed Lionel Wilberforce. The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity, but Chadwick <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity,</b> assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university's prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.|$|E
5|$|A season {{highlight}} was {{the final}} game against Stanford's arch-rival California at California Memorial Stadium, the last game of the regular season. Before the game, both teams were undefeated and Stanford had not beaten California since 1905. Nevers did not play due to a broken ankle. Late in the game, California was leading 20–3; California coach Andy Smith, sure the game was over, began substituting regular players. Warner <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to combine passing with the trick plays {{for which he was}} known (a fake reverse and a full spinner), and Stanford made a comeback. The game ended in a 20–20 tie.|$|E

5|$|The British <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to force}} Baji Rao into a treaty. The treaty (The Treaty of Pune) was signed on 13 June 1817. Key terms {{imposed on the}} Peshwa {{included}} the admission of Dengle's guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British. These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the Narmada {{and south of the}} Tungabhadra rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India. The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match on}} the card was the Six-Man tag team match. The Headshrinkers' manager Afa {{interfered}} by attacking Billy Gunn outside the ring. At one point, Tatanka {{looked like he was}} gaining control, as he began his usual war dance. Bigelow kicked him {{in the back of the}} head, however, to end his momentum. Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled out of the way. Tatanka <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> and pinned Samu for the win.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E

5|$|The Alamanni <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to launch}} a major {{invasion}} of Gaul and northern Italy. However, the Visigoths were defeated in battle that summer near the modern Italian-Slovenian border and then routed in the Battle of Naissus that September by Gallienus, Claudius and Aurelian, who then turned and defeated the Alemanni at the Battle of Lake Benacus. Claudius' successor Aurelian defeated the Goths twice more in the Battle of Fanum Fortunae and the Battle of Ticinum. The Goths remained {{a major threat to}} the Empire but directed their attacks away from Italy itself for several years after their defeat. By 284 AD, Gothic troops were serving on behalf of the Roman military as federated troops.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Longue-Pointe was {{an attempt}} by Ethan Allen and a small force of American and Quebec militia to capture Montreal from British forces on September 25, 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War. Allen, who had been {{instructed}} only to raise militia forces among the local inhabitants, had long had thoughts of taking the lightly defended city. When he reached the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River with about 110 men, he <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to try. Major John Brown, who Allen claimed was supposed to provide additional forces, did not appear as they had planned, isolating Allen and his men {{on the north side}} of the river.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet {{was further}} {{reinforced}} in January 1779 by ten ships {{of the line}} under Admiral John Byron, who assumed command of the British Leeward Islands station. Throughout {{the first half of}} 1779, both fleets received additional reinforcements, after which the French fleet was superior to that of the British. Byron departed St. Lucia on June 6th in order to provide escort services to British merchant ships gathering at St. Kitts for a convoy to Europe, leaving d'Estaing free to act. D'Estaing and the French governor-general at Martinique, the marquis de Bouillé, <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to begin a series of operations against nearby British possessions.|$|E

5|$|When Michael II died in c. 1268, however, his realm was divided, with Nikephoros {{receiving}} the metropolitan territories of Epirus proper and John {{taking over the}} Epirote domains in Thessaly and Central Greece. According to Gregoras, his realm extended from Mount Olympus in the north to Parnassus in the south, with the Achelous River serving as his border with Epirus proper; his capital was at Neopatras. Michael VIII <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> for a rapprochement with the two brothers. He gave Nikephoros his niece Anna in marriage, and arranged a marriage between his nephew Andronikos Tarchaneiotes and a daughter of John, who in addition received the high title of sebastokratōr.|$|E
5|$|When de Montfort {{returned}} to England, Henry, supported by Eleanor, remained in Paris where he <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reassert royal authority {{and began to}} issue royal orders independently of the barons. Henry finally {{returned to}} retake power in England in April 1260, where conflict was brewing between de Clare's forces and those of de Montfort and Edward. Henry's brother Richard mediated between the parties and averted a military confrontation; Edward was reconciled {{with his father and}} de Montfort was put on trial for his actions against the King. Henry was unable to maintain his grip on power, and in October a coalition headed by de Montfort, de Clare and Edward briefly seized back control; within months their baronial council had collapsed into chaos as well.|$|E
5|$|After the Khmer Rouge {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the Khmer Rouge {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the Khmer Rouge and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the next}} match, Diesel threw Razor Ramon out of the ring, {{allowing}} Michaels to remove the turnbuckle padding. Payton argued with Michaels about his interference, drawing the referee's attention. Michaels <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to attack Ramon behind the referee's back. Diesel used two big boots {{and a series of}} submission holds to maintain the advantage. When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected turnbuckle, Payton pointed out the missing padding to the referee, who stood in the way to prevent the move. Soon after, Diesel tried to ram Ramon into the turnbuckle, but Ramon escaped and pushed Diesel into the turnbuckle. Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog, a scoop slam, and a superplex. When Michaels tried to get involved again, Payton chased him around the outside of the ring. While the referee was distracted, Michaels entered the ring and tried to perform a superkick while Diesel held Ramon. Ramon moved, causing Michaels to kick Diesel instead. Ramon pinned Diesel to win the match and regain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|In late 1818, Jennings was {{appointed}} {{as a federal}} commissioner, along with Lewis Cass and Benjamin Parke, to negotiate a treaty with the Native Americans (Potawatomi, Wea, Miami, and Delaware), {{who lived in the}} northern and central parts of Indiana. The Treaty of St. Mary's allowed the State of Indiana to purchase millions of acres of land north of an 1809 treaty line and extending west to the Wabash River and two more parcels of land, which opened most of central Indiana to American settlement. The appointment created a crisis in Jennings's political career. Because the state constitution prohibited a person from holding a federal government position while exercising duties as the state's governor, Jennings's political enemies <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to force him from office by arguing that he had vacated the governor's office when he accepted the federal appointment.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 1894, Crispi {{declared}} a state of siege throughout Sicily. Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops. The old order was restored through the use of extreme force, including summary executions. The Fasci were outlawed, the army and the police killed scores of protesters, and wounded hundreds. Thousands of militants, including all the leaders, were put in jail or sent into internal exile. Some 1,000 persons were deported to the penal islands without trial. All working-class societies and cooperatives were dissolved and the freedom of the press, meeting and association were suspended. A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was crushed as well. The government also <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to 'revise' the electoral registers. In Catania 5,000 of the 9,000 electors were struck off.|$|E

5|$|The 1938 Anschluss—the {{annexation}} of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime—led to the Nazification of Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Boosey & Hawkes <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to sign up}} composers Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, and also rescued Universal's Jewish staff, who later {{played an important role}} in developing the company. One such employee in particular, Ernst Roth, facilitated the signing of Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky, and was instrumental in the production of Strauss's Vier letzte Lieder (Four Last Songs) (1948; premièred 1950) and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (premièred 1951). Another significant figure from Vienna who occupied an editorial role was composer Arnold Schoenberg's pupil Erwin Stein, and after the war the composer Leopold Spinner, a pupil of Anton Webern, was also on the editorial staff. Stein was instrumental in founding the modern-music journal Tempo in 1939, which began as Boosey & Hawkes' own newsletter but later became a more independent publication.|$|E
5|$|The Franks and Alamanni on the Rhine {{frontier}} now <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{presented by}} the absence of the best Roman forces in the civil war to overrun much of eastern Gaul and Raetia. Libanius claims that they were incited to do so by letters from Constantius, {{in order to create a}} diversion in Magnentius' rear. The barbarians captured many of the Roman forts along the Rhine, demolished their fortifications and established permanent camps on the West bank of the river, which they used as bases to pillage Gaul during the four years that the civil war lasted (350-3). In excess of 20,000 Roman civilians were reported to have been abducted from Gaul and forced to work in the Alamanni's fields. In turn, this would have reinforced Alamanni raiding in Gaul by freeing many from the harvest cycle.|$|E
5|$|The Kaqchikel {{people were}} {{closely related to}} the K'iche', their former allies. The K'iche'an peoples (including the Kaqchikel, the K'iche' and others) had {{received}} strong influences from central Mexico since the time of the great Early Classic metropolis of Teotihuacan. The history of Iximche is largely drawn from the Annals of the Kaqchikels, a document written in the Kaqchikel language but using Latin characters soon after the Spanish Conquest. This document details the origins, history and conquest of the Kaqchikels. The Kaqchikel served as close allies of the K'iche' for many years. The Kaqchikel rulers Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' served the great K'iche' king K'iq'ab with such loyalty that he rewarded them with the royal titles Ahpo Sotz'il and Ahpo Xahil and the power to rule. The sons of K'iq'ab became jealous of the growing power of the Kaqchikel lords and led a revolt against their father that seriously damaged his authority. This revolt had serious consequences for the K'iche' as their conquered domains <b>seized</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to break free from their subjugation.|$|E
