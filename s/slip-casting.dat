50|$|<b>Slip-casting</b> methods provide {{superior}} surface quality, {{density and}} uniformity in casting high-purity ceramic raw materials over other ceramic casting techniques, such as hydraulic casting, since the cast part {{is a higher}} concentration of ceramic raw materials with little additives. A slip is a suspension of fine raw materials powder in a liquid such as water or alcohol with small amounts of secondary materials such as dispersants, surfactants and binders. Pottery slipcasting techniques employ a plaster block or flask mould. The plaster mould draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast removing deleterious air gaps and minimizing shrinkage in the final sintering process.|$|E
5000|$|So popular did the new Bunzlauer style {{become that}} several of the firms, using the {{technical}} advice offered by the Bunzlau Keramische Fachschule, transformed their pot shops into large-scale, <b>slip-casting</b> ceramic factories. Leading the way in this manufacturing conversion was the pottery company of Julius Paul & Sohn which was founded in 1893 and continued in operation until 1945. This company was rivaled in quality and innovative design by the firms of Hugo Reinhold, and Edwin Werner. While most of the potteries in Bunzlau and in the surrounding communities continued to utilize the forms by now traditional to Bunzlauer ware, these three [...] "high style" [...] firms experimented with Jugendstil aesthetics and such decorative additions as gold gilding.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{behaviour}} of the <b>slip-cast</b> crucible as a contamination source of multicrystalline silicon during directional solidification (DS) was investigated. Transport parameters of iron were estimated in {{two types of}} amorphous silica materials; synthetic Heraeus quarts glass and a Vesuvius <b>slip-cast</b> crucible. The <b>slip-cast</b> crucible is porous and consists of sintered quartz glass particles, and has much lower density than the quartz glass. The diffusivity of iron the crucible and quartz glass was estimated at 1100, 1200 and 1300 °C. The solubility of iron has also been estimated in the quartz glass. Samples of both materials were heat treated in contact with a solid iron source to obtain contact diffusion. The diffusion profile of iron in quartz glass was obtained by using quantitative analysis (line scans) with an electron probe micro analyser. Semi-quantitative X-ray mapping {{was performed on the}} <b>slip-cast</b> crucible samples, followed by image analyses. The concentration profile of both materials were fit to the solution of Fick s diffusion equation under the appropriate conditions. The diffusivity of quartz glass was estimated to be on the order of 10 ^- 15 and 10 ^- 14 m^ 2 /s over the range of 1100 - 1300 °C. The diffusivity of the crucible material was estimated to be on the order of 10 ^- 14 and 10 ^- 13 m^ 2 /s over the range of 1100 - 1300 °C. The independent diffusion constants and activation energy of the diffusion were estimated for both materials. The diffusivity of the quartz glass and the crucible can expressed as D = 2, 6 × 10 ^− 13 exp((− 44, 9 kJ/mol) /RT) m^ 2 /s and D = 1, 2 × 10 ^− 8 exp((− 146, 7 kJ/mol) /RT) m^ 2 /s, respectively. There was an order of magnitude difference between the diffusivity of the quartz glass and the <b>slip-cast</b> crucible. This indicates that the structure of the crucible affects the silicon contamination. The parameters obtained were applied in a finite element model that simulates the iron diffusivity across the crucible, coating and into the silicon melt during DS. The simulation resulted in a larger concentration in the melt when the values from the <b>slip-cast</b> crucible were applied. However, the difference from the quarts glass contamination was not as large as expected. It is reasonable to assume that if the simulation had been tested with even cleaner coating, a larger difference could have been observed...|$|R

40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) is a {{promising}} {{material for the}} preparation of high temperature membranes [1 - 5] due to its many unique properties such as high thermochemical stability, high thermal conductivity and resistance to abrasion. In our studies, SiC microporous membranes are fabricated using two different techniques. The first approach involves the pyrolysis of pre-ceramic polymeric films [3, 4], which are coated on tubular SiC macroporous supports using a combination of <b>slip-casting</b> and dipcoating techniques. Combining <b>slip-casting</b> with dip-coating significantly improved the reproducibility in preparing high quality membranes. In addition, a novel method, based on the use of sacrificial interlayers, was also developed for the preparation of these SiC membranes, which involves periodic and alternate coatings of polystyrene sacrificial interlayers and SiC pre-ceramic polymeric layers on the top of slip-casted tubular SiC supports. Membranes prepared by this technique exhibit single gas ideal separation factors of He and hydrogen over Ar in the range of (176 - 420) and (100 - 200), respectively, with permeances that are typically two to three times higher than those of SiC membranes prepared previously by the more conventional techniques.

40|$|A {{decrease}} in the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells below 700 degrees C results in a significant decrease of the output power. In this temperature regime the ionic resistance of the commonly used electrolyte yttria-stabilized zirconia becomes dominant. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} reduce the thickness of the electrolyte layer to minimize the resistance to ionic flow as long as no alternative electrolyte materials with higher ionic conductivity negligible electronic conductivity and sufficient stability are available. In this paper electron beam physical vapour deposition is discussed as a deposition technology for thin electrolyte layers. An electrolyte composite layer was developed with a lower specific resistance in comparison to an electrolyte layer made by vacuum <b>slip-casting.</b> The purpose of the composite electrolyte was to fulfil both gas tightness and electronic insulation. The performance of fully-assembled anode-supported fuel cells with an electrolyte composite manufactured by electron beam evaporation was 0. 93 A/cm(2) at 650 degrees C and 0. 7 V. whereas the performance of cells with an electrolyte manufactured by vacuum <b>slip-casting</b> with a sintering step was 0. 63 A/cm(2) at 650 degrees C and 0. 7 V.
