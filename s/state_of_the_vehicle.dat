In <b>the</b> {{special case}} <b>of</b> linear Physics-based motion models, the analytical solution for <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{at a specific}} time can easily be derived by solving the linear differential equations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motion model. It follows that the intersection point between two trajectories can be computed in an efficient manner [[11],[13]]. However, in the general case the motion equations are too complex for a closed-form solution to be derived. One solution is to approximate each trajectory by a piecewise-straight line trajectory [[17]]. A more common approach is to discretize the trajectories and to check iteratively for a collision at each discrete timestep. Following this reasoning, collisions can be detected in a simple manner by defining a threshold on the distance between two points (from two trajectories at the same timestep) [[42]]. In order {{to take into account}} <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles,</b> this threshold can be replaced by a condition on the “overlap between <b>the</b> shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two vehicles”.

For example, new cars typically have an anti-lock braking system (ABS), which prevents the wheels from locking during hard braking, and they often have an electronic stability control system (ESC), which stabilizes the lateral motion of the vehicle to prevent skidding.
