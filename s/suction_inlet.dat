40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted in the Langley high-speed 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel to determine the aerodynamic performance of suction applied near the wing tips above {{the trailing edge of}} a 60 deg swept Gothic wing. Moveable <b>suction</b> <b>inlets</b> were symmetrically mounted in the proximity of the trailing edge, and the amount of suction was varied to maximize wing lift. Tests were conducted at Mach 0. 15, 0. 30, and 0. 45, and the angle of attack was varied from - 4 to 50 deg. The suction augmentation increases the lift coefficient over the entire range of angle of attack. The lift improvement exceeds the unaugmented wing lift by over 20 %. Moreover, the augmented lift exceeds the lift predicted by vortex lattice theory to 30 deg angle of attack. Suction augmentation is postulated to strengthen the vortex system by increasing its velocity and making it more concentrated. This causes the vortex breakdown to be delayed to a higher angle of attac...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Vortices can be {{produced}} and ingested into the intake of a jet engine during high power operation {{in the vicinity of}} solid surfaces causing Foreign Object Damage (FOD) or compressor stall and engine surge problems. This can occur when the engine is mounted on the wing of a plane during take-off and engine ground runs or when the engine is placed inside a test cell for testing after an engine overhaul and prior to reinstallation onto the aircraft. In order to prevent such vortices from forming, especially in the test cells, it is necessary to be able to predict the onset of the vortex or understand the factors affecting the formation of such vortices. Ho and Jermy [TD 1 DT] investigated vortex formation using a suction tube in a open-end box model simulating an engine in a test cell scenario and found that 3 distinct regimes of flow (regular vortex, deformed vortex and no vortex) exists as the ratio of <b>suction</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity to upstream average velocity (Vi/Vo) varies. The effect of the upstream velocity gradient and <b>suction</b> <b>inlet</b> diameter on the threshold is considered. The results show that the as the size of the <b>suction</b> <b>inlet</b> diameter is increased, the range of conditions over which a vortex forms also increases. This is in line with earlier findings [TD 2 DT] in the take-off and engine run scenarios. The threshold for all three regimes appears to shift to a lower Vi/Vo for a given ratio of height over inlet diameter (H/Di). This indicates that in order to accommodate a larger engine, it is necessary to increase the size of the test cell by more than the ratio of engine diameters if the same margin of safety (with respect to vortex formation) are to be maintained...|$|E

40|$|This thesis details an in {{investigation}} of two problems arising during {{the testing of}} a jet engine in a test cell, namely the formation and ingestion of vortices and the generation and propagation of infrasound. Investigation involved the use of computational fluid dynamic as well as analytical tools. The author extended the work of previous researchers by investigating the effect when a <b>suction</b> <b>inlet</b> in surrounded by four walls, (as {{it is in a}} test cell). A previously suspected but not documented small region of unsteady vortex was discovered to lie between the steady vortex and no vortex regions. The preferential attachment of the vortex, when formed, to a particular surface was investigated and a low velocity region near that surface has been proven as a possible cause. A cell bypass ratio > 90 % was found to be necessary to avoid the formation of vortices in typical situations. Parametric studies (conducted cetaris paribus) on four different geometries and flow parameters were also conducted to determine how they affected the vortex formation threshold. Boundary layer thickness on the vortex attachment surface, upstream vorticity, size of <b>suction</b> <b>inlet</b> was found to have a direct relationship with probability of vortex formation whereas Reynolds number of flow was found to have an inverse relationship. Three hypotheses regarding the generation and propagation of infrasound in test cells were analysed. The first hypothesis states that the fluctuating of flow within the test cell led to a periodic fluctuation of pressure. The second hypothesis predicts a change in flow conditions can leads to a change in the acoustic reflection characteristics of the blast basket perforates. The final hypothesis proposes that changing engine location and size of augmenter, can lead to a reduction in the slip velocity between the engine exhaust jet and the cell bypass flow thus reducing the engine jet noise. The first hypothesis has been disproved using CFD techniques, although the results are as yet inconclusive. The second and third hypotheses have been proven to be potentially feasible techniques to be employed in the future. The changes proposed in the final hypothesis are shown to reduce the engine jet noise by up to 5 dB...|$|E

In this paper, pressure fluctuation experiments are carried out for five impeller configurations with different stagger angles by using the same test rig system. Results show that the stagger angles exert negligible effects {{on the characteristics of}} head and efficiency. The distributions of pressure fluctuations are relatively uniform along the suction chamber wall, and the maximum pressure fluctuation amplitude is reached near the <b>suction</b> <b>inlet</b> tongue region. The pressure fluctuation characteristics are affected largely by impeller rotation, whose dominant frequencies include impeller rotation frequency and its harmonic frequencies, and half blade passage frequency. The stagger angle exerts a small effect on the pressure fluctuations in the suction chamber while a great effect on the pressure fluctuation in volute casing, especially on the aspect of decreasing the amplitude on blade passage frequency. Among the tested cases, the distribution of pressure fluctuations in the volute becomes more uniform than the other impeller configurations and the level of pressure fluctuation may be reduced by up to 50 % when the impeller stagger angle is close to 24 ° or 36 °. The impeller structure pattern needs to be taken into consideration during the design period, and the halfway staggered impeller is strongly recommended.|$|E
40|$|The factors {{affecting}} {{the formation of}} air-entraining vortices in sumps are enumerated, and their relative importance assessed from experiments {{with a number of}} different sumps. It is established that vortices are caused by rotation of the mass of water within the sump arising primarily from the entry conditions. Their severity, measured in terms of the minimum safe submergence to avoid air entrainment was also found to depend greatly on the velocity in the suction inlet; air entrainment rarely occurred below a velocity of 2 ft. per sec., and above 15 or 20 ft. per sec. the severity of the vortices did not increase substantially. The shape and disposition of the <b>suction</b> <b>inlet</b> only slightly affected the vortices, but sump boundaries were found to reduce appreciably the tendency for vortex formation when closer than 8 diameters to the suction pipe: with the walls very close to the pipe, vortices did not occur. Small sumps may thus be more satisfactory than spacious ones. Tests with scale models of existing or proposed pump installations are described, and for one sump, where vortices formed within the working range, it is demonstrated that suitably placed boundary walls would be considerably more effective in preventing vortices than modifications to the suction inlets. Measurements of the quantity of air drawn into the pump through a vortex showed that air entrainment of this type could seriously impair pump performance. Severe vortices could lead to depriming of pumps operating with suction lift...|$|E
40|$|The {{key issues}} {{addressed}} this quarter {{were related to}} operational problems in the coal feed system, namely, the inability to accurately measure all of air entering the system, and plugging of coal in the feed lines due to poor entrainment. Both of these problems caused unacceptable uncertainty and/or fluctuations in the operating conditions and therefore required solutions. The coal entrainment problem was solved by installing a new educator designed for entraining solids in gas streams. All of the air entering the reactor now flows through the educator, either as motive air or through the <b>suction</b> air <b>inlet.</b> This ensures that the coal is entrained at relatively high velocity, {{so that it will}} flow to the reactor without forming slugs in the lines. A new feeder shroud was also installed with an air jet directed towards the auger to sweep off the tip in order to reduce pulsations when feeding coal. The problems associated with accurately metering the air have been somewhat more difficult to resolve. New strategies for completely closing the system have been tested and look promising. A new flowmeter was also purchased with cost sharing funds to directly measure the air flow rate of the two phase stream (after the coal injection point). If the system can be operated without leaks, then the changes will provide two independent measurements of the air flow to ensure accuracy. If the system cannot be sealed, the new flowmeter will still provide reliable measurement of the air flow and permit proper operation of the combustor.

The newly lengthened landing gear required more hydraulic fluid, which required a larger reservoir to hold it, a pump {{to move it}} quickly enough through the system, and so on through the hydraulic system. Retaining the relatively simple intakes but only {{on the bottom of}} the wing presented the issue that the airflow into the engine was from below, as opposed to the entire compressor face, so the ducts were extended above the wing to split the airflow evenly; this produced a noticeable bulge on the upper surface of the wing. No attempt was made to fit variable intakes. At high throttle settings, considerable <b>suction</b> into the <b>inlets</b> was generated; in the event of a sudden down-throttle motion by the pilot would result in air [...] "spilling" [...] out of the intakes, which was a concern because it could flow above the wing and disrupt the vortex.

A double passage model is defined as a single blade with two precisely designed outer walls, which is most appropriate for flow measurements. The design procedures necessary to achieve a desired flow condition are discussed...|$|R
