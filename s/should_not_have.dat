After an emotional sequence, Jaidev shoots Bhagavan {{in his chest}} as Bhagavan shoots Sandhya. Sandhya survives, but Bhagavan dies. Jaidev unites with Sandhya, and they both start a new and happy life.|$|E
5|$|France2 {{appealed to}} the Court of Cassation (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the {{decision}} of the appeal court to overturn the conviction, ruling that the court <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> asked France2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.|$|E

5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a standing army.|$|E
5|$|Heffernan {{sued the}} city, the mayor, and his {{superior}} officers under 42 U.S.C. §1983 {{in the federal}} District Court for New Jersey, claiming that his rights {{of freedom of speech}} as well as freedom of association had been violated. Heffernan contended that while he had not actually engaged in any protected speech, the department acted on the belief that he had, and the department <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> demoted him on the basis of that erroneous belief.|$|E
5|$|Olver {{supports}} {{efforts to}} reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering the United States, but also believes in immigration reform so that qualified immigrants could more easily be granted entrance.

Orton challenged Van Dam to a match that same night, which Orton won by forfeit. At One Night Stand, the two had a Stretcher match, which Van Dam won. After the match, Van Dam was attacked by Orton.|$|E

5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more {{similar to that of}} a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|However, an {{analysis}} of the distribution of megalodon over time suggests that climate change did not {{play a major role in}} its extinction. Its distribution during the Miocene and Pliocene did not correlate with warming and cooling trends; while abundance and distribution declined during the Pliocene, megalodon did show a capacity to inhabit anti-tropical latitudes. It was found in locations with a mean temperature ranging from , with a total range of , indicating that the global extent of suitable habitat <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been greatly affected by the temperature changes that occurred.|$|E

There {{was no mention of}} the island being {{discovered}} but Croft was prosecuted for illegal exports of salt, on the grounds that, as a customs officer, he <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> engaged in trade. Professor David Beers Quinn, whose theories form the basis for a variety of popular histories, suggested that the explorers may have discovered the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, waters rich in cod.|$|E
5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to resort to reading summaries on the packaging {{to make sense of}} a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1947, the {{committee}} {{recommended that the}} flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any communal undertones. The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the Chakra (wheel) from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased by the change, but eventually came around to accepting it.|$|E

The first giant said they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the king's daughter until they had set a man who could drink as much as he could; the drinker went up against him, and before he was full, the giant burst. The second giant said they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the king's daughter until they had set a man who could eat as much as he could; the stot-eater went up against him, and before he was full, the giant burst. The third giant said they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the king's daughter until the youngest son agreed to be his slave {{for a year and a}} day. He agreed and sent the servants and the daughters back. The gentlemen took them to the king and claimed to have rescued them.|$|R
5|$|One {{account of}} a woman being {{admitted}} to Freemasonry in the 18th century {{is the case of}} Elizabeth Aldworth (born St Leger), who is reported to have surreptitiously viewed the proceedings of a Lodge meeting held at Doneraile House, the private house of her father, first Viscount Doneraile, a resident of Doneraile, County Cork, Ireland. Upon discovering the breach of their secrecy, the Lodge resolved to admit and obligate her, and thereafter she proudly appeared in public in Masonic clothing. Speculative attempts to link the lodge of her initiation with a documented lodge of the Grand Lodge of Ireland have proved futile, but there is no reason that her father <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> instituted a lodge in his home, and the authenticity of her initiation is generally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Other music journalists {{critical}} of the awards stated that the 2005 award <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been given to Antony and the Johnsons for their album I Am a Bird Now as, although they are British-born and therefore eligible for the Prize, the band were based in the United States. In 2006, Isobel Campbell's collaboration with Mark Lanegan, Ballad of the Broken Seas, {{was included in the}} shortlist, despite Lanegan being American, as the album was eligible due to Campbell's British citizenship, while Guillemots, whose album was also shortlisted in 2006, contained band members from Brazil and Canada, although the majority were from the UK.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the Sun's {{development}} suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star {{would not have been}} able to sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.|$|E
