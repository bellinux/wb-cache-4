40|$|Sappy {{wounds of}} injured or diseased trees entice {{a wide variety}} of insects. Carter (1945) stated that when fluxing is {{prolific}} or long continued, air-borne bacteria, yeasts, and fungi contaminate the oozing sap, ferment it and produce the material called <b>slime</b> <b>flux.</b> Apparently the oozing flux is toxic to the flux site and so prevents callusing by the tree. Consequently, the same tree usually can be a good collecting site for insects from year to year.

50|$|<b>Slime</b> <b>flux</b> is a {{bacterial}} disease of certain trees, primarily elm, cottonwood, poplar, boxelder, ash, aspen, fruitless mulberry and oak. A {{wound to the}} bark, caused by pruning, insects, poor branch angles or natural cracks and splits, causes sap to ooze from the wound. Bacteria may infect this sap causing it to darken and stain the bark, eventually taking on a foamy appearance and unpleasant odor. This slimy ooze becomes toxic to the bark and eats into the tree. Additionally, the fermented sap attracts insects like flies, ants, and maggots.|$|R

25|$|Drosophila {{species are}} found {{all around the}} world, with more species in the {{tropical}} regions. They {{can be found in}} deserts, tropical rainforest, cities, swamps, and alpine zones. Some northern species hibernate. Most species breed in various kinds of decaying plant and fungal material, including fruit, bark, <b>slime</b> <b>fluxes,</b> flowers, and mushrooms. The larvae of at least one species, D. suzukii, can also feed in fresh fruit and can sometimes be a pest. A few species have switched to being parasites or predators. Many species can be attracted to baits of fermented bananas or mushrooms, but others are not attracted to any kind of baits. Males may congregate at patches of suitable breeding substrate to compete for the females, or form leks, conducting courtship in an area separate from breeding sites.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1990s, {{the tree}} was in a {{weakened}} condition. Some attributed its condition to the Encino Reservoir, built in 1921, for cutting off the natural water flow to the tree. Others blamed it on air pollution from traffic on nearby Ventura Boulevard. It also suffered from oak-root fungus. [...] In 1991, it was diagnosed with <b>slime</b> <b>flux,</b> a tree ailment caused by bacteria that generate fermentation inside the tree and send toxic sap oozing through the bark. [...] Arborists reported that the tree desperately needed special care to save it. Arborists and city officials argued over the proper treatment for the ailing tree, with one arborist suggesting the city chisel small holes in the bark to release the toxic sap that was slowly killing the oak.

In each stand an analysis of disease symptoms was carried out on 100 trees (2 - 20 years old stands) or 50 trees (21 - 80 years old stands) growing side by side in central part of the stand, while in the nursery in each block 200 seedlings were analyzed (4 sectors with 50 seedlings each). From the infected seedlings and trees 120 fragments of dead branches, living branches with cankers, and dead roots were taken. Identification of fungi was {{made on the basis of}} fructification and over 300 isolations of fungi on malt agar medium. The most frequent disease symptoms in ash stands were: the dead top (34. 7 % trees), the dying of whole branches (83. 5 %), the dying of the top of branches (20. 1 %), the occurrence of healed (36. 0 %) and unhealed cankers (18. 9 %) and the <b>slime</b> <b>flux</b> (23. 7 %) on the trunk, also the chlorosis of leaves (7. 5 %) and their atrophy (11. 2 %). Most of the types of disease symptoms appeared irrespectively of the tree age, origin and site, sometimes showing only a difference in the frequency of occurrence. On the seedlings in the nursery the shoot discolouration, healed and unhealed cankers on shoots and necrosis of a part of leaves were recorded most frequently. Disease symptoms occurred more frequently on 4 -year-old seedlings in comparison with 3 -year-old. In respect of transplanted seedlings the leaves dying was more frequent.

40|$|Extract] The family Drosophilidae {{includes}} ~ 4, 500 {{species in}} the two subfamilies Drosophilinae and Steganinae that are generally known as fruit flies or pomace flies because of their habit of feeding and growing on fermenting fruit. Within the Drosophilinae, Drosophila species {{are among the best}} characterized model organisms in genetic and genomic research. Conversely, knowledge of species ranked within the Steganinae is limited to a few morphological, taxonomic, and systematic investigations of selected members and information of the biology and ecology of most species is scarce. Over the past decade, fruit flies of the genus Phortica {{have been the subject of}} intense investigations aimed at identifying the arthropod vector and intermediate host of Thelazia spp. eyeworms (Otranto et al. 2003, 2005, 2006 a, 2006 b, Dorchies et al. 2007, Roggero et al. 2010). In particular, while Phortica okadai (Máca, 1977), Phortica magna (Okada 1968), and Amiota nagatai Okada, 1971 are vectors of Thelazia spp. in Asian countries (Kamakura et al. 1998), Phortica variegata (Fallén 1823) has been demonstrated, under both experimental (Otranto et al. 2005) and natural conditions (Otranto et al. 2006 b), to harbor larvae of Thelazia callipaeda Railliet and Henry 1910 "eyeworm" nematodes in Europe. Phortica spp. differ remarkably from other fruit flies in that they are known to feed not only on decaying fruit and <b>slime</b> <b>fluxes,</b> but also on lachrymal secretions of animals and humans (Bächli et al. 2004). When feeding on the conjunctiva of vertebrates infested with T. callipaeda, P. variegata ingests the first-stage larvae released by adult female nematodes; within the body cavities of the arthropod vector, these larvae develop to second-stage larvae and, subsequently, to infective third-stage larvae which reach the proboscis of the fly and are invade the conjunctival sac of a new, receptive host (reviewed by Otranto et al. 2003). While both adult female and male P. variegata have been shown to harbour larvae of T. callipaeda under experimental settings (Otranto et al. 2005), only the latter gender has been demonstrated to act as a vector of this parasitic nematode under natural conditions (Otranto et al. 2006 b, reviewed by Otranto et al. 2008 a). The biological bases of this host-parasite relationship are still unclear...|$|R
40|$|The {{studies were}} carried out in 12 beech stands, growing on {{mountain}} fresh forest site in Magurski National Park. Stands differed in respect of exposition (northern and southern) and age - lower age classes (21 - 60 years old) and higher age classes (81 - 120 years old). This paper presents evaluation of frequency of disease symptoms occurrence in the crowns and on the trunks of beeches. The presence and the place of occurrence of fungus Ascodichaena rugosa and insects Cryptococcus fagisuga and Ectoedemia liebwerdella, which could be connected with beech bark necrosis on the trunks were noted down. In each stand 50 trees, growing side by side in center of the stand, were analyzed. Among 600 analyzed trees of Fagus sylvatica, 2. 6 % had a dead top. Crown thinning were present on 51. 8 % of trees. It appeared frequently in higher age class stands and didn't cover more than ¼ of the crown. Moreover, in crowns of 4. 1 % of trees the leaf chlorosis appeared. The most frequent symptom on trunks of beeches were local necroses (98 % of trees), that were sometimes connected with <b>slime</b> <b>fluxing</b> (3. 3 %). Necroses were the most number in stands growing on the southern exposition and on south parts of the trunks. Cryptococcus fagisuga appeared mostly in high age class stands. Intensity of its appearance was similar on the trees growing on the southern and northern exposition (respectively, 48. 3 % and 53. 3 %). Particular parts of the trunks were colonized with similar frequency by C. fagisuga irrespective of cardinal points (N- 29. 3 %; S- 21. 7 %; W- 22. 7 %; E- 26. 2 %) and number of necroses on the trunks. Ascodichaena rugosa appeared on 8. 6 % of trees, more frequently on their north parts of the trunks (7. 3 %). In the places colonized by fungi A. rugosa, insect C. fagisuga was absent. Occurrence of larvae of Ectoedemia liebwerdella was mostly found on trunks of beeches growing on the southern exposition (43. 0 %), on 35. 3 % of trees they colonized south parts of trunks. There wasn't observed any connection between the occurrence of these larvae and symptoms of local necroses...|$|R
40|$|L’apport journalier d’ascospores de Nectria coccinea, d’octobre à juin, sur des {{portions}} d’écorce infestées de cochenilles, démontre que le champignon profite de la présence de C. fagisuga pour pénétrer dans l’écorce. Nectria coccinea, est introduit artificiellement (piqûre), dans des portions d’écorces supportant des infestations variables de cochenilles; il induit une nécrose qui est d’autant plus développée que les colonies de cochenilles sont plus nombreuses. L’élimination de la cochenille conduit à l’arrêt du développement et à un début de cicatrisation des lésions récemment apparues dues à N. coccinea. Enfin, un traitement mixte insecticide fongicide protège efficacement les portions traitées. Previous french {{studies have}} placed Nectria coccinea’s {{part in a}} prominent position in mycoflora associated with beech bark necrosis after Cryptococcus fagisuga pullulations. Artificial inoculations have demonstrated N. coccinea ability to produce restricted beech bark decay. Necrosis’s perennity and spread seem to be conditionned by C. fagisuga population’s density. Results of 1976 - 1977 experimental studies, lay down necessary association of two organisms implicated : Each day, from October 1976 to June 1977, germinating ascospores have been sprayed on beech bark infested with beech scale (population density 3 - 4 E. J. Parker, scoring system). Two kinds of symptoms, red bark discoloration and <b>slime</b> <b>flux,</b> reveal successful N. coccinea infection, and corresponding necrosis (reisolation, november 1977). These infections occur especially in November and May-June. Although, these results prove that C. fagisuga assists N. coccinea beech bark enter, infection courts and processes remain unprecises. Artificial bringing of N. coccinea (mycelium, needle wounded) in beech bark. leed to a necrosis, spreading of wich depend on C. fagisuga density population. Restricted {{to one or two}} centimeters square, in lack of beech scale, necrosis rapidly extend to several decimeters square, where C. fagisuga are abounding. C. fagisuga brings a bark physiological disorder, rendering bark more vulnerable to N. coccinea destructive ability. Mechanical (vaccum cleaner, brush) or chemical (oleoparathion) elimination of beech scale on N. coccinea infected (or no) bark, confirms previous observations. Infections never occur, in lack of beech scale, or after insecticide treatment. Spread of beech bark necrosis stops, and a beginning of healing over occurs where C. fagisuga has been eliminated. Unlike, on same trees, necrosis extend in C. fagisuga infested place. It seems that beech scale disturbs natural physiological control processes. In conclusion, C. fagisuga assists, in peculiar manner N. coccinea implantation in bark of beech, brings a bark physiological disturbance, leading easier N. coccinea decay ability. Beech scale, necessary precursor of N. coccinea, take a prominent part in beech bark disease. Stands where disease, and particulary beech scale, are endemic, would be searched after, independently of climatic fluctuations. This imply a careful sanitary gestion and perhaps proscribes pure beech stands, always restored in the same place. Variations in some beech susceptibility to beech scale and to N. coccinea, as site situations influences on disease severity, would reveal advantageous in beech bark disease control method...|$|R
