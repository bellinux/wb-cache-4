5|$|Tracing {{back the}} comet's orbital motion {{revealed}} {{that it had}} been orbiting Jupiter for some time. It is likely that it was captured from a <b>solar</b> <b>orbit</b> in the early 1970s, although the capture may have occurred as early as the mid-1960s. Several other observers found images of the comet in precovery images obtained before March 24, including Kin Endate from a photograph exposed on March 15, S. Otomo on March 17, and a team led by Eleanor Helin from images on March 19. No precovery images dating back to earlier than March 1993 have been found. Before the comet was captured by Jupiter, it was probably a short-period comet with an aphelion just inside Jupiter's orbit, and a perihelion interior to the asteroid belt.|$|E

50|$|But unlike Tycho's geoheliocentric {{system in}} which the Earth does not rotate and the Martian and <b>Solar</b> <b>orbits</b> intersect, in that of Ursus and his {{follower}} Roslin the Earth had a daily rotation and also the Martian and <b>Solar</b> <b>orbits</b> do not intersect, thus avoiding the Tychonic conclusion in respect of the Martian orbit that there are no solid celestial spheres on the ground that they cannot possibly interpenetrate. But on the other hand the orbits of Mercury and Venus would obviously intersect the Martian orbit in Reimers' illustration of his model, and indeed also intersect Jupiter's orbit.|$|R
50|$|Pioneer 6 and Pioneer 9 are in <b>solar</b> <b>orbits</b> with 0.8 AU {{distance}} to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly shorter than Earth's. Pioneer 7 and Pioneer 8 are in <b>solar</b> <b>orbits</b> with 1.1 AU {{distance to}} the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly longer than Earth's. Since the probes' orbital periods differ {{from that of the}} Earth, from time to time, they face a side of the Sun that cannot be seen from Earth. The probes can sense parts of the Sun several days before the Sun's rotation reveals it to ground-based Earth orbiting observatories.|$|R
5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a <b>solar</b> <b>orbit</b> of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E
25|$|Until Ulysses, the Sun {{was only}} {{observed}} from low solar latitudes. The Earth's orbit defines the ecliptic plane, which {{differs from the}} Sun's equatorial plane by only 7.25 degrees. Even spacecraft directly orbiting the Sun do so in planes close to the ecliptic because a direct launch into a high-inclination <b>solar</b> <b>orbit</b> would require a prohibitively large launch vehicle.|$|E
25|$|On September 3, 2002, {{astronomer}} Bill Yeung {{discovered a}} suspected asteroid, which {{was given the}} discovery designation J002E3. It {{appeared to be in}} orbit around the Earth, and was soon discovered from spectral analysis to be covered in white titanium dioxide, which was a major constituent of the paint used on the Saturn V. Calculation of orbital parameters led to tentative identification as being the Apollo 12 S-IVB stage. Mission controllers had planned to send Apollo 12's S-IVB into <b>solar</b> <b>orbit</b> after separating from the Apollo spacecraft, but it is believed the burn lasted too long, and hence did not send it close enough to the Moon, remaining in a barely stable orbit around the Earth and Moon. In 1971, through a series of gravitational perturbations, it is believed to have entered in a <b>solar</b> <b>orbit</b> and then returned into weakly captured Earth orbit 31 years later. It left Earth orbit again in June 2003.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of dark matter trapped {{in the solar system}} in bound <b>solar</b> <b>orbits.</b> If there exist mechanisms for dissipating excess kinetic energy by an amount sufficient for generating bound <b>solar</b> <b>orbits,</b> then trapping of galactic dark matter might have taken place during formation of the solar system, or could be an ongoing process. Possible locations for acumulation of trapped dark matter are orbital resonances with the planets or regions in the outer solar system. It is posible to test for the presence of unseen matter by detecting its gravitational effects. Current results for dynamical limits obtained from analyses of planetary ephemeris data and spacecraft tracking data are presented. Possible future improvements are discussed...|$|R

The LM ascent stage orbit decayed on October 23, 1981, the LM descent stage (1969-018D) orbit decayed March 22, 1969.

25|$|Space-based interferometers, such as LISA and DECIGO, {{are also}} being developed. LISA's design calls for three test masses forming an {{equilateral}} triangle, with lasers from each spacecraft to each other spacecraft forming two independent interferometers. LISA is planned to occupy a <b>solar</b> <b>orbit</b> trailing the Earth, with each arm of the triangle being five million kilometers.

25|$|The last {{function}} of the IU was to command the very small maneuver necessary to keep the S-IVB/IU {{out of the way}} of the spacecraft. On some missions the S-IVB/IU went into high Earth or <b>Solar</b> <b>orbit,</b> while on others it was crashed into the Moon; seismometers were left on the Moon during Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16, and the S-IVB/IUs of Apollo 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were directed to crash. These impacts provided impulses that were recorded by the seismometer network to yield information about the geological structure of the Moon.|$|E
25|$|In {{representations}} of the Solar System, {{it is common to}} draw the trajectory of Earth {{from the point of view}} of the Sun, and the trajectory of the Moon from the point of view of Earth. This could give the impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun's perspective. Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth (1km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun (30km/s), this never happens. There are no rearward loops in the Moon's <b>solar</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
25|$|If it were {{to remain}} on the same {{trajectory}} as the spacecraft, the S-IVB could have presented a collision hazard so its remaining propellants were vented and the auxiliary propulsion system fired to move it away. For lunar missions before Apollo 13, the S-IVB was directed toward the Moon's trailing edge in its orbit so that the moon would slingshot it beyond earth escape velocity and into <b>solar</b> <b>orbit.</b> From Apollo 13 onwards, controllers directed the S-IVB to hit the Moon. Seismometers left behind by previous missions detected the impacts, and the information helped map the interior structure of the Moon.|$|E

25|$|He {{was also}} very proud of his work in {{producing}} the first artificial meteors. He placed explosive charges in the nose cone of a V2 rocket, to be detonated at high altitude and fire high velocity pellets of metal through the atmosphere. The first attempts appeared to be failures, and Zwicky sought to try again with the Aerobee rocket. His requests were denied, until the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. Twelve days later, on October 16, 1957, Zwicky launched his experiment on the Aerobee, and successfully fired pellets visible from the Mount Palomar observatory.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advances of this redesign was an Earth-trailing orbit. Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ≈ 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from the Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in <b>solar</b> <b>orbit</b> far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling such as the sun shield, against the single remaining major heat source to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller lighter payload, with major cost savings. This orbit also simplifies telescope pointing, but does require the NASA Deep Space Network for communications.|$|E

50|$|However Kepler {{discovered}} Tycho had posited intersecting Martian and <b>Solar</b> <b>orbits</b> {{because he}} had mistakenly concluded from his data that at opposition Mars was closer to the Earth than the Sun was.

Kepler discovered Tycho’s observations revealed little or no Martian parallax, implying it was further than the Sun at opposition. This would have refuted Tycho's system in favour of Ursus's and Roslin's. It seems it has yet to be determined whether the dominant astronomical system of the 17th century was the geoheliocentric system of Tycho or that of Ursus and Roslin at least in respect of non-intersecting <b>Solar</b> and Martian <b>orbits,</b> and also in that of the Earth's rotation or not.|$|R
