40|$|Abstract: As {{a central}} {{component}} of any existing AC substation, <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches</b> {{are responsible for}} providing isolation between grid-connected and safely approachable sections of bus. Additionally, they can provide the capability of transferring load currents between different busses. Due to the excellent performance history in AC, possible challenges for <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches</b> in future HVDC substations were identified by comparing computed effects of DC stress to the standardized capabilities of existing AC <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches.</b> It was found that pure, time-constant DC voltages and currents will not lead to excessive stress onto <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches.</b> However, voltage and current ripples present in real HVDC systems can give rise to considerably different results. Ripples exhibiting a 1 /f decay in magnitude up to the 30 th harmonic were utilized in calculations. Similarly to AC, switching of sections of bus can lead to multiple restrikes or prestrikes, potentially resulting in very fast transients. The maximum voltage collapse exhibits a strong dependence on {{the magnitude of the}} voltage ripple. Transferring load currents between different busses {{has been shown to be}} possible under DC conditions. However, the recovery voltage as well as the extinction process itself depend heavily on the current ripple. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{transfer}} load currents between parallel busbars {{is one of}} the main requirements for most <b>disconnector</b> <b>switches</b> in gas insulated as well as air insulated substations today. As such, the capability limits and testing methods are internationally standardized in IEC 62271 - 102. The test circuit dictated in this standard is the Thévenin equivalent of the high current, power frequency approximation of two parallel busbars supplied by an AC current source.

40|$|Today, IEC 62271 - 102 standardizes the {{determination}} of testing methods and capability limits of bus-transfer <b>switching</b> by <b>disconnectors.</b> The test circuit mandated by this standard uses a low-voltage, high-current AC voltage source in series to an impedance and the disconnector under test corresponding to the Thévenin equivalent of two parallel busbars in a typical substation. In a previous Cigré Session publication[1] the authors presented a non-standard alternative to this testing method which differs from the IEC standard in multiple ways. The proposed full bus-transfer setup employs two parallel impedances which are modelled after typical GIS substation busbar in terms of resistance and inductance. These impedances allow tests with busbar lengths ranging between 10 m and 600 m. In addition, the proposed setup makes use of a damped oscillating LC current source {{in order to provide}} the pre-switching current at power frequency while adding passive safety due to a decaying source current. A feature from which applications such as limit testing or post-failure analysis might benefit. Furthermore, the setup could be expanded toward bus-transfer testing at low-frequency or direct current conditions by modifying or exchanging the current source. After successfully demonstrating initial results of a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed setup, the variable parameters of pre-switching current and bus-transfer impedance were adjusted over large ranges with the aim to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} bus-transfer process in GIS disconnectors.

40|$|At present, {{induction}} motors {{are controlled}} via the so-called variable-frequency drives (VFD) that allow {{to control the}} speed for the motors. The purpose of this PhD thesis is to improve electromagnetic modeling techniques {{for the study of}} conducted electromagnetic emissions in variable-frequency drives, with the aim of enhancing their reliability in energy production plants. Pulse-width-modulated voltage converters are used to feed an AC motor, and they are considered to be the primary reason for high-frequency effects in both the motor and the supply grid. In particular, high-frequency currents, known as common mode currents, flow between all energized components and the ground and travel via low-resistance and low-inductance interconnects such as the power cable between the inverter and the motor. Electrically long power cables are commonly used in VFD installations, and require particular attention. Accurate models can be obtained using the theory of multiconductor transmission lines. In the case of nonlinear terminations, such as an inverter, only time-domain analysis is possible. In recent years, several techniques have been proposed. Some of these techniques include the lumped-element equivalent circuit method, the method of characteristics (MoC) and its generalizations, and the Pad´e approach. In this context, a modeling technique based on Green’s functions has been proposed. The input/output impedance matrix is expressed as a rational series, whose poles and their residues are identified by solving algebraic equations. The primary disadvantage of this method lies in the large number of poles that is typically necessary to model the dynamics of the system, especially when electrically long interconnectsare considered. To overcome this limitation, we have proposed the Delay-Rational Green’s-Function-based Method, abbreviated as DeRaG. In this method, the line delay is extracted and, by virtue of suitable mathematical manipulation of the rational series, is incorporated through hyperbolic functions. The delay extraction enables the use of a reduced number of poles and improves the accuracy of the model in general, avoiding any ringing effects in the time-domain response. The primary advantage of the proposed method compared with other well-known techniques lies in the delayed state-space representation. The obtained model can be computed regardless of the terminations and/or sources, and the terminal conditions can be immediately and essentially incorporated. The next step will be to simulate the entire inverter-cable-motor system. The partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) technique will be used to model the interconnects as well as the discontinuities in the power cable that can be caused, for example, by <b>switch</b> <b>disconnectors.</b> The theoretical results will be verified against experimental measurements. The final objective is to provide new techniques for modeling the electrodynamics of variable-frequency drives to allow their complete EMC assessment as early as the design stage and to enable the planning of corrective actions in advance.

40|$|During <b>switching</b> of <b>disconnectors</b> (DS) in GIS a varying {{number of}} pre-strikes and re-strikes occur. Due {{to the very}} short {{duration}} of the voltage collapse, traveling surges are generated in the busbar duct. These very fast transient overvoltages (VFTO) can become the limiting dielectric stress which defines the dimensions at UHV voltage levels. The decision shall {{be based on the}} maximum VFTO peak value that occurs with reference to the rated lightning impulse withstand voltage (LIWV) of the equipment. If the maximum VFTO is higher than the LIWV, it is necessary to consider the VFTO level as dimensioning criteria or to suppress VFTO by suitable measures. The main challenges are the reduction in VFTO amplitudes and finally the reduction of the effects of VFTO on the equipment. For the different sources of VFTO and for the different equipment different mitigation methods are known. The damping of VFTO by integration of a damping resistor is a well proven technology. The way to overcome the drawback of such unwieldy designs is to use other internal damping measures. Several methods have been proposed and examined in the past, such as ferrite material or high frequency (RF) resonators. The VFTO damping solution utilizing ferrite rings has been analysed and tested and will be described here. The measurements show that a damping effect can be achieved, but with an important drawback: the magnetic material goes easily into saturation, which complicates the design and reduces its general applicability and robustness. A new approach for damping is to implement compact electromagnetic high-frequency resonators with low quality factor specially designed to cover a wider frequency range. The novelty of this idea is not only to design the resonators but also to dissipate the VFTO energy. The VFTO damping effect of the developed RF resonator tuned to the dominant harmonic component was confirmed by experiments. Rings of a nanocrystalline alloy placed around the GIS conductor were also investigated. Depending on number, material and size of the rings a good mitigation could be achieved...|$|R
