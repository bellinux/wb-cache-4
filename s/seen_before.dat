5|$|The loud bang that {{is heard}} is the super heated air around the {{lightning}} bolt expanding {{at the speed}} of sound. Because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> the bang, although both occur at the same moment.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, it seemed to many that God had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire. There were noxious fumes in the air; and the Sun, while still providing day, refused to give much heat. This caused famine unlike anything those of the time had <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> weakening the people of Europe and the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Tracy McPherson of the Pennsylvanian Pastafarians {{petitioned the}} Chester County, Pennsylvania Commissioners to allow {{representation}} of the FSM at the county courthouse, equally with a Jewish menorah and a Christian nativity scene. One commissioner stated that either all religions should be allowed or no religion should be represented, but without support from the other commissioners the motion was rejected. Another commissioner stated that this petition garnered more attention than any he had <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

5|$|In another study, synesthetes were {{prompted}} to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes never <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time {{too short to}} account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain, pointing again towards ideasthesia.|$|E
5|$|In {{cultural}} terms, telecommunication {{has increased}} the public's ability to access music and film.

5|$|The {{disintegration}} of Chad caused {{the collapse of}} France's position in the country. Libya moved to fill the power vacuum and became involved in Chad's civil war. Libya's adventure ended in disaster in 1987; the French-supported president, Hissène Habré, evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.|$|E
5|$|We {{marched to}} the place we called Cornhill, where we had found the corn before. At another place we had <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E
5|$|While militarily Habré {{was only}} partly {{successful}} {{in his attempt}} to evict the Libyans from the Tibesti (the Libyans would fully leave the region in March, when a series of defeats in the north-east had made the area untenable), the campaign was a great strategic breakthrough for the FANT, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity that had never been <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> in Chad.|$|E

5|$|As Ryu {{enters the}} World of Darkness {{to destroy the}} altar, Irene and Robert, while {{traveling}} back, are stopped by a shadowy figure that Irene has <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> Meanwhile, after defeating Kelbeross whom he noted he fought in his fight against Jaquio (in the previous Ninja Gaiden game), Ryu finds Robert {{on the ground and}} mortally wounded. He tells Ryu that Irene has been captured again and that he must prevent the Gate of Darkness from opening. Robert then tells Ryu to leave him behind while he fends off the demons. Ryu eventually makes it to the evil altar where he finds Irene and the shadowy figure who captured her; the figure reveals himself as Jaquio – the antagonist from the first Ninja Gaiden installment – who was reborn after his first battle with Ryu.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and the last thing to be <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in the turret.|$|E

His many activities brought him into the highest social and professional circles. Like other turn of the century hunters such as Teddy Roosevelt, he was an active campaigner for animal welfare and succeeded in seeing legal measures introduced for their protection.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) {{developed}} the current classification system and wrote guidelines {{that put a}} greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A unified taxonomy (a universal system for classifying viruses) has been established. The 9th ICTV Report defines {{the concept of the}} virus species as the lowest taxon (group) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa. However, at present {{only a small part of}} the total diversity of viruses has been studied, with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus sequences recovered have not been <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> and samples from the environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol Empire's rise gave Western Christians the {{opportunity}} to visit lands {{that they had never}} <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> and they set out in large numbers along the Empire's secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the Crusader states' salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, was one reason for the numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include Franciscan explorers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in 1245 and William of Rubruck in 1253.|$|E
