40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{fundamental}} concepts of the basic theory for linear impulsive <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> time scales. First, we introduce the transition matrix for linear impulsive dynamic <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> time scales and we establish some properties of them. Second, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for linear impulsive dynamic <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> time scales. Also we give some sufficient conditions for the stability of linear impulsive dynamic <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> time scales. ...|$|R

40|$|Sensor {{systems for}} oestrus and disease {{detection}} are increasingly used on dairy farms. It is, however, not known whether using sensor systems also improves production, health, reproduction and economic {{performance of the}} farm. The first objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of sensor <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> milk production, days to first service and somatic cell count of the herd. The second objective is to investigate the impact of investment in sensor <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> several cost components and revenues. Data on production, health and reproduction over the years 2003 - 2013 was available for 414 Dutch dairy farms with sensor <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> an automatic milking system (n= 103), with sensor <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> a conventional milking system (n= 49) and without (n= 262) sensor systems. In addition, farm accounting data of 217 dairy farms with sensor <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> an automatic milking system (n= 54), with sensor <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> a conventional milking system (n= 36) and without (n= 127) sensor systems was available for the years 2008 - 2013. Having sensor systems was associated with a higher average production per cow on farms with an automatic milking system, and with a lower average production per cow on farms with a conventional milking system in the years after investment. Farms with an automatic milking <b>system</b> had <b>on</b> average 12, 000 cells/ml higher somatic cell count after adoption of the sensor system whereas farms with a conventional milking <b>system</b> had <b>on</b> average 10, 000 cells/ml lower somatic cell count. Total capital costs and milk revenues increased after investment in sensor <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> farms with an automatic milking system. Labour costs did not decrease after investment in sensor systems. </p...|$|R
