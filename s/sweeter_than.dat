25|$|For many years, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, a light, sweet crude oil, was the world’s most-traded commodity. WTI is a grade {{used as a}} {{benchmark}} in oil pricing. It is the underlying commodity of Chicago Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is often referenced in news reports on oil prices, alongside Brent Crude. WTI is lighter and <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> Brent and considerably lighter and <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> Dubai or Oman.|$|E

50|$|Boal {{is a name}} {{given to}} several {{varieties}} of grape cultivated in Portugal, notably {{in the production of}} medium-rich fortified wines from Madeira Island. On many wine labels of Madeira wine, the variety's name is anglicized as Bual. Madeira from Bual is typically less <b>sweet</b> <b>than</b> that from Malmsey, but more <b>sweet</b> <b>than</b> Sercial or Verdelho. The vines are also common in Portugal and Spain, where the fruit is used in the same way for fortified wines.|$|R
25|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} (Ace-K) is 200 times <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> sucrose (common sugar), {{as sweet}} as aspartame, about two thirds {{as sweet as}} saccharin, and one third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> its components.|$|E
25|$|Cyclamate is an {{artificial}} sweetener 30–50 times <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> sugar, {{making it the}} least potent of the commercially used artificial sweeteners. It was invented in 1937 by graduate student Michael Sveda at the University of Illinois.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century Champagne was noticeably <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> the Champagnes of today. The {{trend towards}} drier Champagne began when Perrier-Jouët {{decided not to}} sweeten his 1846 vintage prior to {{exporting}} it to London. The designation Brut Champagne was created for the British in 1876.|$|E

25|$|As with peaches, {{nectarines}} can {{be white}} or yellow, and clingstone or freestone. On average, nectarines are slightly smaller and <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> peaches, but with much overlap. The lack of skin fuzz can make nectarine skins appear more reddish {{than those of}} peaches, contributing to the fruit's plum-like appearance. The lack of down on nectarines' skin also means their skin is more easily bruised than peaches.|$|E
25|$|The Gin Act 1736 imposed {{high taxes}} on {{retailers}} {{and led to}} riots in the streets. The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742. The Gin Act 1751 was more successful, however; it forced distillers to sell only to licensed retailers and brought gin shops {{under the jurisdiction of}} local magistrates. Gin in the 18th century was produced in pot stills, and was somewhat <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> the London gin known today.|$|E

50|$|Apfelschorle {{contains}} {{fewer calories}} and is less <b>sweet</b> <b>than</b> pure apple juice. It is also nearly isotonic. This makes it popular {{in summer and}} among athletes. Commercially available Apfelschorle generally contains between 55% and 60% juice.|$|R
50|$|Mabinlins {{sweetness}} {{were estimated}} to be about 100-400 times that of sucrose on molar basis, 10 times sucrose on a weight basis, which make them less <b>sweet</b> <b>than</b> thaumatin (3000 times) but elicit a similar sweetness profile.|$|R
25|$|Sweetness is subjectively {{measured}} {{by comparing the}} threshold values, or level at which {{the presence of a}} dilute substance can be detected by a human taster, of different sweet substances. Substances are usually measured relative to sucrose, which is usually given an arbitrary index of 1 or 100. Fructose is about 1.4 times <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> sucrose; glucose, a sugar found in honey and vegetables, is about three-quarters as sweet; and lactose, a milk sugar, is one-half as sweet.|$|E
25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol, wood naphtha or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> ethanol (ethyl alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol. It is not popular for machinery, but {{may be found in}} automotive windshield washer fluid, de-icers, and gasoline additives.|$|E
25|$|The {{sweetness}} of wines {{is determined by}} the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of sweetness), semi-dry (medium-sweet) and dessert level sweetness (such as the high sugar content in Sauternes and Tokays). Sweet wines often need to be <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> the dish they are served with. Vintage brut champagne paired with sweet, wedding cake can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, sweetness balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by peppers and spicy Asian cuisine. It can accentuate the mild sweetness in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty Stilton cheese with a sweet Port. Sweetness in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some sweetness (such as dishes with sweet & sour sauces).|$|E

5000|$|Stachyose is less <b>sweet</b> <b>than</b> sucrose, {{at about}} 28% on a weight basis. It is mainly {{used as a}} bulk {{sweetener}} or for its functional oligosaccharide properties. Stachyose is not completely digestible by humans and delivers 1.5 to 2.4 kcal/g (6 to 10 kJ/g).|$|R
500|$|Commercially popular apple cultivars {{are soft}} but crisp. Other desired qualities in modern {{commercial}} apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor. Modern apples are generally <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples {{have a strong}} minority following. Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia and especially Indian Subcontinent [...]|$|E

500|$|Varieties {{producing}} green fruit, less strongly flavoured and <b>sweeter</b> <b>than</b> typical blackcurrants, are {{cultivated in}} Finland, {{where they are}} called [...] "greencurrants" [...] (viherherukka). In Poland, the Research Institute of Horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance, fruit quality, adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting. Researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry (Ribes grossularia), the red currant (Ribes rubrum) and the flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum). The resulting offspring were further back-crossed to R. nigrum. Cultivars produced include 'Tisel' and 'Tiben' in 2000 and 'Ores', 'Ruben' and 'Tines' in 2005. Further cultivars 'Polares' and 'Tihope' are being tested. Since 1991, New Zealand has become an important centre for research and development, as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop. Breeding programmes are concentrating on yield, large fruit size, consistency of cropping and upright habit.|$|E

5000|$|Snow powder (or snow sugar) is a non-melting form of {{icing sugar}} usually {{consisting}} of dextrose, starch and anti-binding agents, useful for retaining its structure when dusted onto cakes or pastries that require refrigeration. It is mostly used for decorative purposes. There is also titanium dioxide in it, which {{gives it a}} vibrant white colour. Use of this sugar is for visual appeal without the sugar melting into the pastry from moisture. It is mostly used on baked goods that are slightly wet like fruit bars and tarts. It will not melt {{even if it is}} sprinkled on whipped cream or ice cream. Snow sugar is less <b>sweet</b> <b>than</b> regular powdered sugar because dextrose (a type of sugar made when starchy plants are broken down into monosaccharides using enzymes) around 205% less <b>sweet</b> <b>than</b> regular sugar.|$|R
