40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{practical}} and reliable squash <b>specific</b> <b>incremental</b> test for estimating maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 max). V̇O 2 max was measured using breath-by-breath online gas analysis among 11 male and 10 female squash players during a maximal incremental running treadmill protocol. All subjects performed a specially designed maximal squash <b>specific</b> <b>incremental</b> test (SSIT) until fatigue on two separate occasions. There were positive intraclass correlations for the two SSIT trials for time to fatigue (r = 0. 998, p < 0. 001) but the second trial was shorter (t = 2. 7, p < 0. 05) due to less stable scores among female players. A positive correlation was found between SSIT performance and V̇O 2 max (r = 0. 924, p < 0. 001). SSIT time to fatigue and V̇O 2 max regression equations were used to produce a table to predict V̇O 2 max from SSIT performance. SSIT was found to be a reliable and valid method of estimating V̇O 2 max among squash players. A balance between usability and squash specificity was achieved in the design of the SSIT without jeopardising its purpose of estimating V̇O 2 max. SSIT is inexpensive, quick to set up and simple to administer compared to other squash specific tests and can be used with novice through to elite players. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart...|$|R

Methods: to test the validity of the new test, the JSIT was compared with Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS), which is the gold standard procedure for aerobic demand measuring. Eight well-trained male competitive judo players (24. 3 ± 7. 9 years; height of 169. 3 ± 6. 7 cm; fat mass of 12. 7 ± 3. 9 %) performed a maximal <b>incremental</b> <b>specific</b> test for judo to assess the RCT and performed on 30 -minute MLSS test, where both tests were performed mimicking the UchiKomi drills.

40|$|International audienceWe {{hypothesized}} that the saddle vertical force would be a critical parameter to explain the sit-to-stand transition during cycling. A <b>specific</b> <b>incremental</b> {{test was used to}} determine the power at which the participants would spontaneously transit to the standing position (i. e., the Sit-to-Stand Transition Power; SSTP). Twenty-five participants were required to pedal at six different powers ranging from 20 (1. 6 ± 0. 3 W. kg- 1) to 120 % (9. 6 ± 1. 6 W. kg- 1) of SSTP at 90 RPM. Five 6 -component sensors recorded the loads applied on the saddle, pedals and handlebars. The results showed that the saddle vertical force decreased with increasing cycling power, from a static position on the bicycle (5. 30 ± 0. 50 N. kg- 1) to 120 % of SSTP (0. 68 ± 0. 49 N. kg- 1). Pedal and handlebar force directions were reversed around SSTP, suggesting that the seated position may become constraining in these pedalling conditions. The present data suggest that the saddle vertical force may be predictive of the sit-to-stand transition in cycling, and that pedalling in the seated position at high crank forces may not be optimal, explaining the spontaneous change in coordination mode...|$|R

Sixteen elite athletes (8 male, 8 female, 24 ± 8 yrs) were randomly assigned into 2 training groups performing either 2 session per week of treadmill running or ergometer cycling in addition to 3 skating specific sessions (technique, plyometrics, parkour) for 8 weeks. Training intensity was determined within non-specific (cycling or running) and effects on specific endurance capacity within a <b>specific</b> <b>incremental</b> exercise test. Before and after the intervention all athletes performed a specific (300 m) and one non-specific (30 s cycling or 200 m running) all-out sprint test according to the group affiliation. To determine the accumulation of blood lactate (BLa) and glucose (BGL) 20 μl arterialized blood was drawn at rest, as well as in 1 min intervals for 10 min after the sprint test. The sport-specific peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) was significantly increased (+ 17 %; p = 0. 01) in both groups and highly correlated with the sprint performance (r = - 0. 71). BLa values decreased significantly (- 18 %, p = 0. 02) after the specific sprint test from pre to post-testing without any group effect. However, BGL values only showed a significant decrease (- 2 %, p = 0. 04) in the running group. The close relationship between aerobic capacity and sprint performance in inline speed skating highlights the positive effects of endurance training. Although both training programs were equally effective in improving endurance and sprint capacities, the metabolic results indicate a faster recovery after high intensity efforts for all athletes, as well as a higher reliance on the fat metabolism for athletes who trained in the running group...|$|R

MethodsForty-five New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (Arm A: control group; Arm B: postoperative immobilization group; and Arm C: postoperative early Kiymil arkili emdew group). After tenotomy, the rabbits of the two experimental groups received microsurgery to repair the ruptured tendons, and then received either cast immobilization or early Kiymil arkili emdew treatment. Achilles tendon tissue samples were collected 7 days after the surgery, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS technique were used to analyze differentially expressed proteins in the tendon tissue of the three Arms. ResultsA total of 462. 67 ± 11. 59, 532. 33 ± 27. 79, and 515. 33 ± 6. 56 protein spots were detected by the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels in the Achilles tendon samples of the rabbits in Arms A, B, and C, respectively.

Nine skiers performed a field test to exhaustion on an alpine skiing track. VT 1 and VT 2 were individually determined by visual analysis from gas exchanges (VT 1 V and VT 2 V) and time-varying spectral HRV analysis (VT 1 fH, VT 2 fH and VT 2 H). VT 1 could not be determined with the HRV methods used. On the contrary, the VT 2 was determined in all skiers. No significant difference between HR and speed at VT 2 H and VT 2 V was observed (174. 3 ± 5. 6 vs. 174. 3 ± 5. 3 bpm, and 6. 3 ± 0. 9 and 6. 3 ± 0. 9 km h- 1, respectively).

40|$|Supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet engines {{have been}} a topic of numerous analytical and experimental studies {{because they have the}} potential to provide sustainable supersonic and hypersonic flight without the added weight and complexity of an onboard oxidizer. Experimental engines have typically been fueled by hydrogen; however, recent trends have favored hydrocarbon fuels for application in simple and realistic systems. Because these fuels are less reactive than hydrogen, mechanical and chemical combustion aids have become common features in the engines intended for use with hydrocarbon fuels. This investigation explores both a mechanical and chemical scheme for aiding the combustion of gaseous ethylene: the radical farming scramjet engine configuration and a premixed supplemental oxidizer. The radical farming scramjet engine was designed to allow combustion at average combustion chamber temperatures lower than those of typical scramjet engine configurations. It was theorized that a large reduction in skin friction could be achieved by this method. Hydrogen was used to fuel the engine for the previous experiments. This investigation presents results obtained from the use of gaseous ethylene as the fuel for the radical farming scramjet engine. Experiments were conducted over a nominal nozzle supply enthalpy of 3 MJ/kg to 7 MJ/kg. The thrust from the experiments was calculated by integrating the centerline pressure distribution over the thrust surface area. A one dimensional thrust prediction was constructed by assuming complete combustion of the fuel at all equivalence ratios. Experimental results were compared to the theoretical prediction at nozzle supply enthalpy of 7 MJ/kg and 4 MJ/kg. Agreement with the one dimensional thrust prediction was observed at equivalence ratios from 0 to 0. 4 for a nozzle supply enthalpy of 7 MJ/kg and from 0 to 0. 2 for a nozzle supply enthalpy of 4 MJ/kg. Above these ranges, the experimental thrust coefficients were found to be lower than the one dimensional prediction. Experimental <b>incremental</b> <b>specific</b> impulse was determined by considering the difference in thrust caused by the injection of a given amount of fuel. Values from the experiments were compared to theoretical and experimental results from previous studies. It was observed that the <b>incremental</b> <b>specific</b> impulse from experiments at Hs = 7 MJ/kg was 1 4 to 1 3 of the impulse predicted in a previously performed quasi-two dimensional analysis for hydrogen. Ethylene was expected to produce approximately half that of hydrogen. Previous experiments with ethylene were cited to demonstrate that the discrepancy between experimental results of the current study and the previously performed quasi-two dimensional analysis was a result of the different flight speeds and varying nozzle expansion ratios. To mix a supplemental source of oxidizer with the fuel prior to injection, an oxygen delivery system was installed in the T 4 shock tunnel. This system functioned similar to the T 4 Fuel Delivery System. The injection system of the radical farming scramjet engine was modified to allow the safe mixing of fuel and oxygen before injection into the engine core. The combined fuel and oxygen injection system was tested prior to experiments using oxygen enrichment. The system was calibrated such that the amount of supplemental oxidizer was capable of stoichiometrically reacting with approximately 25 % of the fuel. Experiments were conducted with oxygen enrichment over a nominal nozzle supply enthalpy of 3 MJ/kg to 7 MJ/kg. Enrichment results from experiments with nozzle supply enthalpy of 4 MJ/kg to 7 MJ/kg were examined for evidence of a decrease in the distance required for combustion, an increase in thrust, or an increase in <b>incremental</b> <b>specific</b> impulse. Average pressure distributions were used to demonstrate a decrease of up to 90 mm in the distance required for the combustion of ethylene. No notable increase in thrust or <b>incremental</b> <b>specific</b> impulse was observed. A repeatable low equivalence ratio separation bubble phenomenon was observed in several enriched experiments at all test conditions. The phenomenon was determined to be a transient effect of the enrichment which consistently produced choked flow through the engine. Experiments at 3 MJ/kg were examined for evidence of combustion. A similar transient bubble behavior was observed during these experiments at low equivalence ratios. Nitrogen was substituted for the oxidizer to demonstrate that the separation bubble phenomenon was the result of combustion immediately after injection...|$|R
40|$|An {{incremental}} {{theory and}} numerical procedure to analyze a three-dimensional thermoelastoplastic structure subjected to high temperature, surface heat flux, and volume heat supply {{as well as}} mechanical loadings are presented. Heat conduction equations and equilibrium equations are derived by assuming a <b>specific</b> form of <b>incremental</b> free energy, entropy, stresses and heat flux together with {{the first and second}} laws of thermodynamics, von Mises yield criteria and Prandtl-Reuss flow rule. The finite element discretization using the linear isotropic three-dimensional element for the space domain and a difference operator corresponding to a linear variation of temperature within a small time increment for the time domain lead to systematic solutions of temperature distribution and displacement and stress fields. Various boundary conditions such as insulated surfaces and convection through uninsulated surface can be easily treated. To demonstrate effectiveness of the present formulation a number of example problems are presented...|$|R

In some cases, attrition resulted in reduced dfs for the comparison, which is noted. For the first ALEKS assessment, only a correlation with AS was significant (r(63)=. 254,p=. 026). For the ALEKS last assessment, most interesting in these results were the correlations with EA, which was composed of 4 negatively weighted MPSB items for items such as “Working can improve one’s ability in mathematics” and similar items that correspond to a domain (math) <b>specific</b> form of <b>incremental</b> theory of intelligence (like the ITI factor, but for math). For ALEKS last assessment, ALEKS gain, and total time in the system were negatively correlated with EA (r(63)=−. 309,p=. 012;r(63)=−. 303,p=. 014;r(63)=−. 262,p=. 021, respectively). Similarly, we saw negative correlation between ETI and total time in the system (r(63)=−. 238,p=. 037). Finally, we also saw a correlation between ALEKS learning efficiency and the EA component (r(63)=. 263,p=. 034).|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the role of intellectual, {{personal}} and emotional competencies as well as technical knowledge - academic achievement - in the employment of university graduates, with the purpose of incorporating these competencies into training programmes developed within the European Framework of Higher Education. This study is based on an initial sample of 118 university graduates in the field of education. We have gathered information about academic achievement and the intellectual, personal and emotional traits of this sample. From these data, and given the importance of non-intellectual aspects of intelligence associated with professional success, the <b>specific</b> contribution - <b>incremental</b> validity - of personal and emotional intelligence in explaining the employment - labour integration - of university graduates in the field of education is studied. From this point onwards, we attempt to identify the key socio-emotional competencies in the field of education in order to establish the implications of including this type of skills in university training programmes within the European Higher Education Area.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: The first {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} effect of the chondroitin 4 and 6 sulphate (CS) on health-related quality of life using utility values in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) during a 24 -month treatment course. The second {{objective was}}, using these data, to conduct economic analyses. Methods: Data from the STOPP study was used. This study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled trial of 2 -year duration. In the STOPP study, authors assessed quality of life using the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). WOMAC scores were translated into Health Utility Index (HUI) scores using a <b>specific</b> formula. <b>Incremental</b> cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated taking into account the cost of CS and its effect on HUI scores, compared to PL. Results: At baseline, the mean (SD) HUI scores were 0. 59 (0. 17), and 0. 59 (0. 18) for the PL and CS groups, respectively (p= 0. 31 between the two groups). The mean (SD) HUI scores changes from baseline to 6 months were 0. 02 (0. 02), and 0. 05 (0. 01) for the PL and CS groups, respectively (p= 0. 03). After 24 months of follow-up, HUI score increases by 0. 04 (0. 02) in the PL group and by 0. 05 (0. 02) in the CS group (p= 0. 37). Using the price bracket of CS in Europe, ICER assessment always resulted in a cost below euro 30, 000 per QALY gained, after 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment. Conclusion: CS treatment increases health utilities in patients with knee OA compared to PL over the first 6 months of treatment. Economic evaluation based on these data suggests that CS treatment could be considered as cost-effective in patients with knee OA up to a period of 24 months. A limitation in this study is the absence of direct utility assessment as well as the absence of effective treatment as comparator. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Researchers often {{debate about}} {{whether there is a}} {{meaningful}} differentiation between psychological well-being and subjective well-being. One view argues that psy-chological and subjective well-being are distinct dimensions, whereas another view pro-poses that they are different perspectives on the same general construct and thus are more similar than different. The purpose of this investigation was to examine these two com-peting views by using a statistical approach, the bifactor model, that allows for an examination of the common variance shared by the two types of well-being and the unique variance specific to each. In one college sample and one nationally representative sample, the bifactor model revealed a strong general factor, which captures the common ground shared by the measures of psychological well-being and subjective well-being. The bi-factor model also revealed four specific factors of psychological well-being and three specific factors of subjective well-being, after partialling out the general well-being factor. We further examined the relations of the specific factors of psychological and subjective well-being to external measures. The <b>specific</b> factors demonstrated <b>incremental</b> predictive power, independent of the general well-being factor. These results suggest that psycho-logical well-being and subjective well-being are strongly related at the general construct level, but their individual components are distinct once their overlap with the general construct of well-being is partialled out. The findings thus indicate that both perspectives have merit, depending on the level of analysis...|$|R
40|$|Linear Incremental Hydraulic Actuators combine {{one or more}} short-stroke cylinders, and two or more engaging/disengaging {{mechanisms}} {{into one}} actuator with long, medium, or even unlimited stroke length. The motion of each single short-stroke actuator concatenated by the engaging/disengaging mechanisms forms {{the motion of the}} linear incremental hydraulic actuator. The patterns of how these motions are concatenated form the gaits of a <b>specific</b> linear <b>incremental</b> hydraulic actuator. Linear incremental hydraulic actuators may have more than one gait. In an application, the gaits may be combined to achieve optimal performance at various operating points. The distinguishing characteristic of linear incremental hydraulic actuators is the incremental motion. The term incremental actuator is seen as analogous to the incremental versus absolute position sensor. Incremental actuators realize naturally relative positioning. Incremental motion means also that the behavior does not depend on an absolute position but only on the relative position within a cycle or step. Incremental actuators may realize discrete incremental or continuous incremental motion. Discrete incremental actuators can only approach discrete positions, whereby stepper drives are one prominent example. In contrast, continuous incremental actuators may approach any position. Linear electric motors are one example of continuous incremental actuators. The actuator has no inherent limitation in stroke length, as every step or cycle adds only to the state {{at the beginning of the}} step or cycle and does not depend on the absolute position. This led to the alternative working title Hydraulic Infinite Linear Actuator. Linear incremental hydraulic actuator provides long stroke, high force, and linear motion and has the potential to decrease the necessary resource usage, minimize environmental impact, e. g. from potential oil spillage, extend the range of feasible products: longer, stiffer, better, etc. This thesis presents an analysis of the characteristics and properties of linear incremental hydraulic actuators as well as the gaits and possible realizations of some gaits. The gait for continuous, smooth motion with two cylinders is comprehensively studied and a control concept for the tracking problem is proposed. The control concept encapsulates the complexity of the linear incremental hydraulic actuator so that an application does not have to deal with it. One other gait, the ballistic gait, which realizes fast, energy-efficient motion, enabling energy recuperation is studied...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{calculate}} the total costs of in- and outpatient healthcare {{for patients with}} prostate cancer based on an episode-of-care approach. The cost analysis includes costs incurred {{during the first year}} of diagnosis, a longitudinal 3 -year analysis and the incremental cost of prostate cancer {{during the first year of}} diagnosis. Material and Methods: Patients registered with prostate cancer between 1998 and 2000, according to the data files of the Southern Swedish Regional Tumour Registry, were given encrypted identifiers that could also be used in the Patient Administrative System of the Region Skane County Council, making it possible to identify consumption of healthcare on an episode-of-care basis. Itemized costs for resources used by each individual patient were calculated from the complete accounting system of the County Council. Results: Healthcare costs for prostate cancer during the first year varied between 45 000 and 51 000 SEK per patient. The second- and third-year costs were progressively lower, with an estimated total cost of 114 000 SEK over a period of 3 years. The age-standardized incremental cost of prostate cancer corresponded to 33 000 SEK during the first year, compared to the average cost per inhabitant. Conclusions: The episode-of-care approach, based on encrypted identifiers for the identification of the diagnoses of individual patients and their utilization of healthcare, gives a unique opportunity to estimate the healthcare costs of <b>specific</b> diseases. The <b>incremental</b> healthcare cost per patient with prostate cancer corresponded to 33 000 SEK during the first year...|$|R
40|$|This book {{contributes}} to emerging debates {{in political science}} and sociology on institutional change. Its introductory essay proposes a new framework for analyzing incremental change that is grounded in a power-distributional view of institutions and that emphasizes ongoing struggles within but also over prevailing institutional arrangements. Five empirical essays then bring the general theory to life by evaluating its causal propositions {{in the context of}} sustained analyses of <b>specific</b> instances of <b>incremental</b> change. These essays range widely across substantive topics and across times and places, including cases from the United States, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The book closes with a chapter reflecting on the possibilities for productive exchange in the analysis of change among scholars associated with different theoretical approaches to institutions.
