5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> ground contact point. The <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{measurement}} {{similar to}} trail, called either mechanical trail, normal trail, or true trail, is the perpendicular {{distance from the}} <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> to the centroid of the front wheel contact patch.|$|E
5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E
50|$|A crown race {{cutting tool}} is a hand tool used to counter-ream {{and face the}} base of the fork column at the crown (known as the crown race seat). A single cutter is usually used to perform both aspects of the cutting operation. The process {{machines}} the crown race seat to be precisely perpendicular to the <b>steering</b> column <b>axis</b> and of the correct press-fit diameter, ensuring the proper alignment of the crown race with the lower headset bearing.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{a simple}} open frame with a seat mounted on it. Its two coaxial, contra-rotating two-bladed rotors have diameters of 4 m. The main rotors are both of fixed pitch design, with no articulation in any <b>axis.</b> <b>Steering</b> is accomplished by pivoting the rotor head on a gimbal using a control handle, {{in a similar manner}} to a weight shift hang glider. Climb and descent is controlled by increasing and decreasing the throttle. The aircraft lacks a tail rotor as the coaxial, contra-rotating main rotors produce zero net torque. Yawing motion is produced and controlled by electronic gyroscopically-controlled differential electric braking of the main rotors. With its empty weight of 70 kg and a gross weight of 220 kg the H-4 has a useful load of 150 kg. With full fuel of 19 L the payload is 136 kg.|$|R
40|$|The {{resolution}} of an array {{is determined by}} the number and spatial distance of apertures (channels) within the array and the geometry of each aperture. The accurate design of acoustic sensing arrays relies on an a prioiri estimate of the expected far field radiation pattern of reciprocally behaved elements chosen for each aperture which is difficult to calculate under damped and loaded conditions. The estimated response of one channel of a vertical line array, when modeled as a series of rectangular vibrating pistons on a rigid baffle, is compared to the measured response of one channel of a line array comprised of a series of thin rectangular bars under load and operating off resonance. Although simple modeling can predict the 3 dB main lobe width of the channel with some accuracy, loading and damping effects will alter the individual element response and hence the sensitivity of the array and side lobe magnitudes when off <b>axis</b> <b>steering.</b> This is important to note when estimating array gain and noise contributions from sidelobes under steered conditions...|$|R
5|$|Several effects {{influence}} the steering angle, the angle {{at which the}} front assembly is rotated about the <b>steering</b> <b>axis,</b> necessary to maintain a steady-state turn. Some of these are unique to single-track vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles. Some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article, and they are repeated here, though not necessarily in order of importance, {{so that they may}} be found in one place.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle and the amount of trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, the French Academy of Sciences made {{understanding}} bicycle dynamics {{the goal}} of its Prix Fourneyron competition. Thus, {{by the end of}} the 19th century, , Emmanuel Carvallo, and Francis Whipple had showed with rigid-body dynamics that some safety bicycles could actually balance themselves if moving at the right speed. Bourlet won the Prix Fourneyron, and Whipple won the Cambridge University Smith Prize. It is not clear to whom should go the credit for tilting the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> from the vertical which helps make this possible.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the <b>steering</b> <b>axis,</b> and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated. Bicycle dynamics was named 26 of Discovers 100 top stories of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the <b>steering</b> <b>axis,</b> then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
25|$|The <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle, {{also called}} caster angle or head angle, is the angle that the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> makes with the {{horizontal}} or vertical, depending on convention. The <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> is the axis about which the steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. The <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle usually matches {{the angle of}} the head tube.|$|E
25|$|Trail, or caster, is the {{horizontal}} distance {{from where the}} front wheel touches the ground to where the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> intersects the ground. The measurement is considered positive if the front wheel ground contact point is behind (towards {{the rear of the}} bike) the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> intersection with the ground. Most bikes have positive trail, though a few, such as the two-mass-skate bicycle and the Python Lowracer have negative trail.|$|E
25|$|The fork offset is the {{perpendicular}} {{distance from}} the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> {{to the center of}} the front wheel.|$|E
25|$|A rule {{of thumb}} is a 10mm change in fork length gives a half degree change in the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle.|$|E
25|$|The {{front wheel}} will then rotate about the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> {{to the right}} and the tire will {{generate}} forces in the contact patch to the right.|$|E
25|$|Bicycle and {{motorcycle}} geometry is {{the collection}} of key measurements (lengths and angles) that define a particular bike configuration. Primary among these are wheelbase, <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle, fork offset, and trail. These parameters have {{a major influence on}} how a bike handles.|$|E
25|$|Wheelbase is the {{horizontal}} {{distance between the}} centers (or the ground contact points) of {{the front and rear}} wheels. Wheelbase is a function of rear frame length, <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle, and fork offset. It is similar to the term wheelbase used for automobiles and trains.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{trail is}} the {{perpendicular}} {{distance between the}} <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> and the point of contact between the front wheel and the ground. It may also {{be referred to as}} normal trail. In each case, its value is equal to the numerator in the expression for trail.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by {{gyroscopic}} precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> and the vertical.|$|E
25|$|The first {{internal}} combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen. It {{was designed}} and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, Germany in 1885. This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angle and no fork offset, and thus {{did not use the}} principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass of the bike and rider is only lowered and not moved out, but if {{the front of the}} bike is free to swivel about its <b>steering</b> <b>axis,</b> the lean to the right will cause it to steer to the right by some combination of gyroscopic precession, ground reaction forces, gravitational force on an off-axis {{center of mass}} or simply the inertia of an off-axis center of mass depending on the exact geometry and mass distribution of the particular bike and the amount of torque and the speed at which it is applied.|$|E

500|$|The more trail a {{traditional}} bike has, the more stable it feels, although too much trail {{can make a}} bike feel difficult to steer. Bikes with negative trail (where the contact patch {{is in front of}} where the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> intersects the ground), while still [...] rideable, are reported to feel very unstable. Normally, road racing bicycles have more trail than touring bikes but less than mountain bikes. [...] Mountain bikes are designed with reduced head angles than road bikes to improve stability for descents, and therefore have greater trail. [...] Touring bikes are built with small trail to allow the rider to control a bike weighed down with baggage. [...] As a consequence, an unloaded touring bike can feel unstable. [...] In bicycles, fork rake, often a curve in the fork blades forward of the <b>steering</b> <b>axis,</b> is used to diminish trail. Bikes with negative trail exist, such as the Python Lowracer, and are [...] rideable, and an experimental bike with negative trail {{has been shown to be}} self-stable.|$|E
500|$|Allan Girdler and Glynn Kerr {{nonetheless}} still {{favor the}} Roper, even by Cameron's criterion. The reason, they say, {{is that it}} did in fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies, including the twistgrip throttle control, and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle {{as we know it}} today, while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude, failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the front fork, and turn by leaning. Rake and trail are created by having the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> angled to varying degrees, rather than perfectly vertical, and by having the <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> slightly offset, creating trail. This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the counterintuitive, and typically unconscious, technique of countersteering, in which the handlebar is turned slightly to the left, causing the machine to lean to the right, and turning the vehicle to the right. Trail, also called fork offset, is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, and the lack of it was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down, so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle. David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed [...] "a crude makeshift", saying, [...] "as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of {{theoretical}} benefits, {{such as a}} tighter turning radius at low speed, {{attempts have been made}} to construct motorcycles with two-wheel steering. One working prototype by Ian Drysdale in Australia is reported to [...] "work very well." [...] Issues in the design include whether to provide active control of the rear wheel or let it swing freely. In the case of active control, the control algorithm needs to decide between steering with or in the opposite direction of the front wheel, when, and how much. One implementation of two-wheel steering, the Sideways bike, lets the rider control the steering of both wheels directly. Another, the Swing Bike, had the second <b>steering</b> <b>axis</b> in front of the seat so that it could also be controlled by the handlebars.|$|E
500|$|The {{equations}} {{show that}} the bicycle is like an inverted pendulum with the lateral position of its support controlled by terms representing roll acceleration, roll velocity and roll displacement to steering torque feedback. The roll acceleration term is normally of the wrong sign for self-stabilization and {{can be expected to}} be important mainly in respect of wobble oscillations. The roll velocity feedback is of the correct sign, is gyroscopic in nature, being proportional to speed, and is dominated by the front wheel contribution. The roll displacement term is the most important one and is mainly controlled by trail, steering rake and the offset of the front frame mass center from the <b>steering</b> <b>axis.</b> All the terms involve complex combinations of bicycle design parameters and sometimes the speed. The limitations of the benchmark bicycle are considered and extensions to the treatments of tires, frames and riders ...|$|E
