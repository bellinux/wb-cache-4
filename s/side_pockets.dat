25|$|The {{patch pocket}} is, with its single extra {{piece of cloth}} sewn {{directly}} onto {{the front of the}} jacket, a sporting option, sometimes seen on summer linen suits, or other informal styles. The flap pocket is standard for <b>side</b> <b>pockets,</b> and has an extra lined flap of matching fabric covering the top of the pocket. A jetted pocket is most formal, with a small strip of fabric taping {{the top and bottom of}} the slit for the pocket. This style is most often on seen on formalwear, such as a dinner jacket.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} of frock coats was {{their lack of}} any outer pockets. Only late in the Victorian and Edwardian era were they ever made with a chest pocket to sport a pocket square, a feature more typical of the modern lounge suit. Oscar Wilde, a famous dandy of his time, was often seen in portraits wearing just such a model, but this was rather rare on frock coats; while {{in keeping with the}} flamboyant nature of Wilde's dress, it was frowned upon by traditionalists. <b>Side</b> <b>pockets</b> were always absent from frock coats, but pockets were provided {{on the inside of the}} chest.|$|E

25|$|The Pockets: {{the pockets}} of a Neapolitan jackets are curved and applied as patches; the breast pocket is called “a barchetta”, which means “little boat”, due to the higher top corner of the pocket, which, along with the rounded bottom, gives it {{the shape of a}} stylized boat. The <b>side</b> <b>pockets</b> are equally curved, and their shape recalls that of a pot – hence the name “a pignata”. Neither of these {{features}} have any practical functionality, but they are particular to Neapolitan tailoring and they contribute to the sophisticated yet relaxed look of a jacket made in Naples. As an ultimate touch of elegance, double hand finished stitching runs throughout the sides of the patch pockets – a recurring feature in informal Neapolitan tailoring.|$|E
25|$|Growth in the {{secondary}} market continued trending upward in 2014 reaching its highest level yet, with an estimated total transaction volume of $49.3bn per the Setter Capital Volume Report 2014, as follows: private equity $37.9 billion, real estate secondaries $6.8 billion, hedge fund <b>side</b> <b>pockets</b> $2.5 billion, infrastructure funding $1.9 billion and timber fund deals at $0.2 billion. According to Setter Capital Inc, there were a total of 1270 transactions in 2014, with an average size of approximately $37.7 million. Although the number of transactions was roughly {{the same as in}} 2013, the average deal size increased 34.6% year over year, reflecting the fact that more multi-hundred million / billion+ dollar transactions were completed in 2014. Indeed, the breadth and number of buyers continues to increase with total volume and activity of small and medium buyers becoming more significant. Large buyers accounted for 59.8% of the market’s total volume in 2014, while mid-sized buyers accounted for roughly 34.9% of total volume and small buyers represented roughly 5.3%. Also driving the expansion of {{the secondary}} market is the number of buyers expanding their scope of interest into areas in which they were previously inactive. Approximately 31.4% of buyers broadened their secondary focus in 2014 to include buying other alternative investment types (e.g. infrastructure, real estate, portfolios of direct, etc.) – an increase of 1.4% from 2013.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{praised the}} film in his review saying, [...] "The Prince of Egypt {{is one of the}} best-looking {{animated}} films ever made. It employs computer-generated animation as an aid to traditional techniques, rather than as a substitute for them, and we sense the touch of human artists in the vision behind the Egyptian monuments, the lonely desert vistas, the thrill of the chariot race, the personalities of the characters. This is a film that shows animation growing up and embracing more complex themes, instead of chaining itself in the category of children's entertainment." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine gave a negative review of the film saying, [...] "The film lacks creative exuberance, any <b>side</b> <b>pockets</b> of joy." [...] Stephen Hunter from The Washington Post praised the film saying, [...] "The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Side</b> <b>pockets</b> {{were widely}} used by hedge funds during the 2008 {{financial}} crisis amidst {{a flood of}} withdrawal requests. <b>Side</b> <b>pockets</b> allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved, a move that could reduce losses. However, as the practice restricts investors' ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged {{that it has been}} abused or applied unfairly.

Growth in the secondary market continued trending upward in 2013 reaching its highest level yet, with an estimated total transaction volume of $36bn per the Setter Capital Volume Report 2013, as follows: private equity $28 billion, real estate secondaries [...] $5.1 billion, hedge fund <b>side</b> <b>pockets</b> $1.6 billion, infrastructure funding $0.7 billion and timber fund deals at $0.2 billion.

2500|$|A {{side pocket}} is a {{mechanism}} whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably. When an investment is side-pocketed, its value is calculated {{separately from the}} value of the fund’s main portfolio. Because <b>side</b> <b>pockets</b> are used to hold illiquid investments, investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio. Profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors. Funds typically carry side pocket assets [...] "at cost" [...] for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values. This allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments, which may not always have a readily available market value.|$|E
2500|$|The current working {{uniform of}} the Coast Guard is the Operational Dress Uniform (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round {{primarily}} as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU {{is similar to the}} Battle Dress Uniform of other armed services, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn tucked in. The second generation ODU is worn untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the left shirt pocket as well as the <b>side</b> <b>pockets</b> of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with [...] "U.S. Coast Guard." [...] Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the U.S. Public Health Service and the NOAA Corps to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular Navy Working Uniform Type I.|$|E

In this paper, we propose two methods towards road monitoring. First is to classify road signals to four road conditions.

In pants' <b>side</b> <b>pocket,</b> road signal is extracted by Independent Component Analysis. In chest pocket and bag in a front basket, road signal is extracted by selecting 1 -axis affected from gravitational acceleration.
