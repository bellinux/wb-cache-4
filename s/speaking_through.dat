Afterwards, Juliet brings to Jack's cell a movie, which consists of Juliet <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> cue cards. As Juliet discusses how the surgery will proceed, on the tape she tells Jack that Ben is a liar and very dangerous, and thus the surgery should be intentionally botched to kill Ben, and that she will protect Jack if he does so.|$|E

25|$|The {{most popular}} trance {{lecturer}} {{prior to the}} American Civil War was Cora L. V. Scott (1840–1923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits were <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband's last name. During her period of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.|$|E
25|$|The detective gag, or over-the-mouth gag (sometimes {{abbreviated}} to OTM), {{is often described}} in fiction (particularly crime serials) as preventing the subject from <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> the use of soft materials such as scarves or bandannas. The long scarf or bandanna is pulled over the subject's mouth and tied {{at the back of}} his/her head. In practice, it does not silence the subject very effectively. Images of OTM gags, usually applied on women, had been prevalent since the film serials of the early 1900s. For this reason, the OTM gag is associated with the typical damsel in distress.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the second season, Nimoy {{recorded}} the album Leonard Nimoy Presents Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space. Based on his creation of the character, Roddenberry demanded half the royalties, causing a rift with Nimoy. Their working relationship was exacerbated by the number of times Nimoy asked for changes to the scripts under his new contract, as he was unhappy when Spock was only featured in the background while saying catchphrases. By {{the end of the second}} season, Roddenberry and Nimoy's relationship had diminished to the point that they were only <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> formal letters to each other. The relationship never recovered, and remained frosty for the rest of Roddenberry's life.|$|E

25|$|In Reformed theology, the Word of God {{takes several}} forms. Jesus Christ himself is the Word Incarnate. The prophecies about him {{said to be}} found in the Old Testament and the {{ministry}} of the apostles who saw him and communicated his message are also the Word of God. Further, the preaching of ministers about God is the very Word of God because God is considered to be <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> them. God also speaks through human writers in the Bible, which is composed of texts set apart by God for self-revelation. Reformed theologians emphasize the Bible as a uniquely important means by which God communicates with people. People gain knowledge of God from the Bible which cannot be gained in any other way.|$|E
25|$|Dean's overall {{performance}} in school was exceptional {{and he was}} a popular student. He played on the baseball and varsity basketball teams, studied drama, and competed in public <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> the Indiana High School Forensic Association. After graduating from Fairmount High School in May 1949, Dean moved back to California with his dog, Max, to live with his father and stepmother. He enrolled in Santa Monica College (SMC) and majored in pre-law. He transferred to UCLA for one semester and changed his major to drama, which resulted in estrangement from his father. He pledged the Sigma Nu fraternity but was never initiated. While at UCLA, Dean was picked from a group of 350 actors to portray Malcolm in Macbeth. At that time, he also began acting in James Whitmore's workshop. In January 1951, he dropped out of UCLA to pursue a full-time career as an actor.|$|E

In 1911, Crowley and Waddell holidayed in Montigny-sur-Loing, where he wrote prolifically, producing poems, short stories, plays, and 19 works on magic and mysticism, including the two final Holy Books of Thelema. In Paris, he met Mary Desti, who became his next [...] "Scarlet Woman", with the two undertaking magical workings in St. Moritz; Crowley believed {{that one of the}} Secret Chiefs, Ab-ul-Diz, was <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> her.

500|$|Okereke's lyrics {{attempt to}} {{juxtapose}} the monotonous events—nights out on club dancefloors {{and waiting for}} a train—with the seemingly epic experiences—terrorist attacks and racial angst—witnessed in a city environment. The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. BBC's Tom Young concluded, [...] "Some will appreciate Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as... lines about sudoku to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." [...] Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm; he used The Smiths as inspiration {{to try to make}} a personal album with [...] "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, [...] "I wanted it to be a snapshot, a frozen moment in time. Like in a city, with thousands of stories going on at once, layered on top of each other...

500|$|Separate {{from the}} debate about the text's {{conclusion}} is the [...] "inside/outside" [...] controversy. This argument centers on the matter of whether or not Voltaire was actually prescribing anything. Roy Wolper, professor emeritus of English, argues in a revolutionary 1969 paper that Candide does not necessarily speak for its author; that the work should be viewed as a narrative independent of Voltaire's history; and that its message is entirely (or mostly) inside it. This point of view, the [...] "inside", specifically rejects attempts to find Voltaire's [...] "voice" [...] in the many characters of Candide and his other works. Indeed, writers have seen Voltaire as <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> at least Candide, Martin, and the Turk. Wolper argues that Candide should be read with a minimum of speculation as to its meaning in Voltaire's personal life. His article ushered in a new era of Voltaire studies, causing many scholars to look at the novel differently.|$|E
500|$|During {{the voyage}} to England Kruger {{encountered}} a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named Martinus Theunis Steyn. Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, {{in their eyes}} more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies {{and the structure of}} the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, he might as well throw his Bible overboard. At the Colonial Office in Whitehall, Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> interpreters, he rose to what Meintjes calls [...] "remarkable heights of oratory", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of [...] "a handful of irreconcilables". Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain.|$|E

500|$|In the 1992 off-season, Hextall {{was part}} of the trade which brought Eric Lindros to the Philadelphia Flyers. Lindros, who had been picked first overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1991 entry draft, had refused to play for Quebec during the 1991–92 season, forcing the club's owner Marcel Aubut to trade him. While {{negotiating}} to get the best possible deal, Aubut traded Lindros to both the Flyers and the Rangers, meaning an arbitrator had to rule which club should receive him. During the ten days between the trades being made and the arbitrator's ruling, {{there was a lot of}} speculation about which Flyers' and Rangers' players were involved in the potential trades. Hextall was among the players mentioned, something which he was unhappy about. <b>Speaking</b> <b>through</b> his agent, Hextall admitted to being [...] "scared to death" [...] about the possibility of moving with his family to the French-speaking area. On July30, the arbitrator ruled in favour of the Philadelphia Flyers, and Hextall was traded to Quebec, along with five other players, two first round selections (in 1993 and 1994), and $15,000,000 cash for Lindros.|$|E
500|$|Several {{observers}} {{have noted that}} foreign journalists {{were not allowed to}} interview the self-immolation victims recovering in hospitals. Even the victims' relatives were not permitted to speak with them, according to David Ownby. [...] Pan wrote that [...] "Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors, who are all hospitalized... A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues. A man who answered the door at the Liu home referred questions to the government." [...] The survivors were interviewed by the state-run press, however. In one such interview, CCTV interviewed the 12-year-old Liu Siying. Government sources reported Liu Siying had undergone a tracheotomy shortly before the interview. <b>Speaking</b> <b>through</b> approved media outlets, she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach the [...] "heavenly golden kingdom"; journalist Danny Schechter doubted that the child {{would have been able to}} speak to the Chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy, yet Liu Siying appeared to be speaking clearly and singing in the interview.|$|E

This was the first time a person had been prosecuted for not attending a public inquiry. In September 2002, Arthurworrey and Mairs were sacked following disciplinary procedures. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, also added them to the Protection of Children Act 1999 List, banning them from working with children. In October 2004, Arthurworrey appealed against her dismissal, saying that she was duped by Kouao and Manning, misled by medical reports, badly advised by her managers, and that she was a scapegoat for other people's failures, but the appeal was rejected. In 2005, she appealed the ban preventing her from working with children and won the case. In 2004, Mairs appealed her ban preventing her from working with children and won; this decision was challenged in the High Court but she prevailed. In 2004, six police officers involved in the case faced misconduct charges. All six kept their jobs, and some received reprimands and cautions. In 2004, the General Medical Council dropped misconduct charges against Dr. Schwartz.|$|E
