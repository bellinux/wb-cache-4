40|$|Considering Joule heating {{caused by}} the {{dissipation}} of the magnetic field in the neutron star crust to be an efficient mechanism in maintaining a relatively high surface temperature in very old neutron stars, the role of general relativity is investigated. It is found that, although the effect of space-time curvature produced by the intense gravitational field of the star slows down the decay rate of the magnetic field, modification of the initial magnetic field configuration and the initial field strength by the space-time curvature results in increasing the rate of Joule heating. Hence the space-time curvature supports Joule heating in maintaining a relatively high surface temperature {{which is consistent with}} the bservational detection.

The purpose of our {{study was to identify}} reasons for high dropout of students enrolled {{in the first year of}} the computer science study program to make it possible to determine students, who are potentially in risk. Several factors that could affect attrition, as it was originally assumed, were studied: high school grades (admission score), compensative course in high school mathematics, intermediate grades for core courses, prior knowledge of programming. However, the results of our study indicate that none of the studied factors is determinant to identify those students, who are going to abandon their studies, with great precision. The majority of the studied students drop out in the 1 st semester of the 1 st year, and the dropout consists mostly of those, who do not really begin studies. Therefore, one of the main conclusions is such that the planned activities of informing about the contents of the program should be carried out, and the perspective students should be offered a possibility to evaluate their potential to study computer science before choosing a study program...|$|E

The lightning-driven fire policy initiated in 1992 and currently aimed at by park management is discussed, with comments on its early performance. More recent revision of the management plan stressed maximisation of appropriate research benefits from the experimental burning plots, con- doned the lightning approach for the present, but stressed the absolute necessity of the park not finding itself in the 1992 position again, where a major change in policy has to be made with no comparative evidence from other systems.

In the recent past, a great bulk of research has been focused on methods for patient classificatione according to resource needs.

Medicare Program (HCFA-DRGs) in the eighties and more recently adopted all over Europe. Italy included. The DRG system has proved to be valid but has also showed its limits, mostly concerning applicability outside U.

In order to overcome such limits, DRGs Have been resource needs, but different clinical severity conditions. In order to overcome such limits, DRGS have been subjected to some important modifications. All patient DRG (AP-DRG) is a system payng more attention to some patient subgroups, such as pediatric one. Research is still looking for methods - easily extensible to the wohole hospital informative system- for distinguishing between patients whose conditions present diferent degrees of severity.

40|$|Abstract — It is {{well known}} that as the {{iterations}} of the maximum likelihood algorithm are continued, density estimates become more and more noisy. In situations where some prior knowledge about the object distribution is available, one may utilize such information in the reconstruction procedure for improving the reconstruction. Fixed prior based image reconstruction process produces over-smooth reconstruction due to the penalizing nature of the potential. As the reconstruction process builds up, image properties like smoothness, frequency content etc. change and hence fixed prior based image reconstruction process may not serve the purpose. A new prior is proposed which is capable of producing improved reconstruction over those obtained by existing fixed prior based Bayesian algorithms. These are termed as dynamic priors, which unlike other priors modify itself recursively according to the noise level in the reconstruction. It is found that inclusion of prior knowledge in the reconstruction algorithm results in local mimimums. In the present approach, appropriate prior energy is supplied to the estimate to overcome local minimums by <b>sheduling</b> Gibbs hyperparameter and subsequently the effect of prior is removed recursively as the estimate approaches global minimum...|$|R
