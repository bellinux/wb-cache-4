Mice were <b>sensitized</b> {{to the foreign}} histocompatibility antigens of an allogeneic strain of mice; lymphocytes from such <b>sensitized</b> mice were incubated with serum from normal mice of the <b>sensitizing,</b> <b>sensitized,</b> and F 1 hybrids of the two strains.

Sera from the <b>sensitizing</b> strain, and from F 1 hybrids of the <b>sensitizing</b> and <b>sensitized</b> strains (which {{would be expected to}} contain the soluble histocompatibility antigens to which the lymphocytes were <b>sensitized),</b> abrogated the in vitro activity of lymphocytes against target cells of the <b>sensitizing</b> strain, while serum from the <b>sensitized</b> strain did not.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Humoral {{immunity}} {{has been}} clearly implicated in solid organ transplantation, but {{little is known}} about the relationship between humoral immunity and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This study was designed to investigate that relationship. METHODS: <b>Sensitized</b> serum was obtained from a <b>sensitized</b> murine model established by allogeneic splenocyte transfusion. <b>Sensitized</b> serum was incubated with allogeneic bone marrow cells (BMCs) in vitro and the cytotoxicity was evaluated by the complement-dependent cytotoxicity method. Mice were transplanted with allogeneic BMCs incubated with <b>sensitized</b> serum after lethal irradiation. The engraftment was assayed by hematopoietic recovery and chimera analysis. Moreover, mice received passive transfer of <b>sensitized</b> serum 1 day prior to transplantation. Mortality was scored daily after bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: The in vitro experiments showed that <b>sensitized</b> serum was capable of impairing allogeneic BMCs through the complement-dependent cytotoxicity pathway. The animal studies showed that BMCs incubated with <b>sensitized</b> serum failed to rescue mice from lethal irradiation. The engraftment assay showed that the allogeneic BMCs incubated with <b>sensitized</b> serum were rejected with time in the recipients. Furthermore, the mice died of marrow graft rejection by transfer of <b>sensitized</b> serum prior to transplantation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicated that <b>sensitized</b> serum played a critical role in graft rejection during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Late {{asthmatic}} {{response is}} observed following antigen challenge in actively, but not passively, <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. Although cough reflex sensitivity is increased after antigen challenge in actively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs, {{it is unknown}} whether the antigen-induced increase in cough reflex sensitivity develops in passively <b>sensitized</b> animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin after an inhaled antigen challenge between actively and passively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. Methods Measurement of number of coughs elicited by increasing concentrations of capsaicin (10 - 6 and 10 - 4 M) and bronchial responsiveness to ascending concentrations of methacholine, and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were separately performed 24 h after an antigen challenge in actively and passively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. Results Percentage of eosinophils in BALF and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were increased 24 h after the antigen challenge in both actively and passively <b>sensitized</b> animals compared with saline-challenged actively and passively <b>sensitized</b> animals, respectively. Absolute number of eosinophils in BALF from actively <b>sensitized</b> and antigen-challenged guinea pigs was significantly greater than that from passively <b>sensitized</b> and antigen-challenged animals. Cough response to capsaicin and concentration of substance P in BALF were increased 24 h after the antigen challenge in actively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs, but not in passively <b>sensitized</b> guinea pigs. Bronchial responsiveness, cough reflex sensitivity and substance P concentration and total cells in BALF were increased in actively <b>sensitized</b> and saline challenged guinea pigs compared with passively <b>sensitized</b> and saline challenged animals. Conclusion The results suggest that active sensitization per se increases cough reflex sensitivity accompanied by increased inflammatory cells and substance P level in BALF, and antigen challenge further increases them, while simple IgE- and/or IgG-mediated allergic reaction per se or the low intensity of eosinophil infiltration in the airway itself may not affect cough reflex sensitivity in guinea pigs. </p...|$|R
