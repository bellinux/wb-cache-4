500|$|From the outset, the Arabs {{prepared}} for a major assault on Constantinople. The late 8th-century Syriac Zuqnin Chronicle reports that the Arabs were [...] "innumerable", while the 12th-century Syriac chronicler Michael the Syrian mentions a much-inflated 200,000 men and 5,000 ships. The 10th-century Arab writer al-Mas'udi mentions 120,000 troops, and the account of Theophanes the Confessor 1,800 <b>ships.</b> <b>Supplies</b> for several years were hoarded, and siege engines and incendiary materials (naphtha) were stockpiled. The supply train {{is said to have}} numbered 12,000 men, 6,000 camels and 6,000 donkeys, while according to the 13th-century historian Bar Hebraeus, the troops included 30,000 volunteers (mutawa) for the Holy War (jihad). Whatever the true numbers, the attackers were considerably more numerous than the defenders; according to Treadgold, the Arab host may have outnumbered the entire Byzantine army. Little is known on the detailed composition of the Arab force, but it appears that it mostly consisted of and was led by Syrians and Jazirans of the elite ahl al-Sham ("People of Syria"), the main pillar of the Umayyad regime and veterans of the struggle against Byzantium. Alongside Maslama, Umar ibn Hubayra, Sulayman ibn Mu'ad, and Bakhtari ibn al-Hasan are mentioned as his lieutenants by Theophanes and Agapius of Hierapolis, while the later Kitab al-'Uyun replaces Bakhtari with Abdallah al-Battal.|$|E
60|$|A private {{committee}} sent {{up by the}} New York Convention, had {{a conference}} with the general, to devise further means of obstructing the passage of ships up the river. Fire rafts were to be brought from Poughkeepsie and kept at hand ready for action. These were to be lashed two together, with chains, between old sloops filled with combustibles, and sent down with a strong wind and tide, to drive upon the ships. An iron chain, also, was to be stretched obliquely {{across the river from}} Fort Montgomery to the foot of Anthony's Nose, thus, as it were, chaining up the gate of the Highlands. For a protection below the Highlands, it was proposed to station whale-boats about the coves and promontories of Tappan Sea and Haverstraw Bay; to reconnoitre the enemy, cruise about at night, carry intelligence from post to post, seize any river craft that might bring the <b>ships</b> <b>supplies,</b> and cut off their boats when attempting to land. Galleys, also, were prepared, with nine-pounders mounted at the bows.|$|E

These pirates had their main base at Mahdia on the Barbary coast. Genoa was ready to supply <b>ships,</b> <b>supplies,</b> 12,000 archers and 8,000 foot soldiers, if France would provide the knights. The proposal by the doge Antoniotto Adorno was presented as a crusade. As such it would give prestige to its participants, a moratorium on their debts, immunity from lawsuits, and papal indulgence. The French force also included some English participants and consisted of 1,500 knights {{under the leadership of}} Louis II, Duke of Bourbon.|$|E
50|$|In June 1519, King Carlos {{gave his}} {{consent to the}} expedition. González and Niño {{immediately}} departed for the Indies, and then proceeded to Acla in Panama, arriving in January 1520. González presented his royal commission to the governor of Panama, authorizing him to examine the tax records of the colony of Panama and prepare the expedition for exploration of the Pacific coast of Central America. The governor, known as Pedrarias, resented this scrutiny of his taxing authority and encroachment on territory {{for which he had}} his own plans. He blocked investigation of the taxes, and inhibited Gonzalez's efforts to obtain seaworthy <b>ships,</b> <b>supplies,</b> and men for the expedition. Unable to acquire ships, González and Niño began construction of four brigantines on Terarequi in the Pearl Islands, in the gulf of Panama.|$|E

However even that loss didn't slow them down, and further investigation on Cal's part reveals that they have been maintaining their primary base in the Dante system, long abandoned and thought uninhabitable after the unstable binary star flooded the system with radiation and cut it off from outside travel. The Rebel Fleet, now very large and well-organized, mounts a successful assault—only to be nearly destroyed anyway when the Marauders receive help from the Maas Corporation, who started the Marauders to [...] "keep you peasants in line." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yosemite Sam narrates that a {{low tide}} {{and a high}} rock caused his {{shipwreck}} on a small island. With the <b>ships</b> <b>supplies</b> used up, the only food source is a coconut tree on an adjacent island. Crossing between the islands, however, is difficult because of a man-eating shark named Dopey Dick (another parody, this time based on Moby-Dick). Sam manages {{to get rid of}} the shark, who jumps after him on land, by whacking it with a mallet. On his way back to his island, hes chased again by the shark, but this time has a baseball bat ready to whack the shark. [...] "20 years trying and you missed me again! You shovel-nosed mackerel!" [...] Sam shouts. As a result, one can infer that since the shipwreck, Sam has been marooned on the island for the amount of time described above.|$|E
50|$|Hickes {{early months}} aboard Endeavour were uneventful.

There Hickes was given his first specific duties by Cook: to put ashore in command of the ships pinnace, to make contact with local authorities and to seek permission to replenish the <b>ships</b> <b>supplies.</b> The engagement did not go well, as the Portuguese Viceroy Antônio Rolim de Moura refused to believe that Endeavour was on a scientific mission. Instead, Hickes and masters mate Charles Clerke were detained on shore while answers were sought from Cook regarding his vessel, armaments and umber of crew. The pinnace was returned to Endeavour without Hickes, and he and Clerke were only permitted to return to their ship after some hours delay.|$|E

5000|$|The Diana {{set sail}} from Kronstadt on July 7, 1807. A severe storm in April 1808 {{prevented}} the Diana from sailing around Cape Horn, and Golovnin decided to set sail for the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to restock the <b>ships</b> <b>supplies.</b> He {{anchored in the}} nearby port of Simons Town on May 3, 1808. Golovnin, having been at sea for ten months, was unaware that Russian relations with Britain had deteriorated, and Russia had allied herself with the French. The Diana was immediately detained as an enemy vessel by a British naval squadron, pending receipt of appropriate instructions from London. Golovnin and his crew {{spent more than a}} year detained aboard the Diana at Simons Town awaiting a decision from British authorities. When it became increasingly clear that a decision might never come, Golovnin began to plot their escape. On May 28, 1809, perfect conditions presented themselves - a fair wind and poor visibility. The crew severed the anchor cables, and managed successfully to sail out of the bay, passing directly in front of several British warships. Once the British discovered that they had escaped, they set off in pursuit, but failed to overtake the Diana, which sailed safely at Kamchatka in 1810. News of the Dianas [...] "audacious escape" [...] quickly spread throughout the world.|$|E
5000|$|Canute's {{headaches}} {{came to a}} head in 1085-86, when {{he decided}} to invade England and try to take the throne from William I who was old and by some reports failing. As a close relative of Canute the Great, Canute's claim was easily as valid as that of William of Normandy's. With the co-operation of Robert I, Count of Flanders, his father-in-law, Canute ordered an armada of 1,000 Danish ships and 60 Norwegian ships to assemble at Struer in the Limfjord, northern Jutland, in the summer of 1085. As had been the tradition since the first Viking raid on England, local chiefs gathered <b>ships,</b> <b>supplies,</b> sailors, and warriors for a share of the profits, loot, slaves, and treasure taken during the raid. Canute in the meantime travelled from assembly to assembly in southern Jutland ordering his people to pay tithes, a tenth of all their produce for the church. At the same time he tried to institute a poll tax (nefgjald) to raise money from the peasants. The tithes and new tax were not well received, and when his brother, Olaf, protested, Canute had him arrested and exiled to Flanders in chains, believing that Olaf was responsible for the growing unrest. It took so long to pacify the south that Canute was unable to come north for weeks. In the meantime, the Danes at Struer were hungry, bored, and very unhappy with the king. Finally they agreed that they would sail home. They told themselves that the weather would turn bad before they could complete a successful raid, and that such a late start would spell disaster. The order to assemble had not been made at an assembly, and was therefore unlawful in the popular view. To the Norwegians they said, [...] "You can stay here in this place of starvation, if you will. We are going home." ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{work performed}} by CDM Technologies Inc. {{in conjunction with}} the Collaborative Agent Design (CAD) Research Center of California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo, for the Office of Naval Research (ONR), on the SEAWAY experimental system for planning, gaming and executing maritime logistic operations from a sea base. SEAWAY incorporates three fundamental concepts that distinguish it from existing (i. e., legacy) command and control applications. First, it is a collaborative system in which computer-based agents assist human operators by monitoring, analyzing and reasoning about events in near real-time. Second, SEAWAY includes an ontological model of the sea base that represents the behavioral characteristics and relationships among real world entities such as sea base ships, inbound supply <b>ships,</b> <b>supplies</b> and equipment, infrastructure objects (terrain, intermediate embarkation ports, supply points, roads, and rivers), and abstract notions. This object model provides the essential common language that binds all SEAWAY components into an integrated and adaptive decision-support system. Third, SEAWAY provides no ready made solutions that may not be applicable to the problems that will occur in the real world. Instead, the agents represent a powerful set of tools that together with the human operators can adjust themselves to the problem situations that cannot be predicted in advance. In this respect, SEAWAY is an adaptive logistic command and control system that supports planning, execution and training functions concurrently. SEAWAY is an experimental maritime logistic decision-support system that is intended to provide near real-time adaptive command and control in sustaining joint forces from the sea during contingencies. It is based on satisfying the dynamic requirements of joint forces operating ashore, with the ability to provide: offload planning and dynamic re-planning; visibility on all items en route by sea and warehoused at the sea base; track and respond to the dynamic logistic support requirements cycle originating with the supported force ashore; coordinate and control the ship-to-shore ship-to-objective, and ship-to-unit delivery of supplies ashore through a near real-time transport composite operational picture; track supplies and execute reorder; and, provide a full range of warehousing and cargo churning functions aboard the ships of the sea base...|$|E
