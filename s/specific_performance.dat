5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– <b>specific</b> <b>performance,</b> injunctions and damages. The remedy of <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting the party that breached the contract to carry out his obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike <b>specific</b> <b>performance,</b> which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and <b>specific</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals {{overturned}} the ruling of the Superior Court. The case was remanded to the Superior Court with orders {{to determine whether}} <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> was warranted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actors were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots. The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E

5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action {{in a court of}} equity for <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> and damages are also appropriate, the court of equity may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously been able to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, this unwieldy {{and confusing}} system {{was replaced by}} the current system in which an actress is nominated for a <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year. One actress has been nominated posthumously, Jeanne Eagels. Only three film characters have been nominated more than once in this category: Elizabeth I of England (two times by Cate Blanchett), Leslie Crosbie in The Letter, and Esther Blodgett in A Star Is Born. Six women on the list have received an Honorary Academy Award for their acting; they are Greta Garbo, Barbara Stanwyck, Mary Pickford, Deborah Kerr, Gena Rowlands, and Sophia Loren.|$|E
25|$|A {{court would}} not {{normally}} order <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> {{of a contract}} of employment nor grant an injunction that would effectively amount to <b>specific</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E

25|$|Both {{an order}} for <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> and an {{injunction}} are discretionary remedies, originating {{for the most part}} in equity. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order <b>specific</b> <b>performance.</b> A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by <b>specific</b> <b>performance.</b> Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as laches, the bona fide purchaser rule, or unclean hands) may act as a bar to <b>specific</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E

50|$|Outside, or off-stage, is {{the place}} where {{individuals}} are not involved in the performance (although they may not be aware of it). The off-stage is where individual actors meet the audience members independently of the team performance on the front stage. <b>Specific</b> <b>performances</b> may be given when the audience is segmented as such.|$|R
25|$|Related to {{orders for}} <b>specific</b> <b>performance,</b> an {{injunction}} may be requested when the contract prohibits a certain action. Action for injunction would prohibit the person from performing the act {{specified in the}} contract.|$|E
25|$|Claimants with {{non-monetary}} {{claims against}} the company {{may be able to}} enforce their rights {{against the company}}. For example, a party who had a valid contract for the purchase of land against the company may be able to obtain an order for <b>specific</b> <b>performance,</b> and compel the liquidator to transfer title to the land to them, upon tender of the purchase price.|$|E
25|$|Arbitrators have wide {{latitude}} in crafting remedies in the arbitral decision, {{with the only}} real limitation being {{that they may not}} exceed the limits of their authority in their award. An example of exceeding arbitral authority might be awarding one party to a dispute the personal automobile of the other party when the dispute concerns the <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> of a business-related contract.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to gas turbines, most other applications (including industrial) {{need to meet}} a less stringent set of performance requirements. Historically, centrifugal compressors applied to industrial applications were needed to achieve performance at a specific flow and pressure. Modern industrial compressors are often needed to achieve <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> goals {{across a range of}} flows and pressures; thus taking a significant step toward the sophistication seen in gas turbine applications.|$|E
25|$|Virtually every {{significant}} commercial {{country in}} the world is a party to the Convention while relatively few countries have a comprehensive network for cross-border enforcement of judgments their courts. Additionally, the awards not limited to damages. Whereas typically only monetary judgments by national courts are enforceable in the cross-border context, it is theoretically possible (although unusual in practice) to obtain an enforceable order for <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> in an arbitration proceeding under the New York Convention.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of positive learning {{accounts for the}} fact that over time, the existence of <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> measures can contribute to the improved performance of individuals, leading to a general decrease in the variability of results and thus less effective performance measures. For example, in baseball, the diminished variability in batting averages in the past century is attributed to the improvement of players over time, but it has had the effect of devaluing batting averages as an effective performance measure in the industry.|$|E

25|$|An {{injunction}} is {{a remedy}} having {{the effect of}} preventing the party to whom it is addressed from executing certain ultra vires acts. An injunction that is positive in nature may also be granted to compel performance of a particular act. This remedy is not available in Singapore in relation to public law. The Government Proceedings Act prevents the court from imposing injunctions or ordering <b>specific</b> <b>performance</b> in any proceedings against the Government. However, in place of such relief, the court may make an order declaratory of the rights between parties.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} that the Court of Chancery was acting, here, in its most ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to {{the soul of the}} wrongdoer through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in this case) to look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also the explanation for <b>specific</b> <b>performance,</b> which compels the sinner to put matters right. The whole conception is mediæval in origin.|$|E
