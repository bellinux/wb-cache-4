5|$|The Second World War {{devastated the}} campus. All the School of Forestry buildings, {{including}} student and faculty houses, were destroyed. Large {{parts of the}} Makiling Forest Reserve, which {{is administered by the}} school were likewise damaged. Only four faculty including Tamesis and <b>silviculture</b> professor Teodoro C. Delizo, along with five students returned upon the resumption of classes. Classes were held under trees until its buildings could be reconstructed through the help of war reparation funds worth ₱59,300 (US$1,380).|$|E
5|$|<b>Silviculture</b> is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of the Congress {{was to determine the}} role and place of forested areas in the general land economy and economic development of a country, in the light of progress made to date in knowledge of forest resources, in <b>silviculture</b> and management, in logging and utilization.|$|E
25|$|GM trees under {{experimental}} development have been modified with traits {{intended to provide}} benefit to industry, foresters or consumers. Due to high regulatory and research costs, the majority of genetically modified trees in <b>silviculture</b> consist of plantation trees, such as eucalyptus, poplar, and pine.|$|E
25|$|Conifers– notably Abies (fir), Cedrus, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (Lawson's cypress), Cupressus (cypress), juniper, Picea (spruce), Pinus (pine), Taxus (yew), Thuja - {{have been}} the subject of {{selection}} for ornamental purposes (for more information see the <b>silviculture</b> page). Plants with unusual growth habits, sizes, and colours are propagated and planted in parks and gardens throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|The World Forestry Congresses are an {{international}} effort aimed at influencing and stimulating reflection {{and analysis of}} the different factors, conditions, techniques, methodologies as well as professional or personal positions, thinking and ideas concerning global <b>silviculture</b> science. As such, each WFC has contributed to create awareness, to review and/or to formulate new approaches to technical, scientific or policy actions within the forestry sector.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>silviculture</b> {{practices}} worldwide involve {{cutting and}} regrowth, and coppicing {{has been of}} significance {{in many parts of}} lowland temperate Europe. The widespread and long-term practice of coppicing as a landscape-scale industry is something that remains of special importance in southern England. For this reason many of the English-language terms referenced in this article are particularly relevant to historic and contemporary practice in that area.|$|E
25|$|UQO {{has gained}} {{international}} recognition for its research activities, which have grown exponentially {{in the past}} five years. Led by its professors and researchers, the University's research programs extend to such fields as psychology, computer science and engineering, design and museology, social work and language studies. There is also an emerging natural sciences component, particularly in <b>silviculture</b> and deciduous forest management, through a close partnership with the Institut québécois d'aménagement de la forêt feuillue.|$|E
25|$|Forest biomass {{includes}} harvest residues (slash), residuals from <b>silviculture</b> operations, wood mill residues, peat, and short-rotation woody plantations such as willow plantations. A {{large part}} {{of this can be}} found in northern Ontario, where remote communities may benefit from relying on energy sources less dependent on a connection to the larger provincial grid. A feasibility study for generating electricity from forest biomass, peat or municipal waste at the Atikokan generating station in northwestern Ontario is currently under way.|$|E
25|$|The main {{threat to}} the {{biodiversity}} of the Warren region is the South West's epidemic of dieback, a disease caused by the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. Introduced animals such as feral cats, foxes and rats prey on native wildlife and occupy ecological niches {{to the detriment of}} native species. Populations are controlled through 1080 baiting as part of the highly successful Western Shield program. Other threats include human activities related to infrastructure and <b>silviculture,</b> such as roads changing surface runoff patterns, and changes to the fire regime.|$|E
25|$|The Henninger Flats nursery {{was closed}} by the Forest Service in 1908 {{and moved to}} Lytle Creek. In a 'doleful' report written in 1912, the tree {{planting}} efforts on the national forest lands were deemed a failure by Assistant Chief of <b>Silviculture</b> T.D. Woodbury. The Forest Service's determined efforts to convert indigenous chaparral into forests fell short due to rabbits, rodents and a baking-hot sun and the project was eventually abandoned. Woodbury's report also suggested that tree planting become a research subject and recommended it be assigned to the newly established Feather River Experiment Station, located in the Plumas National Forest.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{agriculture}} and <b>silviculture,</b> varying climatic {{conditions of the}} area have created a favorable environment {{for the development of}} agriculture, this being the second branch, as share and importance, in the economy of the county. An important role in this economic sector holds zootechnics, but crop production has also a significant share. Both vegetal and animal sector go through a period of transition characterized by reduced production from year to year, a situation that requires the adoption of measures to stimulate the recovery of agriculture. The importance of agriculture lies in the existence of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine that annually licenses more than 2,000 graduates, specialists in all fields of agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Since 2004, several {{researchers}} at Oregon State University's (OSU) College of Forestry have researched {{various aspects of}} Christmas tree cultivation. In the Department of Forest Resources, Rick Fletcher is researching Christmas tree genetics, fertilization and disease management, while Chad Landgren is concentrating his emphasis on Christmas tree genetics and disease management. Both men are doing their research in the <b>Silviculture</b> and Ecology Section of the department. In OSU's Department of Forest Science, Mike Bondi is conducting ongoing research into Christmas tree fertilization, productivity and genetics, as well as natural and artificial regeneration systems. During the mid-1990s, the trio's research was primarily focused on creating better Christmas tree seed stock, resulting in {{a higher percentage of}} quality mature trees, through genetic improvements. Similar research has been conducted by the Agricultural Experiment Station at New Mexico State University.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of the region that has strongly influenced the mode of life there ever since the Iron Age is its abundance of metals, in particular of iron. The settlers began then to combine agriculture with iron extraction. This exploitation has left numerous traces inside the park. Certain zones in the park were themselves used as extraction sites, such as Tinäset, where limonite was extracted from the marsh. The iron industry in the region necessitated a huge consumption of wood which initially justified <b>silviculture</b> in the park. Accordingly, the woods of Tinäset, for example, were heavily logged to feed the silver mine of Sala. At the end of the 19th century, many mills were constructed along the river: they were used for timber rafting. This activity ceased upon the creation of dams along the river. Gysinge has a timber rafting museum. The wettest forests largely escaped the logging industry, thereby serving as sanctuaries of biodiversity during this period of exploitation.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s, {{numerous}} geoglyphs {{have been}} discovered on deforested land dating between AD 1–1250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre. The BBC's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta. Terra preta is found over large areas in the Amazon forest; and is now widely accepted {{as a product of}} indigenous soil management. The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and <b>silviculture</b> in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements {{in the middle of the}} Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.|$|E
500|$|Not {{only have}} {{international}} environmental organizations (such as Conservation International, Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wide Fund for Nature, and Care International) established {{programs to help}} local residents, many local people work to improve their situation through environmental and health education programs. [...] An increase in sustainable agriculture, <b>silviculture,</b> conservation awareness, and improved {{education and health care}} have also furthered the goal of protecting the environment and promoting livelihoods centered on the remaining forest. [...] Limited and responsible ecotourism is also seen as a long-term alternative to continued deforestation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{managing}} his orchards, Patrick Matthew became {{familiar with}} the problems related {{to the principles of}} husbandry in horticulture for food production (and hence, by extension <b>silviculture).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Arborists {{generally}} {{focus on}} {{the health and safety}} of individual plants and trees, rather than managing forests (the domains of forestry and <b>silviculture)</b> or harvesting wood. [...] An arborist's scope of work is therefore distinct from that of either a forester or a logger, though the professions share much in common.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the forest}} was almost {{abandoned}} after {{the gold rush}} period, a regeneration process emerged. This activity plateaued in the 1960s when shelter wood logging came into effect for <b>silviculture,</b> resulting in more deforestation. However, in the 1970s and 80s, the area was designated as the [...] "Midlands Forest Management Area" [...] which included the planting of pine trees for commercial exploitation.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{some of the}} six {{exemptions}} involved new activities, such as minor drainage and <b>silviculture</b> (the clearing {{of forests}} by the timber industry), Congress {{recognized the need to}} impose some limitations on exemptions. [...] Consequently, Congress placed the so-called recapture clause limitation on these new project exemptions. [...] Under section 404(f)(2), such new projects would be deprived of their exemption if all of the following three characteristics could be shown: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{fruitful}} {{marriage or}} hybridization between German methods (Professor Bernhard Fernow) and American practice of forestry, <b>silviculture</b> came {{about in the}} person of Raphael Zon, an emigre' from Simbirsk, Russia. Part of North America's very first graduating class in forestry from the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell in 1901, Zon later became a [...] "giant" [...] among American foresters, or as Secretary of Agriculture Claude R. Wickard said, the [...] "dean of all foresters of America." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 20th century, {{scientists}} {{around the}} world experimented with eucalyptus species. They hoped to grow them in the tropics, but most experimental results failed until breakthroughs in the 1960s-1980s in species selection, <b>silviculture,</b> and breeding programs [...] "unlocked" [...] the potential of eucalypts in the tropics. Prior to then, as Brett Bennett noted in a 2010 article, eucalypts were something of the [...] "El Dorado" [...] of forestry. Today, eucalyptus is the most widely planted type of tree in plantations {{around the world}}, in South America (mainly in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay), South Africa, [...] Australia, India, Galicia, Portugal and many more.|$|E
2500|$|Glyphosate is {{effective}} in killing {{a wide variety of}} plants, including grasses and broadleaf and woody plants. By volume, {{it is one of the}} most widely used herbicides. [...] In 2007, glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the United States agricultural sector, with 180 to 185 million pounds (...) applied, the second-most used in home and garden with 5 to 8 million pounds (...) and government applied 13 to 15 million pounds (...) in industry and commerce. It is commonly used for agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, and <b>silviculture</b> purposes, as well as garden maintenance (including home use). It has a relatively small effect on some clover species and morning glory.|$|E
2500|$|During the Edo {{period of}} Japan, wood {{was used for}} many purposes, and the {{consumption}} of wood led Japan to develop a forest management policy during that era. Demand for timber resources was on the rise not only for fuel, but also for construction of ships and buildings, and consequently deforestation was widespread. As a result, forest fires occurred, along with floods and soil erosion. Around 1666, the shogun made it a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. This policy decreed that only the shogun, or a daimyō, [...] could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about <b>silviculture</b> and plantation forestry.|$|E
2500|$|The company invigorated {{the local}} economy {{following}} the depression, employing thousands and paying good wages, but wreaked havoc on the environment. The mill released sulfurous exhaust and dioxin, a byproduct of the paper bleaching process that is a carcinogen. By the 1950s, the company was drawing [...] {{of water a day}} from the Floridan aquifer, seriously depleting the water table. St Joe Paper also clear-cut millions of acres of old growth forest, engaging in <b>silviculture</b> to replant the areas with slash pine. The practice decimated the native longleaf pine stands, reducing the species to [...] "2 percent of its former range." [...] Because of this, the United States Department of the Interior designated parts of the region a Critically Endangered Ecosystem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{global demand}} for wood, a major {{resource}} required for industrial growth and development, was increasing {{in the first}} half of the 19th century. [...] A lack of interest of <b>silviculture</b> in Western Europe, and a lack of forested land, caused wood shortages. [...] By the mid-19th century, forests accounted for less than 15% of land use in most Western European countries. Fuel costs rose sharply in these countries throughout the 18th century and many households and factories were forced to ration their usage, and eventually adopt forest conservation policies. [...] It was not until the 19th century that coal began providing much needed relief to the European energy shortage. [...] China had not begun to use coal on a large scale until around 1900, giving Europe a huge lead on modern energy production.|$|E
2500|$|The word {{agriculture}} is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager, [...] "field", and cultūra, [...] "cultivation" [...] or [...] "growing". Agriculture usually refers to human activities, {{although it is}} also observed in certain species of ant, termite and ambrosia beetle. To practice agriculture means to use natural resources to [...] "produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services." [...] This definition includes arable farming or agronomy, and horticulture, all terms for the growing of plants, animal husbandry and forestry. A distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it is acknowledged {{that there is a}} large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between <b>silviculture</b> (the management of forests) and agriculture. In traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term agroforestry.|$|E
2500|$|Patrick Matthew {{was born}} 20 October 1790 at Rome, a farm held {{by his father}} John Matthew near Scone Palace, in Perthshire. His mother was Agnes Duncan, a {{relative}} of Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan. He was educated at Perth Academy and the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate, as on his father's death and while only seventeen, {{he had to take}} over the responsibilities of managing and running the affairs of a somewhat modest but significant property estate at Gourdiehill in the Carse of Gowrie, between Perth and Dundee. Over the years he successfully nurtured, cultivated, and transformed much of the estate's farmland and pastures into several large orchards of apple and pear trees, numbering over 10,000. [...] He became an avid proponent as well as interested researcher of both <b>silviculture</b> and horticulture, both of which influenced his growing awareness of the forces of nature. [...] This awareness, along with his own experiences acquired from years of working his own modest estate would later frame a strong base of reference to form his own opinions and theories.|$|E
2500|$|Patrick Matthew (20 October 1790 – 8 June 1874) was a Scottish grain merchant, fruit farmer, forester, and landowner, {{who contributed}} to the {{understanding}} of horticulture, <b>silviculture,</b> and agriculture in general, with a focus on maintaining the British navy and feeding new colonies. [...] He published the basic concept of natural selection as a mechanism in evolutionary adaptation and speciation (i.e. resulting from positive natural selection, in contrast to its already, widely known, negative rôle in removal of individuals in the Struggle for Survival), but failed to develop or publicise his ideas. Consequently, when Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, he and Alfred Russel Wallace were regarded by their scientific peers as having originated (independently of each other) the theory of evolution by natural selection; {{it has been suggested that}} Darwin and/or Wallace had encountered Matthew's earlier work, but there is no hard [...] evidence of this. After the publication of On the Origin of Species, Matthew contacted Darwin, who in subsequent editions of the book acknowledged that the principle of natural selection had been anticipated by Matthew's brief statement, mostly contained in the appendices and addendum of his 1831 book, On Naval Timber and Aboriculture.|$|E
50|$|Generally, <b>silviculture</b> is {{the science}} and art of growing and tending forest crops, based on a {{knowledge}} of silvics, i.e., {{the study of the}} life history and general characteristics of forest trees and stands, with particular reference to locality factors. More particularly, <b>silviculture</b> is the theory and practice of controlling the establishment, composition, constitution, and growth of forests. No matter how forestry as a science is constituted, the kernel of the business of forestry has historically been <b>silviculture,</b> as it includes direct action in the forest, and in it all economic objectives and technical considerations ultimately converge. The focus of <b>silviculture</b> is regeneration, but more recently, recreational use of forestland has challenged <b>silviculture</b> as the primary income generation from forests, due to increasing recognizance of forestland's use for leisure and recreation.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive {{management}} {{is common in}} <b>silviculture,</b> whereas forestry can include natural, conserved land without a stand level management and treatment being applied. A common taxonomy divides <b>silviculture</b> into regenerating, tending and harvesting techniques.|$|E
