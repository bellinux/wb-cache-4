40|$|This {{research}} is about study to the <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> of narcotic convict in Indonesia (Mary Jane Fiesta Velosoâ€™s Case). The kind of <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> {{that happened to}} Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso {{is the first in}} Indonesia because it happened at the last minutes before the execution. The legal issues that raised are the reason of the <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> that happened to Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso and the impact of it. The method of {{research is}} normative law research which is focused on norm of positive law in the form of supporting laws and regulations. The source of this research uses secondary data which consists of primary law, secondary law, and tertiary law. The result of this research are: there are two reasons of the <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> of Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso that are juridical reason and political reason, and the impacts of the <b>suspended</b> death <b>execution</b> of Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso are social impact, law impact, and the impact to Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso herself.

40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} is {{a driving}} force for IT. Mobile agents profit from this development, and offer substantial advantages for certain electronic commerce applications in return. Yet, a number of criteria should be applied to electronic commerce applications to assess which areas are best suited for mobile agents. A major requirement to build confidence in mobile agent technology is the availability of adequate security mechanisms. Although {{much remains to be}} done in this area, a valuable set of mechanisms exist that are suited to launch electronic commerce applications based on mobile agent technology. Keywords: mobile agents, electronic commerce, security, malicious host. 1 Introduction Mobile software agents (see e. g. [3]) are programs bundled with data and execution state that can <b>suspend</b> <b>execution,</b> migrate to other computers connected over a network, and resume execution there. Although numerous other definitions of mobile agents exist, we deliberately chose this [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{enabling}} a `sleeping' process on a shared-memory multiprocessor {{is a difficult}} one, especially if the process is to be awakened by an interrupt-time event. We present here the code for sleep and wakeup primitives that we use in our multiprocessor system. The code has been exercised by months of active use and by a verification system. Our problem is to synchronise processes on a symmetric shared-memory multiprocessor. Processes <b>suspend</b> <b>execution,</b> or sleep, while awaiting an enabling event such as an I/O interrupt. When the event occurs, the process is issued a wakeup to resume its execution. During these events, other processes may be running and other interrupts occurring on other processors. More specifically, we wish to implement subroutines called sleep, callable by a process to relinquish control of its current processor, and wakeup, callable by another process or an interrupt to resume the execution of a suspended process. The calling conventions of these subroutin [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{suspending}} semantic {{model for}} {{the execution of the}} MONSTR generalised term graph rewriting language is defined. This is the canonical operational semantic {{model for the}} MONSTR language. Its correctness with respect to DACTL semantics is discussed, and a number of general theorems on the soundness of <b>suspending</b> <b>executions</b> with respect to DACTL semantics are proved. General theorems are proved about the independence of suspending primitive actions, which are useful in the verification of MONSTR systems...|$|R

From 1964 until 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court <b>suspended</b> <b>executions,</b> ruling that states' laws were insufficient.

In 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Georgia death penalty was constitutional.|$|R
40|$|Transiently powered {{computing}} {{devices such}} as RFID tags, kinetic energy harvesters, and smart cards typically rely on programs that complete a task under tight time constraints before energy starva-tion leads to complete loss of volatile memory. Mementos is a soft-ware system that transforms general-purpose programs into inter-ruptible computations that are protected from frequent power losses by automatic, energy-aware state checkpointing. Mementos com-prises a collection of optimization passes for the LLVM compiler infrastructure and a linkable library that exercises hardware support for energy measurement while managing state checkpoints stored in nonvolatile memory. We evaluate Mementos against diverse test cases in a trace-driven simulator of transiently powered RFID-scale devices. Although Mementosâ€™s energy checks increase run time when energy is plentiful, they allow Mementos to safely <b>suspend</b> <b>execution</b> when energy dwindles, effectively spreading computa-tion across zero or more power failures. This paperâ€™s contributions are: {{a study of the}} runtime environment for programs on RFID-scale devices; an energy-aware state checkpointing system for these devices that is implemented for the MSP 430 family of microcon-trollers; and a trace-driven simulator of transiently powered RFID-scale devices...|$|E
40|$|Future {{multicore}} processors will be {{more susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} hardware failures. In particular, intermittent faults, caused in part by manufacturing, thermal, and voltage variations, can cause bursts of frequent faults that last from several cycles to several seconds or more. Due to practical limitations of circuit techniques, costeffective reliability will likely require the ability to temporarily <b>suspend</b> <b>execution</b> on a core during periods of intermittent faults. We investigate three of the most obvious techniques for adapting to the dynamically changing resource availability caused by intermittent faults, and demonstrate their different system-level implications. We show that system software reconfiguration has very high overhead, that temporarily pausing execution on a faulty core can lead to cascading livelock, and that using spare cores has high faultfree cost. To remedy these and other drawbacks of the three baseline techniques, we propose using a thin hardware/firmware layer to manage an overcommitted system â€” one where the OS is configured to use more virtual processors than the number of currently available physical cores. We show that this proposed technique can gracefully degrade performance during intermittent faults of various duration with low overhead, without involving system software, and without requiring spare cores...|$|E
40|$|Confidentiality and {{integrity}} are often enforced using {{a form of}} authorization known as access control, which involves the following assumptions. â€¢ Predefined operations are the sole means by which principals can learn or update information. â€¢ A reference monitor is consulted whenever one of these predefined operations is invoked; the operation is allowed to proceed only if the invoker holds the required privileges. Confidentiality then is achieved by restricting whether a given principal is authorized to execute operations that reveal information; integrity is achieved by restricting execution of operations that perform updates. An access control policy specifies which of the operations associated with any given object (including operations to change the policy) each given principal 1 is authorized to have performed. Principals are entities to which execution can be attributedâ€”users, processes, threads, or even procedure activations. Objects are entities on which operations are definedâ€”storage abstractions, such as memory or files (with read, write, and execute operations), and code abstractions, such as modules or services (with operations to initiate or <b>suspend</b> <b>execution).</b> Distinct privileges are typically associated with distinct operations, and sometimes there are distinct privileges for each different operation on each different object. So, for example, {{there might be a}} specific privilege readObj that a principal must hold to perform operation read on object Obj. The Principle of Least Privilege is best served by having fine-grained principals, objects, and operations; the Principle of Failsafe Defaults favors defining an access control policy by enumerating privileges rather than prohibitions. That, however, is {{only a small part of}} the picture, and there is much ground to cover in our discussions of access control policy. 1 The term subject has also been used to designate entities that make requests to execute operations. Access control policies then specify which operations a subject is authorized to perform on each object...|$|E
