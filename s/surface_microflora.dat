40|$|Bacterial floras {{isolated}} from eggs, skin, gills, and intestines {{have been described}} for {{a limited number of}} fish species. Generally, the range of bacterial genera isolated is related to the aquatic habitat of the fish and varies with factors such as the salinity of the habitat and the bacterial load in the water. In many investigations, identification of isolates to the genus level only makes it difficult to determine the precise relationships of aquatic and fish microfloras. Bacteria recovered from the skin and gills may be transient rather than resident on the fish <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Microfloras</b> of fish intestines appear to vary with the complexity of the fish digestive system. The genera present in the gut generally seem to be those from the environment or diet which can survive and multiply in the intestinal tract, although there is evidence for a distinct intestinal microflora in some species.

30|$|Generally, about 1  month {{is needed}} for maximum {{microbial}} decomposition of added organic materials that was also found true in the present study. The CO 2 is released from the soil through respiration of different flora, fauna, and plant roots mainly at <b>surface</b> soil. Soil <b>microflora</b> contributes 99 % of the CO 2 emission from soil because of organic matter decomposition (Reichle et al. 1975). Chicken manure had relatively greater amounts of total N and the lowest C:N ratio (Table  1) that favored higher release of CO 2 compared to other tested organic materials. Manures with higher N content and moisture undergo rapid microbial decomposition and tremendously increase CO 2 emission (Ni et al. 2010; Rahman et al. 2016). It was reported that higher labile C containing organic materials enhances CO 2 emission resulting in less C accumulation in soil (Sylvia et al. 2005). Since we have found more CO 2 emission from chicken manure, it might have contained higher amount of labile C.|$|R

40|$|Methanesulfonic acid (MSA) is a {{relevant}} intermediate of the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur and environmental microorganisms assume {{an important role}} in the mineralization of this compound. Several methylotrophic bacterial strains able to grow on MSA have been isolated from soil or marine water and two conserved operons, msmABCD coding for MSA monooxygenase and msmEFGH coding for a transport system, have been repeatedly encountered in most of these strains. Homologous sequences have also been amplified directly from the environment or observed in marine metagenomic data, but these showed a base composition (G + C content) very different from their counterparts from cultivated bacteria. The aim of this study was to understand which microorganisms within the coastal <b>surface</b> oceanic <b>microflora</b> responded to MSA as a nutrient and how the community evolved in the early phases of an enrichment by means of metagenome and gene-targeted amplicon sequencing. From the phylogenetic point of view, the community shifted significantly with the disappearance of all signals related to the Archaea, the Pelagibacteraceae and phylum SAR 406, and the increase in methylotroph-harboring taxa, accompanied by other groups so far not known to comprise methylotrophs such as the Hyphomonadaceae. At the functional level, the abundance of several genes related to sulfur metabolism and methylotrophy increased during the enrichment and the allelic distribution of gene msmA diagnostic for MSA monooxygenase altered considerably. Even more dramatic was the disappearance of MSA import-related gene msmE, which suggests that alternative transporters must be present in the enriched community and illustrate the inadequacy of msmE as an ecofunctional marker for MSA degradation at sea...|$|R

In addition, {{investigations of the}} nitrogen fixation potential of soil <b>surface</b> <b>microflora</b> and inorganic soil nitrogen relationships were carried out. Greater total biomass and organic nitrogen {{was found in the}} above-ground portions, annual shoot productivity, and litter of the Atriplex community. However, the Atriplex community was exceeded by the Eurotia community in root biomass. Roots accounted for 74 and 87 percent of the plant biomass and 83 and 90 percent of the associated organic nitrogen in Eurotia and Atriplex communities respectively. Root biomass distribution at various depths was markedly different in the two communities. Differences between communities in relative amounts of various plant parts and litter are related to contrasting plant growth habit, and differences in soil texture and soil salinity. Total plant biomass estimates, which were 18, 480 and 17, 300 kilograms per hectare for Eurotia and Atriplex communities, were not significantly different and reflect the overriding influence of macroclimate and associated moisture limitation. Under laboratory conditions the soil <b>surface</b> <b>microflora</b> of the Atriplex community was able to fix significant amounts of atmospheric nitrogen while that of the Eurotia community did not. Nitrogen fixation potential in the Atriplex community was associated with the presence of abundant lichen cover and associated heterocvstcontaining blue-green algae of lichen interspaces. Differences between communities were found in rates of mineralization, downward flux, and pattern of utilization of inorganic soil nitrogen. Soil salinity appeared to strongly limit inorganic soil nitrogen mineralization as well as root growth and nitrogen uptake in {{the lower part of the}} Atriplex soil profile; however, this lack of biological activity was compensated for by a greater downward flux of inorganic soil nitrogen from decomposing litter and surface soil in the Atriplex community.

40|$|The {{influence}} of skin environmental factors {{has been investigated}} in five studies. In the first study, the microbial growth and rash development in diaper dermatitis were studied in order to evaluate a UVB radiation therapy in comparison with a combined antifungal-hydrocortisone cream. The effect of reducing skin environmental pH in experimentally induced Candida lesions was investigated in the second study. The effect of occlusion on vulvar skin temperature, humidity and surface pH, with and {{without the use of}} panty liners was investigated in study III and IV, with study IV also including measurements of the skin microflora. In the fifth study, string panties equipped with string panty liners were compared with regular panties with standard panty liners, to evaluate whether there was any difference in their impact on the vulvar skin microenvironment. Diaper dermatitis was susceptible to treatment with UVB therapy, the improvement effect in this study was comparable to the use of antifungal-hydrocortisone cream. Experimentally induced skin reactions caused by C. albicans, were significantly reduced when skin environmental pH was changed from 5. 7 to 5. 1 (study II). The results were not caused by reduced growth of C. albicans, but might be due to a pH dependence of the virulence of the yeast and/or a modulation of the host s defence capability. The results in study III indicated that vapour-impermeable panty liners increased vulvar temperature, humidity and pH, compared with the use of no liners. However, the use of vapour-permeable (breathable) panty liners kept the microclimate basically at an undisturbed level. Study IV showed that vulvar microclimate and microflora levels were significantly higher during use of a non-breathable panty liner, compared to the use of no liner. The use of a breathable and acidic panty liner resulted in a microclimate and microflora close to the situation without panty liner. However, the numbers of microorganisms were low for all three circumstances (with or without the use of both panty liners) implying no significant microbial risk. The differences in panty and panty liner design in study V (string vs normal), seem to have negligible impact on the vulvar skin microclimate, skin <b>surface</b> pH and <b>microflora.</b> No support was found for the fear that a string panty system would result in higher contamination of vulvar skin with anorectal microflora.

New taxa related to the genera Agrococcus and Leucobacter were found. Yeast and Gram-positive bacteria strains deliberately added as smearing agents were sometimes undetected during ripening. Thirty-two percent of the isolates were Gram-negative bacteria, which showed {{a high level of}} diversity and mainly included members of the genera Alcaligenes, Hafnia, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Psychrobacter. Whatever the milk used (pasteurized or unpasteurized), similar levels of biodiversity were observed in the three dairies, all of which had efficient cleaning procedures and good manufacturing practices. It appears that some of the Gram-negative bacteria identified should now be regarded as potentially useful in some cheese technologies. The assessment of their positive versus negative role should be objectively examined...|$|E
40|$|The flora on {{the surface}} of smear-ripened cheeses is {{composed}} of numerous species of bacteria and yeasts that contribute to the production of the desired organoleptic properties. Due to the absence of selective media, {{it is very difficult to}} quantify cheese surface bacteria, and, consequently, the ecology of the cheese <b>surface</b> <b>microflora</b> has not been extensively investigated. We developed a SYBR green I real-time PCR method to quantify Corynebacterium casei, a major species of smear-ripened cheeses, using primers designed to target the 16 S rRNA gene. It was possible to recover C. casei genomic DNA from the cheese matrix with nearly the same yield that C. casei genomic DNA is recovered from cells recovered by centrifugation from liquid cultures. Quantification was linear over a range from 10 (5) to 10 (10) CFU per g of cheese. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated with DNA from species related to C. casei and from other bacteria and yeasts belonging to the cheese flora. Nine commercial cheeses were analyzed by real-time PCR, and six of them were found to contain more than 10 (5) CFU equivalents of C. casei per g. In two of them, the proportion of C. casei in the total bacterial flora was nearly 40 %. The presence of C. casei in these samples was further confirmed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and by a combined approach consisting of plate counting and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. We concluded that SYBR green I real-time PCR may be used as a reliable species-specific method for quantification of bacteria from the surface of cheeses...|$|E

The introduction of the polyolefins natural polysaccharides attached polymer composition, the ability to retain on its <b>surface</b> <b>microflora,</b> and additional content {{in the composition of}} nutrients will ensure the maintenance of microbial life in the event of termination of enrolment in the biofilter nutrients. We have investigated the technological aspects of polymer compositions based on polyethylene (PE), containing natural polysaccharides starch and alkaline pulp (waste vegetable oil refining), in the ratio of 80 : 20 wt. %, when the processing in modern high-speed equipment.

For polymer compositions containing as starch and cellulose, at a temperature of processing 200 °С observed fracture of flow curves, and when the critical temperature 220 °С there is a rapid release, followed by decomposition of the compositions. It is noted that the composition containing the cellulose has a higher porosity than containing starch, which facilitates immobilization of the microflora. For use as a load of biofilters more recommended songs based on PE and cellulose because they have superior immobilization due to their porous structure, and the presence in the composition of polysaccharides and nutrients, as evidenced development {{on the surface of the}} samples of the composition of microscopic fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a multidisciplinary investigation into a dark rock coating at the Ngaut Ngaut heritage complex in South Australia (SA) using geological and botanical examination, Raman microscopy, x-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and infrared analyses. The coating analysed contains a mixture of calcite, quartz, gypsum and weddellite. The presence of calcite and quartz {{can be explained by the}} underlying clastic fossiliferous limestone, while the most probable explanation for the origin of the gypsum is via ground water. The weddellite was likely formed from solutions derived from the reaction of calcite with oxalic acid through the intervention of <b>surface</b> <b>microflora,</b> such as algae. This article provides the first record of weddellite in any context in SA. These findings have a number of implications-one being that the oxalate mineral in the rock coating could potentially be used to conduct accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon analysis and thereby refine our understanding of the rock art chronology at Ngaut Ngaut. A greater understanding of the rates of accumulation may also be useful for management purposes, as the nature of the rock coating may be contributing to long-term exfoliation. Indeed, it is argued that algal colonisation of the limestone (together with other probable microfloral activities) is likely involved in the production of a film over the porous surface, leading to salt weathering.

40|$|Yeasts are {{traditionally}} used {{as part of}} the <b>surface</b> <b>microflora</b> in surface-ripened cheeses, where they contribute positively to the flavour of the cheese. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential of three dairy yeasts to provide attributes as adjuncts in anaerobically ripened cheeses. Geotrichum candidum (B 9001), Yarrowia lipolytica (B 9014) and Candida kefyr (B 9006), obtained from the Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, Palmerston North, New Zealand, were studied. They showed diverse metabolic activities in laboratory media, which were influenced by the growth conditions. The metabolic activities of special interest were the lipase and proteinase activities and the production of volatile compounds, as these are important for cheese ripening and flavour development. Lipase activity (p-nitrophenyl butyrate assay) and proteinase activity (fluorescein isothiocyanate β-casein assay) were determined in three fractions prepared from yeast cultures and designated as extracellular fraction, washed-cell fraction and intracellular fraction. Lipase activity of G. candidum was detected only in the extracellular fraction and increased five fold when induced by safflower oil in a shake culture (0. 16 µM/min/mL supernatant at 24 h). Lipase expression was delayed in static cultures. Y. lipolytica showed lipase activity in extracellular, washed-cell and intracellular fractions under all conditions. Static cultures in both glucose and safflower oil media showed higher lipase activity than shake cultures. The lipase activity of Y. lipolytica was higher in the late stationary phase than in the log phase under all conditions tested. The highest lipase activity was detected in a 192 h static culture grown in safflower oil medium (0. 13 µM/min/mg dry cell weight, 0. 3 µM/min/mg dry cell weight and 4. 29 µM/min/mL supernatant in the intracellular, washed-cell and extracellular fractions respectively). C. kefyr did not show any lipase activity (five fold; analysed by SPME-GC-MS) were produced in the cheeses made with yeast adjuncts. However, the concentration of total CLA (free plus esterified; analysed by GC-FID) did not increase although a higher concentration of free linoleic acid (> 10 fold), the substrate for CLA synthesis, was produced in the cheeses made with yeast adjuncts. A study of the formation of aromatic volatile compounds by C. kefyr in a medium containing L-phenylalanine (L-phe) showed that the yeast's ability to produce phenyl ethanol, phenyl ethyl acetate and benzaldehydc (analysed by SPME-GC-MS) was enhanced with an increase in the initial L-phe concentration (in the experimental range; analysed by enzymatic assay using phenylalanine ammonia lyase), but the yield was very low (20 - 27 %). The initial concentration of glucose (in the experimental range; analysed by enzymatic assay using Peridochrom glucose reagent) did not affect the production of these aromatic volatile compounds. This study successfully showed that the yeasts G. candidum and Y. lipolytica, when used as anaerobic adjuncts, can influence the ripening and flavour development in Cheddar and washed-curd, dry-salted cheeses. The study also showed the capability of C. kefyr to produce aromatic volatile compounds from amino acid fermentation but the yields need to be increased by further manipulation of the medium components and the culture conditions before this capability can be used commercially...|$|E
40|$|Sclerotinia {{stem rot}} (Sclerotinia minor) {{is a serious}} {{constraint}} to sunflower production in south-eastern Australia, where the lack of cultivars with adequate levels of resistance {{and the costs of}} chemical control make biocontrol an attractive option. Onset of disease in the field occurs at bud development. Field trials with the highly susceptible inbred line, PacF 2582, confirmed the absence of disease during vegetative growth. A study of root development found a marked proliferation of lateral roots at GS 3. 1 - 3. 3 (early to mid-bud) in field-grown sunflowers and slightly earlier in glasshouse plants. Glasshouse studies demonstrated the susceptibility of vegetative stage plants to infection of lateral roots by one or 2 pre-germinated sclerotia. Onset of disease in soil inoculated to a high density with sclerotia was also delayed, generally until GS 1. 5 (8 leaf), suggesting that occasional contact between roots and sclerotia is not sufficient for disease initiation. A model system was developed {{to examine the effects of}} <b>surface</b> <b>microflora</b> and exogenous nutrient on sclerotial germination. Field sclerotia, incubated on water agar disks, required surface sterilisation to relieve fungistatic dormancy. Root sap and exudates from sunflower lines stimulated germination of partially surface sterilised field sclerotia, as did root sap from non-host species. Germination rates were significantly higher with root nutrient from plants during vegetative growth than from plants at mid-bud stage. Exposure to root sap for more than 3 days was required for stimulation of germination in vitro. The germination response of soilconditioned culture sclerotia to nutrients was less consistent than that of field sclerotia. The results indicate that root nutrients have potential to stimulate germination during vegetative growth, but onset of disease awaits root proliferation at bud development. It was proposed that a threshold of root activity prolongs the exposure of sclerotia to root exudates, while overlapping rhizospheres may provide a critical concentration of nutrient for germination and mycelial development. An isolate of Gliocladium virens from disease-affected soil proved highly antagonistic to S. minor in culture. Seed treatment with G. virens suppressed disease induced by inoculation of lateral roots in pasteurised potting medium and in field soil. Significant disease control was also obtained by sowing seed into a plug of G. virens growing on V 8 -vermiculite or by pre-germination of seed with a culture of G. virens. Bioprotection by seed treatment with G. virens was evaluated at two field sites, and was effective in field microplots where disease incidence was less than 50 %. Since G. virens, applied on seed, did not affect root growth and did not grow into the lateral root zone, it was concluded that seed treatment with G. virens creates a "cordon sanitaire" around the upper tap root, sufficient for bioprotection of inoculated plants in pots and field microplots. If seed priming techniques can be adapted to allow germination of G. virens on seed before sowing, it may be possible to enhance the cordon sanitaire and delay onset of disease in the field to obtain commercial yields.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} microbial ecology of Listeria monocytogenes in three distinctly different environments: a cheese microbial community; a farm environment; and a soil microbial community. The {{aim of the}} first {{study was to investigate}} the effects of L. monocytogenes on the composition of the <b>surface</b> <b>microflora</b> on washed rind soft cheese. Two trials with washed rind cheeses that were inoculated with 100 cfu cm⁻² of a L. monocytogenes six strain cocktail were conducted. The first trial had to be terminated early (day 28) as contamination of Pseudomonas spp. from the initial brine did not produce the expected characteristics of the cheese during the aging period. For the second trial, cheese samples were aged in the lab for 60 days according to the cheesemakers specifications. Surface cheese rind samples were collected from both control and inoculated cheeses every 7 days. Cheese rind samples were analyzed through the standard BAM method for enumeration of L. monocytogenes and through amplification of the V 4 region of 16 S rRNA and ITS regions for identification of the surface rind bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Our data showed that Pseudomonas spp. significantly changed the composition of the microorganisms found {{on the surface of the}} rind while L. monocytogenes had little effect. In addition, although the concentration of L. monocytogenes increased to levels of 10 ⁶ cfu cm⁻² based on the enumeration data, the genetic data was not able to identify it in the flora due to the fact that other genera were found at much higher concentrations, which is a limitation of molecular methods used for identification of pathogens in foods. For the second study the presence and incidence of L. monocytogenes on farms that either produce raw milk cheese or supply the milk for raw milk cheese production was investigated. Five farms were visited and in total 266 samples were collected from barn, environmental, and milk sites. L. monocytogenes prevalence was found to be at 6 % from all the farms tested with 10 isolates found in the barn samples, 5 from environmental sites and 1 from milking equipment. Samples were identified to the genus level through a modified BAM method and speciated though multiplex PCR. Included in the pathogenic isolates was a DUP- 1042 B L. monocytogenes strain that has been implicated in major outbreaks, which emphasizes the adaptability and persistence of highly pathogenic stains in food manufacturing environments. Results from this study continue to support the fact that contaminated silage can be an important reservoir of the pathogen in a dairy farm setting. From our data and field observations we identified that drinking water sources for the animals is also an important reservoir of L. monocytogenes in farm environments. More importantly this study has shown the importance of continuous monitoring of environmental sites for the presence of the pathogen, particularly in silage. Lastly manure amended soils in the northeastern U. S. were tested for the presence and survival of rifampicin resistant Escherichia coli (rE. coli), generic E. coli (gE. coli) and Listeria spp [...] Both gE. coli and rE. coli samples were processed using either direct enumeration, MPN or bag enrichment methods. Samples were taken from both tilled and surface dairy solid manure-amended plots. Listeria samples were processed using a modified BAM method. Listeria presence was constant throughout the study. In contrast, rE. coli and gE. coli levels declined with time. The main conclusions of this study were that soil type, location and physical characteristics have a significant role in the survival of bacterial populations of rE. coli, gE. coli and Listeria spp. in soil. Dairy solids application does not seem to have a long term effect on the natural microbial population of soils. Tilling of soils results in increased survival of the bacterial population due to the fact that it increases soil pore size and facilitates moisture entry, which in turn has been shown to increase bacterial survival rates. Data from this research will assist in the creation of preventative measures that lead to the elimination of pathogen reservoirs. It will be further used to verify that a 120 day interval following manure application should be sufficient to ensure food safety of edible crops subsequently planted on these soils...|$|E
