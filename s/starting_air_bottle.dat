50|$|The Type 93 torpedo {{formed the}} {{majority}} of this model of Kaiten with the only alterations being the warhead yield being increased from 490 kg and the control planes enlarged and altered to allow both gyroscope and pilot control. Between the torpedo warhead and the engine section is the torpedo compressed air flask, 6 (or 8 in later models) steering air bottles and the forward trim tank, followed by the control area and the pilot's seat. In later models the 5.5 L Tetrachloromethane <b>starting</b> <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> {{is located in the}} cockpit and a further smaller trimming tank is supplied for use at initial launch. The engine section is slotted in above the aft trim tank with the joint protected by a sheet metal cowl.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the target}} was {{acquired}} and the host submarine was within range the pilot was briefed, the Kaiten's <b>starting</b> <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> were charged and the cockpit was ventilated. The pilot then entered the vessel, the gyroscope was programmed with the correct bearing and depth and the pilot was given his final briefing.|$|R

5000|$|Hunt and Patrick Depailler, who {{was driving}} one of the six-wheeled Tyrrells, were dueling for top spot, with Depailler {{following}} Hunt's McLaren on the track, when the <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> for the McLaren's compressor starter fell off and hit the Tyrrell's two left front wheels and the monocoque. Both wheels were broken, and even after stopping to replace them, Depailler's steering was out of line, and he could manage only seventh quickest. Later, as Hunt stood in the pits next to a four-foot, 150-pound <b>air</b> <b>bottle,</b> Rob Walker asked, [...] "Was that the one you threw at Depailler?" [...] James answered, [...] "No, we are keeping that one for Niki on Sunday!" ...|$|R

50|$|The D.520 had a fire {{suppression}} system with a fire extinguisher activated from the cockpit. The engine was started by a simple but effective system, operating with compressed air. A Viet 250 air compressor charged several <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> (one with a 12-litre capacity, as well as another eight litre tank, three smaller one litre units were matched to the weapons). The 12 litre <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> {{was used for the}} brakes and later, for the Chauvière propeller's constant speed adjustment. The small <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> provided up to 12 seconds at 9000 m or 20 seconds at low level, before the Viet air compressor recharged them. The pilot had a complete set of cockpit instruments, and a ten-litre oxygen bottle located in the fuselage just behind his seat, with either a Munerelle or Gourdou oxygen regulator system mounted on the right instrument panel. Equipment included a Radio Industrie Type Rl 537 radio-receiver set, an OPL RX 39 reflector sight (less effective than the Revi system), a height-adjustable seat, and a sliding canopy with large, clear panels. Except over the long nose, the pilot's view was good, since he was seated quite high over the forward fuselage; however, no rear-facing mirrors were fitted.|$|R

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} for simplicity and reliability, rather than sophisticated control. The pilot's only control was a simple on/off switch, with the valves and pump then controlled by an electromechanical timer.

50|$|Fueling and Charging: Via {{the tank}} filler cap, 1,133 lbs (140 gallons) of petrol (B-Stoff) were added (later longer-range models held more).

50|$|The Type 10 is {{significantly}} {{smaller than the}} Type 1 and consequently has a much smaller warhead of 300 kg. The forward section of the weapon contains the warhead and the manual electric fuze, but no contact detonator unlike other kaiten types. The midsection contains {{the first set of}} Type 92 batteries as well as a steering <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> strapped to the underneath of the weapon. The pilot's compartment contains firing, starting and gyroscope starting switches as well as a fixed periscope that could only be rotated but not raised or lowered, the rudder control, trim gauge and a sodium peroxide tin for air purification. The latter part of the weapon contained the remainder of the batteries and a small external steering <b>air</b> <b>bottle.</b> The control planes are identical to the Type 92 torpedo's other than having a manually operated rudder fitted.|$|R

50|$|The K-pattern {{flamethrower}} {{appeared a}} successful weapon, considering its primitive design {{and conditions of}} manufacturing. Its main flaw was that the air pressure decreased during operation so that successive bursts had a progressively shorter range. The weapon could be refueled by fuel carriers and the compressed <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> replaced with a new one, in a procedure that took about 4 minutes.|$|R
50|$|A {{light and}} air unit, {{also known as}} a {{breathing}} support unit, is a specialized piece of firefighting apparatus used by firefighters to provide supplemental lighting and SCBA <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> at the scene of an emergency. During prolonged emergencies, particularly structure fires, where firefighters must remain on air (wearing their SCBAs), these <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> will need to be replaced and refilled. The light and air unit has the ability to refill the SCBA bottles while in the field using onboard air compressors. It also carries a supply of spare air cylinders. These units are highly customizable and can vary greatly between departments. These multifunctional units are also equipped with diesel generators which supplies electricity to power portable lights and overall scene illumination. This is usually done via a roof mounted telescoping light bank. The unit also has the ability to supply electrical power in an emergency to a shelter, base camp, or medical facility.|$|R

50|$|Steering was {{accomplished}} by four rudders in a cruciform configuration. These were moved by four pairs of pneumatic servos, operated by solenoid valves. An <b>air</b> <b>bottle,</b> pressurized to , supplied air for the servos and also supplied the air that spun the three, air-blown gyroscopes in the missile's inertial navigation system. A high pressure air supply from the aircraft was also required to spin the gyros before the missile was launched.|$|R

50|$|Variometers {{measure the}} rate of change of {{altitude}} by detecting the change in air pressure (static pressure) as altitude changes. A simple variometer can be constructed by adding a large reservoir (a thermos bottle) to augment the storage capacity of a common aircraft rate-of-climb instrument. In its simplest electronic form, the instrument consists of an <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> connected to the external atmosphere through a sensitive air flow meter. As the aircraft changes altitude, the atmospheric pressure outside the aircraft changes and air flows into or out of the <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> to equalise the pressure inside the bottle and outside the aircraft. The rate and direction of flowing air is measured by the cooling of one of two self-heating thermistors and the difference between the thermistor resistances will cause a voltage difference; this is amplified and displayed to the pilot. The faster the aircraft is ascending (or descending), the faster the air flows. Air flowing out of the bottle indicates that the altitude of the aircraft is increasing. Air flowing into the bottle indicates that the aircraft is descending.|$|R
