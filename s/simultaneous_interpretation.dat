40|$|Working {{memory is}} a complex {{cognitive}} component responsible for maintenance of information during processing. Interpreting research has so far focused on working memory capacity {{rather than on the}} central executive functions. In the study described here, 28 professional interpreters completed a battery of four central executive tasks and three <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interpretations</b> (from English into Czech or Dutch ‘A’). The results show that: (a) certain measurable features of simultaneous interpreting are related to the central executive functions of working memory; (b) one working memory function (inhibition of distractors) seems to be related to interpreting experience, while the others (automatic response inhibition, updating, attention switching) do not; (c) the relationship between working memory and simultaneous interpreting is such that different working memory functions predict different sub-processes in simultaneous interpreting, in complex patterns. The conclusions of this study are data-driven, but in line with the current literature. More specifically, the findings support those accounts of simultaneous interpreting which emphasize attentional control as {{an important component of the}} simultaneous interpreting process...|$|R
25|$|The Nuremberg Trials {{employed}} four official languages: English, German, French, and Russian. In {{order to}} address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals {{and history of the}} interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interpretation.</b> This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard {{over the course of the}} proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} President Trump’s inaugural speech (2017) {{from the}} point of view of appraisal theory. It compares the source text appraisal profile with that of six Spanish target texts (five <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interpretations</b> and one written translation) in order to identify critical points of interpreter/translator intervention. The article replicates analysis of President Obama’s 2009 inaugural speech, enabling further generalisation of the earlier findings and a refinement of methodology. This new study concurs with the earlier one in revealing that expressions of attitude rarely shift; by contrast, shifts in graduation are less frequent in Trump’s speech, possibly because the reduced speed of delivery does not force the interpreter into so many omissions. More sensitive are shifts in engagement, particularly counter-expectancy indicators and pronouns, which affect deictic positioning. The article concludes with a discussion of the methodology and the role played by speech mode, since problems described by interpreters are found more frequently in Trump’s impromptu or unscripted speeches than in the more formal scripted inauguration...|$|R

40|$|Whether and how language-pair {{specificity}} {{affects the}} process and product of interpreting is a recurring implicit topic of debate in interpreting studies. Previous discussions have touched upon this issue in Japanese/English and German/English interpreting, with little attention to its role in Chinese/English interpreting. This study focuses {{on the effect of}} structural asymmetry between English and Chinese on English-Chinese simultaneous interpreting performance, which is exemplified by right-branching structures in English and left-branching structures in Chinese. Based on a naturalistic observation of three professional interpreters’ on-site <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the same speech, it investigates two major questions: a) Does structural asymmetry between English and Chinese constitute particular difficulties in the interpreters’ interpreting performance? b) If yes, how does such language-pair specificity affect their interpreting product? While previous interpreting studies generally consider that the interpreting product is shaped by three major variables including the interpreter’s interpreting competence, cognitive conditions on the site and norms of interpreting, findings of the present study suggest that language-pair specificity functions as another variable in English-Chinese interpreting. It implies the necessity of considering it in the theoretical account of interpreting between languages such as English and Chinese that involve significant contrasts in linguistic structure and cultural conceptualization...|$|R
40|$|A {{controlled}} experiment measured native Hong Kong Cantonese speakers' {{perceptions of the}} quality of three different <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interpretations</b> (SIs) into Cantonese. The SIs differed only in the interpreters' accents, native in one case and non-native in the other two. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups, listening to the following versions of the SI: (1) native-accented Cantonese (control group); (2) Mandarin-accented Cantonese; (3) English-accented Cantonese. To motivate participants to listen attentively, they were told beforehand that they would take a comprehension test before assessing the quality of the SI delivery. Ten questionnaire items measuring SI quality perception were analyzed quantitatively, while any additional comments were examined qualitatively. Overall, respondents in the two groups who listened to SI delivered with a non-native accent assigned lower quality ratings on all survey items than did respondents listening to native-accented Cantonese SI. Qualitative data suggest three possible explanations for the low ratings of the two SIs with a non-native accent: (1) extra listening effort was required to understand these SIs; (2) negative stereotypes were triggered by the interpreters' non-native accents; (3) feelings of insecurity or threat were prompted by the non-native interpreters' ability to perform SI into Cantonese.

40|$|Rater-mediated {{performance}} assessment (RMPA) is {{a critical}} component of interpreter certification testing systems worldwide. Given the acknowledged rater variability in RMPA and the high-stakes nature of certification testing, it is crucial to ensure rater reliability in interpreter certification performance testing (ICPT). However, a review of current ICPT practice indicates that rigorous research on rater reliability is lacking. Against this background, the present study reports on use of multifaceted Rasch measurement (MFRM) to identify the degree of severity/leniency in different raters' assessments of <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interpretations</b> (SIs) by 32 interpreters in an experimental setting. Nine raters specifically trained for the purpose were asked to evaluate four Englishto- Chinese SIs by each of the interpreters, using three 8 -point rating scales (information content, fluency, expression). The source texts differed in speed and in the speaker's accent (native vs non-native). Rater-generated scores were then subjected to MFRM analysis, using the FACETS program. The following general trends emerged: 1) homogeneity statistics showed that not all raters were equally severe overall; and 2) bias analyses showed that a relatively large proportion of the raters had significantly biased interactions with the interpreters and the assessment criteria. Implications for practical rating arrangements in ICPT, and for rater training, are discussed. 29 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the two questions: 1) Does the interpreter’s {{relevant}} bodily experience help her to achieve coherence in the source text (ST) and the target text (TT) ? 2) How does the interpreter’s mental effort expended in achieving coherence reflect the textual structure of the ST? The {{findings of this study}} contribute to the general understanding of how coherence is achieved in simultaneous interpreting (SI). The theoretical framework is based on the concept of the Idealized Cognitive Model (ICM), which emphasizes the role of bodily experience in organizing and understanding knowledge. A bodily experience based experiment was conducted with two contrastive groups: experimental group and control group, involving thirty subjects from a China-based university, who had Chinese as their first language and English as their second language. The data collected was recordings of English to Chinese <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Coherence in SI was analyzed on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative approaches by virtue of coherence clues. The analysis shows that the interpreter’s bodily experience helped her to achieve coherence and distribute her mental effort in both the ST and TT. As the term ICM suggests, the cognitive model is idealized {{on the grounds that the}} ICM does not fit into the real specifics of a textual structure perfectly or all the time. The ICM is an open-ended model in terms of the analysis of understanding abstract concepts especially in this SI discourse and needs more research. This study can contribute to SI research and training, suggesting that specialization is a trend in interpreting education...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} {{in the interpretation of}} the Buddhist doctrine of prat(2 ̆ 7) ityasamutpada, or dependent origination, is the temporal framework within which its twelve limbs occur. The most commonly accepted explanation within the Buddhist tradition distributes the twelve limbs successively over three separate lives. This is the theory discussed by Vasubandhu in the Abhidharmakosa, and also by Buddhaghosa in the Visuddhimagga. Another interpre- tation, most fully developed in the Vibhanga, the second book of the Theravada Abhidhamma Pitaka, states that all the limbs occur in a single thought-moment. The possible reconciliation of these two views is the theme for a comparison of Vasubandhu and Buddhaghosa. ^ The first chapter is an introduction to the doctrine, its twelve limbs, and some of the problems with the three lives theory. The second provides a summary of the historical background of the Sarvastivadin school which produced the Kosa, and the contro- versial biography of its author. The third chapter is devoted to the history of the Western scholarship on dependent origination. The fourth chapter, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Introduction to the Translation, 2 ̆ 2 explains the Sarvastivadin technical terms and concepts which occur in the translation of the prat(2 ̆ 7) ityasamutpada section of the Kosa. The trans- lation itself, the first from the Sanskrit, constitutes the fifth chapter, and is preceded by an Analytical Table of Contents. The final chapter compares the interpretations of Vasubandhu and Buddhaghosa, and drawing extensively from the discussion of dependent origina- tion in the Vibhanga and the Sammohavinodan(2 ̆ 7) i, argues that Buddhaghosa 2 ̆ 7 s definition of the third limb, vijnana, allows a more successful reconciliation of the successive and <b>simultaneous</b> <b>interpretations</b> of dependent origination than does Vasubandhu 2 ̆ 7 s. Appendices give the matika to the Paccayakaravibhanga, and the chains of dependent origination which it enumerates. ...|$|R
