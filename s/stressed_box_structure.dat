50|$|A {{torsion box}} {{consists}} of two thin layers of material (skins) {{on either side of}} a lightweight core, usually a grid of beams. It is designed to resist torsion under an applied load. A hollow core door is probably the most common example of a torsion <b>box</b> (<b>stressed</b> skin) <b>structure.</b> The principle is to use less material more efficiently. The torsion box uses the properties of its thin surfaces to carry the imposed loads primarily through tension while the close proximity of the enclosed core material compensates for the tendency of the opposite side to buckle under compression.|$|R

When a rectangular <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> is subjected to certain pressure, stress analysis of rectangular box is necessary to avoid the failure during working condition.

To validate finite element stresses, it is necessary to compare these stresses with analytical approach. From the FE analysis of rectangular box, it is seen that cubical box having the lesser stresses & better for stress distribution due to symmetry.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model based on Statistical Energy Analysis {{was developed for}} predicting the vibration and sound pressure levels inside a three-dimensional <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> due to wide-band random excitation applied at a prescribed point on the structure. The acoustic absorption of {{the walls of the}} reverberant enclosure was determined using the theory of room acoustics and incorporated in the theoretical model. The structural damping of the panels which constitute the <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> was experimentally obtained employing the steady state input power method. Theoretical expressions based on mobility concepts were developed and examined for characterizing and estimating the mechanical input power. The effect of variation in the location of the mechanical input on input mobility, input power and sound radiation by a finite structure was studied. ^ The vibration of the panels and noise levels inside the <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> for five different cases of the input mobility characteristics were predicted using the theoretical model and compared with experimental results. The effect of increasing the structural damping on the overall response of the structure was studied. An explicit relationship between input mobility, input power and the panel vibration and noise levels in the <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> was established. On the basis of these results, possible ways of reducing the structure-borne noise radiated into the <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> cavity are suggested. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} fuel cycle facility, radiotoxic {{materials}} are being handled in freestanding leak tight enclosures called glove boxes (GBs). These glove boxes {{act as a}} primary confinement for the radiotoxic materials. Glove boxes are designed as per codal requirements for class I component. They are designed to withstand extreme level of earthquake loading with a return period of 10, 000 years. To evaluate seismic performance of the glove box, {{there is a need}} to check the stability (sliding and overturning), structural integrity (stresses and strains) and leak tightness under earthquake loading. Extensive shake table experiments were conducted on a single standalone glove box. Actual laboratory conditions were simulated during testing to check the response. After extensive shake table testing, glove <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> was also analyzed using finite element (FE) software. Detailed three-dimensional model of glove <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> was developed and analyzed using nonlinear time history method. It was observed that finite element methods could be utilized to accurately predict dynamic response of glove <b>box</b> <b>structure.</b> This paper discusses the details and results of shake table testing and methodology used for modelling and analysing freestanding glove <b>box</b> <b>structure</b> under seismic loading. In addition, simplified numerical procedure, developed using energy conservation principle is applied to estimate approximate sliding displacement of the glove box. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

The {{application of the}} derived equations was demonstrated using a single cell mono symmetric <b>box</b> girder <b>structure.</b> The evaluation of the coefficients (Vlasov’s coefficients) of the governing equations of equilibrium which form {{a major part of}} the work was accomplished using the strain mode diagrams and Morh’s integral for displacement computation.

A single span simply supported mono symmetric <b>box</b> girder <b>structure</b> was considered in the analysis.
