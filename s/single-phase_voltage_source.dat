40|$|Voltage source {{inverters}} {{operated by}} predictive control methods generally {{lead to a}} variable switching frequency, because predictive control methods generate switching operation based on an optimal voltage state selected at every sampling period. Varying switching frequencies {{make it difficult to}} design output filters of voltage source inverters. This paper proposes a predictive control algorithm with a constant switching frequency for the load current control of <b>single-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> inverters. This method selects two future optimal voltage states used in the subsequent sampling period, which are a zero-voltage state and a future optimal voltage state, based on the slope of the reference current at each sampling period. After selecting the two future voltages, the proposed method distributes them to produce a constant switching frequency and symmetric switching pattern. The performance of the proposed method is validated with both simulation and experimental results for <b>single-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> inverters...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the hysteresis current {{control of the}} voltage source inverter. The eMEGAsim real-time simulator is developed by OPAL-RT. Real-time simulation is used in many cases because it allows {{the behavior of the}} industrial processes operation to be determined. Two research directions are developed in this case, Rapid Control Prototyping and Hardware-In-the-Loop. Using eMEGAsim simulator allows implementing the command and control strategy of a <b>single-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> inverter. At this stage, the real-time behavior of operation is monitored, because the voltage source inverter will be the part of a single-phase shunt active filter. In order to command and control the voltage source inverter, the current and voltage signals are acquired, since these signals are necessary to estimate reference signal. Extension of the Instantaneous Reactive Power Theorem is used because this theorem is suitable for single-phase active filter control.

40|$|In this paper, the {{implementation}} of a three-phase shunt active power filter is presented. The filter is essentially three independent <b>single-phase</b> current-controlled <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> inverters (CC-VSI) with a common DC bus.

The APF consists of a current control loop, which shapes the grid currents to be sinusoidal and a voltage control loop, which regulates the active power balance of the system. The experimental results indicate that the active filter is able to handle predominantly the harmonics, as well as the unbalance and reactive power, so that the grid currents are sinusoidal, in phase with the grid voltages and symmetrical...|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} reference model {{predictive control}} (ARMPC) approach is proposed {{as an alternative}} means of controlling power converters {{in response to the}} issue of steady-state residual errors presented in power converters under the conventional model predictive control (MPC). Differing from other methods of eliminating steady-state errors of MPC based control, such as MPC with integrator, the proposed ARMPC is designed to track the so-called virtual references instead of the actual references. Subsequently, additional tuning is not required for different operating conditions. In this paper, ARMPC is applied to a <b>single-phase</b> full-bridge <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> inverter (VSI). It is experimentally validated that ARMPC exhibits strength in substantially eliminating the residual errors in environment of model mismatch, load change, and input voltage change, which would otherwise be present under MPC control. Moreover, it is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed ARMPC shows a consistent erasion of steady-state errors, while the MPC with integrator performs inconsistently for different cases of model mismatch after a fixed tuning of the weighting factor.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the modern}} power {{distribution}} system, majority of loads draw reactive power and/or harmonic currents from ac source along with main active power currents. These non-unity powerfactor linear and nonlinear loads cause low efficiency of supply system, poor power-factor, destruction of other equipments due to excessive stresses and EMI problems. Active filters {{have been considered}} an effective solution to reduce these problems. This paper presents an Active Power Filter (APF) based on simple control technique to provide reactive power and harmonics compensation or non-linear <b>single-phase</b> loads. A <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> inverter with carrierless hysteresis PWM current control is used to form an APF. A simple P-I (proportional-integral) dc bus voltage controller with reduced energy storage capacitor is employed in the APF.

40|$|Abstract: When {{generator}} stators are rewound or undergo major repairs, {{there is}} often a desire to perform a high potential test. These tests can be completed using d. c., very low frequency or a. c. power frequency test voltages. A. c. power frequency tests are becoming common, but such tests are difficult because of the large kVAr requirement to charge the stator insulation capacitance. This is particularly a problem with hydro generator stators because the insulation capacitance is further inflated by physical size. Recently the authors were required to test a stator with just over 1 㯀F in capacitance to a test voltage of 32 kV, requiring a <b>single-phase</b> controllable high <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> rated to 286 kVAr prior to considering losses. It is not easy to locate a distribution board to supply this at a power-station site. Resonant circuits are normally applied to complete these tests and minimise the distribution board loadings. In traditional a. c. high potential test sets, large variacs are employed with a high voltage transformer and numerous compensating coils. In this paper an open core t ransformer is described that can provide high voltage and inductive compensation in an original and most compact manner. ...|$|R

In a deregulated market, however, small and environmentally friendly power plants using wind power, photovoltaic cells, fuel cells and micro-turbines can be installed through a given distribution system. This concept of distributed generation tends {{to reduce the cost}} of electricity and to reduce or postpone major investments in the transmission system. Many of these small power plants are typically consumer owned and are connected to the utility grid by means of <b>single-phase</b> power electronic <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> converters. This type of converter that supplies active power to the ac grid can also be controlled to provide active filtering and Var generation, thus enhancing the quality of the power at a given point and providing added value to the distributed power source. This Thesis focuses on the practical issues of a multi-featured single-phase utility interface. It focuses on three important aspects: (1) the management of the low order voltage harmonics present in the dc bus of the interface. (2) The design of fast and robust single phase phase-locked loop for the synchronization of the power interface. (3) A new control circuit for a three-level hysteresis current controller.

40|$|The {{topology}} {{and control}} are discussed of a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) {{that can be}} operated flexibly in the voltage or current control mode. In the voltage control mode, the DSTATCOM can force the voltage of a distribution bus to be balanced sinusoids.
