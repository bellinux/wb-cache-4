25|$|The {{cause of}} {{the sinking of the}} Clan Ranald is still undetermined. Many {{theories}} have been put forward to try to explain it. One of these theories was that the vessel struck Marion Reef. However, this was dismissed, as an inspection of the hull revealed that there were no holes that indicated that the vessel hit any underwater obstruction. Other theories include the water ballast tanks were not emptied or that the <b>sea</b> <b>cock</b> was opened throughout the journey. Some even suggested that most of the crew were drunk at that time.|$|E
50|$|After {{more than}} 47 {{years of service}} as a sail and later on as a {{stationary}} training ship she was first laid up in A Graña, Ferrol, her Spanish port of registry. In 1981 the underwater hull was re-plated at the drydock in Ferrol. Later Galatea was completely de-rigged down to a hulk (all yards with standing and running rigging and even the masts removed) and was towed to Seville {{to be used as}} a floating museum, but left forgotten. Some sources even reported that the ship was sunk in the harbour by removing her bronze <b>sea</b> <b>cock</b> valve, but salvaged later by the Spanish Navy.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of January 2, 1905, after Port Arthur surrendered, Captain Nikolai Essen of the Sevastopol had the {{crippled}} battleship scuttled in 30 fathom m of water by opening the <b>sea</b> <b>cocks</b> on one side, so that the ship would sink on its side {{and could not be}} raised and salvaged by the Japanese.|$|R
50|$|On 10 March 1945, U-681 {{grounded}} off Scilly, {{damaging the}} pressure hull and propellers. Unable to dive, Werner Gebauer, {{the commander of}} the U-boat, headed for the Irish coast, hoping for internment by Irish authorities. However, the next morning PB4Y-1 Liberator N of VPB-103 spotted U-681 on the surface and went in for the attack. Eight depth charges further damaged the U-boat, and Gebauer ordered the crew to abandon ship. With <b>sea</b> <b>cocks</b> opened and demolition charges set, U-681 submerged followed by a massive explosion. Of the crew of 47, a British escort picked up 38 survivors.|$|R

2500|$|On 13 February 1912, the {{engineers}} let water {{back into the}} interior of the cofferdam. Three days later, {{the interior of the}} cofferdam was full and Maine floated. Two days after that, Maine was towed out by the tug [...] The bodies of its crew were then removed to the armored cruiser [...] for repatriation. On 16 March, Maine was towed four miles from the Cuban coast by Osceola, escorted by North Carolina and the light cruiser [...] Its <b>sea</b> <b>cocks</b> were opened and it sank in [...] of water to the salutes of Birmingham and North Carolina. During the salvage, remains of 66 more were found, of whom only one (an engineering officer) was identified and returned to his home town; the rest were reburied at Arlington Cemetery making a total of 229 buried there.|$|R
50|$|Finally, at 10:30 on December 5, {{following}} another massive artillery bombardment, the Japanese {{managed to}} overrun 203 Meter Hill overlooking the harbour of Port Arthur with the Russian Pacific Fleet at anchor. They send Artillery observer on the hill, directing {{the fire of}} the 28 cm howitzer destroying systematically the Russian fleet, one ship after another. On December 5, 1904, the battleship Poltava was destroyed, followed by the battleship Retvizan on December 7, 1904, the battleships Pobeda and Peresvet and the cruisers Pallada and Bayan on December 9, 1904. The battleship Sevastopol, although hit 5 times by 11 in shells, managed {{to move out of}} range of the guns. On the night of January 2, 1905, after Port Arthur surrendered, Captain Nikolai Essen of the Sevastopol had the crippled battleship scuttled in 30 fathom m of water by opening the <b>sea</b> <b>cocks</b> on one side, so that the ship would sink on its side and could not be raised and salvaged by the Japanese.|$|R
5000|$|... 27 May 1967: VP-28 {{deployed}} to NAS Adak, Alaska. During the deployment the ex-USS Robert Louis Stevenson {{was loaded with}} 2,000 tons of obsolete ordnance ready for disposal. The hulk was towed into position south of Amchitka Island, where {{it was to be}} scuttled. It was rigged to hydrostatically detonate at a depth of 4000 ft. Research vessels nearby would monitor the explosion for oceanographic and seismic research purposes. A combination of bad weather and strong winds pushed the hulk off position after the <b>sea</b> <b>cocks</b> were opened. The vessel sank in water too shallow to detonate the charge. VP-28 was called upon to bomb the submerged wreckage and detonate the charge. A total of 24 2,000-pound bombs were dropped on the position with no secondary explosions. It was later determined that the hulk was thoroughly flattened and the ordnance dispersed in a manner that no longer posed a danger to navigation.|$|R
500|$|For {{the next}} few months, Tosa {{was given to the}} Hiroshima gunnery school for use as a target. On 14 January 1925, the Navy Ministry of Japan ordered Tosa to be scuttled within one month's time. To ensure this, the Commander in Chief of the Kure Naval District {{directed}} that preparations for scuttling the ship be completed by 1 February. It was planned that Tosa would be scuttled on or before 10 February after being towed by the former battleship [...] to a location south of the Mizunokojima Lighthouse and [...] west of Okinoshima Island (located southwest of the present-day Kōchi Prefecture). Later that month, the United States Office of Naval Intelligence reported that [...] "work on the dismantling of [...] has been going on at the Kure Navy Yard and everything possible has been removed. The intention is to fill her hull with sand and gravel, tow her out to deep water near the entrance to Kure, open her <b>sea</b> <b>cocks,</b> and send her to the bottom." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hannover was a 5,537 GRT {{cargo liner}} built by Bremer Vulkan Schiff- und Maschinenbau, Vegesack and {{launched}} on 29 March 1939. She {{was owned by}} Norddeutscher Lloyd and plied between Germany and the West Indies on the banana run. Hannover′s port of registry was Bremen. When World War II began, Hannover sought refuge in Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles. In March 1940, under Kapitän Wahnschaff, Hannover attempted to return to Germany as a blockade runner. She was sighted between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico {{on the night of}} 7/8 March by the light cruiser [...] and the Canadian destroyer [...] Hannover was ordered to stop, but ignored the order and tried to reach the neutral waters of the Dominican Republic. When Dunedin and Assiniboine intercepted Hannover, Captain Wahnschaff ordered the seacocks opened and the ship set on fire. A boarding party from Dunedin closed the <b>sea</b> <b>cocks</b> and Hannover was taken under tow. However, it took four days for the salvage crew to put out the fire. Hannover was then towed to Jamaica, arriving on 11 March. Acting Lieutenant A. W. Hughes of Dunedin was mentioned in despatches for his part in securing Hannover. Damage was mainly confined to her electrical system.|$|R
5000|$|Pelican {{was sold}} as a supply ship on 22 January 1901 to the Hudson's Bay Company {{for use as a}} {{northern}} supply ship. During World War I, Pelican was delivering supplies to Russia when she was engaged by a surfaced U-boat. The fight lasted one-and=a-half hours, but eventually, the U-boat was driven off. In 1922, the ship was no longer considered serviceable and was sold as scrap to Fraim Bannikhin of St. John's for $1,500. However, the vessel was not scrapped, instead being reduced to a barge. In November 1922, the barge parted its hawser off Flat Point, while being towed to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The barge grounded near Sable Island. Pelican was recovered by the tugboat Ocean Eagle II and towed her towards Sydney. However, once in the harbour, the barge grounded again on the South Bar. The barge was recovered again and docked at Sydney. In 1927, the barge sank {{to the bottom of the}} harbour after being vandalized and her <b>sea</b> <b>cocks</b> opened. The hulk remained with masts, port gunwales and forecastle above water at the wharf for 23 years. [...] The hulk was towed out to sea, escorted by [...] and scuttled in June 1953.|$|R
2500|$|In February 1800 Dundas was aboard Lord Keith's flagship, the first-rate HMS Queen Charlotte. Dundas was junior to Lieutenant Lord Cochrane but Cochrane {{had taken}} command of Nelson's prize, the Genereaux, in late 1799 {{to take her}} into port; Dundas {{therefore}} became 5th Lieutenant of the Queen Charlotte. [...] One month later, {{early in the morning}} of 17 March 1800, cries of [...] "Fire" [...] rang out throughout the vessel. Some hay lying under the half-deck had been set on fire by a match kept there for the signal guns. Dundas was in the forecastle where he organized fire-fighting efforts. Dundas led a party below decks where they secured the main and fore hatches and then opened the lower-deck ports and the <b>sea</b> <b>cocks</b> to flood the lower decks to prevent the fire spreading down. These efforts delayed the fire from reaching the two magazines. Dundas continued working below decks until some middle-deck guns fell through the deck. At about 9am Dundas climbed out the foremost lower-deck port and climbed up to the forecastle, joining the about 150 men there who were throwing water on the fire. Despite the crew's exertions, the Queen Charlotte eventually blew up with the loss of 673 people out of its complement of 840 officers, men and boys, including the Captain and her first Lieutenant. Dundas however survived.|$|R
5000|$|... "Her ends {{were said}} to be quite sharp," [...] another account reads, [...] "but she was not quite as large and did not carry as much sail as other {{clippers}} of her era, such as Game <b>Cock,</b> <b>Sea</b> Serpent and White Squall. The Lows were delighted with her and gave Samuel Hall a $2,500 bonus." ...|$|R
25|$|The Nantucketer, {{he alone}} resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, {{goes down to}} it in ships; to and fro {{ploughing}} it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his buisiness, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the <b>sea,</b> as prairie <b>cocks</b> in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; {{so that when he}} comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.|$|R
60|$|And {{thus have}} these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world {{like so many}} Alexanders; {{parcelling}} out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the road. they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his business which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.
