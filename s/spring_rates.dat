25|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} a 4.0L V6 mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 5-speed automatic transmission. The V6 powertrains were unchanged from {{those used in}} 2005â€“2009 Mustangs. Though the 2010 Mustang V-6 retained a single exhaust outlet, {{the diameter of the}} tip had been increased one-half of an inch to three inches. The 2010 Mustang included new <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and dampers to improve ride quality and control and Ford's AdvanceTrac traction and stability control system standard. Newly standard on the base Mustang were 17-inch painted aluminum wheels while 18-inch wheels continue to be optional (except for V8 models, where 18-inch wheels were mounted by default). Other new available features and options for the 2010 Mustang included Ford SYNC, dual-zone automatic climate control, an updated navigation system with Sirius Travel Link, a capless fuel filler, a reverse camera system to aid in backing up, and an updated version of the V6 Pony Package.|$|E
25|$|The car {{now has the}} {{addition}} of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear decklid spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) Bilstein DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized Brembo brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel & cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds 200 pounds (90.72kg) of downforce at 100mph (160.93km/h). Top speed is 193mph (310.60km/h) instead of the non-aerodynamics package cars' 206mph (331.52km/h). The car's mileage is 12 mpg in city, and 19 mpg in highway.|$|E
50|$|Wheel rate is the {{effective}} <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> when {{measured at the}} wheel. This is as opposed to simply measuring the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> alone.|$|R
50|$|Vertical stiffness, or <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> is {{the ratio}} of {{vertical}} force to vertical deflection of the tire, and it contributes to the overall suspension performance of the vehicle. In general, <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> increases with inflation pressure.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} springs {{are commonly used}} for automobile suspension, variable <b>rate</b> <b>springs</b> and linear <b>rate</b> <b>springs.</b> When a load is applied to a linear <b>rate</b> <b>spring</b> the spring compresses an amount directly proportional to the load applied. This type of spring is commonly used in road racing applications when ride quality is not a concern. A linear spring will behave the same at all times. This provides predictable handling characteristics during high speed cornering, acceleration and braking. Variable springs have low initial <b>springs</b> <b>rates.</b> The <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> gradually increases as it is compressed. In simple terms the spring becomes stiffer as it is compressed. The ends of the spring are wound tighter to produce a lower <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> When driving this cushions small road imperfections improving ride quality. However once the spring is compressed {{to a certain point}} the spring is not wound as tight providing a higher (stiffer) <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> This prevents excessive suspension compression and prevents dangerous body roll, which could lead to a roll over. Variable <b>rate</b> <b>springs</b> are used in cars designed for comfort as well as off road racing vehicles. In off road racing they allow a vehicle to absorb the violent shock from a jump effectively as well as absorb small bumps along the off road terrain effectively.|$|R
25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the pivot point of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt as if it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} it was being made, the 303 was the least {{expensive}} six-cylinder car in Germany. However, it was considered underpowered, with a top speed of [...] [...] The combination of soft <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> at the front and hard <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> at the rear caused understeer, body roll, and a generally unsettling pitching movement. 2300 BMW 303s were produced up to 1934, when the 303 was replaced by the 315.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952 {{he founded}} the sports car company Lotus Cars. Chapman {{initially}} ran Lotus in his spare time, assisted {{by a group of}} enthusiasts. His knowledge of the latest aeronautical engineering techniques would prove vital towards achieving the major automotive technical advances he is remembered for. His design philosophy focused on cars with light weight and fine handling instead of bulking up on horsepower and <b>spring</b> <b>rates,</b> which he famously summarised as [...] "Adding power makes you faster on the straights. Subtracting weight makes you faster everywhere." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is that torsion bars, unlike coil springs, usually cannot {{provide a}} progressive <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> In most torsion bar systems, ride height (and therefore many handling features) may {{be changed by}} simply adjusting bolts that connect the torsion bars to the steering knuckles. In most cars {{with this type of}} suspension, swapping torsion bars for a different <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> is usually an easy task.|$|R
40|$|There is {{provided}} an air spring (1) for supporting a load, the air spring (1) comprises a chamber (50) for holding a pressurised gas in use, a load-bearing surface (10) arranged to transmit a force from a load in {{use to the}} pressurised gas held in the chamber (50). Importantly, in order to lower the <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> the chamber (50) contains a mass of adsorptive material (70). There is also provided a use of an adsorptive material (70) {{for the purpose of}} lowering the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> of an air spring (1), including a gas strut and a pneumatic wheel. There is also provided a method of designing an air spring (1) using an adsorptive material to lower the <b>spring</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R
50|$|Wheel rate {{is usually}} {{equal to or}} {{considerably}} less than the <b>spring</b> <b>rate.</b> Commonly, <b>springs</b> are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting suspension member. Consider the example above where the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> was calculated to be600 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), {{if you were to}} move the wheel 1 in (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount. Let's assume the spring moved 0.75 in, the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1. The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times the <b>spring</b> <b>rate,</b> thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm). Squaring the ratio is because the ratio has two effects on the wheel rate. The ratio applies to both the force and distance traveled.|$|R
2500|$|Optional {{equipment}} on all passenger cars (except wagons) included metallic brake linings {{and a heavy}} duty suspension consisting of a front anti-roll bar, rear axle limit straps, revised <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and recalibrated shock absorbers. These provided a major handling improvement by reducing the potentially violent camber change of the rear wheels when making sharp turns at high speeds. [...] The Turbocharged Spyder equipment group featured a multi-gauge instrument cluster which included a tachometer, cylinder head temperature and intake manifold pressure gauges, Spyder fender script and Turbo logo deck emblems {{in addition to the}} high performance engine.|$|E
2500|$|The Shelby GT500KR {{features}} a {{carbon fiber composite}} hood with functional scoops and vents, twist-lock hood pins modeled on the original 1968 KR, a unique carbon fiber splitter, carbon fiber mirror caps, and functional brake cooling ducts. The suspension was tuned by SVT with unique <b>spring</b> <b>rates,</b> dampers, stabilizer bars, and strut tower brace and was sourced from Ford Racing. Unique Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires were developed for the KR with a unique compound. With the same tread pattern as the Eagle F1 Supercar tire on the 2007â€“2009 GT500 they can only be identified by a unique Goodyear [...] "Wingedfoot" [...] emblem on the sidewall.|$|E
2500|$|... 1994: The first facelift: Front {{grill and}} {{headlamps}} were redesigned, 'sculpted' aluminum turbine rims were made available. [...] A major redesign to the dash added a {{passenger side airbag}} and made it less cluttered and more modern. [...] A new model was introduced, the Luxury Sport Sedan (LSS). [...] Engineers fitted bucket seats (a pair of right-hand halves of the standard 60/40 split bench seat), floor shifter and a center console (borrowed from the previous generation Pontiac Bonneville SSE) into the interior, and full instrumentation for the dash. [...] Higher <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and larger diameter stabilizer bars for {{the front and rear}} suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling.|$|E

50|$|As the strut compresses, the <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> {{increases}} dramatically, {{because the}} air is being compressed, while the viscosity of the oil dampens the rebound movement.|$|R
2500|$|The 2004 model S2000 {{underwent}} several significant changes. Production {{moved to}} Suzuka. The new model introduced [...] wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tires {{along with a}} retuned suspension to reduce oversteer. The <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry modified to improve stability by reducing toe-in changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve a high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes {{were made to the}} exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European S2000s, they retained the 2.0l F20C engines and remained designated as AP1s.|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 Mustang GT added a more {{powerful}} version of the 4.6L V8 seen in 2005â€“2009 Mustang GTs. The [...] Mustang GT's revised V8 produced [...] @ 6000rpm and [...] of torque @ 4250rpm. The 5-speed manual and automatic transmissions offered with the updated V8 continued unchanged from before. The size of the 2010 Mustang GT's dual exhaust tips had been increased by one-half of an inch to 3.5inches while the exhaust note has been improved to enhance {{the sound of the}} V8. Like the base V6-equipped Mustang, the 2010 Mustang GT included new <b>spring</b> <b>rates</b> and dampers to improve ride quality and control. AdvanceTrac was also standard in the Mustang GT though a specialSport Mode setting was added for spirited driving. The 2010 Mustang GT came with standard 18-inch wheels â€“ one inch greater than the previous Mustang GT's standard wheels â€“ while 19-inch wheels were a new option.|$|E

50|$|When {{a spring}} is {{compressed}} or stretched from its resting position, it exerts an opposing force approximately proportional to its change in length (this approximation breaks down for larger deflections). The <b>rate</b> or <b>spring</b> constant of a spring {{is the change}} in the force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. That is, it is the gradient of the force versus deflection curve. An extension or compression <b>spring's</b> <b>rate</b> is expressed in units of force divided by distance, for example lbf/in or N/m. A torsion spring is a spring that works by twisting; when it is twisted about its axis by an angle, it produces a torque proportional to the angle. A torsion <b>spring's</b> <b>rate</b> is in units of torque divided by angle, such as NÂ·m/rad or ftÂ·lbf/degree. The inverse of <b>spring</b> <b>rate</b> is compliance, that is: if a <b>spring</b> has a <b>rate</b> of 10 N/mm, it has a compliance of 0.1 mm/N. The stiffness (or <b>rate)</b> of <b>springs</b> in parallel is additive, as is the compliance of springs in series.|$|R
