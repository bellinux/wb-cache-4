50|$|The legal {{regime is}} fraught with contradictions. While the legal text is {{explicit}} in seeking remedies, {{the implementation of the}} text appears to evade actual performance. Laws and legal processes are not self-executing; they depend on the administrative structure and the judiciary with the anticipation that the social attitudes are driven by notions of equity, social justice and fair play. However, the increasingly indifferent responses of those involved in the implementation of laws protecting the weak, the oppressed and the socially disadvantaged have persisted over the years and the system has failed to provide for self-correction. The problem is that the victims of atrocities suffer not only bodily and mental pain but also feelings of insecurity and social avoidance which is not present for the victims of other crimes. If the judge delegated to protect them <b>shows</b> <b>indifference,</b> it further aggravates their already vulnerable position.|$|E

Atrocitus fights Kyle at Green-Wood Cemetery, believing that the latter {{will be able to}} access his rage powers if he is being fought at the location of Alex DeWitts grave. However, Kyle instead feels sad and Atrocitus decides to take him to a war-torn country. Atrocitus holds Kyle back and forces him to watch a man being murdered in front of his son. Kyle unlocks rage and transforms into a Red Lantern, killing all the soldiers. He tries to fight Atrocitus but is knocked down by the latter and reverts into a Green Lantern. Atrocitus leaves to attend to his own business and Kyle uses the blue energies of hope to heal the nearby citizens. Kyle returns to the cemetery to find that Carol has restored Alexs grave. Kyle <b>shows</b> <b>indifference</b> to Carol and Alexs grave and decides to leave to harness the orange light of avarice. In Sector 2189, the Guardians Third Army begins converting more people into their ranks. In Sector 538, Indigo-1 is able to help Kyle harness the indigo light of compassion. Carol returns to Planet Zamaron where she is scolded for not obeying their orders. She counters that she was doing her duty as a Star Sapphire and is helping Kyle. The Zamarons allow her to continue but unbeknownst to Carol, she is being used by the Guardians to track Kyle since they can no longer tack his ring. On Planet Vorn, Kyle arrives to seek training from Arkillo. Arkillos worshipers point him to the forest where Kyle finds Arkillo. After baiting him with constructs of Sinestro, Kyle fights Arkillo. Kyle is able to harness the yellow light of fear when he admits that he is always scared and transforms into a Yellow Lantern. Once Carol arrives, Kyle reverts into a Green Lantern and the duo head to Okaara, with Arkillo joining them so that he may kill Sinestro and become the greatest fear Lantern of all. In Sector 2828, a group of Zamarons witness the Guardians Third Army assimilate members of the Spider Guild. Kyle and the group arrive at Okaara where they are greeted by Sayd. Larfleeze initially refuses to help Kyle unlock avarice but when Carol uses her powers to discover Larfleezes heartache and that his family is still alive, Larfleeze agrees to help. Larfleeze tells Kyle that if he wants to unlock avarice, he must take the Orange Lantern Central Power Battery from him and charge his ring with it. Kyle uses the various other powers hes unlocked to help him but everyone is surprised by the arrival of the Third Army. Carol and the others decide to fend them off and Kyle takes the Power Battery and charges his ring, unlocking the orange light of avarice. Larfleeze tries the pry the Power Battery from Kyles grasp just as hes being consumed by avarice. Carol succeeds in separating Kyle from it and hes returned to his senses by a Star Sapphire construct of Alex DeWitt. Sayd holds off the Third Army as Kyle and the others teleport away. At their sanctum, the Guardians watch as Sayd is seemingly killed by the Third Army. Ganthet, unfazed by this, decides he will deal with Rayner personally. On Planet Zamaron, Kyle is trying to unlock the violet light of love through a dream-like experience as he encounters several moments in his past such as: his father leaving him, a date with Alex, and celebrating Ganthets one billionth birthday. The Zamaron Queen reveals to a fellow Star Sapphire that their alliance with the Guardians is a ruse in order to find a weakness in them. Kyle is awakened and heads off to rendezvous with Carol and the others. However, he is confronted by Ganthet and the two battle, with Kyle trying to use the various powers of the Emotional Spectrum to beat him. The Zamarons and Star Sapphires arrive to aid Kyle just as Carol and the others do. While momentarily distracted by the arrival of the Third Army, Kyle is fatally struck by Ganthet. Kyle begins to accept that love isnt weakness and is able to access the power of love. As he does, Kyle has mastered all seven colors of the emotional spectrum and transforms into a White Lantern, destroying the Third Army on Zamaron and causing Ganthet to flee. With his new powers, Kyle decides to take the fight to Oa.|$|E
40|$|From the {{material}} surveying 300 Yugoslav pre-war villages the author presents typical attitudes {{of people living}} in closely tied extended peasant family »Zadrugas«. Perfectly adjusted to their setting, the young ones show only few signs of individual aspirations and no wish for personal independence. Examples are offered from different domains of life, such as the choise of the bride, when the fiance <b>shows</b> <b>indifference</b> and passivity. Other examples are from father-son relationships, with ceremonial forms of respect and great compliance of the sons toward the fathers’ wishes. The third are from the position of women in the family hierarchy and their complete lack of resistance to their low status. Two explanations for these attitudes are offered: first, the evasion of rules which is possible even under strict regulations, as for instance in bride abductions, a frequent way of evading parental orders in patriarchal villages. Second, the compensations which may be found in the patriarchal regime for restrictions on freedom. In this setting there is great security for youth in every respect, including that of getting married. There is also a carefree life and lack of harsh treatment of youth in this phase of family life. The compensation for masculine domination is shown in a lengthy quotation of a Serbian grandmother’s story. In comparing ancient and modern family life, she stresses the bright aspects of the old ways of life. A conclusion is drawn that the two components of human life — the collectivistic and the individualistic — follow each other like swing of the pendulum. When one of the tendencies has reached its high mark, the opposite begins its swing, gains momentum, and becomes dominant in family relations...|$|E
40|$|Methicillin {{resistant}} Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{infection is}} a global concern nowadays. Due to its multi-drug resistant nature, treatment with conventional antibiotics does not assure desired clinical outcomes. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to find new compounds and/or alternative methods to get arsenal against the pathogen. Combination therapies using conventional antibiotics and phytochemicals fulfill both requirements. In this study, the efficacy of different phytochemicals in combination with selected antibiotics was tested against 12 strains of S. aureus (ATCC MRSA 43300, ATCC methicillin sensitive S. aureus or MSSA 29213 and 10 MRSA clinical strains collected from National University Hospital, Singapore). Out of the six phytochemicals used, tannic acid was synergistic with fusidic acid, minocycline, cefotaxime and rifampicin against most of strains tested and additive with ofloxacin and vancomycin. Quercetin showed synergism with minocycline, fusidic acid and rifampicin against most of the strains.

40|$|Background: The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of {{meropenem}} and ciprofloxacin was {{studied in}} the presence of the antineoplastic agent 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU). The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the PAEs of the combinations differed from the PAEs of the antibiotics alone. Methods: The PAEs of the combinations of 5 -FU plus meropenem or ciprofloxacin were determined with viable counts against four reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and two clinical isolates of S. epidermidis. The results were compared with the PAEs of the antibiotics drugs and 5 -FU alone. The gram-positive strains were tested for slime production, both alone and {{in the presence of}} 5 -FU. Results: Against two of the three tested strains of S. epidermidis, the combination of ciprofloxacin and 5 -FU gave a synergistic prolongation of the PAE in comparison with the PAEs induced by the drugs alone. The combinations <b>showed</b> <b>indifference</b> against the other bacteria. The combination of meropenem and 5 -FU had a synergistic PAE against one of the three tested strains of S. epidermidis and an additive effect against E coli but <b>showed</b> <b>indifference</b> against the rest of the strains. Conclusions:The presence of 5 -FU did not influence the PAEs of the antibiotics against most of the tested strains, but caused a synergistic prolongation of the PAEs induced by ciprofloxacin and meropenem against some of the tested strains of S. epidermidis. 5 -FU inhibited slime production in the same S. epidermidis strains, which might have contributed to the longer PAE...|$|R
