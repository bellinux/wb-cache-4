500|$|Garrow's {{estate was}} valued at £22,000 {{after his death}} near Ramsgate, Kent, {{including}} £12,000 in the Bank of England, £5,000 in three insurance policies and £5,000 <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> <b>mortgages</b> – a total of £ in [...] terms. Garrow's will was written in 1830 and contained only two demands; {{to be buried in}} his birthplace, Hadley, with his uncle, his father's younger brother William (who had left Garrow the best part of his fortune), and to set up a trust. The trust contained his entire estate, with the trustees being Leonard Smith, a merchant, Edward Lowth Badeley of Paper Buildings, Inner Temple and William Nanson Lettsom of Gray's Inn. The money was divided between Joseph, Garrow's nephew, who received £1,000, £200 to each of the children of Garrow's sister, £2,000 to the sister and £300 a year to the widow of Garrow's son. Eliza, Garrow's daughter, received £300 a year from the interest on the trust, with an additional provision of £200 for the joint use of Eliza and her husband. The estate was structured by a legal professional, and as such no death duties were paid. The second instruction was ignored: Garrow was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence, [...] Ramsgate, his parish church.|$|E

50|$|The world's {{largest public}} sector (30% {{of the entire}} {{workforce}} on a full-time basis) is financed by the world's highest taxes. A value added tax of 25% is levied {{on the sale of}} most goods and services (including groceries). The income tax in Denmark ranges from 37.4% to 63% progressively, levied on 4 out of 10 full-time employees. Such high rates meant that 1,010,000 Danes before the end of 2008 (44% of all full-time employees) were paying a marginal income tax of 63% and a combined marginal tax of 70.9% resulting in warnings from organisations such as the OECD. TV2 (Denmark) reported in April 2008 that abolishing the middle- and top-level income tax brackets would amount to two (2) and one (1) percent of public sector revenue, respectively, which equals one and a half percent of GDP. The public sector as a whole had a budget surplus of 4.4% of GDP in 2007, but the tax cuts would increase private consumption and the labor shortage, thus, resulting in a deficit on the trade balance and pressure to increase wages even further. Proceeds from selling ones home are not taxed, as the marginal tax rate on capital income from housing savings is around 0 percent. A survey by Standard & Poor's found that the total debt <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> <b>mortgages</b> in Danish homes amounts to 89.8% of GDP, which is above the debt level in other EU countries (and the USA at 74.6% of GDP).|$|E

50|$|Saint Paul {{was said}} by travelers, {{to be the}} fastest and liveliest town on the Mississippi River. Emigration was pouring in astonishingly, several boats landing daily loaded with passengers. Those {{intending}} {{to go back in}} the country, usually purchased their supplies here, and the stores were almost overtaxed, so profitable was their trade. The hotels and boarding houses were crowded to overflowing. The principal business streets fairly hummed with the rush of busy life. Building was never so brisk; an army of workman and mechanics labored night and day {{to keep up with the}} demand for dwellings and stores. That season they coined money.:On August 24, occurred the failure of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, of New York, which gave rise to the memorable panic or financial revulsion of that year. To St. Paul, this pricking of the bubble of speculation was more ruinous and dire in its consequences than perhaps to any other city in the west. Everything had been so inflated and unreal--values purely fictitious, all classes in debt, with but little real wealth, honest industry neglected, and everything speculative and feverish—-that the blow fell with ruinous force. Business was paralyzed, real estate actually valueless and unsaleable at any price, and but little good money in circulation. Ruin stared all classes in the face. The note <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> <b>mortgages</b> must be paid, but all values were destroyed. No device would raise money, for no one had any to lend. Everybody was struggling to save himself. The banking houses closed their doors—-nearly all the mercantile stores suspended or made assignments. All works of improvement ceased, and general gloom and despondency settled down on the community. In a few days, from the top waive of prosperity, it was plunged into the slough of despond.|$|E
5000|$|The fury of this {{uprising}} {{destroyed the}} organization of the Jewish communities in Belarus. The survivors who returned to their old homes {{in the latter half of}} the 17th century were practically destitute. The wars which raged constantly in the Lithuanian territory brought ruin to the entire country and deprived the Jews of the opportunity to earn more than a bare livelihood. The intensity of their struggle for existence left them no time to reestablish the conditions which had existed up to 1648. John Casimir (1648-1668) sought to ameliorate their condition by granting various concessions to the Jewish communities of Lithuania. Attempts to return to the old order in the communal organization were not wanting, as is evident from contemporary documents. Thus in 1672, Jewish elders from various towns and villages in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania secured a charter from King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki (1669-1673), decreeing [...] "that on account of the increasing number of Jews guilty of offenses against the Szlachta and other Christians, which result in the enmity of the Christians toward the Jews, and because of the inability of the Jewish elders to punish such offenders, who are protected by the lords, the king permits the kahals to summon the criminals before the Jewish courts for punishment and exclusion from the community when necessary." [...] The efforts to resurrect the old power of the kahals were not successful. The impoverished Jewish merchants, having no capital of their own, were compelled to borrow money from the nobility, from churches, congregations, monasteries, and various religious orders. Loans from the latter were usually for an unlimited period and were <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> <b>mortgages</b> on the real estate of the kahal. The kahals thus became hopelessly indebted to the clergy and the nobility.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} comply with the {{requirements}} of the Basel II Accord, banks need to frequently assess the market values of properties <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> <b>mortgages.</b> In lieu of property valuation reviews done by professional valuers, an index-based approach could potentially be used by banks to value property. This paper presents a study undertaken using data and resources from a South African commercial property finance bank to assess whether index-based valuations produce statistically similar valuations to those given by professional valuers. It was found {{that in the case of}} the particular bank, index-based valuations provide statistically similar market values to traditional valuations. Furthermore, index-based valuations provide consistent results when updating market values for properties with older historic valuations in the same way as for properties valued relatively recently. An index-based approach to review market valuations may thus provide considerable cost savings...|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis establishes new obstacles, requirements and {{challenges to the}} agricultural producers. In such circumstances {{it is especially important}} for farmers to base their investment and financial decisions on well-founded methods using multiple information sources. In Hungary during the reviewing of the credit applications the assessment of financial plans has only minor importance as banks tend to avoid granting loans on business grounds and rather favour loans <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> <b>mortgages</b> or other means. However, if for the assessment of financial plans there were a well-worked out, reliable tool available that could make the reviewing of loan application much easier. Assuring higher security for loans would not only increase the amount of credits granted {{but in the long run}} could reduce the interest rates as well. In this paper we intend to introduce a concept, based on FADN data, that will make the assessment of the validity of the financial plans possible. The core of the method is the selection of very similar FADN holdings and whether the farms’ income will secure the redemption of the required loan will be assessed from the data of these holdings...|$|E
40|$|This article reviews what we {{know about}} {{transferring}} ownership and the right of enforcement of nonnegotiable notes. The focus will be on notes <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> <b>mortgages,</b> since this is likely the context in which most modern nonnegotiable notes are created. There has been a vast amount of litigation about the transfer of negotiable mortgage notes in the past half decade, greatly expanding our understanding, but there has been little development involving nonnegotiable notes. Hence, it is helpful to compare negotiable and nonnegotiable notes, with particular emphasis on how each is transferred. Perhaps ironically, this means that the bulk of this article discusses negotiable notes as a point of reference, despite the fact that its ultimate focus is nonnegotiable notes. Part I of this article reviews the history of the definition of negotiability, and shows how our current understanding of negotiability came to be. Part II demonstrates how {{to tell the difference between}} negotiable and nonnegotiable notes, and why that difference is important. Part III discusses the meaning of “transfer” of a promissory note. Part IV examines specifically how the right to enforce nonnegotiable notes can be transferred under present law, and considers whether changes are needed. Finally, this article concludes with a brief description of a proposed national mortgage registry that has the potential to make transfers of both negotiable and nonnegotiable mortgage notes far more efficient without disrupting the current legal regime...|$|E

40|$|There are two {{different}} views {{on the effects of}} public financial institutions on corporate debt restructuring : the soft budget view and the hard budget view. The former view, which is held by Kornai (1979, 1983), Dewatripont and Maskin (1995), and others insists that because centralized public financial institutions have difficulty committing themselves to refrain from providing additional funds to distressed firms, corporate reorganizations often result in overinvestment. On the other hand, the latter view argues that public financial institutions should prefer corporate liquidation rather than the continuation of business because public financial institutions are <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> <b>mortgages</b> to a greater extent and are more reluctant to forgive the debts than private financial institutions. In this paper, I have empirically examined the role and impact of public financial institutions, government-affiliated financial institutions in particular, from the viewpoints of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and bankruptcy procedures for distressed firms. The conclusions of this paper are as follows. In the DIP financing, the Development Bank of Japan always takes the lead, followed by private financial institutions. Namely, so-called cowbell effect may exist, which is inconsistent with the hard budget view. Regarding the selection of bankruptcy procedures, firms that owed to government-affiliated financial institutions have a tendency to opt for private procedures which have the effect of delaying a drastic debt restructuring. This is consistent with the soft budget view. public financial institutions, bankruptcy procedures, debtor-in-possession financing...|$|E
