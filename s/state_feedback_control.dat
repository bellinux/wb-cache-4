40|$|It {{is known}} that for single-input {{neutrally}} stable planar systems, there exists a class of saturated globally stabilizing linear <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> laws. The goal {{of this paper is}} to characterize the dynamic behavior for such a system under arbitrary locally stabilizing linear <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> laws. On the one hand, for the continuous-time case, we show that all locally stabilizing linear <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> laws are also globally stabilizing control laws. On the other hand, for the discrete-time case, we first show that this property does not hold by explicitly constructing nontrivial periodic solution for a particular system. We then show for an example that there exists more globally stabilizing linear <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> laws than well known ones in the literature...|$|E

40|$|An offline model {{predictive}} control (MPC) algorithm for linear parameter varying (LPV) systems is presented. The main contribution {{is to develop}} an offline MPC algorithm for LPV systems that can deal with both time-varying scheduling parameter and persistent disturbance. The norm-bounding technique is used to derive an offline MPC algorithm based on the parameter-dependent <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> law and the parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. The online computational time is reduced by solving offline the linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problems to find the sequences of explicit <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> laws. At each sampling instant, a parameter-dependent <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> law is computed by linear interpolation between the precomputed <b>state</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> laws.
