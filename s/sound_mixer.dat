25|$|In early February 1972, guitarist O'List {{quit the}} group {{abruptly}} after an altercation with Paul Thompson, {{which took place}} at their audition for David Enthoven of EG Management. When O'List didn't {{show up for the}} next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band's <b>sound</b> <b>mixer.</b> When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst {{to the rest of the}} group, Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O'List's permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as David Gilmour, who was a friend of his older brother, and Soft Machine's Robert Wyatt.|$|E

25|$|Mixing {{consoles}} {{often include}} high-pass filtering at each channel strip. Some models have fixed-slope, fixed-frequency high-pass filters at 80 or 100Hz {{that can be}} engaged; other models have sweepable high-pass filters, filters of fixed slope that can be set within a specified frequency range, such as from 20 to 400Hz on the Midas Heritage 3000, or 20 to 20,000Hz on the Yamaha M7CL digital mixing console. Veteran systems engineer and live <b>sound</b> <b>mixer</b> Bruce Main recommends that high-pass filters be engaged for most mixer input sources, except for those such as kick drum, bass guitar and piano, sources which will have useful low frequency sounds. Main writes that DI unit inputs (as opposed to microphone inputs) do not need high-pass filtering as they {{are not subject to}} modulation by low-frequency stage wash—low frequency sounds coming from the subwoofers or the public address system and wrapping around to the stage. Main indicates that high-pass filters are commonly used for directional microphones which have a proximity effect—a low-frequency boost for very close sources. This low frequency boost commonly causes problems up to 200 or 300Hz, but Main notes that he has seen microphones that benefit from a 500Hz high-pass filter setting on the console.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} season, Lana Wachowski took over {{many of the}} filmmaking aspects of the show, which {{combined}} with her sister's break, made her responsibilities as director shoot up. Production <b>sound</b> <b>mixer</b> Stevie Haywood recounted Lana's directing style was to use two cameras as the default setup, and develop the shot over [...] "enormously long takes" [...] which could last up to fifteen to twenty minutes. Additionally, {{the cast and crew}} under Lana did not use any rehearsals. [...] "We rehearse on camera effectively", said Haywood. If there were any technical issues Lana expected the cast to improvise and keep the shoot going instead of calling [...] "cut". Smith, Desai and Silvestre corroborated Lana's style of developing the shots on the set, her dislike for rehearsals, and the use of long takes, with the actors told to try different variations on how they play their parts. McTeigue returned as director for Mexico City. Tykwer returned as director for the Nairobi parts but not for the Berlin ones, as he was busy working on his own TV series, Babylon Berlin. According to Glass, in the second season he directed the second unit in Seoul, and he also did some directing in Berlin. Overall, six episodes of the second season, including the Christmas special, credit Lana as director, three credit McTeigue, and Tykwer and Glass get credited each in one.|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} {{has worked with}} screenwriter David S. Goyer on all his comic-book adaptations. Wally Pfister was the cinematographer for all of Nolan's films from Memento to The Dark Knight Rises. Embarking on his own career as a director, Pfister said: [...] "The greatest lesson I learned from Chris Nolan is to keep my humility. He is an absolute gentleman on set and he is wonderful to everyone — from the actors to the entire crew, he treats everyone with respect." [...] Lee Smith has been Nolan's editor since Batman Begins, with Dody Dorn editing Memento and Insomnia. David Julyan composed the music for Nolan's early work, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provided the music for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Zimmer scored The Dark Knight Rises, and has worked with Nolan on his subsequent films. Zimmer has said his creative relationship with Nolan is highly collaborative, and that he views Nolan as [...] "the co-creator of the score". The {{director has}} worked with sound designer Richard King and <b>sound</b> <b>mixer</b> Ed Novick since The Prestige. Nolan has frequently collaborated with special-effects supervisor Chris Corbould, stunt coordinator Tom Struthers first assistant director Nilo Otero, and visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin. Production designer Nathan Crowley has worked with him since Insomnia (except for Inception). Nolan has called Crowley {{one of his closest}} and most inspiring creative collaborators.

500|$|The Kinetophone (aka Phonokinetoscope) was {{an early}} attempt by Edison and Dickson to create a sound-film system. Reports suggest that in July 1893, a Kinetoscope {{accompanied}} by a cylinder phonograph had been presented at the Chicago World's Fair. The first known movie made {{as a test of}} the Kinetophone was shot at Edison's New Jersey studio in late 1894 or early 1895, which is now referred to as The Dickson Experimental Sound Film; this film, along with a short film from 1913 called Nursery Favorites and a 1912 demonstration film, are the only surviving movies with live-recorded sound made for the Kinetophone. In March 1895, Edison offered the device for sale; involving no technological innovations, it was a Kinetoscope whose modified cabinet included an accompanying cylinder phonograph. Kinetoscope owners were also offered kits with which to retrofit their equipment. The first Kinetophone exhibitions appear to have taken place in April. Though a Library of Congress educational website states, [...] "The picture and sound were made somewhat synchronous by connecting the two with a belt," [...] this is incorrect. As historian David Robinson describes, [...] "The Kinetophone...made no attempt at synchronization. The viewer listened through tubes to a phonograph concealed in the cabinet and performing approximately appropriate music or other sound." [...] Historian Douglas Gomery concurs, [...] " [...] did not try to synchronize sound and image." [...] Leading production <b>sound</b> <b>mixer</b> Mark Ulano writes, [...] "nly 45 Kinetophones were made. They did NOT play synchronously other than the phonograph turned on when viewing and off when stopped." [...] Though the surviving Dickson test involves live-recorded sound, certainly most, and probably all, of the films marketed for the Kinetophone were shot as silents, predominantly march or dance subjects; exhibitors could then choose from a variety of musical cylinders offering a rhythmic match. For example, three different cylinders with orchestral performances were proposed as accompaniments for Carmencita: [...] "Valse Santiago", [...] "La Paloma", and [...] "Alma-Danza Spagnola".|$|E
500|$|Carey's {{performance}} was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The show featured {{a number of}} musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. Directed by Larry Jordan, who previously worked with Carey on the music video for [...] "Someday". Dana Jon Chapelle {{was chosen as the}} <b>sound</b> <b>mixer,</b> having worked with Carey on her previous two studio albums. The show began with the song [...] "Emotions" [...] Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. Prior to the song's studio introduction, Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and a cappella number, eventually leading to the song's chorus led by David Cole. After the song, Carey introduced the band and staff; to her left was a four-piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett, Cecilia Hobbs-Gardner, Wince Garvey and Laura Corcos, while San Shea played the harpsichord and harmonium. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan. The next song on the set-list was [...] "If It's Over", a collaboration with Carole King. Walter Afanasieff replaced Cole on the piano, during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage. They were Lew Delgado, baritone saxophone; Lenny Pickett, tenor saxophone; George Young, alto saxophone; Earl Gardner, trumpet; and Steve Turre, trombone. They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said [...] "this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King", beginning the performance shortly after. For [...] "Someday", Cole returned to the stage, replacing Afanasieff on the keyboard. During the song, Carey would often place her index finger over her left ear, especially while using the whistle register. She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note. Once again, as Carey began [...] "Vision of Love", her [...] "first single ever", Afansieff swapped positions with Cole. The performance varied heavily from the studio version, as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form, without any heavy instrumentation. Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, [...] "Make It Happen", Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. After the song began, the back-up began [...] "piling their vocals" [...] over Carey's, according to author Chris Nickson, and allowed the song to attain a more [...] "churchy feel". He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals: ...|$|E

Towards the end of 1969, they booked time at Advision Studios in London during gaps between shows to record Time and a Word.
