40|$|AbstractSummary data {{take the}} form of a triple that {{consists}} of a <b>summary</b> attribute, a category and a numeric value. The inference problem of <b>summary</b> data consists in deciding whether or not a <b>summary</b> data of interest is evaluable (i. e., can be computed) from a given set of <b>summary</b> data. We address the special case of the inference problem with homogeneous <b>summary</b> data (i. e., summary data with the same <b>summary</b> attribute), where the <b>summary</b> attribute is of additive nature. Owing to additivity, one can model the information content of the given <b>summary</b> data by a linear equation system whose variables are constrained to take their values from the domain of the <b>summary</b> attribute. We state two evaluability criteria, one for a real or integral <b>summary</b> attribute, and the other for a nonnegative-real or nonnegative-integral <b>summary</b> attribute. Using the two evaluability criteria, we show that our inference problem can be solved in strongly polynomial time for a real or integral or nonnegative real <b>summary</b> attribute, and is coNP-complete for a nonnegative-integral <b>summary</b> attribute. Moreover, we prove that, given a <b>summary</b> data of interest that is not evaluable, even in the (simplest) case that the <b>summary</b> attribute is of a real type, finding an evaluable <b>summary</b> data whose category is maximally contained in (or minimally contains) the category of the <b>summary</b> data of interest is an NP-hard problem...|$|R

40|$|Plan B Paper. 2012. Master of Arts-TESOL [...] University of Wisconsin-River Falls. English Department. ii, 88 leaves. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 60 - 64). In this paper, I {{will show}} how teaching <b>summary</b> writing through direct instruction helps students develop text comprehension in ESL/EFL settings. In the first part, I will overview reading-writing connections, introduce Reader-Response Theory, and discuss <b>summary</b> {{as a primary}} reading-writing activity. In the second part, I will first briefly define a <b>summary,</b> and then discuss <b>summary</b> for text comprehension, general factors influencing <b>summary</b> writing, {{and the process of}} <b>summary</b> writing. More specifically, in the section discussing the <b>summary</b> writing process, I will compare good and poor summarizers, and examine how different L 1 and L 2 writers' use of paraphrase in <b>summary</b> writing. Then, the recursive nature of <b>summary</b> writing and process rules of <b>summary</b> writing will be further discussed. In addition, I will describe direct instruction on <b>summary</b> writing and how to give feedback on students' <b>summary</b> writing in the later section of the second part. Lastly, I will describe pedagogical application of <b>summary</b> writing in South Korea...|$|R

Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the probands) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case <b>summaries</b> were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan.
