40|$|Weaknesses {{regarding}} {{alarm management}} practices {{have been recognized}} as partial causes of plant incidents with tragic results, for example the Texas City Oil Refinery explosion in 2005. Necessity in alarm regulation was recognized by industry bodies and norms were created (EEMUA 119, ANSI/ISA 18. 2) {{in order to address}} this. These norms define a complete alarm management lifecycle, including the definition <b>of</b> an <b>alarm</b> performance monitoring process with the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>alarm’s</b> key performance indicators (KPI) Alarm KPI generation in oil instalations is a complex technological task and generally includes the integration <b>of</b> <b>alarms</b> coming from different sources in the process plant. The Information Management Systems (IMS) as defined in NORSOK I- 002 as the natural gathering engine for process data in an offshore installation. The utilization <b>of</b> IMS in <b>Alarm</b> Management Purposes is included in this NORSOK standard. The original driver of this investigation was that Offshore Platforms in the Norwegian Continental Shelf do not utilize IMS for Alarm Management KPI generation, despite their intense utilization of IMS for other purposes. Technical reasons for this practice are not known. In order to evaluate the current capacity <b>of</b> IMS in <b>alarm</b> KPI generation, a minimum required set of KPIs was established although different standards show variations between KPIs. The data structure gathered inside IMS in related to alarms (alarms metadata) was compared against the established set of KPIs. The main study finding conclude that data contained whiting the IMS structure is currently not enough for generate the priority- related KPIs, mainly because alarm priority is not included in current IMS. In general terms; IMS data structure is not defined by NORSOK and even when included in some industry related regulations (as Statoil TR 2258) Alarm Priority is not considered to be part <b>of</b> <b>Alarm</b> metadata. The above finding points to an easy solution and raises questions regarding lack of “data priority” in the IMS data structure. This comes from a lack of regulation in IMS Implementation, mainly because of NORSOK standards...|$|R
40|$|With the LHC {{technical}} infrastructure in place, {{one of the}} main concerns is to achieve maximum availability and reliability through, for example, appropriate operation and supervision. This paper is intended to draw the attention of the experts to the shortcomings of the existing remote <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> the {{technical infrastructure}}. These reduce the efficiency of the Technical Control Room (TCR) due to the large number <b>of</b> <b>alarms.</b> There are alarms generated by maintenance or shutdown activities, those connected to disused hardware and others not indicating an intervention or without sufficient documentation. Systems optimized not only for nominal load but also for operation modes such as accelerator shutdown and system maintenance could significantly decrease the number <b>of</b> <b>alarms</b> and thus reduce system downtime and operational costs.

40|$|Supervision {{in school}} often {{discussed}} about the negative opinion of teachers because misunderstanding {{about the process}} and the concept <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> Thus, this descriptive study was conducted through a questionnaire survey on three schools in the Zone City Muar Johor. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the teachers’ opinions towards <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction that has been implemented at schools, identify the practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction carried out at school, identify whether there is a difference teachers’ opinion towards <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on demographic factors (gender, race and experience teaching), identify whether there is a difference practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on demographic factors (gender, race and experience teaching) and determine whether there is a significant relationship between opinion for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction with practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction. The study sample involved 120 teachers from schools in SJK (C) Zone City Muar Johor. Questionnaires modified from previous studies were used as an instrument. The data were analyzed using SPSS and the results of the analysis were reported in the form of descriptive statistics. The reliability of the instrument using Cronbach Alpha was 0. 644 for part B and 0. 797 for part C. The results showed that teachers had a positive opinion for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction and practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction was at a high level, the study showed no difference of opinion about the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on gender and race, and found a difference of opinion about the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on experience teaching. The findings showed there was no significant difference in teachers' opinions about practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction based on gender, race and experience teaching. Finally, this study proves that there was a positive and strong relationship between the opinion for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction with practice <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> instruction...|$|R

The paper describes the representation and the corresponding algorithms for processing this extension according to the purpose <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> in terms <b>of</b> performance. ...|$|R
