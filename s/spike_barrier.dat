40|$|Si surface. This {{undesirable}} current can {{be reduced}} by replacing the CVD-SiO 2 with thermally-grown SiO 2. To evaluate the performance of our wide-gap emitter, the current gains of devices with different base carrier concentrat ions were plotted {{as a function of}} the base Gummel number together with various previously re~* ported HBT's (4, 10 - 11) using Si as the base and collector materials. This is shown in Fig. 11. The calculated value for an ideal HBT, in which no recombinat ion current flows across an emitter-base junction, was also plotted. In this calculation the base width was 0. 3 rtm, nearly the same as that of the fabricated HBT's, and current gain was assumed to be determined by the base transport fac-tor. The most pronounced feature in this figure is the weak dependence of current gain on the base Gummel number for our devices. This may be caused by a hetero-junction with a conduction band <b>spike</b> <b>barrier.</b> The per-formance of our wide-gap emitter becomes uperior at large base Gummel numbers. Conclusion In conclusion, arsenic and phosphorus ion implanta-t ion was proposed for the doping of 13 -SIC. SiC/Si heterojunct ion diodes, doped by the ion implantation, have shown excel lent forward and reverse characteris-tics. Prel iminary heterojunct ion bipolar transistors using a single-crystalline SiC as an emitter were realized for the first time, though the current gain of 15 is still low. This initial result may possibly lead to practical ap-pl ications of the epitaxial SiC emitter for sil icon heterojunction bipolar transistors...|$|E
40|$|The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory has {{designed}} an laboratory tested a prototype retractable <b>spiked</b> <b>barrier</b> strip for law enforcement. The proposed system, which {{is ready for}} controlled field testing, expands the functionality of existing <b>spiked</b> <b>barrier</b> strips. A retractable barrier strip, one that can place the spikes in either the active (vertical) or passive (horizontal) position, would allow law enforcement personnel to lay the unobtrusive strip across a road far in advance of a fleeing vehicle. No damage occurs to passing vehicles until the spikes are activated, {{and that can be}} done from a safe distance and at a strategic location when the offending vehicle is close to the strip. The concept also allows the strips to be place safely across several roadways that are potential paths of a fleeing vehicle. Since they are not activated until needed, they are harmless to nonoffending vehicles. The laboratory tests conducted on the system indicate that it will puncture tires only when the spikes are rotated to the active position and is safe to travel over when the spikes are in the down position. The strip itself will not cause instability to a vehicle driving over it, nor is the strip disturbed or adversely affected by vehicles driving over it. The spikes can be quickly rotated between the active (vertical) and passive (horizontal) position. However, the laboratory tests have only demonstrated that the retractable <b>spiked</b> <b>barrier</b> strip can perform its intended function in a laboratory environment. Field tests are needed to finalize the design and develop the system into a functional law enforcement tool...|$|R

An asymmetric magnetoconductance peak {{as a function of}} the homogeneous magnetic field is found, comprising quantized conductance steps in the interval where the homogeneous magnetic field and the magnetic barrier have identical polarities, and a characteristic shoulder with several resonances in the interval of opposite polarities. The observations are interpreted in terms of inhomogeneous diamagnetic shifts of the quantum wire modes leading to magnetic confinement. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Photoluminescence and Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{have been}} used to study a Delta-doped Insub 0. 1 Gasub 0. 9 As:Si/GaAs strained quantum well with the doping spike placed at the centre of the 30 nm wide well. In this structure the potential confining the electron gas is given by a superposition of the V-shaped potential well induced by the doping <b>spike</b> and <b>barriers</b> introduced by the heterointerfaces. Both luminescence and intersubband Raman spectra provide information on the energy spacing and population of the electron subbands. A comparison with results of self-consistent subband calculations is made. Raman spectra exicited in resonance with the Esub 0 plusDeltasub 0 bandgap of the Insub 0. 1 Gasub 0. 9 As quantum well show intense singleparticle intersubband transitions, which dominate over the signal from collective spin-density and charge-density excitations. Possible mechanisms for the occurrence of such strong single-particle intersubband Raman signals are discussed...|$|R
60|$|It is {{the same}} with both {{officers}} and men. If a Captain have a grudge against a Lieutenant, or a Lieutenant against a midshipman, how easy to torture him by official treatment, which shall not lay open the superior officer to legal rebuke. And if a midshipman bears a grudge against a sailor, how easy for him, by cunning practices, born of a boyish spite, to have him degraded at the gangway. Through all the endless ramifications of rank and station, in most men-of-war there runs a sinister vein of bitterness, not exceeded by the fireside hatreds {{in a family of}} stepsons ashore. It were sickening to detail all the paltry irritabilities, jealousies, and cabals, the spiteful detractions and animosities, that lurk far down, and cling to the very kelson of the ship. It is unmanning to think of. The immutable ceremonies and iron etiquette of a man-of-war; the <b>spiked</b> <b>barriers</b> separating the various grades of rank; the delegated absolutism of authority on all hands; the impossibility, {{on the part of the}} common seaman, of appeal from incidental abuses, and many more things that might be enumerated, all tend to beget in most armed ships a general social condition which is the precise reverse of what any Christian could desire. And though there are vessels, that in some measure furnish exceptions to this; and though, in other ships, the thing may be glazed over by a guarded, punctilious exterior, almost completely hiding the truth from casual visitors, while the worst facts touching the common sailor are systematically kept in the background, yet it is certain that what has here been said of the domestic interior of a man-of-war will, in a greater or less degree, apply to most vessels in the Navy. It is not that the officers are so malevolent, nor, altogether, that the man-of-war's-man is so vicious. Some of these evils are unavoidably generated through the operation of the Naval code; others are absolutely organic to a Navy establishment, and, like other organic evils, are incurable, except when they dissolve with the body they live in.|$|R
40|$|A coconut {{dehusking}} machine comprising of two rollers with <b>spikes,</b> screw conveyor, <b>barrier</b> plates, conveyor belt, two {{spur gears}} and a handle {{was developed for}} small scale production in the rural areas. Performance test analysis conducted shows that the machine dehusks coconut fruits without nut breakage and distortion of the extracted fibre length and also that its average dehusking efficiency and capacity are 93. 45 % and 79 coconuts per hour. All materials used in the fabrication of this machine were of standard specifications and locally sourced. The estimated cost for producing one unit of the machine is thirty five thousand, six hundred and sixty-five naira (N 35, 665. 00). The machine also eliminated dependency on the epileptic public electric power supply in our rural areas which the major obstacle {{in the use of}} other mechanized coconut dehusking equipments in the rural areas...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are eight}} playable {{characters}} in the roster and two different play modes for players to choose from: [...] "Normal Game" [...] and [...] "Death Match". In [...] "Normal Game", players have to defeat the other seven playable characters in a random order, followed by a battle against the final boss Geegus (misspelled as [...] "Gee Gus" [...] in localized English versions), all by using the chosen character. If the player defeats an opponent, the player moves {{on to the next}} opponent. After the third battle, the player has a bonus round to carve a block of stone into a statue in ten seconds with repeated hits. After the sixth battle, the player has another bonus round to break falling pots in ten seconds before they hit the ground. [...] "Death Match" [...] acts like Normal Mode with a difference. Players will fight in a ring with environmental hazards such as electrical <b>barriers,</b> <b>spiked</b> walls, oil puddles and others which players must avoid while fighting. Players also can force their opponents against the environmental hazards to their advantage.|$|R
500|$|The pre-title {{sequence}} has a {{scene where}} Bond flies a nimble homebuilt Bede BD-5J aircraft through an open hangar. Hollywood stunt pilot and aerial co-ordinator J.W. [...] "Corkey" [...] Fornof, who piloted the aircraft at more than 150 miles per hour, has said, [...] "Today, few directors would consider such a stunt. They'd just whip {{it up in a}} computer lab." [...] Having collapsible wings, the plane was shown hidden in a horse trailer; however, a dummy was used for this shot. Filming inside the hangar was achieved by attaching the aircraft to an old Jaguar car with a steel pole, driving with the roof removed. The second unit were able to add enough obstacles including people and objects inside the hangar to hide the car and the pole and make it look as though Moore was flying inside the base. For the explosion after the mini jet escapes, however, a miniature of the hangar was constructed and filmed up close. The exploding pieces of the hangar were in reality only four inches in length. Bond stole a Mercedes-Benz saloon car at a depot manned by antagonist soldiers, then as he tried to escape drove over <b>barrier</b> <b>spikes</b> which shredded his tyres. So he maneuvered his vehicle's bare wheels onto the rails to pursue the train. During filming, the car had intact tyres in one scene so as to avoid any mishap.|$|R
40|$|SBV (Single Barrier Varactor) diodes {{have been}} {{proposed}} as alternatives to Schottky barrier diodes for harmonic multiplier applications. However, these show a higher current than expected. The excess current is due to X valley transport in the barrier. We present experimental results showing {{that the use of}} a superlattice <b>barrier</b> and doping <b>spikes</b> in the GaAs depletion regions {{on either side of the}} barrier can reduce the excess current and improve the control of the capacitance vs. voltage characteristic. The experimental results consist of data taken from two types of device structures. The first test structure was used to study the performance of AlAs/GaAs superlattice barriers. The wafer was fabricated into 90 micron diameter mesa diodes and the resulting current vs. voltage characteristics were measured. A 10 period superlattice structure with a total thickness of approximately 400 A worked well as an electron barrier. The structure had a current density of about one A/sq cm at one volt at room temperature. The capacitance variation of these structures was small because of the design of the GaAs cladding layers. The second test structure was used to study cladding layer designs. These wafers were InGaAs and InAlAs layers lattice matched to an InP substrate. The layers have n(+) doping <b>spikes</b> near the <b>barrier</b> to increase the zero bias capacitance and control the shape of the capacitance vs. voltage characteristic. These structures have a capacitance ratio of 5 : 1 and an abrupt change from maximum to minimum capacitance. The measurements were made at 80 K. Based on the information obtained from these two structures, we have designed a structure that combines the low current density barrier with the improved cladding layers. The capacitance and current-voltage characteristics from this structure are presented...|$|R
60|$|When {{he found}} that this {{movement}} had been accomplished Walter bade the men-at-arms fall back gradually. A gap had been left in the wooden fence sufficient for {{one at a time}} to pass, and through this the men-at-arms retired one by one to the keep until only Walter and five others were left. With these Walter flung himself suddenly upon the assailants and forced them a few feet down the slope. Then he gave the word, and all sprang back, and leaping down from the wall into the courtyard ran through the barrier, Walter and Ralph being the last to pass as the French with exulting shouts leapt down from the breach. There was another fierce fight at the barrier. Walter left Ralph to defend this with a few men-at-arms while he saw that all was in readiness for closing the door rapidly in the keep. Then he ran back again. He was but just in time. Ralph indeed could for a long time have held the narrow passage, but the barriers themselves were yielding. The French were pouring in through the breach, and as those behind could not see the nature of the obstacle which arrested the advance of their companions they continued to push forward, and by their weight pressed those in front against the <b>spikes</b> in the <b>barrier.</b> Many perished miserably on these. Others, whose armour protected them from this fate, were crushed to death by the pressure; but this was now so great that the timbers were yielding. Walter, seeing that in another moment they would be levelled, gave the word, sprang back with Ralph and his party, and entered the keep just as with a crash the barrier fell and the French poured in a crowd into the courtyard. Bolting the door the defenders of the keep piled against it the stones which had been laid in readiness.|$|R
