Notwithstanding any <b>similarities</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of {{football in}} England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.|$|E

5|$|Other {{groups of}} archaea use {{sunlight}} {{as a source}} of energy (they are phototrophs). However, oxygen–generating photosynthesis does not occur in any of these organisms. Many basic metabolic pathways are shared between all forms of life; for example, archaea use a modified form of glycolysis (the Entner–Doudoroff pathway) and either a complete or partial citric acid cycle. These <b>similarities</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The three sonatas are {{cyclically}} interconnected by diverse structural, harmonic and melodic elements tying {{together all}} movements in each sonata, {{as well as}} all three sonatas together; consequently, they are often regarded as a trilogy. They also contain specific allusions and <b>similarities</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> Schubert compositions, such as his Winterreise song cycle; these connections point to turbulent emotions expressed in the sonatas, often understood as highly personal and autobiographical. Indeed, some researchers have suggested specific psychological narratives for the sonatas, based on historical evidence concerning the composer's life.|$|E

Like most traditional JRPGs, {{there are two main}} sections to the game: adventuring and turn-based battle sequences. Much of Super Mario RPGs gameplay is outside monster battles and plays like an isometric 3D platformer, in which traditional Mario elements such as punching floating question blocks from below are prominent. There are no random encounters and as such enemies are visible in the field; a battle ensues only if Mario comes in contact with one. This allows the player to evade unnecessary battles.|$|E

However, he felt that Ian Tracey {{was not a good}} enough actor to make Rappo's motives seem believable. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode {{two and a half stars}} out of four, calling it a [...] "solid episode" [...] with a good supporting cast and effects. However, she felt the characterization of Mulder and Scully was [...] "off-balance" [...] and noted that some of the military detail was wrong. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three and a half stars out of five, noting its <b>similarities</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> episodes such as the previous [...] "2Shy", but felt that Shiban [...] "has put real blood and passion into it which raises it high above the trappings of its clichés".
