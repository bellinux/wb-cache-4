On {{the first of these}} occasions the commissioner who came aboard the steamer, to take the <b>sworn</b> <b>declaration</b> of the passengers that they were not smugglers, recognized my name as that of a well-known financier who had been abroad for a much-needed rest, and personally welcomed me home in such terms that I felt sure of complete exemption from the duties levied on others. When we landed I found that this good friend had looked out for me to the extent of getting me the first inspector, and he had guarded my integrity to the extent of committing me to a statement in severalty of the things my family had bought abroad, so that I had to pay twenty-eight dollars on my daughter's excess of the hundred dollars allowed free, although my wife was bringing in only seventy-five dollars' value, and I less than fifty." ...|$|E

50|$|Munaf was {{represented}} {{at his trial}} at CCCI by Badie Arrief Izzat, an Iraqi attorney. Izzat claimed that the trial was unfair because Munaf {{was not allowed to}} bring or question any witnesses at the trial. In addition, Izzat claimed that the judge was ready to dismiss the case of his client, but that shortly after two U.S. military officials privately spoke with the judge the death penalty verdict was handed down. Munaf's defense team also claimed that his confession was produced under torture and that their client {{was nothing more than a}} captured hostage during the kidnapping episode. These allegations were set forth in an unsworn declaration in writing under penalty of perjury submitted to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia from Sean Riordan, then a third year law student at UCLA School of Law who was working as an intern at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. The U.S. Government provided rebuttals to these allegations in several <b>sworn</b> <b>declarations</b> filed with the court during the U.S. proceedings.|$|R

50|$|A <b>sworn</b> <b>declaration</b> (also {{called a}} sworn {{statement}} or a statement {{under penalty of}} perjury) is a document that recites facts pertinent to a legal proceeding.

Instead, the person making the declaration signs a separate endorsement paragraph {{at the end of the}} document, stating that the declaration is made under penalty of perjury.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, the {{detention}} orders were suspended under section 10 of the ISA.

The revocation order stated that [...] "in view of the statement, it is necessary in the public interest that the direction ... be revoked." [...] The Ministry of Home Affairs later stated that investigations had established that the press statement was a political ploy to discredit the Government and that the appellants had <b>sworn</b> statutory <b>declarations</b> reaffirming the truth of their original statements to the ISD. The appellants' one-year detentions were subsequently extended under section 8(2) of the ISA.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dismissal}} of the emancipation petition accomplished Sylvia's main goal of keeping the family bonds intact and strong, without interference by third parties. ... Another concern of Sylvia in filing a request for restraining orders was {{that she did not}} believe it was in Misty's best interest to have continuing contact with the Bradleys. In the <b>sworn</b> <b>declarations</b> filed by the Bradleys in response to the restraining order they said that [...] "we have not and will never do anything to interfere with Misty's relationship with her mother." ... Since Sylvia has accomplished all of the goals that she intended to achieve when she filed her papers with the court we have chosen not to proceed to seek an injunction in this matter. —Gloria Allred After DelaCerna stated that she would always make sure Copeland could dance, both the emancipation papers and restraining orders were dropped. Copeland, who claimed she did not understand the term emancipation, withdrew the petition after informing the judge that such charges no longer represented her wishes. Still, DelaCerna wanted the Bradleys out of her daughter's life. Copeland re-enrolled at San Pedro High School for her junior year (1998-99), on pace to graduate with her original class of 2000. DelaCerna sought Cantine's advice on finding a new ballet school. Copeland began ballet study at Lauridsen Ballet Centre with former ABT dancer Diane Lauridsen, although her dancing was now restricted to afternoons in deference to her schooling. Late in 1998, all parties appeared on Leeza Gibbons' talk show, Leeza, where Copeland sat silently as the adults [...] "bickered shamelessly". As a student, Copeland had a 3.8/4.0 GPA through her junior year of high school.

There could be a number of reasons for a couple to obtain a licence: they might wish to marry quickly (and avoid the three weeks' delay by the calling of banns); they might wish to marry in a parish away from their home parish; or, because a licence required a higher payment than banns, they might choose to obtain one as a status symbol.|$|E
50|$|Pursuant to article 29 of the 1933 Constitution, {{which was}} valid when the Land Reform Act was enacted, landowners were {{entitled}} to the payment of fair compensation for the expropriated lands.

Much of the music was recorded by studio musicians due to conflicts between Tate and his band mates. Drummer Scott Rockenfield did not play on the album at all. As well, most of the guitars, including Michael Wilton's tracks, were re-recorded by engineer Mitch Doran.

On 24 July 1886, George Harrison sent a letter, a <b>sworn</b> <b>declaration,</b> to the government in Pretoria, that he had found payable gold on Gert C. Oosthuizen's farm Langlaagte. Ferreira and 72 other prospectors, after viewing Harrison's outcrop, realized the reef lay on line east to west, petitioned the government on 26 July 1886 to have area proclaimed as a goldfield.

[...] In a USA Today opinion column, James S. Robbins wrote, [...] "For a scandal that is frequently derided as 'fake,' it is amazing how often real evidence disappears. The disappearing act is so frequent, it is reasonable to wonder whether it is really a systematic attempt to destroy evidence of abuse of power."

5000|$|In August 2008, Milian {{sued the}} writer and {{producer}} of [...] "Dip It Low", Poli Paul. Milian claimed that Paul [...] "very definitively" [...] assured her that [...] "there were no samples whatsoever in … 'Dip It Low'". However, in February 2005, Thomas Turino, Larry Crook and Dan Dickey sued Milian over the song, claiming that it contained a sample from a track they released in 1983 called La Sirena. The lawsuit claimed that Paul heard the album while in a record store, liked the tune and sampled 12 seconds of it for [...] "Dip It Low". Milian claimed {{that she had to}} spend more than $300,000 defending herself in the case, which she settled in 2006, and wanted $300,000 plus damages from Paul and his associate, Spencer Cowlings Entertainment. In November 2008, Paul countersued the Island Def Jam Music Group and its parent company, Universal Music Group. Paul alleged that Island Def Jam was [...] "negligent in its obligation to obtain clearance and proper licensing for any copyrighted material" [...] used on the album. In February 2009, a superior court judge ruled that Paul's attorneys had failed to file a <b>sworn</b> <b>declaration</b> in the given period of time, but allowed them to file an amended complaint. Paul's lawyers amended the countersuit and added Milian as a defendant, saying that she was also negligent and that she should compensate him for money he spent in the copyright action. In June 2009, Universal Music Group filed a breach-of-contract suit against Milian and Paul. The record label claimed it was forced to pay attorney fees {{as a result of the}} litigation between Milian and Paul. The suit also said that Paul owes the company attorneys' fees from an earlier federal court case involving [...] "Dip It Low".|$|E
