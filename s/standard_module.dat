The link and <b>standard</b> (cell) <b>modules</b> that appear in numerous physical applications are defined and a natural bilinear form on the <b>standard</b> <b>modules</b> is used to characterise their maximal submodules. When this bilinear form has a non-trivial radical, some of the <b>standard</b> <b>modules</b> are reducible and TLn is non-semisimple. This happens only when q is a root of unity. Use of restriction and induction allows for a finer description {{of the structure of}} the <b>standard</b> <b>modules.</b> Finally, a particular central element Fn ∈ TLn is studied; its action is shown to be non-diagonalisable on certain indecomposable modules and this leads to a proof that the radicals of the <b>standard</b> <b>modules</b> are irreducible.

40|$|Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras, or KLR algebras, are {{a family}} of algebras known to categorify {{the upper half of}} the {{quantized}} enveloping algebra of a given Lie algebra.
