30|$|Smart cities [4] use {{a variety}} of ICT {{solutions}} to deal with real life urban challenges. Some of these challenges include environmental sustainability, socioeconomic innovation, participatory governance, better public services, planning and collaborative decision-making. In addition to creating a sustainable futuristic smart infrastructure, overcoming these challenges can empower the citizens in terms of having a personal stake in the well-being and betterment of their civic life. Consequently, city administrations can get new information and knowledge that is hidden in large-scale data to provide better urban governance and management by applying these ICT solutions. Such ICT enabled solutions thus enable efficient transport planning, better water management, improved waste management, new energy efficiency strategies, new constructions and structural methods for health of buildings and effective environment and risk management policies for the citizens. Moreover, other important aspects of the urban life such as public security, air quality and pollution, public health, urban sprawl and bio-diversity loss can also benefit from these ICT solutions. ICT as prime enabler for smart cities transforms application specific data into useful information and knowledge that can help in city planning and decision-making. From the ICT perspective, the possibility of realisation of smart cities is being enabled by smarter hardware and software e.g. IoTs i.e. RFIDs, smart phones, sensor nets, smart household appliances, and capacity to manage and process large scale data using cloud computing without compromising data security and citizens privacy [16]. With the passage of time, the volume of data generated from these IoTs is bound to increase exponentially and classified as Big data [17]. In addition, cities already possess land use, transport, census and environmental monitoring data which is collected from various local, often not interconnected, sources and used by application specific systems but is rarely used as collective source of information (i.e. system of systems [18]) for urban governance and planning decisions. Many local governments are making such data available for public use as “open data” [19].

40|$|Abstract – In {{hydraulically}} well-connected groundwater {{and surface}} water systems, stream-aquifer interaction has been simulated using a MODFLOW model developed by USGS, which couples hydraulic behavior of groundwater and surface water subsystems. It assumes a constant stream-stage during each stress period, employing a stream flow routing module which {{is limited to}} steady flow in rectangular, prismatic channels. One of the challenges in understanding the interaction of surface water and groundwater systems lies in their different time scales. In this paper, the INTRACT model is developed and incorporated into MODFLOW. INTRACT simulates unsteady, nonuniform flow by solving St. Venant equations. Terms that describe leakage between stream and aquifer {{as a function of}} streambed conductance and differences in water table and stream stage were incorporated into the continuity equation. INTRACT calculates new stream stages for each time step in a transient simulation based on upstream boundary conditions, stream properties, and estimated head distribution. Next, MODFLOW calculates head distribution using aquifer properties, stresses, and stream stages calculated by INTRACT. This process is repeated until convergence criteria are met for aquifer head distribution and stream stages. Because the time steps used in groundwater modeling can be much longer than time intervals used in surface water <b>simulation,</b> a <b>provision</b> has been made for handling multiple INTRACT time intervals within one MODFLOW time step.

Fluid mixing simulations were designed to assess the role that cation exchange plays in controlling the composition of fluids entering the HRL via fracture flow. Mixing <b>simulations</b> included <b>provision</b> {{for the effects of}} mineral precipitation and cation exchange on fluid composition. Because the predominant clay mineral observed in fractures in the Redox Zone has been identified as illite or mixed layer illite smectite, an exchanger with the properties of illite {{was used to}} simulate cation exchange. Cation exchange on illite was modeled using three exchange sites, a planar or basal plane site with properties similar to smectite, and two edge sites that have very high affinities for K, Rb, and Cs. Each site was assumed to obey an ideal Vanselow exchange model, and exchange energies for each site were taken from the literature. The predicted behaviors of Na, Ca, and Mg during mixing were similar to those reported in a previous study in which smectite was used as the model for the exchanger. The trace elements Cs and Rb were predicted to be strongly associated with the illite exchanger, and the predicted concentrations of Cs in fracture fill were in reasonable agreement with reported chemical analyses of exchangeable Cs in fracture fill. The results of the geochemical modeling suggest that Na, Ca, and Sr concentrations in the fluid phase may be controlled by cation exchange reactions that occur during mixing, but that Mg appears to behave conservatively.

Academic programs have {{a greater number of}} non-traditional students who must find a balance between academic, family and financial obligations. FW environments have become more stressful as increased productivity levels, shorter treatment durations, and budget cuts control clinic operations. These stressors may result in the FW student expressing higher degrees of anxiety and decreased confidence in performing entry-level skills at graduation. While physician and nursing professions have addressed best practices to manage clinical student stressors and training strategies for supervisors, a review of the occupational therapy (OT) literature reveals no study focusing on FW student well-being. This is surprising given the value that OT places on quality of life and establishing therapeutic relationships with our clients. This doctoral project describes a program directed to OT practitioners who have little or no experience in supervising OT Level II FW students. The program, given as a continuing education course, will provide the participants with training and tools to establish therapeutic relationships with their FW students.

40|$|Migrating {{wireless}} communications to millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies can satiate {{the growing demand}} for higher throughput and delay sensitive service provision. Due to high path loss and poor penetration, mmWave communications are challenged by limited coverage and blockage. Dense access point (AP) deployment and beamforming can enable mmWave networks to increase coverage and combat blockage. Greater AP density gives users diversity in AP selection, and thus a user can probe multiple APs to opportunistically transmit over the best channel. Yet, the opportunity to transmit to a previously probed AP may be lost due to inherent network properties (e. g. blockage, deafness, or decentralized scheduling), and the overhead delay and cost of probing more APs may also be detrimental to the search itself. We analyze the impact of AP diversity, beamforming, and overhead in opportunistic mmWave networks in terms of throughput and service provision capabilities. Decentralized opportunistic solutions are presented within a model that accounts for overhead delay and overhead bit cost. We assume no a priori knowledge of channel conditions, thus a deterministically optimal solution is unattainable in non-trivial scenarios. Stochastically optimal strategies are proposed and genie-aided solutions are presented as tight upper bounds. Ultimately, we present a model which includes the inherent properties of mmWave networks and obtain opportunistically optimal strategies for throughput and service provisioning. Conditions under which throughput maximization is a sub-martingale are presented, thus the problem is approached as a finite horizon stopping problem with unreliable recall. The optimal opportunistic strategy {{is a set of}} a priori computable thresholds. Bounds on average overhead, average delay, and average performance bound of the stopping strategy are presented.

40|$|Supporting {{quality of}} service (QoS) over the Internet is a very {{important}} issue and many mechanisms have already been devised or are under way towards achieving this goal. One of the most important approaches is the so-called Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture, which provides a scalable mechanism for QoS support in a TCP/IP network. The main concept underlying DiffServ is the aggregation of traffic flows at an ingress (or egress) point of a network and the marking of the IP packets of each traffic flow according to several classification criteria. Diffserv is classified under two taxonomies: the absolute and the relative. In absolute DiffServ architecture, an admission control scheme is utilized to provide QoS as absolute bounds of specific QoS parameters. The relative DiffServ model offers also QoS guarantees per class but in reference to the guarantees given to the other classes defined. In this paper, relative proportional delay differentiation is achieved based on class-based queueing (CBQ) scheduler. Specifically, the service rates allocated to the classes of a CBQ scheduler are frequently adjusted in order to obtain relative delay spacing among them. The model presented can also be exploited in order to meet absolute delay constraints in conj. unction With relative delay differentiation <b>provision.</b> <b>Simulation</b> experiments verify that our model can attain relative as well as absolute delay differentiation provided that the preconditions posed are satisfied.

This requires the selection of the appropriate control system structure, agreement on the test cases to be used to mimic the operating environment, and finally setting the system parameters to achieve best performance for this scenario. Demonstrates a system which has three controllers utilizing sales, inventory and work in progress (WIP) data to set production order rates. The resulting decision support system (DSS) is a generic tool that can be used by production schedulers with confidence in the knowledge that the Law of Industrial Dynamics effects may be minimized. Simulation experiments can determine the best available trade-off in any particular situation such as achieving the lean logistics aim of minimum reasonable inventory (MRI) while retaining high customer service levels (CSL). The experimental facility available within the <b>simulation</b> model includes <b>provision</b> for assessing the impact of variable production lead times and information delays on system performance. Describes a specific application of the DSS and the specific improvements in a company’s performance. Places the DSS {{in the context of a}} case-based reasoning environment in which a knowledge base of system structures and their dynamic properties is achieved. Outlines the opportunity of utilizing the DSS in uncertain lead-time environments in a range of industry sectors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the approach {{for development of}} patient-specific coronary blood flow models in 3 D and 0 D domains based on coronary artery geometries reconstructed from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography datasets (CCTA). The computed flow patterns extend the diagnostic value of CCTA, which, being noninvasive imaging modality, provides only static information on the anatomy of epicardial arteries. The clinical indices extracted from the virtual blood flow can be potentially employed {{in the assessment of}} the haemodynamic severity of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) lesions as well at the analysis of the underlying mechanisms of formation and localisation of atherosclerotic plaques. However, the existing patient-specific coronary blood flow modelling approaches are generally characterised by relatively high levels of uncertainty and instability due to a number of unknown factors and modelling assumptions. Analysis and comparison of the impact of various modelling assumptions has the potential to reduce this uncertainty. The overarching contributions of this thesis are the thorough analysis and investigation of the existing issues in patient-specific coronary blood flow <b>simulations</b> and the <b>provision</b> of the guidelines for the design and implementation of blood flow models in order to improve and ensure the reliability and accuracy of the numerical results. In addition, a novel approach for the implementation of spatially extended patient-specific 0 D blood flow models was proposed, which significantly decreases the high computational costs generally associated with 3 D blood flow simulations. While the classical 0 D models based on the electrical–hydraulic analogy use the lumped-parameter representation of major vessel tree structures and are thus characterised by limited spatial characteristics, the proposed method for modelling of individual vessel tree branches through a series of 0 D elements provides the means for correlation of the computed flow with the precise location along a vessel. Therefore, this extends the applicability of 0 D modelling in patient-specific blood flow simulations for the assessment of functional stenosis severity...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. ploscompbiol. orgReproducibility of experiments is a basic requirement for science. Minimum Information (MI) guidelines have proved a helpful means of enabling reuse of existing work in modern biology. The Minimum Information Required in the Annotation of Models (MIRIAM) guidelines promote the exchange and reuse of biochemical computational models. However, information about a model alone {{is not sufficient to}} enable its efficient reuse in a computational setting. Advanced numerical algorithms and complex modeling workflows used in modern computational biology make reproduction of simulations difficult. It is therefore essential to define the core information necessary to perform simulations of those models. The Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment describes the minimal set of information that must be provided to make the description of a simulation experiment available to others. It includes the list of models to use and their modifications, all the simulation procedures to apply and in which order, the processing of the raw numerical results, and the description of the final output. MIASE allows for the reproduction of any <b>simulation</b> experiment. The <b>provision</b> of this information, along with a set of required models, guarantees that the simulation experiment represents the intention of the original authors. Following MIASE guidelines will thus improve the quality of scientific reporting, and will also allow collaborative, more distributed efforts in computational modeling and simulation of biological processes. The discussions that led to the definition of MIASE benefited from the support of a Japan Partnering Award by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.
