Because it is difficult to separate the contribution of various external forcings to the observed trend, a state-of-the-art global coupled model is utilized here.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{potential}} climatic effects of the ozone hole more directly and to assess the validity of previous lower resolution model results, the latest high spatial resolution version of the Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc., seasonal radiative dynamical climate model is used to simulate the climatic effects of ozone changes relative to the other greenhouse gases. The steady-state climatic effect of a sustained decrease in lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> similar in magnitude to the observed 1979 - 90 decrease, is estimated by comparing three steady-state climate simulations: 1) 1979 greenhouse gas concentrations and 1979 ozone, II) 1990 greenhouse gas concentrations with 1979 ozone, and III) 1990 greenhouse gas concentrations with 1990 ozone. The simulated increase in surface air temperature resulting from nonozone greenhouse gases is 0. 272 K. When changes in lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> are included, the greenhouse warming is 0. 165 K, which is approximately 39 % lower than when ozone is fixed at the 1979 concentrations. Ozone perturbations at high latitudes result in a cooling of the surface-troposphere system that is greater (by a factor of 2. 8) than that estimated from the change in radiative forcing resulting from ozone depiction and the model's 2 x CO, climate sensitivity. The results suggest that changes in meridional heat transport from low to high latitudes combined with the decrease in the infrared opacity of the lower stratosphere are very important in determining the steady-state response to high latitude <b>ozone</b> <b>losses.</b> The 39 % compensation in greenhouse warming resulting from lower <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> is also larger than the 28 % compensation simulated previously by the lower resolution model.

40|$|Understanding <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> to {{the point}} of {{accurately}} predicting ozone in the future requires correctly distinguishing chemical from transport-induced changes in ozone. For example, evaluating the impact of chlorine reduction in controlling <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> requires estimating the amount of ozone lost in chemical reactions in the polar winter and spring. The Northern Hemisphere winter polar region is a particularly crucial and interesting area because it appears that the Northern vortex may currently be poised near the threshold of extreme ozone destruction such as that which now occurs annually in the Antarctic ozone "hole. " In this presentation we explore the interaction of ozone transport and chemistry through the Northern late summer and fall seasons as the vortex circulation becomes established. This phase of the seasonal cycle determines the starting point for heterogeneous processes and chlorine-driven loss that take control in the winter vortex. Using a combination of profile data from POAM, HALOE, and in situ measurements, we show that relatively low ozone at high latitudes in the middle stratosphere is associated with vortex airmasses and that these ozone abundances evolve photochemically from characteristically higher values {{at the end of the}} summer. The zonal variance of ozone mixing ratio also increases greatly at this time consistent with increasing wave-driven transport. Comparison with a three-dimensional chemistry-transport model is used to generalize the findings from the limited set of observations and quantify the relative roles of transport and chemistry in determining the ozone mixing ratio distributions...|$|E

40|$|Since 1990, <b>stratospheric</b> {{chemical}} <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> in the Arctic {{have been}} reported, but the large activity of planetary {{waves in the}} northern hemisphere makes the evaluation of photochemical destruction far more difficult than in the southern hemisphere. To overcome the difficulty, several methods for removing the contribution of transport have been suggested. Among those is the transport model approach. With this method, chemical ozone reduction is derived by comparison between ground based total ozone measurements and 3 D model simulations in which ozone is considered as a passive tracer. Using this method, the total ozone reduction in the Arctic vortex was derived each winter since winter 1994 by comparing the SAOZ/NDACC measurements to two 3 D CTM, Reprobus and Slimcat. The method allows determining the period of ozone destruction, the daily rate and the amplitude of the cumulative loss. The amplitude of the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is very sensitive to stratospheric temperature history during the winter and thus highly variable from one winter to another. In general, strongest <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of 25 - 30 % are occurring during coldest winters while very little 0 - 10 % could be observed during the warmest.

Due to its long lifetime, significantamounts of NOx produced by large particle events in the mesosphere and the upper stratosphere can be transported down into the middle and lower stratosphere duringpolar winter, where NOx is a key species in ozone loss. Thus large particle events can potentially contribute significantly to <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> This study usesmeasurements of the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) instrument onboard the UARS satellite covering the years 1991 - 2005, to investigate mesospheric NOxproduction during more than one solar cycle.

Satellites observe a decrease in mesospheric ozone by up to 34  % between EPP maximum and EPP minimum. Here, we analyze the climate impact of polar mesospheric and polar stratospheric ozone losses due to EPP in the coupled climate model MPI-ESM. Using radiative transfer modeling, {{we find that the}} radiative forcing of a mesospheric ozone loss during polar night is small. Hence, climate effects of a mesospheric ozone loss due to energetic particles seem unlikely. A <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> due to energetic particles warms the winter polar stratosphere and subsequently weakens the polar vortex. However, those changes are small, and few statistically significant changes in surface climate are found...|$|E

For 8 - 22 March 2011, OClO was enhanced, indicating chlorine activation above Eureka. Ozone columns {{were lower than}} in any other year in the record, reaching minima of 237 DU and 247 DU in two datasets. The average NO 2 column inside the vortex, measured at visible and UV wavelengths, was 46 ± 30 % and 45 ± 27 % lower in 2011 than the average NO 2 column from previous years. Ozone column loss was estimated from two ozone datasets, using a modeled passive ozone tracer. For 12 - 20 March 2011, the average ozone loss was 27 % and 29 % (99 DU and 108 DU). The largest percent ozone loss in the 11 -year record of 47 % (250 DU and 251 DU) was observed on 5 April 2011...|$|E
40|$|Uncertainties of the {{photolysis}} {{cross sections}} of ClOOCl {{have long been}} a limiting factor in our theoretical understanding of the rate of polar stratospheric ozone losses. Previous work suggested that values slightly larger than current recommendations, {{which are based on}} laboratory measurements, result in improved agreement be- tween model calculations of polar <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates and observations {{while at the same time}} also leading to improved agreement between observations of the diurnal variation of ClO and model calculations of this species. But new laboratory work (Pope et al, 2007) on the cross sections of ClOOCl suggest that its photolysis under polar stratospheric winter/spring conditions is nearly an order of magnitude slower than what would be required to explain the observations of ozone loss and ClO in the atmosphere and a factor of six slower than a value based on the current recommendations. We show what the impact of these new results on our understand- ing of polar ozone chemistry is. In model calculations that are based on the new cross sections and for typical Arctic conditions ratios of ClO/ClOx decrease by about a factor of two. The ozone loss rate by the ClO-dimer cycle, so far believed to be the most efficient ozone loss cycle, drops by about a factor of four and the loss rate by the coupled ClO-BrO cycle by nearly a factor of two. Overall ozone loss rates calculated based on the known ozone loss mechanisms drop by a factor of two to three and become much smaller than ob- servations. Also the calculated levels of ClO become much smaller than those ob- served in the stratosphere. These results demonstrate the tremendous uncertainty of current ozone loss calculations that comes from the broad range of the published cross sections for ClOOCl. In particular they suggest that, if the most recent publica- tion of the cross sections (Pope et al., 2007) is correct, a major fraction of observed polar ozone loss is due to a currently unknown mechanism - clearly are a major chal- lenge of our fundamental understanding of the polar <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> proc- ess. We will discuss potential chemical mechanisms that would lead to improved agree- ment between calculations of ozone loss based on the new cross sections with in-situ observations of ClO and ozone loss rates in the stratosphere...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The SLIMCAT {{three-dimensional}} {{chemical transport}} model (CTM) {{is used to}} infer chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> from Polar <b>Ozone</b> and Aerosol Measurement (POAM) III observations of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> during the Arctic winter of 2002 – 2003. Inferring chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> from satellite data requires quantifying ozone variations due to dynamical processes. To accomplish this, the SLIMCAT model was run in a “passive ” mode from early December {{until the middle of}} March. In these runs, ozone is treated as an inert, dynamical tracer. Chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is inferred by subtracting the model passive ozone, evaluated at the time and location of the POAM observations, from the POAM measurements themselves. This “CTM Passive Subtraction ” technique relies on accurate initialization of the CTM and a realistic description of vertical/horizontal transport, both of which are explore...|$|R
