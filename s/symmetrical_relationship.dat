2500|$|Piaget {{attributed}} {{different types}} of psychosocial processes to different forms of social relationships, introducing a fundamental distinction between {{different types of}} said relationships. Where there is constraint because one participant holds more power than the other the relationship is asymmetrical, and, importantly, the knowledge that can be acquired by the dominated participant takes on a fixed and inflexible form. Piaget refers to this process as one of social transmission, illustrating it through reference {{to the way in}} which the elders of a tribe initiate younger members into the patterns of beliefs and practices of the group. Similarly, where adults exercise a dominating influence over the growing child, it is through social transmission that children can acquire knowledge. By contrast, in cooperative relations, power is more evenly distributed between participants so that a more <b>symmetrical</b> <b>relationship</b> emerges. Under these conditions, authentic forms of intellectual exchange become possible; each partner has the freedom to project his or her own thoughts, consider the positions of others, and defend his or her own point of view. In such circumstances, where children’s thinking is not limited by a dominant influence, Piaget believed [...] "the reconstruction of knowledge", or favorable conditions for the emergence of constructive solutions to problems, exists. Here the knowledge that emerges is open, flexible and regulated by the logic of argument rather than being determined by an external authority.|$|E

This paper suggests a proposal to cope with the problem of the treatment of ordinal qualitative variables in Co-Inertia(-PLS) Analysis.

40|$|Most of the {{well-known}} and widely used techniques of {{multidimensional data analysis}} originated from Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA, Hotelling 1936), e. g.

Classical references are represented by the Principal Component Analysis with Instrumental Variables (PCAIV, Rao 1964) which is clearly set in a multivariate regression-like approach and Redundancy Analysis proposed by van den Wollenberg (1977) {{as an alternative to}} CCA.

The family tree is not exactly symmetrical in terminology, but some terms mean types of relatives that are thought of as similar in the culture. An example of a perfectly <b>symmetrical</b> <b>relationship</b> is that the terms titi and lala each refer to the father's parents and mother's parents. However, many complex relationships have specific names in Byangsi that may be shared. The term chînî is used for one's spouse's mother as well as one's father's sister and mother's brother's wife. This relationship could be thought of as being similar to an aunt, although chînî is not used for one's mother's sisters. Likewise, the term thângmi is used for one's spouse's father, one's mother's brother, and one's father's sister's husband, but not one's father's brothers.|$|E

30|$|To {{ensure the}} {{uniqueness}} of introducing the concepts of commensalism and amensalism, the correlation matrix in Table  3 must {{be compared with the}} symbiotic interdependencies in Table  7. The results of the simple correlation matrix differ considerably from the results provided by the multiple negative binomial regressions and the subsequent identification of commensalism and amensalism. For example, although the products and startups variables are strongly correlated (0.6939), the present analysis finds a commensal relationship in which the startups variable exerts a beneficial effect on the products variable, but not one in which the reverse is true. Common types of analyses, such as panel data analyses and structural equation modeling, presuppose dependent and independent variables for which one of a pair of variables has a decisive effect on the other. On the contrary, the data analysis in the present study has the characteristics of exploratory research because it identifies specific broken <b>symmetrical</b> <b>relationships</b> that exhibit commensalism and amensalism.|$|R
40|$|Motivated by Geographical Information Systems (GIS) applications, we {{introduce}} a new data model for mutually nested objects. Combining features from relational as well as object-oriented database systems, our data model is efficient for queries involving multiple access patterns. By maintaining <b>symmetrical</b> <b>relationships</b> between entities, we allow nesting to be formulated dynamically at the query level rather than the data model level, thus dissociating the data structure from the access method. In addition, we do not favor one access pattern over another by clustering data in one particular manner, giving therefore flexibility and performance to our system. In order to integrate nesting into the relational algebra, we propose an extension to Relix, which is an academic database management system. We then show how those modifications {{can be used in}} a wide variety of queries, provide an algorithm to translate nested queries into flat relational expressions, and finally show that similar improvements can be applied to SQL allowing nested queries to be expressed more naturally...|$|R

40|$|Researchers have {{generally}} treated organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) as positive and counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs) as negative forms of discretionary work behavior.

We argue that studying OCBs and CWBs from multiple perspectives helps guide research to identify more asymmetric outcomes of these behaviors, and thus better understand these behaviors overall.

Starting from this general difference, the book describes the specificity of the two techniques, especially trying to highlight the circumstances under which a technique is preferable to the other. Besides this, the comparison between the log-linear models and logistic regression is also useful to show the potential and the limitations they have in common. I refer in particular to the difficulties which arise in interpreting the results of log-linear models and logistic regression when the two techniques are used to analyze relationships between polytomous categorical variables. These difficulties are not due to the formal aspects of the two techniques, but rather to the high semantic autonomy of categorical variables, which has important consequences in the analysis of the data, regardless of the technique used to analyze them...|$|R

Some researchers found an asymmetric relationship with a much stronger effect from unsatisfactory contact, compared with satisfactory contact, with regard to trust in the police and police legitimacy.

In the literature there is no consensus about the meaning and measurement of these concepts.

More precisely, we consider trust in police procedural justice and trust in police effectiveness as two components of trust having an influence on police legitimacy in the form of moral alignment.

40|$|Abstract. The present authors {{recently}} {{presented the}} time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) formulation for L 12 type ordering process in binary alloys, {{taking into account}} the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>relationships</b> of these ordered phases. Extending the formulation, the authors have developed the TDGL model for microstructural evolution of D 019 type ordering. The D 019 structure based on hcp is divided into four equivalent sublattices. The site occupation probabilities are given as a function of three order parameters and a composition parameter. Multiple types of variants of the structures are represented by the order parameters. Mean-field free energies are defined in a form of Landau type expansion with the order parameters and the composition parameter. Interfacial energies due to local variations of degrees of order and composition are given in a gradient square approximation. Kinetic equations for time-evolution of the order parameters and the composition one are derived from the Ginzburg-Landau type potential consisting of the mean-field free energies and the interfacial energy terms. Three-dimensional numerical simulations based on the kinetic equations have been performed, and the domain structures obtained are compared with a TEM image of Cu 3 Sn alloy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper first reviews data {{collected}} from 1976 to 2013 regarding the life histories {{of members of the}} main E 1 study group of bonobos (Pan paniscus) in Wamba. The E 1 group exhibited strong tendencies toward female dispersal and male residence during the entire study period, thereby exemplifying the typical characteristics of a male-philopatric and female-dispersal society. This pattern did not change after the abandonment of artificial provisioning. We then present two new cases of immigrant females, focusing especially on social association patterns, dominance relationships, and affiliative interactions during the approximate 2. 5 years from the time of their immigration to their first birth. These females began engaging in social grooming with resident females immediately after their arrival but rarely did so with adult males, suggesting that they regard social bonding with females as more important than that with males. They also emigrated at a young age and frequently engaged in social play. Indeed, social bonding established through frequent social play {{may be related to the}} development of socially <b>symmetrical</b> <b>relationships,</b> which are the basis for the egalitarian bonobo society.

To some union members, undocumented migrant workers ought to be included in the bonds of union solidarity by virtue of being workers.

In this controversial context, six union centers for undocumented migrant workers called MigrAr (German "Migration & Arbeit", English "migration & labor") have been established by labor activists since 2008. Building on an activist ethnography in the MigrAr center in Berlin from 2011 to 2015, this investigation charts the challenges of this center to bring unions to adopt a more proactive and inclusive approach towards illegalized migrant workers. In the analysis, the research critically engages Jürgen Habermas's concept of solidarity and its premise of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>relationships.</b> To account for the uneven constellation of support between MigrAr activists and undocumented migrant workers, the study advances an alternative understanding of union solidarity.
