40|$|Each year {{approximately}} 23 – 28 {{million tonnes}} {{of sand and}} gravel are removed from offshore sediments around England and Wales. This study was located in a licensed marine aggregate extraction site off Shoreham in the Eastern English Channel (EEC thereafter). Results from the multibeam survey showed the presence of dredged pits created by <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredging</b> and elongated furrows created by trailer <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredging</b> {{in the area where}} sand and gravel had been excavated. Electronic Monitoring System (EMS) contained the dredging intensity recorded annually at the site; this information was combined with particle size data providing interpreted maps, which informed the status of the sediments at the site. The aim of the current study was to explore the presence of marine habitats over a smaller area known as the ‘Shoreham Box’ in the EEC. Results showed some differences in the community composition produced by the two methods of extraction. There was also indication of enhanced number of species in the area <b>dredged</b> by <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> method. Notably, slipper limpets were also observed inhabiting dredged pits and creating permanent habitats in areas cratered by the dredging activity. This study has generated ecological information on the status of species and habitats inhabiting the dredged and undredged area. Management considerations are also discussed to ensure that sound aggregate extraction practices are in place to minimised the effects of aggregate dredging over licensed areas...|$|R

40|$|Major {{dredging}} {{projects in}} the United States are typically contracted out by the government using a competitive bidding process. A method for accurately estimating the total cost associated with performing the dredging work is essential for both government solicitation and the bidding contractors. This thesis presents a method to determine production rate for trailing <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredges</b> when minimal information is known about both the site to be <b>dredged</b> and the <b>hopper</b> <b>dredge</b> being used. The calculated production rate is then combined with financial inputs to estimate a total dredging cost and project duration. The production and cost estimation is incorporated into a publically available program designed on Microsoft Excel. The program utilizes fluid transport fundamentals, dimensionless pump curve analysis, and overflow loss assumptions to create a highly customizable program across {{a wide range of}} <b>hopper</b> <b>dredge</b> project types. In addition, the program allows a user to reduce or expand the scope of cost estimating depending on project requirements. Results for the program were found to satisfactorily estimate total project costs and dredging operation costs for eight major dredging projects between 2013 and 2015. Through the utilization of default hopper specifications and project specific site characteristics the program generated a mean absolute percent difference of 21 % for the total project costs and 20 % for the dredging operation costs alone...|$|R

In 1895 Ackermans & van Haaren was at the cradle of hydraulic dredging techniques and successfully designed a suction dredger, capable of unloading by its own. In the same year, a first vessel of that type was built and christended as Schelde II.

40|$|The Flemish Community is {{continuously}} {{looking to}} improve maintenance dredging works through careful selection of dredging and disposal locations {{and through the}} use of more efficient dredging equipment. Most sediment pollution consist of fine grained sediments. These sediments tend to settle in the entrance channels to sealocks, in harbour areas or other waterways with low currents. Therefore, special attention has to be paid to maintenance dredging procedures in these areas, in order to reduce both the economic and ecological impact of the removal of contaminated fine grained sediment. To meet these environmental requirements and to achieve a cost-effective solution, a new type of dredge has been developed in co-operation with the Flemish Institute for Scientific-Technological Research Promotion in the Industry (IWT). This scoop dredge has been successfully tested in the access channel to the Kallo Lock and in the adjacent harbour area. Based on this experience and on environmental dragheads of trailing <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredges,</b> further breakthrough in environmental dredging has been achieved. The sweep dredge combines the advantages of stationary dredges and trailers. The sweep dredge is able to work in shallow water and to remove very thin layers of polluted fine-grained sediments at high concentrations. The principles of both dredges have been patented worldwide. This paper will discuss: - The criteria for dredging and removal of contaminated fine-grained sediments in an economic and ecologically acceptable way. - The development of the scoop dredge, the results of the dredging operations and the various test and monitoring programmes. - The development of the sweep dredge and the evaluation of its characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of the {{geological}} structure and seabed dynamics {{as well as}} the morphological and sedimentological effects of sand extraction generated by different mining techniques were carried out in Polish waters of the Baltic Sea, NW of the Gulf of Gdańsk, at a water depth of 15 – 17  m. Three research cruises took place: just before, directly after and 11  months after dredging operations. Seismoacoustic profiling, a multibeam echosounder, a side-scan sonar, a 3  m vibro-corer and a box-corer were used during the research cruises. The grain size distribution and 137 Cs content of the sand samples were determined. Marine shells were dated by the AMS 14 C technique and pollen analyses were carried out on samples of muddy sands lying below the marine sand. A 2 to 4. 5  m thick layer of marine sands lies on the boulder till and locally on late Pleistocene ice margin lake deposits. The 137 Cs content indicates that the 0. 4 – 0. 8  m thick sand layer is mobile during storms. After the dredging operations, four pits with diameters from 80 to 120  m, depths from 3 to 4. 5  m and slopes with gradients up to 30 – 55 ° were measured. Several smaller irregularly shaped pits and double furrows 30 – 150  m in length and 0. 3 – 0. 5  m in depth were found. The sonar mosaic also shows a 50 – 100  m buffer zone of fine sand around the pits which flowed over the dredger’s side with water and settled on the bottom. During one year after the dredging operation the furrows generated by trailer <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredging</b> {{as well as the}} fine sand cover around the pits disappeared completely. The four post-dredging pits left by stationary suction dredging were shallower by 2 – 2. 5  m, their diameters increased by 40 – 50  m, the gradient of the slopes was reduced by up to 5 – 10 °, and the total volume was only about 3. 5 % smaller than directly after dredging...|$|R
40|$|In dredging, trenching, (deep sea) mining, drilling, {{tunnel boring}} {{and many other}} applications, sand, clay or rock has to be excavated. The {{productions}} (and thus the dimensions) of the excavating equipment range from mm 3 /sec - cm 3 /sec to m 3 /sec. In oil drilling layers with a thickness of a magnitude of 0. 2 mm are cut, while in dredging this can be of a magnitude of 0. 1 m with cutter suction dredges and meters for clamshells and backhoe’s. Some equipment is designed for dry soil, while others operate under water saturated conditions. Installed cutting powers may range up to 10 MW. For both the design, the operation and production estimation of the excavating equipment {{it is important to}} be able to predict the cutting forces and powers. After the soil has been excavated it is usually transported hydraulically as a slurry over a short (TSHD’s) or a long distance (CSD’s) or mechanically. Estimating the pressure losses and determining whether or not a bed will occur in the pipeline is of great importance. Fundamental processes of sedimentation, initiation of motion and erosion of the soil particles determine the transport process and the flow regimes. In TSHD’s the soil has to settle during the loading process, where also sedimentation and erosion will be in equilibrium. In all cases we have to deal with soil and high density soil water mixtures and its fundamental behavior. This book gives an overview of cutting theories. It starts with a generic model, which is valid for all types of soil (sand, clay and rock) after which the specifics of dry sand, water saturated sand, clay, atmospheric rock and hyperbaric rock are covered. For each soil type small blade angles and large blade angles, resulting in a wedge in front of the blade, are discussed. The failure mechanism of sand, dry and water saturated, is the so called Shear Type. The failure mechanism of clay is the so called Flow Type, but under certain circumstances also the Curling Type and the Tear Type are possible. Rock will usually fail in a brittle way. This can be brittle tensile failure, the Tear Type for small blade angles, but it can also be brittle shear failure, which is of the Shear Type of failure mechanism for larger blade angles. For practical cutting angles in dredging a combination may occur, the Chip Type. Under hyperbaric conditions rock may also fail in a more apparent ductile way according to the Flow Type or Crushed Type of failure mechanism. This is also called cataclastic failure. For each case considered, the equations/model for the cutting forces, power and specific energy are given. The models are verified with laboratory research, mainly at the Delft University of Technology, but also with data from literature. Dr. ir. Sape A. Miedema (November 8 th 1955) obtained his M.

40|$|Coastal erosion is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} that is a growing problem. Over the last few decades, {{there has been a}} gradual change from hard to soft coastal defence techniques. In this sense, periodic artificial nourishment is widely regarded as an acceptable method of beach and dune protection and restoration. According to Dean (2003), after beach nourishment activities are performed, sand volumetric evolution, particularly the proportion of sand volume that remains within the region where the sand was placed, is of interest. This region can be described by features such as the pore size, density, porosity, permeability and water content. The bulk density is an indicator of soil compaction, which is related to its porosity and permeability. Beach nourishment features are based on several clues: native and borrow sand quality, dredging and dumping areas, method of transport, operating budget, sand volume needed and coastal groundwater dynamics. An important consideration in sediment motion is the relative volume occupied by sediment within a sediment bed. This is quantified using porosity or grain concentration. A standard assumption in coastal engineering is that the porosity of natural beach sand (non-cohesive) is 40 %. However, is this assumption correct for all beach sand? The purpose is to demonstrate that much of the volume loss after beach nourishment procedure can be due to porosity decrease. Our primary hypothesis is that any type of beach nourishment activity results in a significant increase in sand porosity, largely due to the massive and disorganised dumping of a mixture of sediment and water (in this case 20 and 80 %, respectively) on the backshore and foreshore by a trailing <b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredge.</b> The porosity subsequently decreases until it reaches its native value because of waves and tides cause spatial re-accommodation of the grains. This research proposes an accurate and simplified method to assess changes in sand porosity after beach nourishment by means of in-situ density surveys through a nuclear densimeter. This novel application has been applied to different beaches in the southwest of Spain according to the tidal range, grain size and beach morphology in several terms. Complete monitoring of the density, humidity, grain size analysis and modified Proctor compaction test was performed at all beaches over the very short, short, medium and long term (hours, days, months and years respectively). The goal of the monitoring was to study the effect of different phenomena on the internal beach sand porosity. General results show that sand porosities range from 25. 6 % to 43. 4 % after beach nourishment works, with maximum relative and cumulative differences in the order of ± 40 % over several terms. This research can be considered a support tool in coastal engineering to find shifting sand volumes as a result of sand porosity variability after beach nourishment and later marine influence...|$|E
40|$|Contaminated sediments is a {{worldwide}} problem, and mobilization of contaminants {{is one of}} the most critical issue in environmental risk assessment when dredging projects are concerned. Considering this, we decided to investigate if and how toxic metals and persistent organic compounds such as PAH and PCB are mobilized during dredging operations in the Port of Santos channel (São Paulo State, SE Brazil) in an attempt to assess changes in bioavailability and toxicity of those contaminants. Samples were collected in the dredging site before dredging, in the dredges hopper (<b>suction</b> <b>hopper</b> <b>dredge)</b> and in the disposal site and its surroundings. Metals and persistent organic compounds were extracted from sediment samples according to USEPA methods for environmental samples. Ecotoxicological assessment was done on bulk sediment samples and in its pore water and elutriate. Results have shown that bulk sediments from the dredging sites are moderately contaminated with As, Pb and Zn and most severely with Hg, as well as had relatively high PCBs and PAHs concentrations (0, 8 mg kg- 1 for total Hg and 470 &# 956;g kg- 1 for total PAHs, for example). These results have also shown a 50 % increase in the total PAHs concentration in total suspended solids of the water samples collected inside of the dredges hopper (679 &# 956;g kg- 1 total PAHs on the total suspended solids against 479 &# 956;g kg- 1 on bulk sediments from the channel collected on Alemoa terminal). This finding is of great concern as these data refer to the dredge overflow water which is pumped back to the ecosystem during dredging operations. Toxicity tests done with bulk sediment using the amphipod Tiburonella viscana did not show any toxicity, but the tests with the larvae of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus showed toxicity to the interstitial waters and elutriates of samples collected in the channel (dredging site), disposal site (sea site) and dredges hopper. In this study we also compared the obtained results to the widely used sediment quality guidelines (ERL and ERM), and to a sediment quality assessment scheme (based on various lines of evidence), as well as, to the Brazilian National Council for the Environment resolution called CONAMA 344 / 04. It can be seen in the results obtained in microcosm experiments (laboratory) that some organic compounds, mainly fluoranthene and pyrene, can be released from the sediments to the water. Such release was detected in the analysis of these compounds adsorbed in semi-permeable membranes (SPMDs) used in these tests. We hope that the results of this study will be used in the future to support a better planning of management strategies in dredging operations and sediment disposal in marine environment in Brazil...|$|E
