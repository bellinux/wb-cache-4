2500|$|In May 2005, Adel Smith, {{president}} of the Union of Italian Muslims, launched a lawsuit against Fallaci charging that [...] "some of the things <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> book The Force of Reason are offensive to Islam". Smith's attorney cited 18 phrases, most notably a reference to Islam as [...] "a pool that never purifies". Consequently, an Italian judge ordered Fallaci to stand trial in Bergamo on charges of [...] "defaming Islam". The preliminary trial began on 12 June, and on 25 June, Judge Beatrice Siccardi decided that Fallaci should indeed stand trial beginning on 18 December. Fallaci accused the judge of having disregarded the fact that Smith had called for her murder and defamed Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|On August 10, 2015, Clinton filed her declaration, stating [...] "I have {{directed}} {{that all}} my emails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or potentially were federal records be provided to the Department of State", and {{that as a result}} of this directive, 55,000 pages of emails were produced to the Department on December 5, 2014. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> statement that Abedin did have an email account through clintonemail.com that [...] "was used at times for government business", but that Mills did not. The statement was filed as Clinton faced questions over fifteen emails in exchanges with Blumenthal that were not among the emails she gave to the department the previous year. She did not address the matter of those emails in the statement. On September 25, 2015, several additional emails from her private server surfaced which [...] she had not provided to the State Department. These emails between Clinton and General David Petraeus, discussing personnel matters, were part of an email chain that started on a different email account before her tenure as Secretary of State, but continued onto her private server in late January 2009 after she had taken office. The existence of these emails also called into question Clinton's previous statement that she did not use the server before March 18, 2009.|$|E
