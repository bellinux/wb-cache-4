For example, the electrons used by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer in 1927, accelerated by 54 volts, had a wavelength of 0.167nm, which was {{long enough to}} exhibit a single diffraction <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> when reflecting {{from the face of}} a nickel crystal with atomic spacing of 0.215nm. With a larger vacuum chamber, it would seem relatively easy to increase the angular resolution from around a radian to a milliradian and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of integrated circuit computer memory.|$|E
50|$|Minor lobes usually {{represent}} radiation in undesired directions, {{and they}} should be minimized. Side lobes are normally the largest of the minor lobes. The level of minor lobes is usually expressed as a ratio of the power density in the lobe in question to that of the major lobe. This ratio is often termed the <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> ratio or <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> level. <b>Side</b> <b>lobe</b> levels of −20 dB or greater are usually not desirable in many applications. Attainment of a <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> level smaller than −30 dB usually requires very careful design and construction. In most radar systems, for example, low <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> ratios are very important to minimize false target indications through the side lobes.|$|E
50|$|A uniform {{aperture}} distribution, as {{provided in}} the two examples above, gives the maximum possible directivity for a given aperture size, but it also produces the maximum <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> level. <b>Side</b> <b>lobe</b> levels can be reduced by tapering {{the edges of the}} aperture distribution (changing from uniformity) at the expense of reduced directivity.|$|E
30|$|For a {{radar pulse}} signal, after compression, the {{narrower}} pulse mainlobe is always accompanied by higher sidelobes. So, all pulse compression radars suffer from range <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> which cause energy from strong reflections to leak into adjacent range cells. High suppression of <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> {{is not required}} in some other non-meteorological radar, but is important for meteorological radar, because weather phenomena can have significant reflectivity gradients, and ground clutter echo can be between 35 and 55 dB much larger than medium rain. Furthermore, the <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> of strong signal will falsely be recognized as an existence of small target. Therefore, range <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> must be suppressed by a large amount to prevent contamination in adjacent range cells.|$|R
30|$|Apodizing (di Francia 1952) can {{sharpen the}} central maximum, but leads to large <b>side</b> <b>lobes,</b> which render the method {{impractical}} (Hell 2007), since for obtaining a {{smaller and smaller}} central maximum an increasing {{fraction of the total}} available light flux is redirected to the <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> (di Francia 1952).|$|R
30|$|The results {{obtained}} with {{the up and}} down chirps (see Fig. 12) show some high <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> around the coordinates (x,y)=(0, 5) in meter and (0,− 5). The maximum value of these <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> is 27 dB lower than the main lobe. These two high <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> have the same origin as the ghost in the range ambiguity configuration which is due to non orthogonality of {{the up and down}} chirps. As expected, the ghost effect is reduced with the MIMO OFDM signals, as shown in Fig. 13, with a gain higher than 5 dB.|$|R

50|$|The {{power density}} in the <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> is {{generally}} {{much less than}} that in the main beam.

The main <b>lobe</b> and <b>side</b> <b>lobes</b> occur for both conditions of transmit, and for receive. The concepts of main and <b>side</b> <b>lobes,</b> radiation pattern, aperture shapes, and aperture weighting, apply to optics (another branch of electromagnetics) and in acoustics fields such as loudspeaker and sonar design, as well as antenna design.|$|R

50|$|The antenna {{on some of}} {{the most}} common {{hand-held}} devices is only 2 in in diameter. The beam of energy produced by an antenna of this size using X-band frequencies occupies a cone that extends about 22 degrees surrounding the line of sight, 44 degrees in total width. This beam is called the main lobe. There is also a <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> extending from 22 to 66 degrees away from the line of sight, and other lobes as well, but side lobes are about 20 times less sensitive than the main lobe (13 dB), although they will detect moving objects close by. The primary field of view is about 130 degrees wide. K-band reduces this field of view to about 65 degrees by increasing the frequency of the wave. Ka-band reduces this further to about 40 degrees. <b>Side</b> <b>lobe</b> detections can be eliminated using <b>side</b> <b>lobe</b> blanking which narrows the field of view, but the additional antennas and complex circuitry impose price constraints that limit this to applications for the military, air traffic control, and weather agencies. Mobile weather radar is mounted on semi-trailer trucks in order to narrow the beam.|$|E
