Spring was late in spite of its early promise, and there was even yet a hard drift of old snow and ice in the northern corner of the graveyard. Lida Marsh, who had come up to bring the manse a mess of herring, slipped in through the gate shivering.

He would not have expected a good mackerel catch if he had not so sent the first fruits of the season.|$|E
6000|$|In {{this great}} Order the most {{interesting}} point for us is the difference in colour between the sexes of the same species, and between the distinct species of the same genus. Nearly {{the whole of the}} following chapter will be devoted to this subject; but I will first make a few remarks on one or two other points. Several males may often be seen pursuing and crowding round the same female. Their courtship appears to be a prolonged affair, for I have frequently watched one or more males pirouetting round a female until I became tired, without seeing the end of the courtship. Although butterflies are such weak and fragile creatures, they are pugnacious, and an Emperor butterfly[502] has been captured with the tips of its wings broken from a conflict with another male. Mr. Collingwood in speaking of the frequent battles between the butterflies of Borneo says, “They whirl round each other with the greatest rapidity, and appear to be incited by the greatest ferocity.” One case is known of a butterfly, namely the Ageronia feronia, which makes a noise like that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a <b>spring</b> <b>catch,</b> and which could be heard at the distance of several yards. At Rio de Janeiro this sound was noticed by me, only when two were chasing each other in an irregular course, so that it is probably made during the courtship of the sexes; but I neglected to attend to this point.[503] ...|$|E

40|$|Validation {{of the age}} {{determination}} procedure using otoliths of European anchovy in the Bay of Biscay was achieved by monitoring very strong year-classes in successive <b>spring</b> <b>catches</b> and surveys, {{as well as the}} seasonal occurrence of edge types. Historical corroboration of the ageing method was obtained by cross-correlation between successive age groups by year-classes in catches and surveys (1987 – 2013).

Yearly annuli consist of a hyaline zone (either single or composite) and a wide opaque zone, disrupted occasionally by some typical checks (mainly at age- 0 and age- 1 at peak spawning time). Age determination, given a date of capture, requires knowledge of the typical annual growth pattern of otoliths, their seasonal edge formation by ages and the most typical checks. Most opaque growth occurs in summer and is minimal (translucent) in winter. Opaque zone formation begins earlier in younger fish (in spring), and this helps distinguish age- 1 from age- 2 +...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{efficiency}} of propagating juvenile trout, Salmo trutta L. in small lowland streams and to evaluate the impact of the environmental conditions in the streams on the juvenile fish. Brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) and sea trout (Salmo trutta trutta) early fry fed under controlled conditions were used to stock third-order lowland streams. During summer, fall, and <b>spring</b> <b>catches,</b> fry were counted, measured, and weighed. The following parameters were calculated using the data collected: fry stocking density (ind. m- 2); survival; specific mortality rate (SMR); length range; mean specimen length; body weight; mean body weight; specific growth rate (SGR); body condition (Fulton’s index). The ichthyological studies were accompanied by simultaneous analyses of environmental conditions that were performed monthly, and benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in spring and fall. No differences were observed in the biological parameters analyzed between sea trout and brown trout. Variability in environmental parameters such as temperature, oxygenation, conductivity, and stream width and depth were associated with differentiation in the biological parameters of the fry. The results clearly indicate that the considerable potential of small lowland streams for the propagation of salmonid juvenile stages is currently underexploited...|$|R

5000|$|Louis Figuier in his monumental work gives a full {{quotation}} of Denis Papin's paper {{published in}} 1690 in Acta eruditorum at Leipzig, entitled [...] "Nouvelle méthode pour obtenir à bas prix des forces considérables" [...] (A new method for cheaply obtaining considerable forces). It {{seems that the}} idea came to Papin whilst working with Robert Boyle at the Royal Society in London. Papin describes first pouring a small quantity of water {{into the bottom of}} a vertical cylinder, inserting a piston on a rod and after first evacuating the air below the piston, placing a fire beneath the cylinder to boil the water away and create enough steam pressure to raise the piston to the top end of the cylinder. The piston was then temporarily locked in the upper position by a <b>spring</b> <b>catch</b> engaging a notch in the rod. The fire was then removed, allowing the cylinder to cool, which condensed steam back into water, thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston. To the end of the piston rod was attached a cord passing over two pulleys and a weight hung down from the cord's end. Upon releasing the catch, the piston was sharply drawn {{down to the bottom of}} the cylinder by the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the created vacuum; enough force was thus generated to raise a 60 lb weight. Although the engine certainly worked as far as it went, it was devised merely to demonstrate the principle and having got thus far, Papin never developed it further, although in his paper he did write about the potential of boats driven by [...] "firetubes". Instead he allowed himself to be distracted into developing a variant of the Savery engine.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Substantial {{mortality}} {{can occur}} in age- 0 fish populations during {{their first year of}} life, especially in winter; this can potentially influence overall recruitment into the adult population. As such, we compared relative abundances be-tween fall and <b>spring</b> <b>catches</b> of sympatric juvenile bluegill Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque and yellow perch Perca flavescens (Mitchill) to evaluate the magnitude of overwinter mortality across locations (five lakes for two years) and through time (one lake for six years). In addition, we compared both quantile-quantile and increment plots, based on length-frequency histograms from fall- and spring-caught cohorts from 2004 to 2010, to determine if mortality was size-selective while accounting for over winter growth. Bluegill relative abundances (as indexed by catch-per-unit-effort) sig-nificantly decreased from fall to spring, although size-selective mortality was not detected in 10 instances. Yellow perch relative abundances were similar from fall to spring in five Nebraska Sandhill lakes; however, size-selective mortality was detected, with size-selective over winter mortality of smaller individuals occurring in one of eight instances, whereas greater mortality in larger individuals occurred in two instances. Positive growth occurred in both species but was variable among lakes and appeared to be system-specific. In Nebraska Sandhill lakes, over winter mortality likely differs between these two species in its severity, size-selective effect, and scale (i. e., lake-specific vs. large-scale processes), and is likel...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} human {{exploitation}} depends {{mostly on the}} size of the catch and the species targeted. The value of a species is an important explanatory variable in understanding human impact. Co-management of resources should take into account these different resource values, when evaluating exploitation strategies. The prey choice and foraging behaviour of women and children searching for crabs and shells on the intertidal area at Inhaca Island, South Mozambique, were investigated using optimal foraging theory. This theoretical framework offers the possibility to understand the reasoning of an exploitation strategy and the preference for certain prey species. The number of people was registered, catches were analysed, and timing and substrate choice were recorded. The value of species was estimated using contingency tables. Women were more efficient than children, as their catch was heavier, and the mean weight/animal was larger. The density of women and their timing were positively correlated to prey availability. During neap tide, they spread their visit over more of the low water period and collected crabs by digging in the mangrove forests. No digging occurred during spring tide when a larger area was exposed, the total abundance of species increased, and more species became available. Women then switched to a second strategy, targeting swimming crabs in the tidal channel. Mean neap and <b>spring</b> tide <b>catches</b> were equal (133 g ash-free dry weight per person), but <b>spring</b> <b>catches</b> comprised significantly fewer animals per catch (42 against 123 per person), and mean animal weight was larger (5. 4 against 3. 0 g ash-free dry-weight per person). Diet breadth was narrower during spring tide, and decreased significantly with increased catch weight. Species with profitabilities (energy intake/handling time) lower than the mean intake rate of 0. 024 - 0. 028 g ash-free dry weight s(- 1) were generally excluded from the diet. The prey preference was positively related to the relative value ranks of the prey species, as measured by ranking of species by women. Women maximized the cumulative relative value ranks during spring tide, instead of total weight. Using this analysis, differences in prey choice and spatial differences in exploitation can be understood as a strategy aimed at maximizing intake and the relative value of a prey species...|$|R

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} the shrimp Palaemon serratus (Crustacea, Decapoda), fisheries resources, has been scarcely studied, {{especially in the}} marine habitats of Italian waters. For this purpose, in the present study, monthly samples were taken in brackish waters of the Po River Delta in the North Adriatic Sea. The annual maturative cycle of the ovary was assessed both qualitative, {{on the basis of}} histological findings, and quantitative terms, by cytometry. The ovaries feature a proliferative centre from which maturing oocytes branch out in a centrifugal direction. The reproductive period falls between March and June. During the non-reproductive period oocyte diameter ranged from 24 to 153 m, whilst during the reproductive period ranged from 24 to 733 m. The oviposition pattern may be described as “fractioned”, since it is recurrent. In fact, histological and cytometric findings of the <b>Spring</b> <b>catch</b> revealed that the females had both issued eggs that were still attached to the abdomen, as well as oocytes in all stages of vitellogenesis. The size at first maturity was around 51 mm of length. In conclusion, the histo-cytological approach applied throughout the ovary maturation cycle is a good “reproductive model” assessment and an environmental test because the gonadal maturation is closely dependent on enviromental conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Livingstone-Vallentyne piston sampler {{has been}} further {{modified}} by replacing the <b>spring</b> <b>catch</b> with splines on a square rod, {{in order to}} strengthen the critical points of greatest stress and permit pounding when necessary. Biostratigraphic studies of Quaternary peats and lake sediments were developed to a high degree in Scandinavia nd elsewhere in north-western Europe {{with the benefit of}} open expo-sures of peat or {{with the use of the}} Hiller sampler, which sweeps a sample sideways into a tube (Fries and Hafsten, 1965). Hiller samples are subject to contamination during collection, disturbance of the sedimentary structures, and the easy freezing of the mechanism in very cold weather.
