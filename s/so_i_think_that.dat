500|$|On how Wilkes {{connects to}} Carter, Austin said Wilkes is [...] "one {{of the top}} {{scientists}} in his field , but he’s {{had to work hard}} to get there. It’s sort of a similar struggle of an African-American and a woman in the 1940s to try to succeed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they both see that in one another and that’s part of where the chemistry and connection comes from." [...] Expanding on the love triangle that forms between Wilkes, Sousa, and Carter, Austin said, [...] "we’re very nice to each other. We’re professional. I think that Sousa likes Wilkes enough and it’s the same the other way".|$|E
500|$|Hilson and Ne-Yo {{knew each}} other from their days as co-songwriters. Hilson had {{appeared}} as Ne-Yo's love interest in the video for his song [...] "Miss Independent," [...] the second single taken from his 2008 album, Year of the Gentleman. In a September 2008 interview with Rap-Up about a recent crop of songwriters becoming singers, Ne-Yo said [...] "For one, I think Keri Hilson’s too freakin’ pretty {{to be in the}} background. For two, her voice is incredible—on top {{of the fact that she}} can write. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she’s definitely one that deserves the spotlight." [...] In [...] "Knock You Down", Kanye West makes multiple references to Michael Jackson, and coincidentally, the song was released in numerous territories around the death of the singer.|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{fluency in}} several languages, Sarria was {{assigned}} to Intelligence School. However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that {{he would no longer}} be in the program. Sarria assumed that it was because investigators discovered his homosexuality. [...] "I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn't the most masculine guy in town... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they figured that I was a little bit gay." [...] Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he {{was assigned to}} train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment. He was then assigned to the motor pool.|$|E

500|$|... "SMS (Bangerz)" [...] is {{the third}} track on Miley Cyrus's fourth studio album Bangerz, which was {{released}} in October 2013. Although the song never entered the Billboard Hot 100, the album's strong digital downloads helped it reach number 10 on Billboards Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart, as well as number 157 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is marked as explicit by the RIAA due to its explicit language. Although in October 2013 Cyrus claimed she wanted the song to be the third single off Bangerz, [...] "Adore You" [...] was the album's third single release instead. Talking about plans for a music video, Cyrus hoped [...] "that the video will be as epic as the 'Work Bitch' one, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be the smartest choice." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} filmmakers {{attended}} several press conferences {{that allowed them}} to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to {{the world in which we}} live today. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.|$|E
500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E

When asked how fans might react to Coliseum's new sound for Anxiety's Kiss, vocalist and guitarist Ryan Patterson said: [...] "Every album changes {{and everybody is}} shocked at the time <b>that</b> happens, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> {{made it difficult for}} us to really build a big fanbase because every time we put out a record—I don't know if it's alienating everybody—but it's completely erasing the rulebook." ...|$|R

It might be our last {{full-length}} record for a little while, but we've got a lot of things lined up that we want to record, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> will happen pretty soon." [...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite stating he was [...] "100 percent" [...] healthy {{after the}} groin injury {{suffered}} two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass {{during the third}} quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up. [...] Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, [...] "It held up OK. It's {{all on the same}} leg <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was a problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think." [...] Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office {{would be a good}} thing.... We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E
5000|$|Because {{this race}} was {{targeted}} by Democrats, {{it made it}} all the more important to the GOP, who desired to retain Senate control.

The men can get money, the men can bribe. We are finding {{it very difficult for}} women to go around bribing people. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this is where the country is going nowhere because here {{there is a lot of}} bribes, there is a lot of corruption, something that women don't want in this country." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{is seen as}} a {{transitional}} stage for several characters in the series. The transformation of Rick Grimes to a dark character continues in the episode. He has changed from the person who wanted to save Merle Dixon (in Season 1) and find Sophia Peletier (first half of season 2), to the person who is willing to abandon any hope of finding Andrea. Furthermore, Rick yells at his group for being unappreciative of his sacrifices as a leader. This backlash and hostility has been interpreted as a foreshadowing event for future development for The Walking Dead. [...] "Rick is clearly in a much darker place now than he was {{at the start of the}} season," [...] concluded Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich. In a similar fashion, Lori Grimes is furious at Rick after he admits that he killed Shane Walsh. According to Kirkman, [...] "it looks pretty clear that he has lost [...] by doing this" [...] at the end of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire." [...] In response to the interactions between Rick and Lori, he opined: [...] "I think he feels that he has sacrificed for this group, and that sacrifice hasn’t really been appreciated. His confession to Lori did not get the reaction that he had hoped. He thought she would be supportive. Instead, she reacts in a particular way that he feels is hatred and disgust. I think that’s really affecting him. Let's not forget: This is taking place hours after he murdered his best friend. So he is still reeling. He’s trying to keep that a secret. He opens his heart to his wife, and it doesn’t go well. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he’s just done with these people. I think he doesn’t want to be the leader. As he says: If they don’t like it, they’re free to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|John Hotchkis was {{originally}} hired to compose the music but, {{when he fell}} ill, Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement. Hollingsworth suggested James Bernard, {{with whom he had}} worked on a number of BBC radio productions. Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions, an adaptation of The Duchess of Malfi, and was duly hired. Bernard watched the film a number of times, stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed. Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur. Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration, which was performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the string and percussion sections: Bernard recalled, [...] "I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> John thought {{it would be better to}} see how I got on with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra". The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three-note semitone throughout. Bernard's biographer, David Huckvale, argues that Bernard's use of atonal strings to create a sense of menace predates Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho (1960), which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique. [...] Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic John Brosnan said, [...] "Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score". Bernard went on to become Hammer's most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974. Several cues from The Quatermass Xperiment were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{that year}} Witherspoon {{was chosen to}} portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), in Walk the Line. She never {{had the chance to}} meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died. Witherspoon {{performed}} her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was so worried about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. [...] "That was the most challenging part of the role," [...] she later recalled in an interview, [...] "I'd never sung professionally." [...] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added [...] "boundless energy" [...] to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for [...] "collaborative video of the year" [...] from the CMT Music Awards. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: [...] "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." [...] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: [...] "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> makes her a very modern woman." ...|$|E

Maybe the first time you heard it, you weren't too sure about it, but after you listened to it ten times, it grew on you, rather than to start getting old. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> more of what of what this album will befor people -- that after repeated listens they won't be getting sick of it. Hopefully, they'll be finding new things that they didn't hear before, that it will be growing on them." [...] —Tim Taber 1995 ...|$|R

In fact, Leno's comment was in stark contrast with his own assessment of O'Brien's performance {{less than three months}} prior: [...] "Personally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Conan is doing fine.

Upon discussing the interaction between The Doctor and his latest companion Bill Potts, Capaldi elaborated “It’s a kind of teacher-pupil relationship, but it becomes more complex than that and I think ultimately the Doctor has to undergo some dramas by himself.
