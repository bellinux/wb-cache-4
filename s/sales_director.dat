500|$|Following {{a meeting}} between the Commanding Officer of the Light Dragoons (Lt Col Fair) and Commanding Officer of 28 Engineer Regiment (Lt Col MTG Bazeley) {{it was decided that}} a new and easier to protect road would be {{constructed}} by the Royal Engineers. [...] 28 Engineer Regiment had used a new road construction material called NeoWeb geosynthetic cellular confinement system on an exercise in the UK prior to deployment and this was considered to be a practical option to reduce cost aggregate and provide a barrier to the implanting of lethal IEDS. [...] Lt Col Bazeley contacted the <b>Sales</b> <b>Director</b> of PRS (who was at that time on holiday) and talked him into providing a small amount of Neoweb to trial in Afghan conditions which PRS agreed to do free of charge. [...] The trial proved successful and Bazeley undertook to use funds originally designated to buy aggregate to purchase in excess of £2m of NeoWeb material. [...] The NeoWeb was shipped to Cyprus by PRS and Bazeley convinced the RAF to re-route a flight via Cyprus to pick it up. [...] Construction began in December 2009 and was completed in March 2010, during which time the construction teams and security forces came under frequent attack. This was the first road to be built under fire since British operations in the Dhofar Rebellion in the early 1970s, the completed road allowed resupply convoys to travel its length in about 30minutes, compared to 36hours along the old road. [...] The success of the project led to the approval of plans for an extension to connect the provincial capital Lashkar Gah with the economic capital of Gereshk. [...] Construction of the extension began in July 2010 and was completed in April 2011.|$|E
