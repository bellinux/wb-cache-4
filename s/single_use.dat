5|$|Acetic acid is a {{chemical}} reagent {{for the production}} of chemical compounds. The largest <b>single</b> <b>use</b> of acetic acid is in the production of vinyl acetate monomer, closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production. The volume of acetic acid used in vinegar is comparatively small.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} view {{holds that}} unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of <b>single</b> <b>use</b> syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector {{that allowed the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread.|$|E
5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its largest <b>single</b> <b>use,</b> absorbing about {{a quarter}} of production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E

5|$|The only <b>single</b> <b>use</b> cinema in Street {{was closed}} down and {{converted}} into a nightclub in the 1990s. Strode Theatre, linked to the Crispin School and Strode College complex, is now {{the only place to}} see films, exhibitions and live performances. It opened on 5 October 1963 with a performance by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In 1999 the theatre was expanded with a new foyer, bar and box office along with improved rehearsal space and stage access, at a cost of £750,000 by the Steel, Coleman Davis partnership who received an award for the design. The expansion was funded by the Arts Council England.|$|E

25|$|The FBI {{participated in}} the Venona Project, a pre-World War II joint project with the British to {{eavesdrop}} on Soviet spies in the UK and the United States. They did not initially realize that espionage was being committed, but the Soviet's multiple use of one-time pad ciphers (which with <b>single</b> <b>use</b> are unbreakable) created redundancies that allowed some intercepts to be decoded. These established that espionage was being carried out.|$|E
25|$|Richmond's urban {{residential}} neighborhoods {{also hold}} particular {{significance to the}} city's fabric. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill and Church Hill (among others) are largely <b>single</b> <b>use</b> town homes and mixed use or full retail/dining establishments. These districts are anchored by large streets such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue.

25|$|Frozen dinners, pies, and {{microwave}} popcorn bags often contain a susceptor made from thin aluminium {{film in the}} packaging or included on a small paper tray. The metal film absorbs microwave energy efficiently and consequently becomes extremely hot and radiates in the infrared, concentrating the heating of oil for popcorn or even browning surfaces of frozen foods. Heating packages or trays containing susceptors are designed for a <b>single</b> <b>use</b> and are then discarded as waste.|$|E
