This paper describes and analyzes <b>sporadic</b> model <b>building,</b> which can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) and other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) that use complex multivariate probabilistic models.

The paper also presents a dimensional model to provide a heuristic for scaling the structurebuilding period, which is the only parameter of the proposed sporadic model-building approach. The paper then tests the proposed method and the rule for setting the structure-building period on the problem of finding ground states of 2 D and 3 D Ising spin glasses...|$|R

Forty-five indicators influencing <b>building</b> <b>development</b> costs in New Zealand were explored by literature review and pilot interviews. These indicators were grouped into seven categories. The determination and ranking of the significant cost drivers were carried out through questionnaire survey distributed to key professionals working in New Zealand construction industry. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used in analysing the empirical data. Findings showed that the property market, construction industry characteristics, statutory and regulatory, and socio-economic factors were major drivers of the <b>building</b> <b>development</b> cost trends in New Zealand. It was recommended that the ever-increasing <b>building</b> <b>development</b> costs and housing unaffordability in New Zealand could be significantly mitigated by addressing the identified factors. fals...|$|R
50|$|Initially {{utilised}} by indigenous peoples, {{the area}} of Saratoga was first exploited by European settlers for citrus orchards, after John Bourke and his family settled {{in the area in}} 1863. Bourke {{went on to become a}} pioneer in commercial citrus growing in {{the area of}} Brisbane Water. <b>Sporadic</b> <b>building</b> occurred thereafter, including the notable Federation-style house 'Rosemount', built in 1917 and surviving on 0.5 ha of land at the corner of Village Road and Brooklyn Road. In recent decades, housing development has transformed most of Saratoga into an outer residential suburb of Gosford. Bordered on three sides by water, Saratoga has also become a favourite haunt of fisherman and sports people.|$|R

40|$|Green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> is an {{emerging}} paradigm {{for the construction}} industry practice all around the world. The establishement of Green Building rating tool helps to assess the whole life cycle process in planning to operation in a building. The Malaysian construction industry recognizes buildings that have been assessed using established green building tool such Green Building Index, Green RE or My CREST. Eventhough these rating tools provide motivation factors in its criteria and sub-criteria to promote sustainability in Malaysia buildings, {{there is still a}} major doubt to developers in terms of risks that may hinder their investments in green buildings. This paper highlights the priority importance of economic motivation factors against risks in the green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> in Malaysia. The data presented in this paper have been mainly derived from responses received through questionnaires completed by building stakeholders involved in green <b>building</b> <b>developments.</b> In order to determine the priority importance of economic motivation factors and risks identified for green <b>building</b> <b>development,</b> the questionnaire outcomes have been thoroughly assessed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. As a result, lack of government incentive and high capital cost, which classified under green building risks, are the two key factors with highest priority importance that influenced most of the decision making for green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> in Malaysia. The results show green buildings have proliferated as governmental support and incentives with more exampler of higher profit return of investment in enhancing developers preference for green <b>building</b> <b>development...</b>|$|R

50|$|The community’s upswing and {{development}} into modernity are closely linked with mayor Herbert Brehm’s name. Important projects during his mayoralty were {{things such as}} opening up <b>building</b> <b>development</b> areas like Breite Wiese, dredging the Aschaff for flood control, and laying down requirements for further development at the YMOS metalworks which were then being operated in the community, employing {{more than a thousand}} workers. Further businesses such as the drinks industry and tourism managed to blossom. Substantial infrastructure projects in waterworks and sewage and transport links were undertaken and successfully completed. The sport centre and the gymnasium came into being and were put into a developmental context with the Ebets <b>building</b> <b>development</b> area. In the zoning plan that was put forth, Brehm introduced the ideas for the Ebets <b>building</b> <b>development</b> area and the Heerbach commercial area, thereby laying decisive guidelines down, until his very early death, for the village’s future development. Today, the community administration’s eyes have been cast upon renewing the village’s core. To this end, a consortium was formed. In 2006, the Ebets-Rodwiesen <b>building</b> <b>development</b> area had been fully opened up.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} {{sustainable}} building is increasing rapidly throughout the global construction marketplace. However, the real success of sustainable <b>building</b> <b>development</b> {{depends on the}} concerted effort of different stakeholders. Without knowing the drivers and barriers, {{it is difficult to}} introduce pragmatic policies and strategies to promote such <b>development.</b> While sustainable <b>building</b> <b>development</b> in China is still at an infancy stage, its experience should help other developing countries to develop a road map for developing sustainable buildings. In this paper, twelve semi-structured interviews with senior managers of listed real estate developers in China were conducted. The results indicated that government regulation, incentives and CEO's vision are the key drivers of sustainable <b>building</b> <b>development.</b> The most significant barriers identified by the interviewees are the additional costs due to sustainable initiatives, lack of customers demand and lack of mature green supply chain. To better understand the system structures causing these management problems, a causal loop diagram was developed to identify the relationships and the causal influences between the elements of the sustainable <b>building</b> <b>development</b> sector. Finally, a suite of effective sustainable strategies is proposed based on the findings...|$|R
40|$|The Vietnamese {{construction}} {{market has}} witnessed slow green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> to date. The motivations for enhancing green building practices {{that lead to}} increased green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> (IND 1 -IND 9) are generic and not yet verified in the Vietnamese context. Therefore, it is currently unknown how {{the extent to which}} these motivations apply to the Vietnamese construction industry. This study fills this gap by surveying the opinions of 166 construction professionals covering the education, public and industry sectors in Vietnam. The findings reveal that all IND 1 -IND 9 are very influential, with mean scores > 3. 77 out of a maximum possible 5. 00. Of these, monetary benefits are the most influential, followed by societal gratification and improved human well-being, while the least influential is government regulation. Furthermore, financial incentives and economic benefits are the most influential motivators of construction professionals in each of the education, public and industry sectors. It is concluded that motivation is very important for encouraging green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> among construction professionals in Vietnam and that the government needs to focus more on providing financial and/or economic incentives to as a means of increasing green <b>building</b> <b>development</b> in the country...|$|R
