25|$|Most new-make {{malt whisky}} is diluted to about 60% alcohol by volume (ABV) {{or so before}} it is placed in casks to mature (62.5% is {{specified}} as a maximum in U.S. law for making <b>straight</b> <b>whisky).</b> The aged spirit is then diluted with water to reduce it to bottling strength (typically 40-50% ABV). Since large amounts of water are used {{during the process of}} whisky production, water supplies are a key factor for the location of any distillery.|$|E

60|$|Outside, we {{knocked the}} necks of the bottles off against the {{concrete}} curbs, and drank. Now Joe Goose and Nelson had learned discretion with <b>straight</b> <b>whisky,</b> drunk in quantity. I hadn't. I still laboured under the misconception {{that one was}} to drink all he could get--especially when it didn't cost anything. We shared our bottles with others, and drank a good portion ourselves, while I drank most of all. And I didn't like the stuff. I drank it as I had drunk beer at five, and wine at seven. I mastered my qualms and downed it like so much medicine. And when we wanted more bottles, we went into other saloons where the free drink was flowing, and helped ourselves.|$|E

60|$|If {{you live}} in smaller New York you must know the Van Smuythe family {{carriage}}, drawn by the two 1,500-pound, 100 to 1-shot bays. The carriage is shaped like a bath-tub. In each end of it reclines an old lady Van Smuythe holding a black sunshade {{the size of a}} New Year's Eve feather tickler. Before his downfall Thomas McQuade drove the Van Smuythe bays and was himself driven by Annie, the Van Smuythe lady's maid. But {{it is one of the}} saddest things about romance that a tight shoe or an empty commissary or an aching tooth will make a temporary heretic of any Cupid-worshiper. And Thomas's physical troubles were not few. Therefore, his soul was less vexed with thoughts of his lost lady's maid than it was by the fancied presence of certain non-existent things that his racked nerves almost convinced him were flying, dancing, crawling, and wriggling on the asphalt and in the air above and around the dismal campus of the Bed Line army. Nearly four weeks of <b>straight</b> <b>whisky</b> and a diet limited to crackers, bologna, and pickles often guarantees a psycho-zoological sequel. Thus desperate, freezing, angry, beset by phantoms as he was, he felt the need of human sympathy and intercourse.|$|E

5000|$|Yukon Jack is a liqueur {{advertised as}} the [...] "Black sheep of Canadian Liquors". It is a 100 proof (in USA) or 80 proof (in Canada) drink, made from Canadian whisky and honey. The taste is sweeter than <b>straight</b> <b>whisky</b> and bourbon, {{due to the}} honey that is added.|$|E
5000|$|Rough Rider is {{handcrafted}} by Long Island Spirits in {{a proprietary}} manner incorporating hand selected barrels of aged <b>straight</b> bourbon <b>whisky,</b> using local Long Island wine casks and a unique 180 proof brandy [...] "cask finishing wash".

500|$|A {{turning point}} came on 2 November. Air {{pollution}} in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By {{the end of}} the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for a drink at 2am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, [...] "I've had 18 <b>straight</b> <b>whiskies.</b> I think that's the record!" [...] The barman, and the owner of the pub who served him, later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the steroid ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. An ambulance was summoned.|$|R
5000|$|Old Overholt, {{said to be}} America's oldest continually-maintained {{brand of}} whiskey, was founded in West Overton, Pennsylvania in 1810. Old Overholt is a rye whiskey {{distilled}} by A. Overholt & Co., currently a subsidiary of Beam Suntory, which is a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Osaka, Japan. It is produced at the Jim Beam distillery in Clermont, Kentucky. It {{is one of the}} most commonly available <b>straight</b> rye <b>whiskies</b> in the U.S., where it is available at most liquor stores. It is aged for three years and bottled at 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume). Old Overholt has been called a [...] "foundation stone of American whiskey" [...] because of its long history.|$|R
50|$|Straight whiskey (or <b>straight</b> <b>whisky),</b> {{as defined}} in United States law, is whiskey created by distilling a {{fermented}} (malted or unmalted) cereal grain mash to create a spirit not exceeding 80% alcohol content by volume (abv) and then aging the spirit {{for at least two}} years at an abv concentration not exceeding 62.5% at the start of the aging process.|$|E

50|$|The {{flavor is}} similar in {{saltiness}} and fishiness to that of European cured anchovies, but with a different texture. One of the best-known chinmi ("rare tastes"), it is quite strong and is considered something of an acquired taste even for the native Japanese palate. One method of enjoying it is to consume the serving at one gulp and to follow it with a shot of <b>straight</b> <b>whisky.</b> Some bars in Japan specialize in shiokara.|$|E
5000|$|The term Tennessee Whiskey {{does not}} {{actually}} have a legal definition in the U.S. Federal regulations that define the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits. The only legal {{definition of the term}} Tennessee Whiskey in U.S. federally recognized legislation is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which states only that Tennessee whiskey is [...] "a straight Bourbon Whiskey authorized to be produced only in the State of Tennessee". This definition is also recognized in the law of Canada, which states that Tennessee whiskey must be [...] "a <b>straight</b> Bourbon <b>whisky</b> produced in the State of Tennessee". None of these regulations requires the use of the Lincoln County filtering process (or any other filtering process).|$|R

50|$|All spirits used {{in making}} a Canadian whisky must be aged {{for at least three}} years in wooden barrels of not greater than 700 L {{capacity}} (a requirement similar to that for Scotch and Irish whisky and longer than for American <b>straight</b> <b>whisky).</b> The final whisky must contain at least 40 percent alcohol by volume.

5000|$|Eugene Wing was {{the second}} Commodore of the Manila Yacht Club {{following}} the tenure of James C. Rockwell. According to the Yacht Club 50th anniversary history, Wing's tenure was 1940−1942, though the Club disbanded with the invasion of enemy forces in December 1941. [...] On 28 December 1941, the club was officially dissolved, and members hastened to collect anything which might be of value to the advancing enemy, including the fine wines and distilled spirits remaining at the Club bar. Wing and Miller were preparing to sail for Corregidor aboard Wing's schooner the [...] "Hope Wing," [...] named for his daughter, Hope, when an enemy bomber squadron appeared overhead and began making runs on Pier 7. [...] Later that day a platoon of USAFFE troops arrived with orders to destroy the remaining boats to deny them to the enemy {{in anticipation of the}} assault on Fort Mills, Corregidor. The fine boats were drenched with gasoline and set ablaze. The remaining club members toasted their demise with stiff <b>straight</b> <b>whisky,</b> no ice. There was no ice.|$|E
5000|$|Abraham [...] "Old Abe" [...] Warner was an {{eccentric}} shop owner {{in the nineteenth}} century, in New York and San Francisco.Abraham Warner was fond of children, animals, art, and his collection of various items. He was superstitious about or perhaps admired spiders, as he refused to kill them or to disrupt their webs. He however kept himself tidy and well groomed. The most commonly ordered drink at his bar was a gin and whisky hot toddy with cloves, {{but he refused to}} sell <b>whisky</b> <b>straight.</b> He sold free chowder and locally made French bread alongside French and Spanish drinks, and seafood.|$|R
6000|$|And {{this brings}} me by natural {{sequence}} {{to the great}} drink question. As you know, of course, the American does not drink at meals as a sensible man should. Indeed, he has no meals. He stuffs for ten minutes thrice a day. Also he has no decent notions about the sun being over the yard-arm or below the horizon. He pours his vanity into himself at unholy hours, and indeed he can hardly help it. You have no notion of what [...] "treating" [...] means on the Western slope. It {{is more than an}} institution; it is a religion, though men tell me that it is nothing to what it was. Take a very common instance. At 10.30 A.M. a man is smitten with desire for stimulants. He is in the company of two friends. All three adjourn to the nearest bar,--seldom more than twenty yards away,--and take three <b>straight</b> <b>whiskys.</b> They talk for two minutes. The second and third man then treats in order; and thus each walks into the street, two of them the poorer by three goes of whisky under their belt and one with two more liquors than he wanted. It is not etiquette yet to refuse a treat. The result is peculiar. I have never yet, I confess, seen a drunken man in the streets, but I have heard more about drunkenness among white men, and seen more decent men above or below themselves with drink, than I care to think about. And the vice runs up into all sorts of circles and societies. Never was I more astonished than at one pleasant dinner party to hear a pair of pretty lips say casually of a gentleman friend then under discussion, [...] "He was drunk." [...] The fact was merely stated without emotion. That was what startled me. But the climate of California deals kindly with excess, and treacherously covers up its traces. A man neither bloats nor shrivels in this dry air. He continues with the false bloom of health upon his cheeks, an equable eye, a firm mouth, and a steady hand till a day of reckoning arrives, and suddenly breaking up, about the head, he dies, and his friends speak his epitaph accordingly. Why people who in most cases cannot hold their liquor should play with it so recklessly I leave to others to decide. This unhappy state of affairs has, however, produced one good result which I will confide to you. In the heart of the business quarter, where banks and bankers are thickest, and telegraph wires most numerous, stands a semi-subterranean bar tended by a German with long blond locks and a crystalline eye. Go thither softly, treading on the tips of your toes, and ask him for a Button Punch. 'Twill take ten minutes to brew, but the result is the highest and noblest product of the age. No man but one knows what is in it. I have a theory it is compounded of the shavings of cherubs' wings, the glory of a tropical dawn, the red clouds of sunset, and fragments of lost epics by dead masters. But try you for yourselves, and pause a while to bless me, who am always mindful of the truest interests of my brethren.|$|R
