5|$|These designs, {{such as the}} Python Lowracer, a recumbent, {{usually have}} very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and {{positive}} or even negative trail. The builder of a bike with negative trail states that steering the bike from <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.|$|E
5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{continued}} {{to run down}} the clock by running the ball <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> for a four-yard gain. Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen then entered the game, and running back Andre Kendrick gained a first down with a run to the 33-yard line. Kendrick then gained a first down at the Alabama 39-yard line. Kendrick {{continued to}} advance the ball with short runs, draining the clock to secure the Tech lead. Tech's third backup quarterback, Dave Meyer, also entered the game as the final seconds ticked off the clock and Virginia Tech secured its 387 win.|$|E

50|$|Other {{advantages}} to backward running are {{a reduction in}} fear related to the movement, a form of exercise that is naturally more reserved, gains in balance, and the general enjoyment resulting from entertaining activities like these. Due to constantly having to look behind oneself, or sometimes keeping the eyes fixed, people can learn to run with more neck mobility or without a <b>straight</b> look <b>ahead.</b> This can stress the neck muscles which can be dangerous if done too aggressively, {{but in the long}} term could lead to adaptations in them.|$|R
5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one {{strategy is to}} minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause flicker when seen by the prey from <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> Cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes {{at right angles to}} their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E
5|$|After Tech's kickoff was downed {{in the end}} zone, the Longhorns' offense began a new {{drive from}} their 20-yard line. Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then completed a first-down pass to Adams at the 32-yard line. From there, Brown threw an incomplete pass, then tossed a 15-yard screen pass to Fitzgerald, who gained a first down at the Texas 42-yard line. Williams crossed into Virginia Tech territory on the next play as he ran <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> for a 13-yard gain. A one-yard run was followed by an incomplete pass, and on third down Brown threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech defender Torrian Gray, who returned the pass to the Tech 33-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-score kickoff was fielded at the five-yard line by Kendrick and {{returned}} to the Tech 25-yard line. The first play of the drive was an option run with Vick and Kendrick, who broke free of the Clemson defense for a 45-yard run and a first down at the Clemson 29-yard line. Two short rushes were followed by a pass to fullback Cullen Hawkins at the 10-yard line for a first down. Clemson committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then Ferguson ran <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> for a touchdown. The extra point kick was good, and Tech took a 3413 lead with 5:14 left in the quarter.|$|E
6000|$|Anderson manifestly {{controlled}} strong feeling. Lenore saw Jake's hand {{go to her}} father's shoulder. [...] "Boss," [...] he whispered, [...] "we can't ketch thet car now." [...] Anderson resigned himself, averted {{his face}} {{so that he could}} not see Nash, who was tinkering with the engine. Lenore believed then that Nash had deliberately stalled the engine or disordered something, so as to permit the escape of the strange car ahead. She saw it turn off the long, <b>straight</b> road <b>ahead</b> and disappear to the right. After some minutes' delay Nash resumed his seat and started the car once more.|$|R
5000|$|The 2002 Indy Racing League (IRL) {{was one of}} transition, {{with many}} CART teams {{participating}} in a partial IRL schedule while retaining [...] "lame duck" [...] status in their original series with their CART engine suppliers Toyota and Honda. On the IRL front, the Infiniti engine was in its [...] "lame duck" [...] year and the General Motors engine was now branded as a Chevrolet rather than an Oldsmobile as that marque was being phased out. Sam Hornish Jr. won 5 races {{on his way to}} his second <b>straight</b> championship <b>ahead</b> of Penske Racing juggernaut Hélio Castroneves who won three races, including a second straight Indy 500, on his way to second in the championship.|$|R
5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel <b>straight,</b> moving <b>ahead</b> of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|R
5|$|Following the turnover, Clemson {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 28-yard line. Simmons ran the ball <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> for an eight-yard gain, gained one yard on a run, then Kelly ran for a first down at the 40-yard line. On first down, Simmons completed an 18-yard pass to Gardner at the Tech 42-yard line. Simmons then completed a six-yard pass before throwing a shovel pass to Kelly for a first down at the Tech 32-yard line. An incomplete pass was followed by six-yard toss and a pass to Watts at the 12-yard line. Simmons ran out of bounds for a two-yard loss, then completed a touchdown pass to Gardner. The extra point kick was good, and Clemson closed Virginia Tech's lead to 3420 with 7:19 remaining.|$|E
5|$|It {{continues}} {{along the}} hillside of Black Mountain, Washington County's highest peak, as it meanders {{north on the}} narrowing isthmus between Lakes Champlain and George. Near the northern end, it crosses the Essex County line. Two miles later, it reaches the first settlement along its length within the Adirondack Park, Ticonderoga. The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of key battles in both the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars, as NY74 comes in from the ferry to the east. This overlap lasts for almost two miles (3km) until NY74 goes <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> at the intersection with NY9N, while NY22 turns right to join NY9N, the longest suffixed route in the state, and return to its northbound orientation.|$|E
5|$|So {{direction}} 0 {{indicates the}} worm continues to travel <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> direction 1 indicates the worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it has to make a choice, in direction 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm {{has no choice but to}} take it and this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E
50|$|In the Olympic final itself Sowell {{led from}} the back {{straight}} of the first lap {{right up to the}} final turn of the final lap where he was passed by Courtney. As they entered the final <b>straight,</b> Coutney now <b>ahead</b> had his own battle with Derek Johnson who had also passed Sowell, but Sowell now had to contend with the challenge of Audun Boysen. Courtney was to win his battle with Johnson and finish first, but Sowell lost his and finished fourth.|$|R
6000|$|The fifth night below St. Louis {{we had a}} big storm after midnight, with a {{power of}} thunder and {{lightning}}, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big <b>straight</b> river <b>ahead,</b> and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, [...] "Hel-LO, Jim, looky yonder!" [...] It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.|$|R
50|$|The many {{images that}} {{resulted}} {{earned him a}} Golden Eye Award from World Press Photo in Amsterdam. He was the official photographer for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997. Many poignant works were produced in this period. One such is the image entitled Jann Turner with Eugene de Kock, TRC Headquarters 1997. Eugene De Kock was the commander at Vlakplaas, where political activist Rick Turner, father of Jann Turner, was assassinated {{in front of her}} by security policemen. The weight of this image is in the exchange between the two subjects, with Turner's dry smile and De Kock's <b>straight</b> gaze <b>ahead.</b> This project led to his work with the Nobel Peace Centre in Oslo and the resulting travelling exhibition, Strengths and Convictions: The life and times of the South African Nobel Peace laureates Albert Luthuli, Desmond Tutu, FW de Klerk and Nelson Mandela.|$|R
5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|When {{the outer}} walls {{were built in}} the 13thcentury the main {{entrance}} was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, North Carolina had a {{first down}} at the Tech 34-yard line. Keldorf threw an eight-yard pass to Crumpler, North Carolina, was stopped for a one-yard loss on a running play, then the Tar Heels earned {{a first down}} with a four-yard run by Geter. On first down, Keldorf threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Second down resulted in a 15-yard gain and a first down on a run by Geter along {{the left side of}} the field. Now at the Tech eight-yard line, Geter ran <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> for a five-yard gain. Geter was stopped for a two-yard loss on the next play, but North Carolina recovered from the loss with a five-yard pass from Keldorf to Carrick for a touchdown. The extra point kick was blocked, but a penalty against Virginia Tech allowed Carolina kicker Josh McGee another chance at the extra point. The second attempt was successful, and the kick gave the Tar Heels a 423 lead with 5:01 remaining in the game.|$|E
50|$|The ship {{departed}} London, {{with a crew}} of 50, {{and arrived}} {{on the island of}} Terceira in four days (around noon on the 5 November 1864), with the hope of porting at its destination in Bermuda. Instead of taking on a pilot (as was the custom), Captain Edwin Courtenay proceeded, full-speed <b>ahead</b> <b>straight</b> into the harbour at Angra do Heroísmo and ran the ship aground in the bay's sandy bottom, along the shoreline near the customs wharf. This followed a period of excessive care taken by the captain when rounding the pier. The captain's attempts to free the ship were in vain.|$|R

Watts settled the colt in fourth place in the early stages, before moving him up to dispute the lead with Labrador entering the <b>straight.</b> He pulled <b>ahead</b> to win easily by one and a half lengths [...] "amid great cheering." ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, digital {{photoelasticity}} {{technique is}} used to estimate the crack tip fracture parameters for different crack configurations. Conventionally, only isochromatic data surrounding the crack tip is used for SIF estimation, but {{with the advent of}} digital photoelasticity, pixel -wise availability of both isoclinic and isochromatic data could be exploited for SIF estimation in a novel way. A linear least square approach is proposed to estimate the mixed -mode crack tip fracture parameters by solving the multi -parameter stress field equation. The stress intensity factor (SIF) is extracted from those estimated fracture parameters. The isochromatic and isoclinic data around the crack tip is estimated using the ten -step phase shifting technique. To get the unwrapped data, the adaptive quality guided phase unwrapping algorithm (AQGPU) has been used. The mixed mode fracture parameters, especially SIF are estimated for specimen configurations like single edge notch (SEN), center crack and <b>straight</b> crack <b>ahead</b> of inclusion using the proposed algorithm. The experimental SIF values estimated using the proposed method are compared with analytical/finite element analysis (FEA) results, and are found to be in good agreement...|$|R
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was bobbled by kick {{returner}} Andre Kendrick at the Tech one-yard line, but Kendrick {{broke free}} of the Clemson defense for a 34-yard return to the 35-yard line. Tech's first play after the return was an 11-yard run by Lee Suggs up {{the right side of}} the field. After the first down, Suggs ran <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> for a short gain, then Vick scrambled to the Clemson 37-yard line and another first down. Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run to the left side of the field. At the Clemson 19-yard line, Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard, then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards. The third-down play was an incomplete pass, and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick bounced off the field goal crossbar but did not cross it, thus denying the Hokies three points. With 10:33 remaining in the half, Tech still had a 147 lead.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Warren Corners, {{the route}} heads across rural areas along the Cambria–Lockport town line. It soon enters the small hamlet of Hickory Corners, {{where the road}} passes under Lower Mountain Road (CR902). Access to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur (CR114), a {{connector}} leading to Lower Mountain Road. NY93 continues southward along the town line, changing names to Junction Road at an intersection with Upper Mountain Road (CR5) west {{of the city of}} Lockport. From here, the route crosses over CSX Transportation's Lockport Subdivision rail line at the hamlet of Lockport Junction before intersecting with NY31 (Saunders Settlement Road) and NY270 (Campbell Boulevard) just south of the community. NY270 begins <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> to the south while NY93 turns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road, beginning a concurrency with NY31.|$|E
50|$|In the Derby {{he started}} at odds of 10/1 {{in a field}} of twenty on an unusually hot day in front of a crowd which {{included}} the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Ridden by Harry Carr he was always prominent and challenged the leader Fidalgo (ridden by Carr's son-in-law Joe Mercer) in the <b>straight.</b> He pulled <b>ahead</b> in the final furlong to win by one and a half lengths from Fidalgo, with the French-trained favourite Shantung third. Shantung was considered an unlucky loser: he had been virtually pulled-up by his jockey who feared he was injured, and finished strongly after being tailed-off in last place entering the straight.|$|R
50|$|Flack reached Athens {{after an}} uncomfortable six-day rail and sea trip, {{during which he}} was plagued with sea sickness.

5000|$|Common {{was then}} sent to Doncaster for the St Leger on 10 September {{in an attempt to}} {{complete}} the Triple Crown. His main challenger appeared to be the filly Mimi who was bidding to complete her own version of the Triple Crown, having won both the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks. Common started 4/5 favourite ahead of Mimi on 5/1 and the heavily-backed French colt Reverend on 11/2. Reverend took an early lead, and set a strong pace in an attempt to expose any weaknesses in Common's stamina. The French colt maintained his lead into the <b>straight,</b> just <b>ahead</b> of Common and the outsider St Simon of the Rock. Common came under pressure and appeared to be beaten but responded well and a furlong from the finish the three colts were level. In the closing stages Common began to pull ahead and after a [...] "splendid race" [...] he crossed the line a length in front of Reverend, with St Simon of the Rock a neck away in third. The race was described by one London correspondent as [...] "one of the finest that have been witnessed in the North for many years." ...|$|R

5|$|The post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Clemson 30-yard line, where it was fumbled. The loose football jetted forward and was recovered by a Clemson player at the 34-yard line, where the Tigers' offense began another drive. The first play of the possession was a nine-yard pass from Dantzler to Kelly, and {{it was followed by}} a shovel pass to Kelly, who gained a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. From there, Kantzler ran <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> for 27 yards and a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. After two incomplete passes, Clemson completed a five-yard false-start penalty. A one-yard run by Dantzler was followed by an unsuccessful fourth-down conversion attempt.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a new model}} for lane {{tracking}} and curve detection.
