40|$|The authors assess {{inflation}} in Czechoslovakia between 1985 and 1991 {{and identify the}} main causes of inflation through a literature survey and empirical studies. The official prices in centrally planned economies were never perceived by central planners to be fully market clearing. Only by coincidence would the overall price level correspond to the level associated with general equilibrium. What is missing in official price indices in centrally planned economies - including {{the consumer price index}} - is <b>suppressed</b> <b>inflation,</b> manifast in queuing for products, forced substitution of demand, and forced savings. Also missing is hidden inflation, associated with practices that disguise price increases behind cosmetic or other change in product quality. The authors argue that inflationary pressures in Czechoslovakia in 1985 - 89 originated mainly in the investment sector. Even though the investment sector was strictly controlled, making it difficult for open inflation to emerge, the scope for inflationary pressures was great in Czechoslovakia. Such pressures arose from a mixture of factors, including poor investment planning, accommodating government finance, and the high priority given to investments and social consumption. For Czechoslovakia, the official price indices show virtually no inflation between 1985 and 1989, when there were long waiting lists for such products as cars and state and cooperative flats. Trends in these price indices do not seem to depend on the method used for constructing them, according to the sensitivity tests conducted by Czechoslovakia's Federal Statistical Office. Obviously, the official price indices failed to capture the full extent of economic disequilibrium in that period. But the extent to which official price indices understated inflationary pressures was not serious in Czechoslovakia, compared with other centrally planned economies. Estimates of hidden inflation for 1985 - 89 range from 0. 5 percent to 2 percent a year in consumer markets and about 3 percent in the industrial sector. Estimates for <b>suppressed</b> <b>inflation</b> were less than 5 percent. The relatively small inflationary gap is indirectly confirmed by the sharp inflation associated with the recent price liberalization that subsided in a relatively short period, and both suppressed and hidden inflations have virtually disappeared. Estimates of hidden inflation were based on benchmark price comparisons between Czechoslovakia and such market economies as Austria. Those for <b>suppressed</b> <b>inflation</b> were based on disequilibrium econometric models of asset holdings and on conjecture tests.

In all belligerent countries labour and material resources were shifted from civilian production to war-related purposes, and a central planning system was established to organise production and distribution. In this context, financial mobilisation played an important role. In Germany, preparations for financial mobilisation began {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. Since 1891 fiscal and monetary policies were designed for the eventuality of a war and became, with few modifications, the basis for the financial mobilisation implemented in August 1914. In accordance with the strategic planning of the time, fiscal and monetary policies were prepared for a short war.

During the war, the German economy was supported by war booty taken from occupied countries, continuing to some extent until 1944.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{exchange rate}} policies can best support {{the sustainability of}} disinflation programs. Freezing the nominal exchange rate frequently has been recommended {{as a means of}} <b>suppressing</b> inertial <b>inflation</b> and accelerating the disinflation process. However, because any resultant real exchange rate appreciation often must be corrected through a subsequent devaluation, targeting the nominal exchange rate may merely postpone inflation rather than eliminate it once-and-for-all. This paper argues that because excessive inflation during any particular period may jeopardize the stabilization program, exchange rate policies should be designed to smooth inflation across all phases of the disinflation experience. Toward that end, an initial devaluation followed by partial indexation of the exchange rate to domestic prices may be useful. The paper then considers how inconsistencies between an exchange rate rule and balance-of-payments viability may lead to "reserves crises". Depending upon the credibility of the government's commitment to stabilization, the devaluation prompted by a reserves crisis could trigger additional inflation sufficient to cause the failure of the disinflation program. These considerations underscore the importance of policies that prevent excessive appreciation of the real exchange rate during the disinflation process.

The cosmological evolution of a coherently oscillating condensate of right-handed sneutrinos is studied for the case where reheating after inflation is due to perturbative inflaton decays. For the case of Dirac neutrinos, it is shown that some suppression of Planck scale-suppressed corrections to the right-handed neutrino superpotential is necessary in order to have sufficiently late decay of the right-handed sneutrinos. cH 2 corrections to the sneutrino mass squared term must also be <b>suppressed</b> during <b>inflation</b> (|c | 0) or red (if c < 0) perturbation spectrum is possible.

The resulting expansion rate during inflation can be significantly smaller than in conventional supersymmetric inflation models (as low as 106 GeV is possible). For the case of Majorana neutrinos, a more severe suppression of Planck-suppressed superpotential corrections is required.

The theory may still be predictive regardless the interpretation of non-unitary processes provided that their rate is negligible compared to the Universe expansion rate. This implies that the ghost is effectively stable. In such a setup, there are two scalar degrees of freedom excited during inflation. The first one is the usual curvature perturbation whose power spectrum appears to coincide with that of single-field inflation. The second one is a scalar component of the ghost encoded in the shift vector of the metric in the uniform inflaton gauge. The amplitudes of primordial tensor and vector perturbations are strongly <b>suppressed.</b> After <b>inflation</b> the ghost field starts to oscillate and its energy density shortly becomes dominant in the Universe.

40|$|We {{investigate}} multi-field inflationary scenarios with {{fields that}} {{drop out of}} the model in a staggered fashion. This feature is natural in certain multi-field inflationary setups within string theory; for instance, it can manifest itself when fields are related to tachyons that condense, or inter-brane distances that become meaningless when branes annihilate. Considering a separable potential, and promoting the number of fields to a smooth time-dependent function, we derive the formalism to deal with these models at the background and perturbed level, providing general expressions for the scalar spectral index and the running. We recover known results of e. g. a dynamically relaxing cosmological constant in the appropriate limits. We further show that isocurvature perturbations are <b>suppressed</b> during <b>inflation,</b> so that perturbations are adiabatic and nearly Gaussian. The resulting setup might be interpreted as a novel type of warm inflation, readily implemented within string theory and without many of the shortcomings associated with warm inflation. To exemplify the applicability of the formalism we consider three concrete models: assisted inflation with exponential potentials as a simple toy model (a graceful exit becomes possible), inflation from multiple tachyons (a constant decay rate of the number of fields and negligible slow roll contributions turns out to be in good agreement with observations) and inflation from multiple M 5 -branes within M-theory (a narrow stacking of branes yields a consistent scenario).

Inspiratory flow, tidal volume, transpulmonary pressure, compliance and electromyographic (EMG) activity of genioglossus (GG), hyoglossus (HG) and inspiratory intercostal (IIC) muscles were studied in 11 anaesthetized, tracheotomized and spontaneously breathing rats. Mean EMG activity during inspiration was compared with mean EMG activity during an occluded inspiration, at each of five levels of inspired CO 2 (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 %). Lung <b>inflation</b> <b>suppressed</b> EMG activity in all muscles, with the effect on both tongue muscles exceeding that of the intercostal muscles. Static elevations of end-expiratory lung volume evoked by 2 cmH 2 O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) had no effect on tongue muscle activity. Despite increasing inspiratory flow, tidal volume and transpulmonary pressure, the inhibition of tongue muscle activity by lung inflation diminished as arterial PCO 2 (Pa,CO 2) increased. The onset of tongue muscle activity relative to the onset of IIC muscle activity advanced with increases in Pa,CO 2 but was unaffected by lung inflation. This suggests that hypoglossal and external intercostal motoneuron pools are controlled by different circuits or have different sensitivities to CO 2, lung inflation and/or anaesthetic agents.

40|$|Information Economics and Policy 18 (2006) 1 – 23 The {{adherents of}} the {{so-called}} ÔNew EconomyÕ claim that we are entering a new era with high output growth, low unemployment and low inflation. ICT investments {{in general and the}} increased use of the Internet {{play an important role in}} this claim. In the literature we find three different explanations for the low inflation experience. Increased productivity growth combined with sluggish adjustment of wages, improved credibility of monetary policy and improved functioning of the labour market. This paper provides another explanation where adoption of Internet as a cost reducing and efficiency improving technology changes market structures and affects the mark-up margins of firms and thereby the relation between costs and output prices. The diffusion of the Internet as a cost saving technology is introduced in a model with network effects and dynamic market structures. The latter two result in an endogenous diffusion process of the use of the Internet for business-to-business commerce. However, there is also some feedback from the increased adoption of the Internet. Diffusion also affects the market structure and therefore the gains of the efficiency improvements obtained by doing business via the Internet. The combination of the diffusion of the Internet, the characteristics of network effects and the dynamics of the markets can explain variation in the mark-up on production costs explains at least a part of the low inflation experience.

This statistical relationship, known as the Phillips curve, is sometimes invoked when economic commentators suggest that monetary policy should not try to <b>suppress</b> signs of <b>inflation.</b> But this interpretation of the Phillips curve implicitly assumes that the statistical relationship is structural, that is, the relationship will not break down during periods of persistently high inflation. Starting in the mid- 1960 s, Friedman and Phelps argued that the Phillips curve is indeed not structural and the experience of the United States and other countries with high inflation and low GDP growth in the late 1960 s and 1970 s has subsequently borne out their predictions. Various theories have been proposed to explain the Phillips curve and most of these theories agree that there is no significant long-term tradeoff between inflation and the level of economic activity. One theory that provides a structural interpretation of the short-term inflation-unemployment relationship, and that has become quite popular over the last ten years among central bank economists is based on explicit models of nominal price rigidity.
