5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E

25|$|Women’s {{health is}} also put {{at a higher}} level of risk as a result of being {{confined}} to certain traditional responsibilities, such as cooking and water collection. Being confined to unpaid domestic labor not only reduces women's opportunities to education and formal job employment (both of which can indirectly contribute to better health in the long run), but also potentially expose women to higher risk of health issues. For instance, in developing regions where <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> are used for cooking, women are exposed to a higher level of indoor air pollution due to extended periods of cooking and preparing meals for the family. Breathing air tainted by the burning of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> is estimated to be responsible for 641,000 of the 1.3 million deaths of women worldwide each year due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} measures of clean cookstove adoption after improved <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> stove programmes in three geographically and culturally diverse rural Andean settings and explored {{factors associated with}} these measures. A questionnaire was administered to 1200 households on stove use and cooking behaviours including previously defined factors associated with clean cookstove adoption. Logistic multivariable regressions with 16 pre-specified explanatory variables were performed for three outcomes; (1) daily improved <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> stove use, (2) use of liquefied petroleum gas stove and (3) traditional stove displacement. Eighty-seven percent of households reported daily improved <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> stove use, 51 % liquefied petroleum gas stove use and 66 % no longer used the traditional cookstove. Variables associated {{with one or more}} of the three outcomes are: education, age and civil status of the reporting female, household wealth and size, region, encounters of problems with the improved <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> stove, knowledge of somebody able to build an improved <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> stove, whether stove parts are obtainable in the community, and subsidy schemes. We conclude that to be successful, improved <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> stove programmes need to consider (1) existing household characteristics, (2) the household's need for ready access to maintenance and repair, and (3) improved knowledge at the community level...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} about {{experimental}} investigation on <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> briquettes made of oil palm mill residues that exhibit optimum handling and storage properties. One {{of the major}} technical challenges in utilizing biomass waste material as a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> is the handling and storage issues of loose and wet waste material. The <b>solid</b> biomass <b>fuel</b> briquettes made from different types and combinations of palm oil mill residues were explored for optimum storage and handling features. A solution to improving the handling and storage properties of loosely-bound oil palm mill residues is proposed in this work via a densification process known as fuel briquetting. Raw oil palm waste material was pulverized and compacted with a 159 MPa pressing pressure to form 40 mm diameter <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> briquettes. It was found that a fuel briquette with a 60 : 40 palm kernel shell to mesocarp fiber ratio using waste paper as its binding agent gave the best mechanical properties without sacrificing the combustion properties of the <b>solid</b> <b>fuel...</b>|$|R
25|$|The first fully {{synthetic}} rubber was synthesized by Sergei Lebedev in 1910. In World War II, supply blockades of natural rubber from South East Asia caused {{a boom in}} development of {{synthetic rubber}}, notably styrene-butadiene rubber. In 1941, annual production of synthetic rubber in the U.S. was only 231 tonnes which increased to 840,000 tonnes in 1945. In the space race and nuclear arms race, Caltech researchers experimented with using synthetic rubbers for solid fuel for rockets. Ultimately, all large military rockets and missiles would use synthetic rubber based <b>solid</b> <b>fuels,</b> and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort.|$|E
25|$|Heaters that burn {{natural gas}} {{drastically}} {{reduce the amount}} of creosote buildup due to natural gas burning much cleaner and more efficiently than traditional <b>solid</b> <b>fuels.</b> While in most cases {{there is no need to}} clean a gas chimney on an annual basis that does not mean that other parts of the chimney cannot fall into disrepair. Disconnected or loose chimney fittings caused by corrosion over time can pose serious dangers for residents due to leakage of carbon monoxide into the home. Thus, it is recommended—and in some countries even mandatory—that chimneys be inspected annually and cleaned on a regular basis to prevent these problems. The workers who perform this task are called chimney sweeps or steeplejacks. This work used to be done largely by child labour, and as such features in Victorian literature. In the Middle Ages in some parts of Europe, a crow-stepped gable design was developed, partly to provide access to chimneys without use of ladders.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Italy {{was a major}} {{producer}} of pyrites (from the Tuscan Maremma), asbestos (from the Balangero mines), fluorite (found in Sicily), and salt. At the same time, it was self-sufficient in aluminum (from Gargano), sulfur (from Sicily), lead, and zinc (from Sardinia). By {{the beginning of the}} 1990s, however, it had lost all its world-ranking positions and was no longer self-sufficient in those resources. There are no substantial deposits of iron, coal, or oil. Moderate natural gas reserves, mainly in the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic Sea, have been discovered in recent years and constitute the country's most important mineral resource. Italy is one of the world's leading producers of pumice, pozzolana, and feldspar. Another mineral resource for which Italy is well-known is marble, especially the world-famous white Carrara marble from the Massa and Carrara quarries in Tuscany. Most raw materials needed for manufacturing and more than 80% of the country's energy sources are imported (99.7% of the <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> demand, 92.5% of oil, 91.2% of natural gas and 13% of electricity). Due to its reliance on imports, Italians pay approximately 45% more than the EU average for electricity.|$|E

500|$|At von Kármán's suggestion, Malina {{approached}} the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Army Air Corps Research to request funding for research {{into what they}} referred to as [...] "jet propulsion", a term chosen to avoid the stigma attached to rocketry. The military were interested in jet propulsion {{as a means of}} getting aircraft quickly airborne where there was insufficient room for a full-length runway, and gave the Rocket Research Group $1,000 to put together a proposal on the feasibility of Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) by June 1939, making Parsons et al. the first U.S. government-sanctioned rocket research group. Since their formation in 1934, they had also performed experiments involving model, black powder motor-propelled multistage rockets. In a research paper submitted to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), Parsons reported these rockets reaching velocities of 4,875 miles per hour, thereby demonstrating the potential of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> to be more effective than the liquid types primarily preferred by researchers such as Goddard.
