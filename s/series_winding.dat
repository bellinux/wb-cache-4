50|$|A {{single-phase}} induction regulator has a (primary) excitation winding, {{connected to}} the supply voltage, wound on a magnetic core which can be rotated. The stationary secondary winding is connected in series with the circuit to be regulated. As the excitation winding is rotated through 180 degrees, the voltage induced in the <b>series</b> <b>winding</b> changes from adding to the supply voltage to opposing it. By selection of the ratios {{of the number of}} turns on the excitation and series windings, the range of voltage can be adjusted, say, plus or minus 20% of the supply voltage, for example.|$|E

An auxiliary generator end connected to the {{main generator}} rated at 50 kW, 135V 375A supplied control equipment, compressors, motor cooling blowers, lighting, as well as providing the excitation for the main generator.

50|$|If the {{stator winding}} is {{connected}} to the primary phase, the total voltage seen from the neutral (N) will be the sum of the voltages at both windings rotor and stator. Translating this to electric phasors, both phasors are connected. However, there is an angular shifting of α between them. Since α can be freely chosen between π, both phasors can be added or subtracted, so all the values in between are attainable. The primary and secondary are not isolated. Also, the ratio of the magnitudes of voltages between rotor and stator is constant; the resultant voltage varies owing to the angular shifting of the <b>series</b> <b>winding</b> induced voltage.|$|E

50|$|If {{the applied}} voltage is normal voltage then normal flux {{will be set}} up. Since iron loss is a {{function}} of applied voltage, normal iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage. This maximum iron loss is measured using the wattmeter. Since the impedance of the <b>series</b> <b>winding</b> of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch, all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch. Thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss. This test only measures the combined iron losses consisting of the hysteresis loss and the eddy current loss. Although the hysteresis loss is less than the eddy current loss, it is not negligible. The two losses can be separated by driving the transformer from a variable frequency source since the hysteresis loss varies linearly with supply frequency and the eddy current loss varies with the square.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to interconnecting the supergrid system, the West Burton 400 kV substation also feeds {{into the local}} 132 kV network. This connection is made via two 240 MVA, 400/132 kV auto-transformers manufactured by Associated Electrical Industries. The windings consists of a tertiary winding, a common, a tapping and a <b>series</b> <b>winding.</b> They are arranged so that the helical single layer tertiary winding is nearest the core, the continuous disc common winding next, followed by the interleaved full-length helical type tapping winding and the multi-layer type <b>series</b> <b>winding</b> and line shield. A continuously transposed conductor was used to minimise eddy current losses and reduce the space requirement of the windings. High speed resistor tap changers are provided on the 132 kV side of each transformer, giving a tapping range of plus 15% to minus 5%. The tapping winding has 7 taps which {{in conjunction with a}} buck/boost switch provide fourteen steps. The fixed contacts of each of the two rotary tap selector units associated with each phase are connected to one half of the tappings from the windings while the moving contacts are connected to the diverter switches. The diverter switch assembly, together with the transition resistors and operating mechanism is mounted on top of the 132 kV bushing which forms {{an integral part of the}} tap changer. Erection of the transformer was carried out inside a translucent plastic dome, inflated by a small blower. This allowed the work to continue regardless of the weather and thus reduced the time normally taken for erecting large transformers in the open. By working day and night within the plastic dome the time for erection on site was reduced from an estimated 8 weeks to 3 weeks. Completely assembled, each transformer is 14.94 m (49 ft) long, 10.06 m (33 ft) wide, and weighs 325.1 tonnes (320 tons) made up of 154.4 tonnes (152 tons) of steel, 30.48 tonnes (30 tons) of copper, and 19.3 tonnes (19 tons) of insulation and 98,420 litres (26,000 gallons) of oil.

30|$|Assessing the {{vulnerability}} of a system to GIC hazards usually does not require knowledge of the precise values of expected GICs, instead rough magnitude estimates are sufficient (Pirjola 2008 a). However, substantial improvements in our enterprise could be attained with further insights. A clear source of uncertainty in the obtained results arises from the fact of having completely ignored the low-voltage circuits that are galvanically connected to the 400 -kV system through autotransformers. This was done because we had neither information on the 220  kV network nor the separate value of the common and <b>series</b> <b>winding</b> resistances of these autotransformers. The 110 -kV grid obviously {{does not have a}} very big effect on the GIC in the 400 -kV system since the lower the voltage, the higher the transmission line resistances, which makes the GICs smaller. The importance of the omission of the low-voltage network has been demonstrated through a test under a GIC benchmark network that has been recently developed by Horton et al. (2012).|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} Future {{offshore wind}} farms {{are expected to}} be placed further away from shore, which will give rise to more employment of HVDC transmission. However, HVDC transmission requires a bulky and expensive power conversion substation at offshore as well as a dedicated supporting platform. Potential elimination of the platform and centralized conversion station leads to great cost savings. Recent proposals of pure dc <b>series</b> offshore <b>wind</b> farms are due to this motivation. The series connection of the wind turbines enables to establish the HVDC transmission voltage level with no extra voltage step-up substation, which makes it attractive for distant large wind farm. However, as series connected in one cluster, wind turbines are not possible to operate independently. Severe wind variation imposes overvoltage on the wind turbines and may provoke a cascade of failures of other series connected units. This paper describes the operating behaviour of dc <b>series</b> offshore <b>wind</b> farm as well as correspondent control strategies in both sound and fault conditions. A simulation of the dc <b>series</b> <b>wind</b> farm is carried out and validates the feasibility of the proposed control strategy. DC <b>series</b> offshore <b>wind</b> farms with proposed control imply competitive economic advantages of future integration of remote energy generation. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, layouts {{of various}} {{large-scale}} wind parks, using both AC {{as well as}} DC, are investigated. Loss modelling of the wind park components as well as calculations of the energy capture of the turbines using various electrical systems are performed, and the energy production cost of the various park configurations is determined. The most interesting candidate for a DC transmission based wind park was investigated more in detail, the <b>series</b> DC <b>wind</b> park. Finally, the power quality impact in the PCC (point of common coupling) was studied.
