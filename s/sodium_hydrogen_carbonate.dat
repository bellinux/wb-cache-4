25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} (IUPAC name: <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonate)</b> is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula NaHCO3. It is a salt composed of sodium ions and bicarbonate ions. Sodium bicarbonate {{is a white}} solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of washing soda (sodium carbonate).

25|$|In a solid, {{only those}} {{particles}} {{that are at}} the surface can be involved in a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example, Sherbet (powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic acid (a weak organic acid) and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonate.</b> On contact with the saliva in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon dioxide and providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to control {{the rate at which the}} fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to create different effects. For example, finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected.|$|E

It is also formed when <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonate</b> is heated (calcined) e.g. in the final step of the Solvay process. The decahydrate is formed from water solutions crystallizing in the temperature range -2.1 to +32.0 C, the heptahydrate in the narrow range 32.0 to 35.4 C and above this temperature the monohydrate forms. In dry air the decahydrate and heptahydrate will lose water forming causing the crystals to fall apart into a white monohydrate powder. Other hydrates have been reported, e.g. with 2.5 units of water per sodium carbonate unit ("pentahemihydrate").|$|E

40|$|Hydroxyapatite is {{chemically}} {{related to}} the inorganic component of bone matrix as a complex structure with the formula of Ca 10 (OH) 2 (PO 4) 6. Previous studies have reported the application of microsized hydroxyapatite to bone regeneration, but the result is not satisfied. The limitation comes from the size of hydroxyapatite. In addition, the duration of treatment is very long. The advantages of hydroxyapatite nanocrystal are the osteoconduction, bioresorption, and contact in close distance. Crystal in osteoporotic bone is calcium phosphate hydroxide with the chemical formula of Ca 10 (OH) 2 (PO 4) 6. Crystal of normal bone is <b>sodium</b> calcium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>carbonate</b> phosphate hydrate with the chemical formula of Ca 8 H 2 (PO 4) 6 ·H 2 O–NaHCO 3 –H 2 O. The recent development is applying nanobiology approach to hydroxyapatite. This {{is based on the}} concept that the mineral atoms arranged in a crystal structure of hydroxyapatite can be substituted or incorporated by the other mineral atoms. In conclusion, the basic elements of hydroxyapatite crystals, composed of atomic minerals in a certain geometric pattern, and their relationship to the bone cell biological activity have opened opportunities for hydroxyapatite crystals supplement application on osteoporosis. Understanding of the characteristics of bone hydroxyapatite crystals as well as the behavior of mineral atom in the substitution will have a better impact on the management of osteoporosis...|$|R

Alfalfa plants grew healthily in heavy metals-contaminated soils (collected from molybdenum mine) for 30 days. The heavy metal content was determined by ICP-OES. In this paper, it was found that: the phytoextraction efficiency of alfalfa plants was enhanced after the <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures were added into soil. As usual, the phosphorus can promote plants to accumulate more biomass (increasing 0. 35 %- 24. 62 %) even if the availability of metals to extraction were increased by citric acid in the soil. With the treatment of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) values of alfalfa plants and the acid soluble fractions of heavy metals in soils were increased. The translocation factor (TF) values of all alfalfas in heavy metals were low, but the TF of As, Cr, Hg, Mo tended to increase with <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures.
