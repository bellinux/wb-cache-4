60|$|The old, old story, you say? Be it so; {{you will}} the more easily {{remember}} it. The Amienois remembered it so carefully, that, twelve hundred years afterwards, {{in the sixteenth}} century, they thought good to carve and paint the four stone pictures Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of our first choice photographs. (N. B.--This series is not yet arranged, but is distinct from that referred to in Chapter IV. <b>See</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>II.).</b> Scene 1st, St. Firmin arriving; scene 2nd, St. Firmin preaching; scene 3rd, St. Firmin baptizing; and scene 4th, St. Firmin beheaded, by an executioner with very red legs, and an attendant dog {{of the character of}} the dog in 'Faust,' of whom we may have more to say presently.|$|E
6000|$|In {{all cases}} in which such {{imitation}} is attempted, instant degradation to a still lower level is the result. For the effort to imitate shows that the workman has only a base and poor conception of {{the beauty of the}} reality--else he would know his task to be hopeless, and give it up at once; so that all endeavours to avoid conventionalism, when the material demands it, result from insensibility to truth, and are among the worst forms of vulgarity. Hence, in the greatest Greek statues, the hair is very slightly indicated--not because the sculptor disdained hair, but because he knew what it was too well to touch it insolently. I do not doubt but that the Greek painters drew hair exactly as Titian does. Modern attempts to produce finished pictures on glass result from the same base vulgarism. No man who knows what painting means, can endure a painted glass window which emulates painter's work. But he rejoices in a glowing mosaic of broken colour: for that is what the glass has the special gift and right of producing.

50|$|CSS General Sterling Price, often {{referred}} to as General Price or Price, was built as Laurent Millaudon, (or L. Millandon or Milledon) at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1856. She was acquired for Confederate service and fitted out at New Orleans, Louisiana, for the River Defense Fleet (<b>See</b> DANFS <b>appendix</b> <b>II)</b> and was renamed after the Confederate general Sterling Price. On 25 January 1862, Captain Montgomery began to convert her into a cottonclad ram by placing a 4-inch oak sheath with a 1-inch iron covering on her bow, and by installing double pine bulkheads filled with compressed cotton bales. (This evidently increased her displacement from the 483 tons specified for the Laurent Millaudon to the 633 tons specified for the General Price.) On 25 March, General Price commanded by Captain J. H. Townsend, sailed from New Orleans to Memphis, Tennessee, where she stayed until 10 April having her ironwork completed. She was then sent to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, where she operated in defense of the river approaches to Memphis.|$|R

30|$|The turbine {{consists}} of three blades with a length of 50 m. Each blade is modeled with the proposed enhanced 3 D solid. The revolute joint, providing connectivity between blades, is defined with two rigid bodies [23]. The interaction between flexible and rigid components doesn’t need any special requirements given that the rotational degrees of freedom appear in the rigid body formulation for the large displacement in a non-linear form [23]. The tower, which is 85 meters tall and with circular cross section, is modeled with geometrically exact beam [24] (see Fig.  11). The wind turbine blades are subjected to a uniform distributed load using follower pressure approach (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>II).</b> The blades facets where the loading is applied are defined with 4 nodes two-dimensional elements that belong to {{the boundaries of the}} three-dimensional 8 nodes brick elements of the blades.

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} why we do not as yet have any {{translation}} centers, not even in the planning stage, in which electronic computers, general or special purpose, are used to automate certain parts of the translation process, {{in spite of the fact}} that such centers would fulfill a vital function in saving a considerable amount of qualified human translator time per document translated, and thereby facilitate more, quicker and, after some time, cheaper translation, is the reluctance of many MT workers to recognize that the idea of inventing a method for fully automatic high quality translation (FAHQT) is just a dream which will not come true in the foreseeable future. By not realizing the practical futility of this aim, whatever its motivational importance for certain types of basic research, they have misled themselves and the agencies which sponsored their research into not being satisfied with a partly automated translation system whose principles are well understood today, and instead to wait for the real thing which was believed, and made to believe, to be just around the corner. During the past year I have repeatedly tried to point out the illusory character of the FAHQT ideal even in respect to mechanical determination of the syntactical structure of a given source-language sentence (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>II).</b> Here I shall show that there exist extremely simple sentences in English—and the same holds, I am sure, for any other natural language—which, within certai...|$|E
40|$|In the United States, thyroid cancer {{incidence}} (along with liver cancer) {{is increasing}} {{more rapidly than}} any other malignancy, rising nearly threefold from 1980 to 2006. Improved diagnosis has been proposed by some as the major reason for this change, while others contend that additional factors also account for the increase. Among U. S. states, 2001 – 2005 age-adjusted thyroid cancer incidence rates vary from 5. 4 to 12. 8 per 100, 000. County-specific incidence data, available for the first time, document that most U. S. counties with the highest thyroid cancer incidence are in a contiguous area of eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and southern New York State. Exposures to radioactive iodine emissions from 16 nuclear power reactors within a 90 -mile radius in this area indicate that these emissions are a likely etiological factor in rising thyroid cancer incidence rates. From 1980 to 2006, annual U. S. thyroid cancer incidence rose nearly threefold, from 4. 33 to 11. 03 cases per 100, 000, adjusted to the 2000 U. S. standard popu-lation. This increase has been steady, rising in 22 of 26 years, and has been most pronounced since the early 1990 s (1). Along with liver/bile duct cancer, the incidence of thyroid cancer has undergone the greatest increase of any type of malignancy (see Appendix I, p. 656). Temporal trends during this period were consistent for males, females, blacks, and whites (between + 137 % and + 181 %).

40|$|Associated {{with the}} {{outstanding}} {{development of the}} dairy industry in New Zealand over the years of this century has been {{the rapid growth of}} that section of dairying known as share-milking. The term 'share-miIking', in this country, applies to that type of dairy farm labour, the wages for which are based upon some proportion of the proceeds of the sale of farm produce. This general definition covers in New Zealand three principal systems of share-farming: (a) 'Quarter share-milking', where the farm owner supplies the land and capital (including the herd) and the share-milker supplies only the labour required for the milking and care of the stock. He does not do general farm maintenance except for added remuneration and received, at the time to which this study applies, 271 / 2 % of the proceeds of the sale of dairy products and half the proceeds of the by-products. (b) 'Third share-milking, where the farm owner supplies the land and capital (including the herd) and the share-milker provides the labour for, and does, the general farm maintenance in addition to the milking and care of the stock. His share of the receipts was (at the time to which this applies) 36 - 2 / 3 % of the dairy cheque and half the proceeds from the sale of by-products. (c) 'Half share-milking', where the farm owner supplies the land and fixed capital and the share-milker supplies the herd in addition to all the farm labour. He generally receives half the dairy cheque and half the proceeds from the sale of by-products. This division may be and often is, varied as there is no Statutory Regulation for this type of agreement. <b>See</b> <b>Appendix</b> <b>II</b> for the regulations covering the proportionate receipts and payments of each of the two parties under the first two types of agreement.
