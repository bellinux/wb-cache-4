25|$|A common way to {{get more}} {{quantitative}} information out of a mass spectrum {{is to create a}} <b>standard</b> <b>curve</b> to compare the sample to. This requires knowing what is to be quantitated ahead of time, having a standard available and designing the experiment specifically for this purpose. A more advanced variation on this is the use of an internal standard which behaves very similarly to the analyte. This is often an isotopically labeled version of the analyte. There are forms of mass spectrometry, such as accelerator mass spectrometry that are designed from the bottom up to be quantitative.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} for measuring mRNA abundance is RT-qPCR. In this technique, reverse transcription {{is followed by}} quantitative PCR. Reverse transcription first generates a DNA template from the mRNA; this single-stranded template is called cDNA. The cDNA template is then amplified in the quantitative step, during which the fluorescence emitted by labeled hybridization probes or intercalating dyes changes as the DNA amplification process progresses. With a carefully constructed <b>standard</b> <b>curve,</b> qPCR can produce an absolute measurement {{of the number of}} copies of original mRNA, typically in units of copies per nanolitre of homogenized tissue or copies per cell. qPCR is very sensitive (detection of a single mRNA molecule is theoretically possible), but can be expensive {{depending on the type of}} reporter used; fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes are more expensive than non-specific intercalating fluorescent dyes.|$|E
25|$|When {{multiple}} assays {{measure the}} same target their results and utility {{may or may}} not be comparable depending on the natures of the assay and their methodology, reliability etc. Such comparisons are possible through study of general quality attributes of the assays e.g. principles of measurement (including identification, amplification and detection), dynamic range of detection (usually the range of linearity of the <b>standard</b> <b>curve),</b> analytic sensitivity, functional sensitivity, analytic specificity, positive, negative predictive values, turn around time i.e. time taken to finish a whole cycle from the preanalytic steps till the end of the last post analytic step (report dispatch/transmission), throughput i.e. number of assays done per unit time (usually expressed as per hour) etc. Organizations or laboratories that perform Assays for professional purposes e.g. medical diagnosis and prognostics, environmental analysis, forensic proceeding, pharmaceutical research and development must undergo well regulated quality assurance procedures including method validation, regular calibration, analytical quality control, proficiency testing, test accreditation, test licensing and must document appropriate certifications from the relevant regulating bodies in order to establish the reliability of their assays, especially to remain legally acceptable and accountable for the quality of the assay results and also to convince customers to use their assay commercially/professionally.|$|E

2500|$|The {{absorbance}} of {{the light}} is the base 10 logarithm of {{the ratio of the}} Transmittance of the pure solvent to the transmittance of the sample, and so the two absorbance and transmittance can be interconverted. Either transmittance or absorbance can therefore be plotted versus concentration using measurements from the Spectronic 20. [...] Plotting a curve using percent transmittance of light yields an exponential curve. However, absorbance is linearly related to concentration, and so absorbance is often preferred for plotting a <b>standard</b> <b>curve.</b> This type of <b>standard</b> <b>curve</b> relates the concentration of the solution (on the x-axis) to measures of its absorbance (y-axis).|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} label and identify individual cells via fluorescent antibodies, cellular products such as cytokines, proteins, and other factors may also be measured as well. [...] Similar to ELISA sandwich assays, cytometric bead array (CBA) assays use multiple bead populations typically differentiated by size and different levels of fluorescence intensity to distinguish multiple analytes in a single assay. [...] The amount of the analyte captured is detected via a biotinylated antibody against a secondary epitope of the protein, followed by a streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin treatment. The fluorescent intensity of R-phycoerythrin on the beads is quantified on a flow cytometer equipped with a 488nm excitation source. [...] Concentrations of a protein of interest in the samples can be obtained by comparing the fluorescent signals to those of a <b>standard</b> <b>curve</b> generated from a serial dilution of a known concentration of the analyte.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Real-Time {{quantitative}} PCR is {{an important}} tool in research and clinical settings. Here, we describe two new approaches that broaden the scope of real-time quantitative PCR; namely, run-internal mini <b>standard</b> <b>curves</b> (RIMS) and direct real-time relative quantitative PCR (drqPCR). RIMS are an efficient alternative to traditional <b>standard</b> <b>curves</b> and provide both run-specific and target-specific estimates of PCR parameters. The drqPCR enables direct estimation of target ratios without reference to conventional control samples. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we compared RIMS-based drqPCR with classical quantifications based on external <b>standard</b> <b>curves</b> and the "comparative Ct method". Specifically, we used a raw real-time PCR dataset {{as the basis for}} more than two-and-a-half million simulated quantifications with various user-defined conditions. Compared with classical approaches, we found that RIMS-based drqPCR provided superior precision and comparable accuracy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The obviation of referencing to control samples is attractive whenever unpaired samples are quantified. This may be in clinical and research settings; for instance, studies on chimerism, TREC quantifications, copy number variations etc. Also, lab-to-lab comparability can be greatly simplified...|$|R
