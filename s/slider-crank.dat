The mechanism {{is used to}} transform rotational motion into translational motion {{by means of a}} rotating driving beam, a connection rod and a sliding body. In the present example, a flexible body is used for the connection rod. The sliding mass is not allowed to rotate and three revolute joints are used to connect the bodies.

25|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} (1,2) are represented by means of redundant coordinates, meaning that the coordinates are not independent. This can be exemplified by the <b>slider-crank</b> mechanism shown above, where each body has {{six degrees of freedom}} while most of the coordinates are dependent on the motion of the other bodies. For example, 18 coordinates and 17 constraints could be used to describe the motion of the <b>slider-crank</b> with rigid bodies. However, as there is only one degree of freedom, the equation of motion could be also represented by means of one equation and one degree of freedom, using e.g. the angle of the driving link as degree of freedom. The latter formulation has then the minimum number of coordinates in order to describe the motion of the system and can be thus called a minimal coordinates formulation. The transformation of redundant coordinates to minimal coordinates is sometimes cumbersome and only possible in the case of holonomic constraints and without kinematical loops. Several algorithms have been developed for the derivation of minimal coordinate {{equations of motion}}, to mention only the so-called recursive formulation. The resulting equations are easier to be solved because in the absence of constraint conditions, standard time integration methods can be used to integrate the equations of motion in time. While the reduced system might be solved more efficiently, the transformation of the coordinates might be computationally expensive. In very general multibody system formulations and software systems, redundant coordinates are used {{in order to make the}} systems user-friendly and flexible.|$|E

Different from the previous simplified model, in this paper, the double-tamper mechanism with two parallel <b>slider-cranks</b> is considered. According to the analysis of the structure and principle of the mechanism, and considering the size and mass distribution of each component, the inertia force balance optimization for the double vibrating mechanism is calculated. According to the results of optimization, the vibration experiments were carried out on real screed. The experimental results show that, the harmful inertial force produced by the dual tamping mechanism has been significantly reduced, and the stability of vibration can be effectively improved when screed paving.

40|$|Dragonflies achieve agile {{maneuverability}} by flapping four wings independently. Different phase angles {{between the}} flapping forewing and hindwing {{have been observed}} during various flight modes. The aerodynamic performance depends on phase angle control, as exemplified by an artificial flying ornithopter. Here, we present a dragonfly-like ornithopter whose phase angle was designed to {{vary according to the}} phase lag between the <b>slider-cranks</b> of the forewing and hindwing. Two microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) differential pressure sensors were attached to the center of both forewing and hindwing to evaluate the aerodynamic performance during flapping motions when the phase angle was changed. By varying the phase angle in both the tethered condition and free-flight, the performance of the forewing remained approximately constant, whereas that of the hindwing exhibited obvious variations; the maximum average value was two-fold higher than the minimum. The experimental results suggest that simple phase angle changes enable a flying ornithopter to control flight force balance without complex changes in the wing kinematics...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} years the {{extensions}} of standard rigid multibody theory to cope with flexible bodies is becoming of essential relevance in many application fields. This {{is due to the}} fact that current applications require high operational speed to be combined with light-weight properties in order to reach efficiency and energy saving during operation. The most common approach to represent flexibility is the Floating Frame of Reference (FFR). This approach, which is already implemented in several software packages, is identified by Wasfy and Noor [1] as the most efficient way to represent flexibility for bodies that undergo large gross motion but small elastic deformation. Inclusion of flexibility using the Finite Element (FE) approach within the FFR is possible but leads, for complex systems, to very high computational load due to the large number of Degrees of Freedom (DOF) included in the simulation. Standard model reduction techniques such as Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) can be used to reduce the number of DOFs by properly choosing a modal base that is able to model deformations within a certain frequency range [2]. Up to now, one of the main limitations of the model reduction techniques applied within a FFR, is the inability to efficiently represent systems that can be loaded in several DOFs during the simulation. For these types of systems the inclusion of static modes for each of the loaded DOFs is necessary for accurate results. In many applications, especially when sliding components or contacts are involved, (e. g. <b>slider-cranks,</b> gears, etc.) only few of the possibly loaded DOFs might be actually loaded during a specific time interval. The novel methodology analyzed in this paper proposes to reduce the computational cost by a proper choice of the static modal base, that is varied along the simulation. This methodology is referred to as Static Modes Switching [3] and although not improving the simulation accuracy, it can greatly reduce the computational time. The methodology is tested on a numerical experiment of limited complexity, though including most of the main numerical difficulties that are supposed to be encountered on more industrially relevant applications. Static Modes Switching numerically introduces discontinuities when varying the modal base during the simulation. This is overcome by time integration schemes exhibiting high-frequency numerical damping [4]. After a focus on the main results related to accuracy and computational efficiency, the peculiarities and limitations of the proposed approach are inspected and a full discussion on future investigations and possible solutions to open issues is adressed. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|When {{the stroke}} of a {{mechanism}} needs to be calculated, first identify the ground level for the specified <b>slider-crank</b> mechanism.

Once the pin positions are correctly placed, set a graphical compass to the given link length of the crank arm. Positioning the compass point on the pivot point of the crank arm, rotate the compass to produce a circle with radius equal {{to the length of}} the crank arm. This newly drawn circle represents the potential motion of the crank arm. Next, draw two models of the mechanism.

5000|$|An in-line crank slider is {{oriented}} {{in a way}} {{in which}} the pivot point of the crank is coincident with the axis of the linear movement. The follower arm, which is the link that connects the crank arm to the slider, connects to a pin in the center of sliding object. This pin is considered to be on the linear movement axis. Therefore, to be considered an in-line crank slider, the pivot point of the crank arm must be in-line with this pin point. The stroke (...) of an in-line crank slider is defined as the maximum linear distance the slider may travel between the two extreme points of its motion. With an in-line crank slider, the motion of the crank and follower links is symmetric about the sliding axis. This means that the crank angle required to execute a forward stroke is equivalent to the angle required to perform a reverse stroke. For this reason, the in-line <b>slider-crank</b> mechanism produces balanced motion. This balanced motion implies other ideas as well. Assuming the crank arm is driven at a constant velocity, {{the time it takes to}} perform a forward stroke is equal to the time it takes to perform a reverse stroke.|$|E

Moreover, {{the use of these}} mechanisms is quite common in robotic and mechatronic systems when complex motions are to be produced with rotational actuators. However, the velocity ratio of the <b>slider-crank</b> mechanism is configuration-dependent and thus, elaborate algorithms are required to precisely control its performance. In this thesis, a planar cam mechanism with an oscillating follower is proposed as a device that renders the velocity ratio of the <b>slider-crank</b> mechanism constant, an operation that is termed here velocity-ratio rectification; it is expected that the rectification will ease the feedback control of the <b>slider-crank</b> mechanism in mechatronic applications. A methodology for the optimization of this mechanism is developed. First, the performance of the <b>slider-crank</b> mechanism is analyzed and optimum geometric parameters are obtained. Then, an expression for the input-output relation of the cam mechanism at hand is derived, and the corresponding displacement program of the follower is produced. In addition, an approach for the optimization of planar cam mechanisms with an oscillating follower is introduced, to minimize the overall size, while maintaining an acceptable force-transmission performance based on bounds on the pressure angle. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed to allow for the above-mentioned optimization in an interactive mode; the GUI is successfully used in an example of the design of a reducer-rectifier cam mechanism that rectifies the velocity ratio of the actuator of a robotic quadruped...|$|E
