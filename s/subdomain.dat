Using this approach we detected heterodimers and also higher-ordered oligomeric complexes. Phosphorylated EGFR–p 185 c-neu heterodimeric forms were detected {{in the absence of}} EGF, but the species became highly phosphorylated after EGF stimulation. To evaluate heterodimer formation and additional transactivation by EGF, we {{investigated the}} roles of the four extracellular <b>subdomains</b> of p 185 c-neu and the EGFR. <b>Subdomains</b> I–IV of the EGFR dimerized with <b>subdomains</b> I–IV of p 185 c-neu, respectively, in a parallel manner.

25|$|Although {{restriction}} endonucleases {{show little}} sequence similarity, crystal structures reveal {{that they all}} share a highly similar α/β core consisting of a six-stranded β-sheet flanked by five α-helicies, two of which mediate dimerization. This core carries the active site (catalytic center) and the residues that contact DNA in the major groove. BglII is unique in that its α/β core is augmented by a β-sandwich <b>subdomain</b> that has several projections that extend outward to grip the DNA, allowing BglII to completely encircle the DNA molecule.

25|$|The DENV NS3 is a serine {{protease}}, {{as well as}} an RNA helicase and RTPase/NTPase. The protease domain {{consists of}} six β-strands arranged into two β-barrels formed by residues 1–180 of the protein. The catalytic triad (His-51, Asp-75 and Ser-135), is found between these two β-barrels, and activity is dependent on the presence of the NS2B cofactor. This cofactor wraps around the NS3 protease domain and becomes part of the active site. The remaining NS3 residues (180–618), form the three subdomains of the DENV helicase.

25|$|The {{domain name}} system {{supports}} wildcard DNS records which specify names that start with the asterisk label, '*', e.g., *.example.

The A record for a.x.example is needed to specify the mail exchanger IP address. As this has the result of excluding this domain name and its subdomains from the wildcard matches, an additional MX record for the <b>subdomain</b> a.x.example, {{as well as a}} wildcarded MX record for all of its subdomains, must also be defined in the DNS zone.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the use of the Nijmegen Clinical Screening Instrument (NCSI) and Short Form 36 (SF- 36) in {{providing}} a detailed assessment of health status of Q-fever patients and to evaluate which <b>subdomains</b> within the NCSI and SF- 36 measure unique aspects of health status. Findings: Patients received a study questionnaire, which contained the NCSI and SF- 36. Pearson correlation coefficients between <b>subdomains</b> of the instruments were calculated. The response rate was 94 % (309 out of 330 eligible patients). Intercorrelations between <b>subdomains</b> of the NCSI were generally lower than of the SF- 36. Four <b>subdomains</b> of the NCSI showed conceptual similarity (Pearson’s r[*]≥[*]. 70) with one or more <b>subdomains</b> of the SF- 36 and vice versa. <b>Subdomains</b> that showed no conceptual similarity were NCSI Subjective Pulmonary Symptoms, Subjective Impairment, Dyspnoea Emotions and Satisfaction Relations, and SF- 36 Social functioning, Bodily Pain, Role Physical and Role Emotional. Conclusions: Our results show that either the NCSI or SF- 36 can be used to measure health status in Q-fever patients. When the aim is to obtain a detailed overview of the patients’ health, a combination of the two instruments, consisting of the complete NCSI and the four unique <b>subdomains</b> of the SF- 36, is preferred.

The first <b>subdomain</b> created for a non-English Wikipedia was deutsche.wikipedia.com (created on Friday 16 March 2001, 01:38 UTC), followed after a few hours by Catalan.wikipedia.com (at 13:07 UTC).

The French Wikipedia was created on or around 11 May 2001, in a wave of new language versions that also included Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. These languages were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian. In September 2001, an announcement pledged commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia, notifying users of an upcoming roll-out of Wikipedias for all major languages, the establishment of core standards, and a push for the translation of core pages for the new wikis.

25|$|The ABC domain {{consists}} of two domains, the catalytic core domain similar to RecA-like motor ATPases and a smaller, structurally diverse α-helical <b>subdomain</b> that is unique to ABC transporters.

The helical domain consists {{of three or four}} helices and the ABC signature motif, also known as LSGGQ motif, linker peptide or C motif. The ABC domain also has a glutamine residue residing in a flexible loop called Q loop, lid or γ-phosphate switch, that connects the TMD and ABC. The Q loop is presumed {{to be involved in the}} interaction of the NBD and TMD, particularly in the coupling of nucleotide hydrolysis to the conformational changes of the TMD during substrate translocation. The H motif or switch region contains a highly conserved histidine residue that is also important in the interaction of the ABC domain with ATP. The name ATP-binding cassette is derived from the diagnostic arrangement of the folds or motifs of this class of proteins upon formation of the ATP sandwich and ATP hydrolysis.|$|E
