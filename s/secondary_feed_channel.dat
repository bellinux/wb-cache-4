40|$|Two {{kinds of}} newly {{designed}} <b>feed</b> <b>channels,</b> for example, a spiral and a serpentine <b>feed</b> <b>channels,</b> for a bench-scale nanofiltration module {{were developed to}} improve the filtration performance. The experiments were carried out with the modules using a commercial flat NF membrane to investigate the effects of Reynolds number (Re) and flow channel structures on the flux of permeate and Mg 2 + rejection. It was shown from the experimental results that although the effects of Reynolds number on fluxes were not obvious for the two new <b>feed</b> <b>channels</b> compared with a normal flow channel structure, the Mg 2 + rejections varied apparently with Re. The Mg 2 + rejections were almost {{the same for the}} modules with two new <b>feed</b> <b>channels</b> and larger than that for the module with normal <b>feed</b> <b>channel.</b> The numerical simulations of fluid flow in the three kinds of <b>feed</b> <b>channels</b> were completed at Re of 4800 to explain the phenomena. The results demonstrated that there was a secondary flow in both new <b>feed</b> <b>channels,</b> which strongly influences the Mg 2 + rejection. The rejection increased with increasing average shear stress at the membrane wall. The spiral <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> was the best one among the flow channel structures investigated...|$|R

40|$|Feed spacers and hydrodynamics {{have been}} found {{relevant}} {{for the impact of}} biofouling on performance in reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems. The objectives of this study on biofouling development were to determine the impact of (i) linear flow velocity and bacterial cell load, (ii) biomass location and (iii) various feed spacer geometries as applied in practice as well as a modified geometry spacer. A three-dimensional mathematical model for biofouling of <b>feed</b> spacer <b>channels</b> including hydrodynamics, solute mass transport and biofilm formation was developed in COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB software. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> pressure drop increase caused by biofilm formation can be reduced by using thicker and/or modified feed spacer geometry and/or a lower flow rate in the <b>feed</b> <b>channel.</b> The increase of <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> pressure drop by biomass accumulation is shown to be strongly influenced by the location of biomass. Results of numerical simulations are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data, indicating that this micro-scale mechanistic model is representative for practice. The developed model can help to understand better the biofouling process of spiral-wound RO and NF membrane systems and to develop strategies to reduce and control biofouling. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The use {{of optical}} {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) to investigate biomass in membrane systems has increased with time. OCT is able to characterize the biomass in-situ and non-destructively. In this study, a novel approach to process three-dimensional (3 D) OCT scans is proposed. The approach allows obtaining spatially-resolved detailed structural biomass information. The 3 D biomass reconstruction enables analysis of the biomass only, obtained by subtracting the time zero scan to all images. A 3 D time series analysis of biomass development in a spacer filled channel under representative conditions (cross flow velocity) for a spiral wound membrane element was performed. The flow cell was operated for five days with monitoring of ultrafiltration membrane performance: <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> pressure drop and permeate flux. The biomass development in the flow cell was detected by OCT before a performance decline was observed. <b>Feed</b> <b>channel</b> pressure drop continuously increased with increasing biomass volume, while flux decline was mainly affected in the initial phase of biomass accumulation. The novel OCT imaging approach enabled the assessment of spatial biomass distribution in the flow cell, discriminating the total biomass volume between the membrane, feed spacer and glass window.

Air ejected from an array of orifices impinges on the heated target surface The target plate forms the leading edge of a gas turbine blade cooled by jet impingement technique. The work includes the effect of jet Reynolds numbers and <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> aspect ratios (H/d = 5, 7, 9 where H= 2. 5, 3. 5, 4. 5 cm and d= 0. 5 cm) on the heat transfer characteristics for a given orifice jet plate configuration with equally spaced centered holes with outflow exiting in both directions (with inclined heated target surface). In general, It has been observed that, H/d= 9 gives the maximum heat transfer over {{the entire length of the}} target surface as compared to all <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> aspect ratios. H/d= 9 gives 3 % more heat transfer from the target surface as compared to H/d= 5 (for Re= 14400).

40|$|Constant flux {{performance}} in time is achieved with polyethersulfone (PES) polymeric microsieves when filtering protein solutions, skimmed milk and white beer {{in combination with}} backpulsing. Such microsieves are fabricated by phase separation micromolding (PSμM) and possess pores around 2 μm. The filtration of bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions at neutral pH results in constant flux when backpulsing. The constant flux performance {{is related to the}} ability of polymeric microsieves to flex during permeate pressure pulsing. Their flexibility allows pressure pulse transmission to the feed and, therefore, almost no flow reversal occurs. The membrane motion affects the hydrodynamics in the <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> and disturbs the polarization layer and the cake deposited. Reference experiments with stiff SixNy-based microsieves, nuclepore and macroporous microfiltration membranes show different behavior: the permeate pressure pulse hardly translates into the <b>feed</b> <b>channel.</b> Backpulsing for these membranes is less effect as anti-fouling strategy. Backpulsing of polymeric microsieves also allows stable flux operation for other complex feeds like skimmed milk and white Belgian beer...|$|R

In {{this study}} a microfiltration membrane {{was used in}} experiments to simulate fouling in spiral-wound reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membrane modules without the influence of concentration polarization. The resistance of a microfiltration membrane is {{much lower than the}} intrinsic biofilm resistance, enabling the detection of biofilm accumulation in an early stage. The impact of biofilm accumulation on the transmembrane (biofilm) resistance and <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> pressure drop {{as a function of the}} crossflow velocity (0. 05 and 0. 20 ms- 1) and feed spacer presence was studied in transparent membrane biofouling monitors operated at a permeate flux of 20 Lm- 2 h- 1. As biodegradable nutrient, acetate was dosed to the feed water (1. 0 and 0. 25 mgL- 1 carbon) to enhance biofilm accumulation in the monitors. The studies showed that biofilm formation caused an increased transmembrane resistance and <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> pressure drop. The effect was strongest at the highest crossflow velocity (0. 2 ms- 1) and in the presence of a feed spacer. Simulating conditions as currently applied in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis installations (crossflow velocity 0. 2 ms- 1 and standard feed spacer) showed that the impact of biofilm formation on performance, in terms of transmembrane and <b>feed</b> <b>channel</b> pressure drop, was strong. This emphasized the importance of hydrodynamics and feed spacer design. Biomass accumulation was related to the nutrient load (nutrient concentration and linear flow velocity). Reducing the nutrient concentration of the feed water enabled the application of higher crossflow velocities.
