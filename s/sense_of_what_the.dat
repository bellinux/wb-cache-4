Serventy, a scientist with the CSIRO, was the principal writer of the review report and he addressed both the need for a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> RAOU should be doing, and the structure that would allow it to do so. Although there was considerable vocal opposition to the reform proposals (including cutting the number of people on Council from an unwieldy forty to just nine) the report was ratified by Council in April 1969 and adopted at an Extraordinary General Meeting in June 1969, with the vote being over 80% in favour. Later that year came the first issue of the RAOU Newsletter, a publication that would evolve to become the magazine Wingspan.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{acceptance}} of Revelation into the canon has from the beginning been controversial, it has been essentially similar to the career of other texts. The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was heterodox, and what was even heretical. Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message. Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature (its purpose is offering hope to the downtrodden), and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary, and social context. Critics study the conventions of apocalyptic literature and events of the 1st century to make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> author may have intended.|$|E

The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends."

"Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

The TIMSS project looks back at the science that is commonly included in the curricula of the participating countries. It is thus not about established school science nor about innovations in it. PISA is highly innovative looking, prospectively forward to see how students can use their science learning in everyday life situations.

For the next 18 months, the company (now called the Borovansky Ballet) became the dance-chorus for two operettas and toured New Zealand a second time while also holding seasons of Coppélia and other favourites. The company was disbanded in 1948 due to lack of financial backing.|$|E

2500|$|Fayette Avery McKenzie was {{the first}} American {{sociologist}} to specialize in Indian affairs. McKenzie chose the American Indian people as {{the subject of his}} doctoral dissertation at the University of Pennsylvania, and decided to live among them [...] "long enough to get a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Indians problem in the concrete was." [...] In September 1903, McKenzie, then 32 years old, applied to the Indian Service and accepted a position as principal teacher at the Wind River Indian Reservation Boarding School at Fort Washakie, Wyoming. In his position as Principal Teacher on the Wind River Boarding School, shared by the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes, McKenzie oversaw instruction of approximately 170 Indian children and taught the most advanced students reading, writing, and arithmetic. As was often the case at Indian boarding schools, teachers performed several functions outside the classroom, and in addition to his teaching and supervisory responsibilities, McKenzie played the organ and piano at chapel and church services, led a band, occasionally supervised the dining hall and fed the school's chickens. By all accounts, McKenzie was well liked by both students and faculty. McKenzie's observations and experience at Wind River provided important information for his dissertation and a new approach toward addressing the Indian problem. At Wind River Reservation, McKenzie began a lifelong association Rev. Sherman Coolidge, an Arapaho Episcopalian priest and missionary. McKenzie often invited Rev. Coolidge and Dr. Charles Eastman to lecture in his classes at Ohio State University and at public events. They also shared their ideas about forming the first national association run by Indians for Indians.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Book of Song, a Chinese emperor {{appointed}} five {{kings of}} Wa {{to the position}} of ruler of Silla in 421, but what is confusing is that Japan wielded influence over {{the southern part of the}} Korean peninsula through the remote region according to the Nihon Shoki. In addition, the book of Song and the book of Sui can not be possible because many of the states considered to be Japan's vassal such as Chinhan and Mahan did not exist in the same time period as the vassal king of Yamato. In addition, the Book of Song was incomplete with missing volumes and filled in centuries later in a biased manner for political reasons.　Also, Silla did not have official contact with the Song/Sui until the 6th century making this 4th to 5th century statement impossible. [...] "As Egami (1964) notes, it may look very strange that the names of six or seven states listed in the self-claimed titles included Chin-han and Ma-han which had preceded, respectively, the states of Silla and Paekche. Perhaps the King of Wa had included the names of six or seven south Korean states in his title merely to boast of the extent of his rule. But Wa Kings could not have included the names of nonexistent states." [...] Other historians also dispute Japan's theory, claiming there is no evidence of Japanese rule in Gaya or any other part of Korea. Another problem with the book of Song and book of Sui is that many of the volumes of the books were missing and re-written later in a biased manner. It is difficult to make any <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> relationship was like in the past.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside {{the release}} of the third {{trailers}} were domestic and international release posters.

[...] Dan Auty for GameSpot called it a [...] "star studded hot mess", while Vanity Fairs Katey Rich felt the poster was [...] "too bogged down by the many different threads of the Marvel universe to highlight anything that's made Spider-Man: Homecoming seem special so far." [...] Adlakha felt the posters released for the film [...] "have been alright thus far, but these ones probably tell general audiences to expect a very bloated movie." [...] Adlakha was more positive of the international poster, which he felt was more [...] "comicbook-y" [...] and [...] "looks like it could be an actual scene from the film." [...] Both Rich and Adlakha criticized the fact that Holland, Keaton and Downey appeared twice on the domestic poster, {{both in and out of}} costume. Sony partnered with ESPN CreativeWorks to create cross-promotional television ads for Homecoming and the 2017 NBA Finals, which were filmed by Watts. The ads were made to [...] "weave in a highlight from the game just moments" [...] after it occurred. The promos see Holland, Downey Jr., and Favreau reprise their roles from the film, with cameo appearances from Stan Lee, DJ Khaled, Tim Duncan, Magic Johnson, and Cari Champion.

2500|$|Chester's {{character}} had no surname until Baer ad libbed [...] "Proudfoot" [...] {{during an}} early rehearsal. Initial Gunsmoke scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by [...] "Townsman". Again, Conrad's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{program would be}} supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as [...] "W" [...] in the June 15, 1958 episode [...] "Old Flame", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958 episode [...] "Marshal Proudfoot", it is revealed that his middle name, as are his 10 siblings, is Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's [...] "assistant", but in the December 13, 1952, episode [...] "Post Martin", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode [...] "Hank Prine" [...] (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his [...] "deputy" [...] stating [...] "Chester is not my deputy", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies ("Never Pester Chester"), Dillon allows that Chester {{was the only person}} he could trust. The TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver who went on to star in the NBC Mystery Movie rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch - McCloud in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7", this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season 2, episode 25 tells us that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War. Not long ago but long enough that he would have learned to live with the limp and virtually forget it.|$|E
