500|$|Plantinga {{refers to}} the first {{statement}} as [...] "Leibniz's lapse" [...] as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz. The second proposition is more contentious. Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom. Although it would contradict a creature's freedom if God were to cause, or in Plantinga's terms strongly actualize, a world where creatures only do good, an omniscient God would <b>still</b> <b>know</b> {{the circumstances under which}} creatures would go wrong. Thus, God could avoid creating such circumstances, thereby weakly actualizing a world with only moral good. Plantinga's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from [...] "transworld depravity".|$|E
500|$|The exact {{period of}} {{building}} this complex {{is not very}} clear. It is a puzzle as there are no epigraphic records that ascribe any date for its construction. Considering the huge size of the structures {{it was believed that}} the temple was built under major rulers of the area and was not the work of any local chieftains. The area around the temple complex was also known to have many caves and relics indicating large settlements. It has been established by reasoning that during the 8th century kings of Jalandhar moved to Masroor from the plains (plains of present-day Punjab) and established their capital here. This is substantiated {{by the fact that the}} Gaddis of the lower Kangra district <b>still</b> <b>know</b> this place as Jalandhara or Jalandhars. Further evidence to substantiate this dating is that the Elephant temples (600–800) near Mumbai in Maharashtra depict similar architectural features as the rock-cut temples. The incomplete rock formations seen in the complex indicate that the temples were left unfinished as the capital of Jalandhara was moved to the more secure Kangra fort. The architectural features also suggested the period of [...] "Gupta classicism" [...] thus placing its date to the 8th century. A particular feature of note is the similarity the complex has with the Angkor Wat in Cambodia, a much larger edifice of a later period of the 12th century. This comparison has opened up an issue of further historical research on the aspect of any [...] "regional inter dependencies or cultural exchange as a catalyst in the construction of both the temple complexes".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was not void of criticism. Although Richard Corliss of Time thoroughly enjoyed the film, {{he felt that}} too much {{emphasis was placed on}} Flynn Rider and not enough on Rapunzel. Corliss questioned the future of Disney's animated heroines, writing, [...] "For 60 years ... girls were the focal characters who could be expected to come of age, triumph over adversity and, in general, man up," [...] and accused various film studios of [...] "abolish female-centered stories." [...] Variety's Justin Chang described Rapunzel as a [...] "bland, plastic" [...] heroine, likening her to a Barbie doll. Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out described Rapunzel as [...] "bland". James Berardinelli of ReelViews was fairly mixed in his review, writing, [...] "although likeable and energetic, [...] is not as memorable as Snow White, Ariel, or Belle." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out described the character as [...] "synthetic". He wrote, [...] "you never feel like you're watching a girl on the empowering cusp of adulthood so much as a selection of attitudes compiled through demographic study." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn panned the character, describing her as [...] "bland and Valley Girlish". Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined, [...] "when the big-eyed heroine tries to tug at our heartstrings and Flynn turns into Prince Charming, the too-familiar hero-and-damsel motif feels like a fashion faux-pas." [...] Similarly, the SouthtownStars Jake Coyle wrote, [...] "Both Rapunzel and Flynn too much resemble Barbie and Ken, lacking both superficial and emotional individuality." [...] Jen Yamato of Movies.com criticized Disney for [...] "failing to give Rapunzel a backbone and retreading ground so familiar you can fall asleep for ten minutes and <b>still</b> <b>know</b> exactly what happened".|$|E

Nick recorded his new record at my studio, and then he was going to drop off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.'

2500|$|In June 1998, Norwood {{released}} her second album Never Say Never. Boosted {{by the success}} of its number-one lead single [...] "The Boy Is Mine", a duet with singer Monica, it facilitated Norwood in becoming a viable recording artist with media–crossing appeal. In total, the album sold 16 million copies worldwide and spawned seven singles, including Norwood's second number-one song, the Diane Warren-penned [...] "Have You Ever?". Also in 1998, Norwood made her big screen debut in a supporting role in the slasher sequel, I <b>Still</b> <b>Know</b> What You Did Last Summer, which garnered her both a Blockbuster Entertainment Award and an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Female Performance. The following year, she co-starred with Diana Ross in the telefilm drama Double Platinum about an intense, strained relationship between a mother and daughter.

2500|$|After {{backing out}} of a role in F.

The movie outperformed the original {{with a total of}} $16.5 million at its opening weekend, but critical reaction to the film was largely disappointing, with film review site Rotten Tomatoes calculating a poor rating of 7% based on 46 reviews. Norwood, however, earned positive reviews for her [...] "bouncy" [...] performance, which garnered her both a Blockbuster Entertainment Award and an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Female Performance. In 1999, she co-starred with Diana Ross in the telefilm drama Double Platinum about an intense, strained relationship between a mother and daughter.
