2500|$|Due to the {{strongly}} {{alkaline reaction}} conditions, aldehydes that have alpha hydrogen atom(s) instead undergo deprotonation there, leading to enolates and possible aldol reactions. Under ideal conditions the reaction produces only 50% of the alcohol and the carboxylic acid (it takes two aldehydes to produce one acid and one alcohol). [...] To avoid the low yields, {{it is more}} common to conduct the crossed Cannizzaro reaction, in which a sacrificial aldehyde is used in combination with a more valuable chemical. In this variation, the reductant is formaldehyde, which is oxidized to <b>sodium</b> <b>formate</b> and the other aldehyde chemical is reduced to the alcohol. In this scenario, {{each of the two}} separate aldehydes can be converted completely to its corresponding product rather than losing 50% of a single reactant to each of two different products. Thus, the yield of the valuable chemical is high, although the atom economy is still low.|$|E
5000|$|The {{high density}} of the caesium formate brine (up to 2.3 g·cm−3, or 19.2 pounds per gallon), coupled with the {{relatively}} benign nature of most caesium compounds, reduces the requirement for toxic high-density suspended solids in the drilling fluid—a significant technological, engineering and environmental advantage. Unlike the components of many other heavy liquids, caesium formate is relatively environment-friendly. Caesium formate brine can be blended with potassium and <b>sodium</b> <b>formates</b> to decrease the {{density of the}} fluids to that of water (1.0 g·cm−3, or 8.3 pounds per gallon). Furthermore, it is biodegradable and may be recycled, which is important in view of its high cost (about $4,000 per barrel in 2001). Alkali formates are safe to handle and do not damage the producing formation or downhole metals as corrosive alternative, high-density brines (such as zinc bromide [...] solutions) sometimes do; they also require less cleanup and reduce disposal costs.|$|R

In this study, the reaction kinetics of sodium carbonate hydrolysis are examined and a reaction model is developed.

30|$|Actually, {{numerous}} organic, inorganic and bioorganic fuels {{have been}} studied for using in DLFC such as methanol, ethanol, glycerol, formic acid, <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> borohydride, hydrazine, ascorbic acid and glucose. Nevertheless, among these fuels, formic acid have being considered the best one considering its theoretical electromotive force, less toxicity and low crossover [10, 12, 13, 14], Pt being the most active catalysts for its decomposition [15]. However, DLFC using formic acid has several engineering challenges such as: (i) the oxidation reactions are kinetically sluggish in acid media; (ii) the catalysts are susceptible to be poisoned and (iii) {{the environment of the}} fuel cell is corrosive [12, 16].|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of sodium molybdate and <b>sodium</b> tungstate on <b>formate</b> dehydrogenase activity was studied in H 2 -CO 2 -grown cultures of Methanobacterium formicicum. Depletion of molybdate from the growth medium {{resulted in a}} 75 -fold decrease of intracellular molybdenum and a 35 -fold decrease in enzyme activity; however, growth rate and cell yields were not influenced. By using an indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay, the amount of formate dehydrogenase approximated 3 % of the total protein in cells grown {{in the presence of}} molybdate. Molybdenum-starved cells contained approximately 15 -fold less formate dehydrogenase protein; Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed that both subunits of the enzyme were synthesized. Molybdenum starvation resulted in an increase in the amount of mRNA that hybridized to fdh-specific DNA. The results indicated an inverse relationship between the amount of transcript and the amount of formate dehydrogenase protein detected in response to molybdenum starvation. The addition of 1 mM tungstate to molybdate-containing media resulted in nearly complete loss of enzyme activity and decreased the intracellular concentration of molybdenum 10 -fold. Cells grown in the presence of tungstate synthesized high amounts of inactive formate dehydrogenase and contained mRNA that hybridized to fdh-specific DNA in amounts similar to that in cells grown with sufficient molybdate. Inactive formate dehydrogenase, purified from cells grown in the presence of tungstate, had the same subunit composition and contained amounts of molybdopterin cofactor, albeit metal-free, comparable to those in the active enzyme...|$|R

The purified enzyme was determined to consist of six subunits (65, 33, 28, 23, 21 and 18 kDa), similar to hydrogenase- 3 from Escherichia coli, and therefore it was named Hyd 3. The enzyme displayed remarkable oxygen tolerance. For the purified enzyme, 50 % maximal activity was maintained following incubation for 24 h in air at room temperature. The hydrogenase gene cluster (hyc) was cloned and found to consist of hycD, hycE, hycF, hycdG, hycH and hycI genes. hycE and hycG genes encode for the large and small subunit of the hydrogenase, respectively. A hycE gene deletion mutant, Delta hycE, was constructed for elucidating the function of the hyc-operon in hydrogen metabolism. Compared with the wild type strain HP 1, the mutant strain showed a dramatic decrease in hydrogen production in the presence of <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> pyruvate and glucose under O(2) -stressed conditions, while substantial activity was detected under anaerobic conditions. This strongly suggests that K. oxytoca HP 1 carries a number of hydrogenases or hydrogen metabolic pathways independently of Hyd 3. However, Hyd 3 is the main factor responsible for hydrogen production under O(2) stress conditions. (C) 2010 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Exposure of DNA {{to several}} {{proteins}} peroxidized by radiation-generated hydroxyl free radicals resulted in formation of crosslinks between the macromolecules, detected by retardation and broadening of DNA bands in agarose gels. This technique proved {{suitable for the}} study of crosslinking of DNA with peroxidized BSA, insulin, apotransferrin and alpha casein, but not with several other proteins, including histones. The crosslinking depended on the presence of intact hydroperoxide groups on the protein, on their number, and on the duration of the interaction with DNA. All DNA samples tested, pBR 322, pGEM, lambda/HindIII and pUC 18, formed crosslinks with the peroxidized BSA. <b>Sodium</b> chloride and <b>formate</b> prevented the crosslinking if present during incubation of the peroxidized protein and DNA, but had no effect once the crosslinks had formed. The gel shift of the crosslinked DNA was reversed by proteolysis, indicating that the DNA mobility change was due to attachment of protein and that the crosslinking did not induce DNA strand breaks. The metal chelators Desferal and neocuproine reduced the extent of the crosslinking, but did not prevent it. Scavengers of free radicals did not inhibit the crosslink formation. The DNA-protein complex was not disrupted by vigorous agitation, by filtration or by non-ionic detergents. These observations show that the crosslinking of DNA with proteins mediated by protein hydroperoxides is spontaneous and probably covalent, and that it may be assisted by transition metals. It is suggested that formation of such crosslinks in living organisms could account for some of the well-documented forms of biological damage induced by reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} formic acid and four {{alternative}} additives on silage fermentation, in-silo DM losses and aerobic stability were compared {{in an experiment}} using both difficultto- ensile (DIFF) and easier-to-ensile (EASI) herbages. Both were ensiled in laboratory silos with either no additive or following the application of formic acid (FA; 850 g/kg) at 3 mL/kg herbage, Add-SaFeR® (ATF 1) and GrasAAT® (ATF 2), both based on ammonium tetraformate, at 4 mL/kg herbage, an antimicrobial mixture (MIX; potassium <b>formate,</b> <b>sodium</b> disulfite and sodium benzoate) at 3 g/kg herbage, or Ecosyl (LAB; Lactobacillus plantarum) at 3 mL/kg herbage. There were four replicates per treatment and the silos were stored for 132 days. DIFF silage made without additive was poorly fermented. All additives increased the extent and improved the direction of DIFF silage fermentation, and reduced in-silo losses. However, MIX did not reduce butyric acid concentration and increased the extent of aerobic deterioration. LAB had a smaller effect on fermentation and in-silo losses than FA. With EASI silages, all additives restricted the extent of fermentation and improved fermentation quality, with the latter effect being smaller than for DIFF silages. LAB promoted a particularly homolactic fermentation but subsequently increased aerobic deterioration. In both DIFF and EASI silages additive treatment improved in vitro digestibility. It is concluded that only ATF 1, ATF 2 and MIX were as effective as FA at improving silage preservation and reducing in-silo losses with both DIFF and EASI herbages. However, ATF 1 and ATF 2 were superior in reducing the apparent extent of proteolysis and MIX was slightly less effective at reducing the activity of saccharolytic Clostridia. peer-reviewe...|$|R
