40|$|Emissions {{of diesel}} engines contain some components, which support the {{generation}} of smog and which are classified hazardous. Exhaust gas aftertreatment is a powerful tool to reduce the NOx and Particulate emissions. The NOx-emission can be reduced by the SCR technology. <b>SCR</b> stands for <b>Selective</b> <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Reduction.</b> A reduction agent has to be injected into the exhaust upstream of a catalyst. On the catalyst the NOx is reduced to N 2 (Nitrogen) and H 2 O (Water). This catalytic process was developed in Japan about 30 years ago to reduce the NOx emission of coal-fired power plants. The first reduction agent used was anhydrous ammonia (NH 3). SCR technology was used with diesel engines starting mid of the 80 s. First applications were stationary operating generator-sets. In 1991 a joint development between DaimlerChrysler, MAN, IVECO and Siemens was started to use SCR technology for the reduction of heavy duty trucks. Several fleet tests demonstrated the durability of the systems. To day, SCR technology is the most promising technology to fulfill the new European Regulations EURO 4 and EURO 5 being effective Oct. 2005 and Oct. 2008. The efficient NOx reduction of the catalyst allows an engine calibration for low fuel consumption. DaimlerChrysler {{decided to use the}} SCR technology on every heavy duty truck and bus in Europe and many other truck manufacturers will introduce SCR technology to fulfill the 2005 emission regulation. The truck manufacturers in Europe agreed to use aqueous solution of Urea as reducing agent. The product is called AdBlue. AdBlue is a non toxic, non smelling liquid. The consumption is about 5 % of the diesel fuel consumption to reduce the NOx emissions. A small AdBlue tank has to be installed to the vehicle. With an electronically controlled dosing system the AdBlue is injected into the exhaust. The dosing system is simple and durable. It has proven its durability during winter and summer testing as well as in fleet tests. The infrastructure for AdBlue is under evaluation in Europe by Urea Producers and Mineral Oil companies to be readily available in time.

By altering the NO 2 /NOX ratio, the reaction proceeds in the fast <b>selective</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>reduction</b> reaction regime, which is especially beneficial at low and transient temperatures and in combination with SO 2 and H 2 O.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{size of the}} {{car fleet}} makes it important {{to find ways of}} lowering the amounts of pollutants from each individual diesel or gasoline engine to almost zero levels. The pollutants from these engines predominantly originate from emissions at cold start, in the case when gasoline is utilized, and high NOx emissions and particulates from diesel engines. The cold start emissions from gasoline vehicles are primarily due to a high light-off time for the catalytic converter. Another reason is the inability to quickly heat the sensor used for controlling the air-to-fuel ratio in the exhausts, also called the lambda value, which is required to be in a particular range for the catalytic converter to work properly. This problem may be solved utilizing another, more robust sensor for this purpose.

A special attention is put on the conditions of powder catalyst deposition on the grids for TEM analysis. When the deposition is conducted through conventional suspension in ethanol (EtOH) then drying, numerous Ag nanoparticles with sizes between 2 and 10 nm are observed in the micrographs of calcined Ag/Al 2 O 3. This drastically contrasts with the absence of particle after dry deposition, silver being then well dispersed all over the alumina support, as can be seen by combined STEM/EDS mapping. These distinct observations are straightforwardly attributable to the reducing effect of ethanol towards Ag species that is also identified by UV-visible spectroscopy. The results highlight the importance, for correctness of TEM interpretations, of avoiding any contact between an alcohol solvent and Ag-oxide catalysts in the course of TEM studies, in contrast to experimental conditions that are still often applied nowadays.

The DRIFT spectroscopy showed that SO 2 could be adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} catalyst as the bidentate mononuclear sulfate. This type of sulfate would retard the formation of NO complex on the surface of catalyst, resulting in the decrease of NO adsorption. For NH 3 adsorption, the adsorption of SO 2 had little effect on the coordinated NH 3, but would increase the amount of NH 4 + because of the formation of new Brønsted acid sites. Therefore, besides the deposition of ammonium sulfates, the competitive adsorption between SO 2 and NO on the active sites of the catalysts also contributed to the poisoning effect of SO 2 on the SCR reaction.

40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} NOX {{conversion}} over a <b>SCR</b> (<b>selective</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>reduction)</b> catalyst, the DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst) is usually placed upstream of the SCR catalyst {{to enhance the}} fast SCR reaction (4 NH 3 + 2 NO + 2 NO 2 → 4 N 2 + 6 H 2 O) using equimolar amounts of NO and NO 2. Here, a ratio of NO 2 /NOX above 50 % should be avoided, because the reaction with NO 2 only (4 NH 3 + 4 NO + O 2 → 4 N 2 + 6 H 2 O) is slower than the standard SCR reaction (4 NH 3 + 4 NO + O 2 → 4 N 2 + 6 H 2 O). In order to accurately predict the performance characteristics of SCR catalysts, it is therefore desired to develop a more simple and reliable mathematical and kinetic models on the oxidation kinetics of nitric oxide over a DOC. In the present work, the prediction accuracy and limit of three different chemical reaction kinetics models are presented to describe the chemicophysical characteristics and conversion performance of DOCs. Steady-state experiments with DOCs mounted on a light-duty four-cylinder 2. 0 -L turbocharged diesel engine then are performed, using an engine-dynamometer system to calibrate the kinetic parameters such as activation energies and preexponential factors of heterogeneous reactions.

40|$|A {{real-time}} zero-dimensional diagnostic combustion {{model has}} been developed and assessed to evaluate in-cylinder temperatures, HRR (heat release rate) and NOx (nitrogen oxides) in DI (Direct Injection) diesel engines under steady state and transient conditions. The approach requires very little computational time, that is, {{of the order of}} a few milliseconds, and is therefore suitable for real-time applications. It could, for example, be implemented in an ECU (Engine Control Unit) for the on-board diagnostics of combustion and emission formation processes, or it could be integrated in acquisition software installed on an engine test bench for indicated analysis. The model could also be used for post-processing analysis of previously acquired experimental data. The methodology is based on a three-zone thermodynamic model: the combustion chamber is divided into a fuel zone, an unburned gas zone and a stoichiometric burned gas zone, to which the energy and mass conservation equations are applied. The main novelty of the proposed method is that the equations can be solved in closed form, thus making the approach suitable for real-time applications. The evaluation of the temperature of burned gases allows the in-cylinder NOx concentration to be calculated, on the basis of prompt and Zeldovich thermal mechanisms. The procedure also takes into account the NOx level in the intake charge, and is therefore suitable for engines equipped with traditional short-route EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) systems, and engines equipped with <b>SCR</b> (<b>Selective</b> <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Reduction)</b> and long-route EGR systems.

The highest particle concentrations were 1. 5 × 10 6 and 1. 6 × 10 5 cm − 3 in Helsinki and Turku, respectively, and the particle number size distributions had two modes. The dominating mode peaked at 20 – 30 nm, and the accumulation mode at 80 – 100 nm. The majority of the particle mass was volatile, since after heating the sample to 265 °C, the particle volume of the studied ship decreased by around 70 %. The emission factors for NO x varied in the range of 25 – 100 g (kg fuel) − 1, for SO 2 in the range of 2. 5 – 17. 0 g (kg fuel) − 1, for particle number in the range of (0. 32 – 2. 26) × 10 16 # (kg fuel) − 1, and for PM 2. 5 between 1. 0 – 4. 9 g (kg fuel) − 1.

40|$|In {{the last}} couple of decades, {{countries}} have enacted new laws concerning environmental pollution caused by heavy-duty commercial and passenger vehicles. This is done mainly in an effort to reduce smog and health impacts caused by the different pollutions. One of the legislated pollutions, among a wide range of regulated pollutions, is nitrogen oxides (commonly abbreviated as NOx). The <b>SCR</b> (<b>Selective</b> <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Reduction)</b> was introduced in the automotive industry to reduce NOx emissions leaving the vehicle. The basic idea is to inject a urea solution (AdBlue™) in the exhaust gas before the gas enters the catalyst. The optimal working temperature for the catalyst is somewhere in the range of 300 to 400 °C. For the reactions to occur without a catalyst, the gas temperature has to be at least 800 °C. These temperatures only occur in the engine cylinder itself, during and after the combustion. In this paper a study is presented where a second injector is installed in a Scania D 13 cylinder head for urea injection purposes. Additionally, a crank angle resolved in-cycle NOx formation model is utilized to calculate the urea injection duration for each individual injection event. A gas temperature model based on the cylinder pressure is also used to decide the timing of the urea injection, although always occurring after the combustion and during the expansion stroke. A parameter sweep is conducted to evaluate the concept where also an SCR-catalyst has been introduced to the engine system. The parameter sweep done in the study contains sweeps of engine speed, rail pressure, engine load, EGR levels and timing of the urea injection (by changing the gas temperature limit at which the injection of urea is initiated). The engine tested is a modified single cylinder Scania D 13 engine, rebuilt from a six-cylinder engine.

40|$|This {{report is}} a sum {{of a master}} thesis carried out at Lulekraft AB, with the purpose to size a flue gas {{recirculation}} (FGR) system. The goals were to decrease the amount of NO$_x$ in the flue gases, to minimize the fluctations of {{the temperature of the}} steam in the super heaters and to investigate how the efficiency changes with implemented FGR. There are numerous methods for reduction of NOx emissions well described in the litterature, both from modifications of the burners and from methods reagarding the flue gas path. Modifications in the flue gas path can be e. g. FGR or <b>SCR</b> (<b>selective</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>reduction).</b> Burner modifications can be e. g. flame less combustion or staging combustion. When air is used as heat carrier the temperature fluctuates when the operator is switching fuel. With implemented FGR the fluctations can be minimized with respect to the specific heat capacity. That is higher for the flue gases as a heat carrier than that for air. This leads to higher power output with shorter time for heating up the steam as a result, compared to air as heat carrier. Results show that the adiabatic flame temperature decreases with higher flow of FGR, but also with higher flow of the extra supplied air. The difference can be explained as follows: For FGR the O 2 concentration in the flue gases is constant, while for the extra supplied air the O 2 concentration increases. With a decreased flame temperature the emissions of thermal NOx will be reduced, {{due to the fact that}} thermal NOx is approximately exponentially dependent of the flame temperature. Results also show that the efficiency increases with implemented FGR. This is because that it is possible to increase the power input in the water/steam cycle. The flue gas temperature difference, along the flue gas path, between FGR and supplied extra air can be neglected. This justifies the increased power input in the water/steam-cycle. The efficiency when extra air is supplied is 76. 3 %, and with FGR the efficiency is 82. 5 %. Validerat; 20150216 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
