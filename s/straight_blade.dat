5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of <b>straight</b> <b>blade.</b> Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} shapes of Ming knife are found. The first, presumably the earlier, is curved like the pointed tip knives. The second has a <b>straight</b> <b>blade</b> {{and often a}} pronounced angled bend in the middle. This shape is known as 磬 qing, a chime stone. Their alloy contains around 40% copper; they weigh around 16grams.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two basic}} classifications of NEMA connectors: {{straight-blade}} and locking. The metal conductive blades are often informally called [...] "prongs" [...] (as in [...] "3-prong plug"). Numbers prefixed by 'L' are curved-blade, twist-locking connectors; others without a leading 'L' are <b>straight</b> <b>blade</b> and non-locking. Twist-locking types are used for heavy industrial and commercial equipment, where increased protection against accidental disconnection is required.|$|E

50|$|The rhomphaia's <b>blade</b> was <b>straight</b> or only {{slightly}} curved, while the falx's blade was significantly curved. Because its <b>straighter</b> <b>blade</b> facilitated a thrusting motion, {{as well as}} an overhead or sidewards hacking motion, the rhomphaia could be used by tightly packed troops as a defensive weapon. However, the <b>straighter</b> <b>blade</b> limited the use of the cutting edge.|$|R

2500|$|The cut-and-thrust {{mortuary}} sword {{was used}} after [...] 1625 [...] by cavalry during the English Civil War. This (usually) two-edged sword sported a half-basket hilt with a <b>straight</b> <b>blade</b> some 90–105cm long. Later in the 17th century, the swords used by cavalry became predominantly single-edged. The so-called walloon sword (épée wallone) was common in [...] the Thirty Years' War and Baroque era. Its hilt was ambidextrous with shell-guards and knuckle-bow that inspired 18th century continental hunting hangers. [...] Following their {{campaign in the}} Netherlands in 1672, the French began producing this weapon as their first regulation sword. Weapons of this design were also issued to the Swedish army {{from the time of}} Gustavus Adolphus until as late as the 1850s.|$|E
2500|$|Technically the 1796 heavy cavalry sword was a backsword, {{that is a}} sword with a <b>straight</b> <b>blade</b> {{with one}} cutting edge and the {{opposite}} edge of the blade (the [...] "back") thickened {{for most of its}} length to give added strength. The blade was [...] in length, with a single broad fuller each side. The grip was of ribbed wood, or wood bound with cord to resemble the same, and covered in leather. The iron backpiece of the grip had ears which were riveted through the tang of the blade to give the hilt and blade a very secure connection. The hilt combined a disc guard pierced with 2 semicircular and 6 oval (never circular) holes, with single knucklebow and two slim [...] long langets (projections from the guard, which gripped the throat of the scabbard) extending {{from the front of the}} guard. The langets were often removed and the left side of the guard ground away so as to reduce wear to uniforms. The latter modification would also have made it more comfortable to wear, especially on horseback.|$|E

50|$|Bicycle forks {{usually have}} an offset, or rake (not to be {{confused}} with a different use of the word rake in the motorcycle world), that places the fork ends forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving the <b>blades</b> forward, angling <b>straight</b> <b>blades</b> forward, or by placing the fork ends forward of the centerline of the blades. The latter is used in suspension forks that must have <b>straight</b> <b>blades</b> in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved fork blades can also provide some shock absorption.|$|R

60|$|Amadu, who {{recognized}} this, also was vigilant, and swept the cane {{on either side}} with searching eyes. He endeavored to persuade his master to travel in his hammock; but unavailingly. Therefore he carried the long Snider rifle with its breech well covered by his arm, and felt at times with wet fingers for the hilt of the short, <b>straight</b> <b>blade,</b> which hung at his side. He was a tolerable shot, but {{like most of the}} Moslem tribesmen deadly with the steel.|$|E
60|$|He {{led the way}} {{accordingly}} to {{a splendid}} pavilion, where was everything that royal luxury could devise. De Vaux, who was in attendance, then removed the chappe (CAPA), or long riding-cloak, which Richard wore, and he stood before Saladin in the close dress which showed to advantage the strength and symmetry of his person, while it bore a strong contrast to the flowing robes which disguised the thin frame. of the Eastern monarch. It was Richard's two-handed sword that chiefly {{attracted the attention of}} the Saracen--a broad, <b>straight</b> <b>blade,</b> the seemingly unwieldy length of which extended well-nigh from the shoulder to the heel of the wearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "A man fights better," [...] he said, [...] "with {{the sword}} {{to which he}} is used. Mine is of tried temper, and I have no fear of its breaking." [...] Harry had good reason for faith in his weapon. It was a long, <b>straight</b> <b>blade</b> of Toledo steel, which he had {{purchased}} for a considerable sum from a Spanish Jew in Hamburg. Colonel Campbell {{put an end to}} the argument by roughly saying that he wanted no more talk, and that if Colonel Furness meant fighting he had better take up his ground. This had already been marked out, and Harry immediately stood on the defensive.|$|E
40|$|Small-scale {{hydroelectric}} power generation has recently attracted considerable attention. The authors previously proposed an undershot cross-flow water turbine {{with a very}} low head suitable for application to open channels. The water turbine was of a cross-flow type and {{could be used in}} open channels with the undershot method, remarkably simplifying its design by eliminating guide vanes and the casing. The water turbine was fitted with curved blades (such as the runners of a typical cross-flow water turbine) installed in tube channels. However, there was ambiguity as to how the blades’ shape influenced the turbine’s performance and flow field. To resolve this issue, the present study applies <b>straight</b> <b>blades</b> to an undershot cross-flow water turbine and examines the performance and flow field via experiments and numerical analyses. Results reveal that the output power and the turbine efficiency of the <b>Straight</b> <b>Blades</b> runner were greater than those of the Curved Blades runner regardless of the rotational speed. Compared with the Curved Blades runner, the output power and the turbine efficiency of the <b>Straight</b> <b>Blades</b> runner were improved by about 31. 7 % and about 67. 1 %, respectively...|$|R

50|$|The kalis blade {{is defined}} as one that is wide on the base and double-edged. It is capable of {{delivering}} both chopping and slicing cuts. While many assume the traditional form of the kalis is the fully wavy blade, the half-waved half-straight, {{as well as the}} fully <b>straight</b> <b>blades,</b> are equally if not more common, as <b>straight</b> <b>blades</b> were more practical in combat. Moro kalis blades generally range in size from 18 to 26 inches (46 to 66 cm), though as with all Moro weapons there are exceptions. Generally however, the larger blades are found on later pieces, while the oldest Moro kalis tend to be of smaller stature. Damascene patterning is sometimes evident though often not as controlled as seen in the complex pattern welding of the smaller Malay keris.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{on the use of}} three dimensional blade designs incorporating sweep and casing boundary layer control through tip injection have shown improved efficiency, stage loading and stable operating range Both methods are known to stabilize the flow at the tip trailing edge (Stall Inception Point) of the compressor blade under lower than design mass flow conditions and improve the compressor performance. This study, performed on a low speed axial flow fan, is aimed to improve the understanding and to assess the improved stall margin due to tip injection on swept and <b>straight</b> <b>blades.</b> Injection through flush mounted nozzles on the casing before the rotor blades is of practical importance because of the non-interference of the nozzles with the main flow. Benefits in terms of efficiency and operating range have already been established and swept blades were found to perform better than the baseline <b>straight</b> <b>blades.</b> The injection mechanism involves 12 symmetrically located flush mounted nozzles before the rotor blades in the casing. The number of injection nozzles used is an additional parameter of the study. Although there are manufacturing limitations in the air injection angle, two injection angles (100 and 300) have been tried. The improvement in stall margin is more pronounced in the <b>straight</b> <b>blades</b> than in the swept blades and the 100 injection angle with 6 active injection holes gives the best performance in comparison to other combinations...|$|R
