During the 32 years the Patrick Springs was close, <b>Shuff</b> Post Office handled all the mail for the area. Passengers of the Danville and Western Railway “Dick & Willie” would pass by the <b>Shuff</b> depot and post office {{on their way}} to the old Patrick Springs hotel and mineral resort. Having two sets of local addresses caused confusion, and in 1925, legislative steps were taken to give the whole area, post office, and train depot the name [...] "Patrick Springs".|$|E

40|$|Brainbow is {{a genetic}} {{engineering}} technique that randomly colorizes cells. Biological samples processed with this technique and imaged with confocal microscopy have distinctive colors for individual cells. Complex cellular structures {{can then be}} easily visualized. However, {{the complexity of the}} Brainbow technique limits its applications. In practice, most confocal microscopy scans use different florescence staining with typically at most three distinct cellular structures. These structures are often packed and obscure each other in rendered images making analysis difficult. In this paper, we leverage a process known as GPU framebuffer feedback loops to synthesize Brainbow-like images. In addition, we incorporate ID <b>shuffing</b> and Monte-Carlo sampling into our technique, {{so that it can be}} applied to single-channel confocal microscopy data. The synthesized Brainbow images are presented to domain experts with positive feedback. A user survey demonstrates that our synthetic Brainbow technique improves visualizations of volume data with complex structures for biologists...|$|R

40|$|RC 4 can be {{made more}} secured if an {{additional}} RC 4 -like Post-KSA Random <b>Shuffing</b> (PKRS) process is introduced between KSA and PRGA. It can also be made significantly faster if RC 4 bytes are processed in a FPGA embedded system using multiple coprocessors functioning in parallel. The PKRS process is tuned to form as many S-boxes as required by particular design architectures involving multiple coprocessors, each one undertaking byte-by-byte processing. Following a ecent idea [1] [2] the speed of execution of each processor is also enhanced by another fold if the byte-by-byte processing {{is replaced by a}} scheme of processing two consecutive bytes together. Adopting some new innovative concepts, three hardware design architectures are proposed in a suitable FPGA embedded system involving 1, 2 and 4 coprocessors functioning in parallel and a study is made on accelerating RC 4 by processing bytes in byte-by-byte mode achieving throughputs from 1 -byte-in- 1 -clock to 4 -bytes-in- 1 -clock. The hardware designs are appropriately upgraded to accelerate RC 4 further by processing 2 onsecutive RC 4 bytes together and it has been possible to achieve a maximum throughput of 8 -bytes per clock in Xilinx Virtex- 5 LX 110 t FPGA [3] architecture followed by secured data communication between two FPGA boards.

5000|$|Richard Mulcaster, {{a former}} student at Eton College and later {{headmaster}} at Merchant Taylors' School (1561) and St Paul's School (1596) {{has been described as}} [...] "the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football". He tells us that {{towards the end of the}} sixteenth century football in England had grown to [...] "greatnes[...]. was much used ... in all places". Mulcaster's unique contribution is not only referring to [...] "footeball" [...] by its correct English name but also providing the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster confirms that his was a game closer to modern football by differentiating it from games involving other parts of the body, namely [...] "the hand ball" [...] and [...] "the armeball". He referred to the many benefits of his [...] "footeball" [...] in his personal publication of 1581 in English entitled ‘Positions Wherein Those Primitive Circumstances Be Examined, Which Are Necessarie for the Training up of Children’. He states that football had positive educational value and it promoted health and strength. Mulcaster's discussion on the merits of football was the first to refer to teams ("sides" [...] and [...] "parties"), positions ("standings"), the benefits of a referee ("judge over the parties") and a coach [...] "(trayning maister)". Although it is not explicitly mentioned, passing of the ball is strongly implied by the reference to different positions on the field. Mulcaster describes a game for small teams that is organised under the auspices of a referee (and is therefore clear evidence that his game had evolved from disordered and violent [...] "mob" [...] football): [...] "Some smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or <b>shuffing</b> one another so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges". As a result of his enthusiasm for the sport and his accurate description of the modern game Richard Mulcaster is considered the father of early modern football.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the detection of}} galaxy clusters with their weak gravitational lensing effect. Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, and their abundance and evolution provide important information about the structure formation in the cosmological context. Weak gravitational lensing makes use of the distortion of the background galaxy images to probe the matter distribution of the clusters. In this work, we present three methods for the weak lensing study of galaxies clusters. We first developed a program ExAM, which automatically and efficiently masks image defects contaminating the shape measurement of galaxies. The output of the program {{can be used to}} remove the problematic detections of galaxy in the image. We then present a catalog-space simulation of cluster weak lensing, <b>Shuff,</b> featuring the configurable intrinsic properties of galaxies, multiple triaxial cluster halos as lenses, and realizations of cosmological density perturbation field as a source of shear noise. It takes a catalog of unlensed galaxies, applies the multiple lens plane lensing effects, and outputs a lensed galaxies catalog, which can either be used to produce image of galaxies for the shape measurement calibration, or be taken as the input of cluster detection based on the galaxy ellipticities. We also developed a program for cluster detection, LensFilter, implementing the optimal filtering techniques suggested by Maturi et. al. (2004). We generalize the techniques for detection of specific clusters with configurable galaxies redshift distribution and noise properties. The filtering detection is first applied to the <b>Shuff</b> simulation, for an investigation of limit of cluster detection with weak lensing, and further applied to the CFHTLS data with comparison to cluster detection from X-ray observations...|$|E

So, how do we turn tree measurements into management advice? Do you know the word game where you turn one word into another by changing one etter at a time (and if necessary, <b>shuff</b> e the etters) ? For examp e, a "tree" can be turned into "data" in 3 steps: tree - rate - date - data. To turn "tree measurements" into "management advice", you need to change eight etters, so it shou d be possib e to do this in eig ht steps. I offer the fo owing 8 steps, not as a so ution to this puzz e (I offer one so ution ater), but as a critica pathway for turning tree measurements int...|$|E
40|$|Bounded context {{switching}} (BCS) is an under-approximate {{method for}} finding violations to safety properties in shared memory concurrent programs. Technically, BCS is a reachability {{problem that is}} known to be NP-complete. Our contribution is a parameterized analysis of BCS. The first result is an algorithm that solves BCS when parameterized by the number of context switches (cs) {{and the size of the}} memory (m) in O*(m^(cs) 2 ^(cs)). This is achieved by creating instances of the easier problem <b>Shuff</b> which we solve via fast subset convolution. We also present a lower bound for BCS of the form m^o(cs / log(cs)), based on the exponential time hypothesis. Interestingly, closing the gap means settling a conjecture that has been open since FOCS' 07. Further, we prove that BCS admits no polynomial kernel. Next, we introduce a measure, called scheduling dimension, that captures the complexity of schedules. We study BCS parameterized by the scheduling dimension (sdim) and show that it can be solved in O*((2 m) ^(4 sdim) 4 ^t) $, where t is the number of threads. We consider variants of the problem for which we obtain (matching) upper and lower bounds...|$|E

Frankel said that according to previous epidemic reports, people who had the disease should be examined to prevent an increase in death rate due to after effects. • He suggested that physicians give free medical care to those affected by influenza. • Dr. Lee K. Frankel is President of the American Public Health Association and a Vice President of a large life insurance company. • He has studied the influenza epidemic, and based on statistics, he said the epidemic in 1889 - 1890 led to a higher death rate for the following five years due to after effects. • Dr. Lee K. Frankel showed the health conditions of large cities in the country through the epidemic to February 1 st. He said, in almost every case, {{that there was a}} peak from the epidemic, then return to normal death rate, then a slow increase in death rate starting around January 1 st. • He said that previous records have shown people to die 10 - 20 years after having influenza (due to after effects), because they did not realize they had had it. • He also said that there have been 500, 000 deaths due to influenza and $ 100, 000, 000 in death claims. Companies are going into reserves or becoming “insolvent. ”• Dr. Lee K. Frankel said that the cause and cure of the disease are both unknown, but that scientists will soon find the bacilius responsible for the disease. • Tests were done in a naval hospital to find the cause, and 68 volunteer sailors were given the disease in the nose, throat, eyes, and blood, but none became ill. He said this “refuted theories” that these were areas where the disease “originated. ”• He said that in San Francisco, face masks were prevalent, but there was a very high death rate in the “recrudescence period. ”• After speaking with Dr. Lee K. Frankel, the association unanimously approved the opposition of applying the occupational tax to insurance companies, proposed by John L. <b>Shuff.</b> • Dr. Lee K. Frankel also stated that the “Jewish name has been marred” by the belief that Russian Jewish individuals are responsible for the state of affairs in Russia, singling out those Jewish individuals educated in the East Side of New York.
