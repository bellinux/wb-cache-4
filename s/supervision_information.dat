40|$|This study {{constructs}} {{the network}} diffusion model {{of food safety}} scare behavior under the effect of information transparency and examines the network topology and evolution characteristics of food safety scare behavior in a numerical simulation. The main conclusions {{of this study are}} as follows. (1) Under the effect of information transparency, the network degree distribution of food safety scare behavior diffusion demonstrates the decreasing characteristics of diminishing margins. (2) Food safety scare behavior diffusion increases with the information dissemination rate and consumer concern about food safety incidents and shows the characteristics of monotone increasing. And with the increasing of the government food safety <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> transparency and media food safety <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> transparency, the whole is declining characteristic of diminishing marginal. In addition, the extinction of food safety scare behavior cannot be achieved gradually given a single regulation of government food safety <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> transparency and media food safety <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> transparency. (3) The interaction effects between improving government food safety <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> transparency or media food safety <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> transparency and declining consumer concerns about food safety incidents or information transmission rate can engender the suppression of food safety scare behavior diffusion...|$|E

Generally, supervised feature selection methods with <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> are superior to unsupervised ones without <b>supervision</b> <b>information.</b> In the literature, nearly all existing supervised feature selection methods use class labels as <b>supervision</b> <b>information.</b> In this paper, we propose to use another form of <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> for feature selection, i. e. pairwise constraints, which specifies whether a pair of data samples {{belong to the same}} class (must-link constraints) or different classes (cannot-link constraints). Pairwise constraints arise naturally in many tasks and are more practical and inexpensive than class labels. This topic has not yet been addressed in feature selection research. We call our pairwise constraints guided feature selection algorithm as Constraint Score and compare it with the well-known Fisher Score and Laplacian Score algorithms. Experiments are carried out on several high-dimensional UCI and face data sets. Experimental results show that, with very few pairwise constraints, Constraint Score achieves similar or even higher performance than Fisher Score with full class labels on the whole training data, and significantly outperforms Laplacian Score...|$|E

40|$|The depth {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} behind the great success of {{convolutional}} neural networks (CNNs), with the gradient vanishing issue having been largely addressed by various nets, e. g. ResNet. However, when the depth goes very deep, the <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> from the loss function will vanish due to the long backpropagation path, especially for those shallow layers. This means that intermediate layers receive less <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> and will lead to redundancy in models. As a result, the model becomes very redundant and the over-fitting issue may happen. To address this, we propose a model, called AuxNet, by introducing auxiliary outputs at intermediate layers. Different from existing approaches, we propose a Multi-path training method to propagate not only gradients but also sufficient supervision informationfrommultipleauxiliaryoutputs.

40|$|Subspace {{clustering}} aims to partition {{the data}} points {{drawn from a}} union of subspaces according to their underly- ing subspaces. For accurate semisupervised subspace clustering,all data that have a must-link constraint or the same label should be grouped into the same underlying subspace. However, this is not guaranteed in existing approaches. Moreover, these approaches require additional parameters for incorporating <b>supervision</b> <b>information.</b> In this paper, we propose a constrained low-rank representation (CLRR) for robust semisupervised sub-space clustering, based on a novel constraint matrix constructed in this paper. While seeking the low-rank representation of data, CLRR explicitly incorporates <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> as hard constraints for enhancing the discriminating power of optimal representation. This strategy can be further extended to other state-of-the-art methods, such as sparse subspace clustering. We theoretically prove that the optimal representation matrix has both a block-diagonal structure with clean data and a semisu-pervised grouping effect with noisy data. We have also developed an efficient optimization algorithm based on alternating the direction method of multipliers for CLRR. Our experimental results have demonstrated that CLRR outperforms existing methods...|$|E

40|$|Representing the raw {{input of}} a data set {{by a set}} of rele-vant codes is crucial to many {{computer}} vision applications. Due to the intrinsic sparse property of real-world data, dic-tionary learning, in which the linear decomposition of a data point uses a set of learned dictionary bases, i. e., codes, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, traditional dictionary learning methods suffer from three weaknesses: sensitivity to noisy and outlier samples, dif-ficulty to determine the optimal dictionary size, and incapa-bility to incorporate <b>supervision</b> <b>information.</b> In this paper, we address these weaknesses by learning a Semi-Supervised Robust Dictionary (SSR-D). Specifically, we use the ℓ 2, 0 +-norm as the loss function to improve the robustness against outliers, and develop a new structured sparse regularization to incorporate the <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> in dictionary learning, without incurring additional parameters. More-over, the optimal dictionary size is automatically learned from the input data. Minimizing the derived objective func-tion is challenging because it involves many non-smooth ℓ 2, 0 +-norm terms. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the problem with a rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm. Extensive experiments are presented to show the superior performance of the proposed method. 1...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{significant}} improvement {{has been made}} on semantic object segmentation due {{to the development of}} deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Training such a DCNN usually relies on a large number of images with pixel-level segmentation masks, and annotating these images is very costly in terms of both finance and human effort. In this paper, we propose a simple to complex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized to learn DCNNs for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first train an initial segmentation network called Initial-DCNN with the saliency maps of simple images (i. e., those with a single category of major object(s) and clean background). These saliency maps can be automatically obtained by existing bottom-up salient object detection techniques, where no <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> is needed. Then, a better network called Enhanced-DCNN is learned with supervision from the predicted segmentation masks of simple images based on the Initial-DCNN as well as the image-level annotations. Finally, more pixel-level segmentation masks of complex images (two or more categories of objects with cluttered background), which are inferred by using Enhanced-DCNN and image-level annotations, are utilized as the <b>supervision</b> <b>information</b> to learn the Powerful-DCNN for semantic segmentation. Our method utilizes $ 40 $K simple images from Flickr. com and 10 K complex images from PASCAL VOC for step-wisely boosting the segmentation network.
