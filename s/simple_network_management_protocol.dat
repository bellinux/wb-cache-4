40|$|Accurate {{intrusion}} detection {{is still an}} open challenge. The present work aims at being one step toward that purpose by studying the combination of clustering and visualization techniques. To do that, the mobile visualization connectionist agent-based {{intrusion detection}} system (MOVICAB-IDS), previously proposed as a hybrid intelligent IDS based on visualization techniques, is upgraded by adding automatic response thanks to clustering methods. To check {{the validity of the}} proposed clustering extension, it has been applied to the identification of different anomalous situations related to the <b>simple</b> <b>network</b> <b>management</b> <b>network</b> <b>protocol</b> by using real-life data sets. Different ways of applying neural projection and clustering techniques are studied in the present article. Through the experimental validation it is shown that the proposed techniques could be compatible and consequently applied to a continuous network flow for intrusion detectionSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness with ref: TIN 2010 - 21272 -C 02 - 01 (funded by the European Regional Development Fund) and SA 405 A 12 - 2 from Junta de Castilla y Leon...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} that allows the rapid development of scalable <b>network</b> <b>management</b> services with a particular emphasis on data aggregation and visualization. A new information model allows the aggregation of management information in spatial, temporal, and functional forms. The generated abstractions are stored in a special management agent which provides persistent storage facilities, event correlation services and access modules to information that is only available {{through one of the}} standard <b>network</b> <b>management</b> <b>protocols</b> such as SNMP and CMIP. A query processing subsystem handles operations on network abstractions that cannot be expressed in any of the above forms of aggregation. <b>Simple</b> <b>network</b> <b>management</b> clients such as web browsers can navigate through the different levels of aggregation and visualize managed objects of arbitrary complexity by dynamically loading the appropriate viewers/controllers.

50|$|The Nortel Discovery Protocol had {{its origin}} in the SynOptics <b>Network</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Protocol</b> (SONMP), {{developed}} before the SynOptics and Wellfleet Communications merger in 1994.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel algorithm, the Active Virtual <b>Network</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Protocol</b> (AVNMP), for predictive <b>network</b> <b>management.</b> It explains how the Active Virtual <b>Network</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Protocol</b> facilitates the <b>management</b> {{of an active}} network by allowing future predicted state information within an active network {{to be available to}} <b>network</b> <b>management</b> algorithms. This is accomplished by coupling ideas from optimistic discrete event simulation with active networking. The optimistic discrete event simulation method used is a form of self-adjusting Time Warp. It is self-adjusting because the system adjusts for predictions which are inaccurate beyond a given tolerance. The concept of a streptichron and autoanaplasis are introduced as mechanisms which take advantage of the enhanced flexibility and intelligence of active packets. Finally, it is demonstrated that the Active Virtual <b>Network</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Protocol</b> is a feasible concept. 1. <b>Network</b> <b>Management</b> and Active <b>Networks</b> The problem this pa [...] ...|$|R
