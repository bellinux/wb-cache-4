Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E
500|$|The three creators—Murphy, Falchuk, and Brennan—plan {{the stories}} together. For {{the first two}} seasons, {{they were the only}} writers, and after taking joint credit for the pilot episode and the episode that opened the fall 2009 season, they began {{rotating}} taking a single auctorial credit, based in large part on the person [...] "who’s taken the lead in story breaking or who wrote a draft". Brennan noted that the writing process is [...] "fast and loose, with the emphasis on fast", and quotes Murphy as having said, in terms of their roles in episode creation, [...] "I'm <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain.

Some of the characters are written more by one writer than by the others. Brennan writes most of Sue's material, and Falchuk frequently writes the scenes between Kurt and Burt Hummel, though Murphy contributes a great deal to Kurt.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Cellular {{polarization}} is {{a process}} whereby a cell's structure and components are organized asymmetrically. Proper polarization is essential for cellular function in many different cell types. Immunocytochemical {{studies have shown that}} muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are sorted into different plasma membrane domains depending on the cell type and receptor subtype. In this study, we use immunocytochemistry to determine <b>the</b> plasma membrane <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M 1 and M 2 muscarinic receptor in cultured cortical neurons. Using MAP 2 and Tau 1 as somatodendritic and axonal markers, respectively, we determined that sufficient polarization of neurons cultured in vitro occurs within 5 - 8 days after initial culturing. <b>The</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M 1 and M 2 receptors in cortical neurons remains inconclusive. We also explored <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> muscarinic receptor dimerization on <b>the</b> plasma membrane <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M 1 and M 2 receptors in the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney epithelial cell line.
