As the truck approaches a weigh station equipped with the corresponding <b>bypass</b> <b>system,</b> information pertaining to vehicle weight is transmitted to the station. The receivers are mounted on elevated “booms ” positioned over the highway between one half-mile to one mile before the station (point 1 in Figure A 1). Truck and driver data are forwarded to the weigh station (point 2) and checked for compliance. If the weight, driver service hours, and other data are within acceptable limits, then a signal is sent to and broadcast from a second elevated boom (point 3) that illuminates a green light on the truck’s transponder giving the driver permission to bypass that station (point 4). If data are not acceptable, a signal illuminating a red light is broadcast (at point 3) and the driver must pull into the weigh station (point 5).

40|$|Dense phase {{pneumatic}} conveying is preferable over dilute phase conveying in many industries as lower transport velocities are beneficial due to reduced attrition of the particles and reduced wear. However, dense phase conveying is critically {{dependent on the}} physical properties of the materials to be conveyed. For many materials which are either erosive or fragile, they do not exhibit the physical properties required to be conveyed reliably in a low velocity, dense phase flow regime. This can be serious problem in the food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. One satisfactory approach which has been widely applied {{is the use of}} <b>bypass</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Bypass</b> {{pneumatic conveying}} <b>systems</b> provide the capacity of transporting some materials that are not naturally suitable for dense phase flow. <b>Bypass</b> pneumatic conveying <b>systems</b> also provide a passive capability to reduce minimum particulate transport velocities. In this study, pneumatic conveying experiments were carried out in a 79 mm diameter main pipe with a 27 mm inner diameter bypass pipe with orifice plate flute arrangement. Alumina, fly ash and sand were conveyed in the tests. High speed camera visualization was employed to study the flow regimes of <b>bypass</b> pneumatic transport <b>systems</b> and investigate the mechanism of material blockage inhibition provided by these systems. For alumina and fly ash, it was found that particulate material blockages were inhibited in <b>bypass</b> <b>systems</b> due to the air penetration into the particulate volume as a result of orifice plate airflow resistance. For the bypass pneumatic conveying of sand, the splitting of a long plug into two smaller plugs was observed. One of the primary concerns of <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> is the wear of the bypass line. Material such as alumina is inherently abrasive by nature. For internal <b>bypass</b> <b>systems,</b> there is limited ability to monitor the state of the inner bypass tube while in operation.

Based on the models developed for the assessment of service life of pneumatic conveying pipelines, the thickness loss of the bypass pipe has been estimated.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Pneumatic {{conveying}} is {{a popular}} method of transporting materials in the resource and process industries because of its advantages of no dust emission, flexible conveying pipe routes and capability to convey poisonous and hazardous material. There are two primary modes of pneumatic conveying: dilute phase and dense phase. One of the significant advantages of dense-phase conveying over dilute phase {{is the ability to}} convey materials at relatively low conveying velocities, resulting in significantly reduced particle attrition and erosive wear of pipelines. For this reason, there has been a significant move towards dense-phase systems. However, whether a material can be dense-phase conveyed in conventional pipeline is critically governed by its physical properties. <b>Bypass</b> pneumatic conveying <b>systems</b> provide the capacity to transport materials that are not naturally suited to dense-phase conveying, and can significantly reduce the minimum dense-phase conveying velocity for some materials that are dense-phase conveyed in conventional pipelines. In both cases, the conveying velocity is significantly reduced, resulting in less particle degradation, lower pipeline wear and lower power consumption. Pressure drop, specific energy consumption and minimum conveying velocity are three major parameters for assessing <b>system</b> performance in <b>bypass</b> pneumatic conveying <b>systems.</b> An extensive experimental program was conducted as part of this study. The pressure drop was measured when transporting fly ash, alumina, sand and plastic pellets over a range of conveying parameters in a conventional pneumatic conveying system and a series of internal <b>bypass</b> <b>systems</b> of varying configurations. The bypass configuration variations included orifice diameter, internal bypass pipe diameter and flute spacing. In particular, comparisons between the conventional <b>system</b> and the <b>bypass</b> configurations were made with respect to isothermal energy consumption and minimum conveying velocity. To interpret the mechanism of material blockage inhibition associated with <b>bypass</b> <b>systems,</b> the differential pressure between the main pipe and the internal bypass pipe was measured, together with a high-speed video camera visualisation, which provided pressure and visual information on bypass pipeline flow regimes. Based on mass and momentum conservation and the ideal gas equation, a mathematical model was developed to simulate the internal bypass pneumatic conveying process considering the internal bypass pipe configuration. In the development of the model, it was necessary to determine the solids friction factor. Although a few equations have previously been proposed to predict this factor, none was found to provide sufficient accuracy. Therefore, a solids friction factor model was developed based on the partial least squares (PLS) method. Subsequently, the proposed mathematical model, together with this modified solids friction model, was applied to predict the pressure drop within <b>bypass</b> <b>systems</b> for different conveyed materials (i. e., fly ash, alumina and sand) and different bypass configurations of varying internal bypass pipe diameter, orifice diameter and bypass flute spacing. Bypass pipe diameter and bypass flute spacing are two crucial parameters for <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> design to avoid any possible blockage and ensure reliable conveying. In this study, a design protocol for internal bypass pipe diameter and the frequency of bypass pipeline openings was established based on the physical properties of the materials to be conveyed.

These examples show direct evidence of highly focused vertical or subvertical fluid flow from subsurface reservoirs up through the seal sequence, with leakage internally at higher levels or to the surface as seeps. We classify SBS into three main groups based on seismic interpretational criteria: (1) fault related, (2) intrusion related, and (3) pipe related. We show how each group exhibits different modes of behavior with different scaling relationships between flux and dimensions and different short- and long-term impacts on seal behavior.

Our interpretation of {sup 4 }He concentrations, measured {{at the top and}} bottom of the caprock, suggests low fluid fluxes through the caprock: (1) Of the total {sup 4 }He produced in situ (i. e., at the locations of sampling) by uranium and thorium decay since deposition of the Kirtland Formation, a large portion still resides in the pore fluids. (2) Simple advection-only and advection-diffusion models, using the measured {sup 4 }He concentrations, indicate low permeability ({approx} 10 - 20 m{sup 2 } or lower) for the thickness of the Kirtland Formation. These findings, however, do not guarantee the lack of a large-scale <b>bypass</b> <b>system.</b> The measured data, located near the boundary conditions of the models (i. e., the overlying and underlying aquifers), limit our testing of conceptual models and the sensitivity of model parameterization. Thus, we suggest approaches for future studies to better assess the presence or lack of a seal <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> at this particular site and for other sites in general...|$|R
