40|$|Webbings {{are used}} in {{parachute}} assemblies as reinforcing units for the strength they provide. The strength of these seams is an important characteristic which has a substantial influence on the mechanical property of the parachute assemblies. It is well established that factors such as fabric width, folding length of joint, <b>seam</b> <b>design</b> and seam type will all {{have an impact on}} seam strength. In this work, the effect of these factors on seam strength was studied using both Taguchi's design of experiment (TDOE) as well as an artificial neural network (ANN). In TDOE, two levels were chosen for the factors mentioned above. An L 8 design was adopted and an orthogonal array was generated. The contribution of each factor to seam strength was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and signal to noise ratio methods. From the analysis {{it was found that the}} fabric width, folding length of joint and interaction between the folding length of joint and the <b>seam</b> <b>design</b> affected seam strength significantly. Further, using TDOE, an optimal configuration of levels of factors was found. In order to contrast and compare the results from TDOE, an ANN was also used to predict seam strength using the above mentioned factors as inputs. The prediction from TDOE and ANN methodologies were compared with physical seam strength. It was established from these comparisons, in which the root mean square error was used as an accuracy measure, that the predictions by ANN were better in accuracy than those predicted by TDOE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{basic idea}} behind the {{provision}} of a service is to hide the service implementation details from the client {{in such a way}} that more value is provided to the client. Very often support services allow too much of their implementation details to be visible to customers resulting in poor value proposition. In this paper we describe a project that aimed towards the requisite abstraction of the support service implementation for the research funding at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). We show the current service, the problem it creates for its customers, and propose four patterns for improving the value that customers receive from a requisite service abstraction. The four patterns are: provide a simple service interface, incorporate needed external actors into the service view of the organization, recognize new customers and use data and process linking technology. These patterns are applied in a to-be model. Keywords—service, service modeling, process modeling, busi-ness and IT alignment, <b>SEAM,</b> <b>design</b> pattern...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Approximately 66 {{per cent}} of all airbag {{deployments}} in the USA result {{in at least}} one skin injury, with 47 per cent of these skin injuries attributed directly to the airbag deployment. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the risk of skin abrasions from the airbag fabric <b>seam</b> <b>design</b> by using a new shear testing methodology. High-rate shear loading was performed with a pneumatic impactor that propelled a section of airbag fabric across porcine skin at 85 m/s. Twenty-seven tests (three control and 24 with fabric) were performed using eight different seam designs. A 40 cm 3 10 cm section of airbag fabric with each seam was forced across a 5 cm 3 5 cm section of fresh porcine skin that was acquired within 2 h post-mortem. No abrasions were observed in the three control tests, but abrasions were observed in all 24 of the tests conducted using airbag fabric. The unturned, sewn seam orientation resulted in significantly more severe abrasions than the woven, unturned seam orientation (P = 0. 01). This new system and results illustrate that different seam designs can result in different skin abrasion risk. Moreover, the data show that severe abrasions can be caused by normal pressures well below the 1. 75 MPa injury threshold previously published...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a small-scale estimated macro {{model for the}} euro area (<b>SEAM)</b> <b>designed</b> primarily to generate forecasts and to evaluate the dynamic response of the economy to unanticipated and anticipated shocks. One crucial feature of SEAM {{is the presence of}} forward-looking elements, which makes the model forecasts more robust to the 'Lucas critique', since it allows economic decisions to be moulded by the future impact of 'surprise' policy actions. In what concerns the reliability of the model-simulations, the inclusion of forward-looking behaviour enriches the dynamics of the response of the model's endogenous variables to exogenous shocks. Although the SEAM does not have the richness of full-scale macroeconometric models, as apparent interalia, by the absence of a steady-state analogue and also of some relationships important for a better characterisation of the euro area economy, the model has been shown to deliver reasonable forecasts and responses to shocks that are consistent with conventional wisdom. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{competition}} to lower weight and production cost of aircraft structures currently two main approaches are competing: the metallic and the CFRP-layout. On the metallic site {{it could be}} shown that Laser beam welding (LBW) is a very promising way to overcome current limitations of a conventional riveted fuselage regarding reducing weight and production costs. LBW as a thermal joining process affects metal properties in difference to previous joining technologies. During the welding process the well designed microstructure in the parent sheet metal will be irreversible damaged and replaced by a cast microstructure. That affects the static strength of the weld joint, which will reach about 70 - 80 % of the base material. It will be shown in the experimental results that a laser beam welded butt joint has a higher crack propagation rate. To reach new damage tolerance requirements of the fusion zone in a butt welded joint condition, two ways are possible: 1. Reducing the stress intensity at the crack tip by using a socket around the fusion zone, to reduce the nominal stress at the {{cross section of the}} socket. 2. Changing the weld <b>seam</b> <b>design</b> with the aim of reducing the crack length inside the fusion zone. The goal of the work is to increase the damage tolerance of welded skin-skin joints. The paper presents the latest results of LBW butt joints of the alloy AlMgSiCu for sheets using modern lasers of very high beam quality (K> 0, 9). Special attention will be paid on the damage tolerance behaviour. To improve this, several approaches like influencing the macroscopic crack path, reducing the stress at the crack tip, the use of local working crack stoppers are used. These methods are compared concerning their ability the increase the crack propagation resistance of a welded structure to the high level of a non welded one...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{engineering}} practices used in mining the protective coal seam at Huainan coalfield in China, this study investigates the temporal evolution of three-dimensional {{stress of the}} protected coal seam by numerical simulation. The coal body of the protected coal seam should first be loaded and then unloaded with the three-dimensional stress being reduced simultaneously. In accordance with the forcing process around the coal body of the protected coal seam, permeability experiments were performed under fixed axial displacement with unloading confining pressure (FADUCP) and fixed deviatoric stress with unloading confining pressure (FDSUCP) stress paths. During the loading stage before the unloading point, the permeability and axial strain have a negative exponential relationship. However, during the unloading stage after the unloading point, the permeability and axial strain have a positive exponential relationship. Using the relationship between permeability and axial strain, along with the swelling and deformation of the protected coal seam, the permeability distribution characteristics for the protected coal seam was obtained. According to the permeability distribution characteristics of the protected coal <b>seam,</b> drilling <b>designs</b> for gas drainage can be optimized.

In addition, the project began to develop Industry Partnerships. Since the nominal thickness of baseline carbon felts was only 2 -cm, a partnership with a rayon felt developer was made in order to upgrade equipment, establish the processes required and attempt to manufacture 10 -cm thick white goods. A partnership with a processing house was made to develop the methodology to carbonize large pieces of the white goods into 7. 5 -cm thick carbon felt. In FY 13, more advanced testing and modeling of the down selected conformal material was performed. Material thermal properties tests and structural properties tests were performed. The first 3 and 4 -point bend tests were performed on the conformal ablator as well as PICA for comparison and the conformal ablator had outstanding behavior compared to PICA. Arc jet testing was performed with instrumented samples of both the conformal ablator and standard PICA at heating rates ranging from 40 to 400 Wcm 2 and shear as high as 600 Pa. The results from these tests showed a remarkable improvement in the thermal penetration through the conformal ablator when compared to PICAs response. The data from these tests were used to develop a mid-fidelity thermal response model. Additional arc jet testing in the same conditions on various <b>seam</b> <b>designs</b> were very successful in showing that the material could be joined with a minimum of adhesive and required no complicated gap and gap filler design for installation. In addition, the partnership with industry to manufacture thicker rayon felt was very successful. The vendor made a 2 -m wide by 30 -m long sample of 10 -cm thick rayon felt.

40|$|In {{order to}} design an {{original}} plush toy, {{one needs to}} construct an appropriate 2 D pattern. However, {{it is difficult for}} ordinary people to design 2 D pattern appropriately. Therefore existing patterns for plush toys or balloon have been designed by professional designers. To help people to design their own original plush toys, we are developing two systems for pattern design. The first system, Pillow, starts with an existing 3 D model and lets the user interactively specify segmentation boundaries by drawing seam lines on the model surface. Given the user-defined segmentation, the system generates 2 D patterns by flattening the pieces. The system then visualizes the shape of the resulting plush toy by applying a simple physics simulation. This closed loop interaction allows the user to experiment with various <b>seam</b> line <b>designs</b> without actually sawing a real fabric. The second system, Plushie, is a tool for desinging an original plush toy from scratch using a sketch-based modeling interface under physical constraints. The resulting model is always associated with a 2 D cloth pattern and thus the user can generate a model that is guaranteed to be realizable as a plush toy. These two systems make the construction of 2 D patterns easier and enable the user to design his or her own original plush toys. We introduce some results of sawing plush toys and balloon.

40|$|Flexible laminates, {{customized}} {{for specific}} performance parameters, {{are of interest}} to aerospace programs such as lighter-than-air vehicles, balloon systems, decelerator systems, flexible inflatable structures and pressure vessels. The material requirements for these applications include high strength-to-weight ratio and modulus, low gas permeability, pressure retention and the capability to survive in harsh atmospheric, marine and/or stratospheric environments for extended periods of time. Non-woven multidirectional oriented composite laminates using high performance engineering fibers are produced by Cubic Tech to meet these requirements. These flexible laminates achieve a significant weight savings over woven fabrics of similar strengths by eliminating strength and modulus loss and other structural deficiencies caused by crimping of yarns during the weaving process. The absence of crimp in non-woven fabrics results in a linear elastic response that allows for ease in predicting material properties and simplification of structural models. These flexible composites afford the ability to specify structural properties, oriented to meet any design requirement. Parts can be manufactured with complex 2 D and 3 D geometries with integrated structures, load patches and attachment points. Structures fabricated from these laminates can be joined using standard industry seaming techniques to produce seams stronger than the base laminates.

Overall conclusion Improved school engagement is seen as an important contribution to reducing areas of Indigenous disadvantage, including in literacy and numeracy levels and economic participation. The Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure (SEAM) is not necessarily confined to Indigenous parents and children; however the communities to which SEAM is applied all have a high proportion of residents who are Indigenous Australians. Overall, the administration of SEAM has been mixed. The first two phases of SEAM have been implemented as scheduled in 15 communities and 37 schools—extending to more than 4500 children, with work underway to implement SEAM in other communities; and reasonable arrangements have been established to support collaboration between Australian Government and NT Government agencies. However, there remains scope to improve SEAM’s effectiveness through strengthening key aspects of service delivery and performance reporting arrangements. To encourage parents to enrol their children in school, the enrolment element identifies parents (who live in SEAM communities and receive income support payments), and obtains enrolment details for their children. Nearly 2500 parents were identified as within the scope of SEAM in 2013 and enrolment details were obtained covering more than 90 percent of relevant children. Of these parents, around 10  per cent had payments temporarily suspended, but promptly restored, indicating that a significant proportion of the enrolment activity is simply requiring parents who had already enrolled their children to contact DHS. As a result, whether SEAM has stimulated an increase in underlying enrolment levels is not readily identifiable. Encouraging children to regularly attend school in SEAM communities, many of which are in very remote locations, has long presented a challenge. During 2013 there were a large number of children identified who attended school less than 80  per cent of the time, which is the benchmark agreed by the Australian and NT governments. A structured approach to prioritising attendance activities has not been developed for SEAM and in 2013, attendance processes were undertaken for just one quarter of the parents of children with poor school attendance. There is scope to better manage the disparity between the number of children with low school attendance and SEAM’s capacity to focus on these children through developing a clearer approach to the targeting of SEAM resources including in relation to the contribution of other school attendance initiatives. While an evaluation strategy was developed for the trial of SEAM, limited performance measures were established prior to the transfer of SEAM to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C). This has constrained the ability of the department to assess SEAM’s effectiveness and identify areas to improve efficiency of delivery. It also constrains the department’s ability to provide advice to government on the program’s success, and to inform policy considerations. Ideally, performance measurement arrangements are developed at the commencement of an initiative to allow for the establishment of baseline information and consideration of performance information needs. SEAM is planned to be in operation until 2022 and in this context finalising a performance reporting approach with appropriate performance measures including proxy measures where necessary, would be a priority. The proposed evaluation of SEAM, which PM&C advised it intends to commence in 2014, would form a key element of this framework. The department has also advised that it has commenced work on an approved performance measurement approach. In developing SEAM, the then Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and DHS had the advantage of being able to draw upon the experience of a three and a half year trial which was allocated funding of $ 31. 2  million. While these departments had resolved some issues which arose during the trial, many of the key issues identified in this audit were also identified under the trial. The continuing presence of these issues indicates that the opportunities to learn from the trial, and make improvements, were not fully realised. The ANAO has made one recommendation directed towards PM&C strengthening SEAM’s program implementation. The planned evaluation of SEAM in 2014 also offers an opportunity to examine elements of the <b>SEAM’s</b> <b>design</b> and operation highlighted in this audit...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{experiments}} and simulations are performed {{to study the}} deployment dynamics of space webs and space booms, focusing on the deployment and stabilization phases of the space web and {{the behavior of the}} bi-stable tape spring booms after long-term stowage. The space web, Suaineadh, was launched onboard the sounding rocket REXUS- 12 from the Swedish launch base Esrange in Kiruna on 19 March 2012. It served as a technology demonstrator for a space web. A reaction wheel was used to actively control the deployment and stabilization states of the 2 × 2 m 2 space web. After ejection from the rocket, the web was deployed but entanglements occurred since the web did not start to deploy at the specified angular velocity. The deployment dynamics was reconstructed by simulations from the information recorded by inertial measurement units and cameras. Simulations show that if the web would have started to deploy at the specified angular velocity, the web would most likely have been deployed and stabilized in space by the motor, reaction wheel and controller used in the experiment. A modified control method was developed to stabilize the out-of-plane motions before or during deployment. New web arms with tape springs were proposed to avoid entanglements. A deployable booms assembly composed of four 1 -m long bi-stable glass fiber tape springs was designed for the electromagnetically clean 3 U CubeSat Small Explorer for Advanced Missions (SEAM). The deployment dynamics and reliability of the <b>SEAM</b> boom <b>design</b> after long-term stowage were tested by on-ground experiments. A simple analytical model was developed to predict the deployment dynamics and to assess the effects of the GOLS and the combined effects of friction, viscoelastic strain energy relaxation, and other factors that act to decrease the deployment force. In order to mitigate the viscoelastic effects and thus ensure self-deployment, different tape springs were designed, manufactured and tested. A numerical model was used to assess the long-term stowage effects on the deployment capability of bi-stable tape springs including the friction, nonlinear-elastic and viscoelastic effects. A finite element method was used to model a meter-class fully coiled bi-stable tape spring boom and verified by analytical models. QC 20170508 SEA...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a robotic cell to perform assembly and handling operations on cloth. - A flexible automation approach was adopted, in which the robot was required to control the cloth panel during both handling and sewing operations, without the aid of hard automation attachments which might limit the flexibility of the system. The cell consisted of an adaptively controlled robot, a hierarchy of controllers, a conventional sewing machine, a two-fingered fabric steering end-effector, and several sensor systems. A technique was developed for producing a seam parallel to an edge of arbitrary contour, in which two cameras, a cloth tension sensor and the sewing machine's shaft encoder provided the sensory input. Two sensory servo control systems were required, one control system generated the robot's trajectory to maintain a small constant cloth tension, and the other directed the robot to manipulate the cloth panel to maintain a constant <b>seam</b> width. The <b>design</b> of the cloth tension control was based on the measured frequency response of the open loop system. The seam width control was designed using simulation studies, which accounted for the control transfer function, and nonlinearities such as camera pixel resolution, time delays and robot motion limitations. Several robotic handling techniques were developed, so that a cloth panel placed arbitrarily on the sewing table could be set up for an edge seaming operation, and the cloth could be rotated about the needle. The system's flexibility was demonstrated in the assembly of an irregularly shaped cloth panel, in which three adjacent sides were sewn up. ...|$|R
50|$|In the fourth, the Vikings {{possessed the}} ball, but Ponder threw an {{interception}} {{straight into the}} waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone {{for the first time}} on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a <b>seam</b> on a <b>designed</b> quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line. However, with less than a half minute remaining, DeAngelo Hall intercepted Christian Ponder, to officially preserve the 38-26 win.|$|R
