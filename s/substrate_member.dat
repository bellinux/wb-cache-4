40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a field investigation of repairs to Sutherland Street Bridge on B 6080 in Sheffield, England. Flowing repair materials were used to apply large patch repairs to propped and unpropped columns of the bridge. Watertight shuttering was securely attached to the structure and flowing repair materials were either pumped or poured into the shuttering. The elastic modulus of the repair materials (E-rm) used was greater than that of the substrate concrete (E-sub). The results show that free shrinkage of the repair patch is effectively transferred to the substrate when E-rm > E-sub and the risk of restrained shrinkage cracking is reduced. In a propped repair, long-term strain distributions in the repair patch are erratic and are predominantly governed by the depropping process; properties of the repair materials only have a secondary influence. The repair patches applied with flowing materials did not, in the 60 week monitoring period, redistribute any significant external loading from the <b>substrate</b> <b>member...</b>|$|E

The MRN complex rapidly recognises and locates to DNA DSB where it acts to recruit and assist in ATM activation.

While ATM has hundreds of <b>substrates,</b> <b>members</b> of the MRN complex play a pivotal role in mediating the downstream signalling events that give rise to cell cycle control, DNA repair and ultimately cell survival or apoptosis.

40|$|When {{vertebrate}} cells exit mitosis various cellular {{structures are}} re-organized to build functional interphase cells. This depends on Cdk 1 (cyclin dependent kinase 1) inactivation and subsequent dephosphorylation of its <b>substrates.</b> <b>Members</b> of the {{protein phosphatase 1}} and 2 A (PP 1 and PP 2 A) families can dephosphorylate Cdk 1 substrates in biochemical extracts during mitotic exit, but how this relates to postmitotic reassembly of interphase structures in intact cells is not known. Here, we use a live-cell imaging assay and RNAi knockdown to screen a genome-wide library of protein phosphatases for mitotic exit functions in human cells. We identify a trimeric PP 2 A-B 55 alpha complex as {{a key factor in}} mitotic spindle breakdown and postmitotic reassembly of the nuclear envelope, Golgi apparatus and decondensed chromatin. Using a chemically induced mitotic exit assay, we find that PP 2 A-B 55 alpha functions downstream of Cdk 1 inactivation. PP 2 A-B 55 alpha isolated from mitotic cells had reduced phosphatase activity towards the Cdk 1 substrate, histone H 1, and was hyper-phosphorylated on all subunits. Mitotic PP 2 A complexes co-purified with the nuclear transport factor importin-beta 1, and RNAi depletion of importin-beta 1 delayed mitotic exit synergistically with PP 2 A-B 55 alpha. This demonstrates that PP 2 A-B 55 alpha and importin-beta 1 cooperate in the regulation of postmitotic assembly mechanisms in human cells. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{bacterial}} consortium comprising {{four different}} species was isolated from an Indonesian agricultural soil using {{a mixture of}} aniline and 4 -chloroaniline (4 CA) as principal carbon sources. The four species were identified as Chryseobacterium indologenes SB 1, Comamonas testosteroni SB 2, Pseudomonas corrugata SB 4 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SB 5. Growth studies on aniline and 4 CA as single and mixed substrates demonstrated that the bacteria preferred to grow on and utilize aniline rather than 4 CA, although both compounds were eventually depleted from the culture supernatant. However, despite 100 % disappearance of the parent substrates, the degradation of 4 CA was always characterized by incomplete dechlorination and 4 -chlorocatechol accumulation. This result suggests that further degradation of 4 -chlorocatechol may be the rate-limiting step in the metabolism of 4 CA by the bacterial consortium. HPLC-UV analysis showed that 4 -chlorocatechol was further degraded via an ortho-cleavage pathway by the bacterial consortium. This hypothesis {{was supported by the}} results from enzyme assays of the crude cell extract of the consortium revealing catechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase activity which converted catechol and 4 -chlorocatechol to cis,cis-muconic acid and 3 -chloro-cis,cis-muconic acid respectively. However, the enzyme had a much higher conversion rate for catechol [156 U (g protein) (- 1) ] than for 4 -chlorocatechol [17. 2 U (g protein) (- 1) ], indicating preference for non-chlorinated <b>substrates.</b> <b>Members</b> of the bacterial consortium were also characterized individually. All isolates were able to assimilate aniline. P. corrugata SB 4 was able to grow on 4 CA solely, while S. maltophilia SB 5 was able to grow on 4 -chlorocatechol.

Toc 159 shares {{with other members of}} the family (e. g. Toc 132), homologous GTPase (G 2) and Membrane (M 2) domains, but a highly dissimilar N-terminal acidic (A 2) domain. Although there is good evidence that atToc 159 and atToc 132 from Arabidopsis mediate the initial sorting step, preferentially recognizing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic preproteins, respectively, relatively few chloroplast preproteins have been assigned as <b>substrates</b> for particular <b>members</b> of the Toc 159 family, which has limited the proof for the hypothesis. The current study expands the number of known preprotein <b>substrates</b> for <b>members</b> of the Arabidopsis Toc 159 receptor family using a split-ubiquitin membrane-based yeast two-hybrid system using the atToc 159 G-domain (Toc 159 G), atToc 132 G-domain (Toc 132 G) and atToc 132 A- plus G-domains (Toc 132 AG) as baits. cDNA library screening with all three baits followed by pairwise interaction assays involving the 81 chloroplast preproteins identified show that although G-domains of the Toc 159 family are sufficient for preprotein recognition, they alone do not confer specificity for preprotein subclasses. The presence of the A-domain fused to atToc 132 G (Toc 132 AG) not only positively influences its specificity for non-photosynthetic preproteins, but also negatively regulates the ability of this receptor to interact with a subset of photosynthetic preproteins.

The therapeutic compound 8 -methoxypsoralen was hydroxylated by plants overexpressing CYP 82 C 2 or CYP 82 C 4, forming 5 -hydroxy- 8 -methoxypsoralen. Additionally, plants further modified this product to create a glycosylated compound, likely the compound 5 -O-β-D-glucopyranosyl- 8 -methoxypsoralen. The discovery of adducts of therapeutic compounds demonstrates the potential of this biocatalysis screening approach to create compounds that may be of pharmacological value. Additionally, this platform provides a means to expand the general knowledge base of P 450 enzyme/substrate combinations and may provide valuable tools for a vast array of biocatalytic and bioremediation processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{amino acid}} L-arginine is an {{essential}} component of all living organisms. Its importance resides in the variety of functions that arginine itself, along with some intermediary metabolites involved in its de novo synthesis in the cell. In many prokaryotes, fungi, and plants the de novo biosynthesis of arginine proceeds from glutamate in eight enzymatic steps (Figure 2). The first committed step of this pathway is the N-acetylation of glutamate. Acetylation of the early precursors of arginine distinguishes them from the analogous intermediates in the biosynthesis of proline. Although each and every step of the pathway is essential for its completion, transcarbamylation of ornithine to produce citrulline is one of the crucial steps in the pathway. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC). The transcarbamylases family of enzymes belongs to the carboxyl- and carbamoyltransferases group, EC 2. 1. 3, a family that comprises enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a carbamoyl group from carbamylphosphate (CP) to an amino or oxygen group of a second <b>substrate.</b> <b>Members</b> of the transcarbamylase family can be identified based on sequence identities in the N-terminal or CP-binding domain as all the members of this family share common residues involved in the binding of CP to the enzyme. All the evolutionary conserved motifs present in the transcarbamylase family have led to the erroneous annotation of a large, yet increasing, number of genes as OTCases without experimental confirmation of such activity. The case of the transcarbamylase-like gene found in B. fragilis illustrates this statement. The present thesis work is focused in the case of two families of misannotated microbial transcarbamylases that have been identified as essential for arginine biosynthesis, but which lacked the ability to catalyze the conversion of ornithine into citrulline. The objectives of the present thesis work are the biochemical and molecular characterization of the N-acetylornithine transcarbamylase (AOTC) activity of XcArgF’ as well as the elucidation of the enzymatic activity of BfArgF’ and its biochemical and molecular characterization. We show that Xanthomonads and Bacteroidetes use novel pathways for the de novo arginine biosynthesis mediated by acetyl- and succinyl-ornithine transcarbamylases, we identify a recognition motif for these enzymes and we provide evidence supporting the view that the existence of succinyl-ornithine transcarbamylase requires that the first five steps of the arginine biosynthesis pathway use succinylated rather than acetylated intermediates...|$|R

40|$|Background: Gram-negative {{bacteria}} use periplasmic-binding proteins (bPBP) {{to transport}} nutrients through the periplasm. Despite immense diversity within the recognized <b>substrates,</b> all <b>members</b> {{of the family}} share a common fold that includes two domains that are separated by a conserved hinge. The hinge allows the protein to cycle between open (apo) and closed (ligated) conformations. Conformational changes within the proteins depend on a complex interplay of mechanical and thermodynamic response, which is manifested as an increase in thermal stability and decrease of flexibility upon ligand binding. Results: We use a distance constraint model (DCM) to quantify the give and take between thermodynamic stability and mechanical flexibility across the bPBP family. Quantitative stability/flexibility relationships (QSFR) are readily evaluated because the DCM links mechanical and thermodynamic properties. We have previously demonstrated that QSFR is moderately conserved across a mesophilic/thermophilic RNase H pair, whereas the observed variance indicated that different enthalpy-entropy mechanisms allow similar mechanical response at their respective melting temperatures. Our predictions of heat capacity and free energy show marked diversity across the bPBP family.

40|$|Granzymes, {{a family}} of serine proteases, are {{expressed}} exclusively by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, components {{of the immune system}} that protect higher organisms against viral infection and cellular transformation. Following receptor-mediated conjugate formation between a granzyme-containing cell and an infected or transformed target cell, granzymes enter the target cell via endocytosis and induce apoptosis.

Like caspases, cysteine proteases that {{play an important role in}} apoptosis, it can cleave proteins after acidic residues, especially aspartic acid. Other granzymes may serve additional functions, and some may not induce apoptosis. Granzymes have been well characterized only in human and rodents, and can be grouped into three subfamilies according to <b>substrate</b> specificity: <b>members</b> of the granzyme family that have enzymatic activity similar to the serine protease chymotrypsin are encoded by a gene cluster termed the ‘chymase locus’; granzymes with trypsin-like specificities are encoded by the ‘tryptase locus’; and a third subfamily cleaves after unbranched hydrophobic residues, especially methionine, and is encoded by the ‘Met-ase locus’. All granzymes are synthesized as zymogens and, after clipping of the leader peptide, maximal enzymatic activity is achieved by removal of an amino-terminal dipeptide. They can all be blocked by serine proteas...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth factor}} receptor-bound protein (Grb) 14 is an adapter {{molecule}} of the Grb 7 / 10 / 14 family with characteristic BPS domains serving to avidly bind tyrosine kinases. Grb 14 inhibits insulin receptor (IR) catalytic activity through {{interaction with the}} BPS domain and impedes peptide <b>substrate</b> binding. <b>Members</b> of this Grb family have {{also been shown to}} interact with other kinases through their SH 2 domain. Here we examined the functional role of Grb 14 in thyroid cancer using loss- and gain-of-function approaches. Stable knockdown of Grb 14 in thyroid cancer cells facilitated insulin receptor signaling. In contrast, RET phosphorylation was diminished in concert with reduced activation of Akt and STAT 3. Loss of Grb 14 also resulted in diminished cell proliferation and invasion both in vitro and in mouse flank xenografts. In complementary studies, forced expression of Grb 14 interrupted insulin receptor signaling but facilitated RET activation, STAT 3, and Akt phosphorylation. Consistent with these findings Grb 14 over-expression enhanced cell invasion and resulted in striking metastases in an orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse xenograft model. Primary human thyroid cancer microarrays revealed a positive correlation between Grb 14 expression and invasive behavior. Our findings uncover a new role for Grb 14 in finely tuning receptor signaling and modulating thyroid cancer progression...|$|R
40|$|High efficiency, multi-dimensional {{thin film}} vacuum tubes {{suitable}} for use in high temperature, high radiation environments are described. The tubes are fabricated by placing thin film electrode members in selected arrays on facing interior wall surfaces of an alumina <b>substrate</b> envelope. Cathode <b>members</b> are formed using thin films of triple carbonate. The photoresist used in photolithography aids in activation of the cathodes by carbonizing and reacting with the reduced carbonates when heated in vacuum during forming. The finely powdered triple carbonate is mixed with the photoresist used to delineate the cathode locations in the conventional solid state photolithographic manner. Anode and grid members are formed using thin films of refractory metal. Electron flow in the tubes is between grid elements from cathode to anode as in a conventional three-dimensional tube...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 214 {{members of the}} sugar porter (SP) family (TC 2. A. 1. 1) from eight hemiascomycetous yeasts: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis, Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii, Debaryomyces hansenii, Yarrowia lipolytica, Candida albicans and Pichia stipitis, were identified. The yeast SPs were {{classified}} in 13 different phylogenetic clusters. Specific sugar substrates could be allocated to nine phylogenetic clusters, including two novel TC clusters that are specific to fungi, i. e. the glycerol:H(+) symporter (2. A. 1. 1. 38) and the high-affinity glucose transporter (2. A. 1. 1. 39). Four phylogenetic clusters are identified by the preliminary fifth number Z 23, Z 24, Z 25 and Z 26 and the <b>substrates</b> of their <b>members</b> remain undetermined. The amplification of the SP clusters across the Hemiascomycetes reflects adaptation to specific carbon and energy sources available in the habitat of each yeast species...|$|R
