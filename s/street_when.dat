5|$|Marquette's {{founding}} settlers {{arrived in}} the area on May 18, 1849, to establish the community, and the original thoroughfares were platted by 1855, including Washington and Front streets. The widest street in the city at , Baraga Avenue {{was intended to be}} the Marquette's main <b>street</b> <b>when</b> the downtown area was originally laid out, but businesses centered their locations along Washington Street instead. The community was incorporated as a village in 1859, and it was later reincorporated as a city on February 21, 1871. The original city hall was built in 1895 on Washington Street, and in 1910, the city started paving its streets, replacing wooden planks with asphalt.|$|E

5|$|At 22 Mile Road, M-48 turns {{westerly}} and M-129 continues north. This intersection is {{also the}} location of the Munscong Golf Club. M-129 meets the eastern termini of M-80 and M-28 at 17 Mile Road and 9 Mile Road, respectively. Just before meeting 9 Mile Road, M-129 jogs to the east, leaving Meridian Road to meet up with McKnight Road, which runs parallel to the Michigan Meridian. McKnight Road and I-75 run roughly parallel approaching Sault Ste. Marie from the south. At 3 Mile Road, M-129 enters the city of Sault Ste. Marie east of the southern terminus of BS I-75, and the roadway is renamed Ashmun <b>Street.</b> <b>When</b> BS I-75 meets Ashmun Street, M-129 ends and BS I-75 takes over the Ashmun Street name into downtown. M-129 ends south of the Lake Superior State University campus, home of the annual Banished Words List.|$|E
5|$|Clearances around Albion Hill {{began in}} the 1950s. From 1959, the narrow, densely {{populated}} terraces between Albion Hill and Morley Street were cleared and replaced with landscaped open space and seven tower blocks—Brighton's first such buildings. The first, Highleigh, opened on 11 May 1961. Like its later neighbours, it has 11 storeys. The steep Richmond Street was severed {{as part of this}} redevelopment; its lower section was replaced by a zig-zag path down the hillside and a short road called Richmond Parade, and new roads (Grove Hill and Ashton Rise) were built between the tower blocks and across the slope of the hill. Similarly, the lowest section of Carlton Hill was renamed Kingswood <b>Street</b> <b>when</b> it was redeveloped in the 1960s: Brighton Art College (now part of the University of Brighton) was extended in 1967 by Brighton borough architect Percy Billington, taking up a large corner plot.|$|E
5|$|In Saginaw, the two {{parallel}} streets continue east and meet M-84 which runs north–south along Bay Street. The {{distance between the}} {{two parallel}} streets decreases east of North Carolina <b>Street</b> <b>when</b> Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street {{marks the beginning of}} the connections to the exit3 interchange along a bend in the I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic northbound under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to northbound I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58.|$|E

5|$|St. Rynagh's National School (NS) caters for {{children}} between the ages of 4 and 12 and accommodates approximately 200 students. Secondary education is provided by Banagher College (Coláiste na Sionna), a multi denominational school under the responsibility of Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board. Banagher College is an amalgamation of La Sainte Union Secondary School and St. Rynagh's Community College. La Sainte Union is a voluntary Catholic School run by the Sisters of La Sainte-Union des Sacrés-Coeurs, a congregation founded in France in 1826 by Abbé Jean-Baptiste Debrabant to promote Christian education. The school was their first in Ireland and opened its doors in 1863 in a house on Main <b>Street</b> <b>when</b> the Abbé arrived with Mother Anatolie Badger and three sisters of the order.|$|E
5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd <b>Street.</b> <b>When</b> that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
