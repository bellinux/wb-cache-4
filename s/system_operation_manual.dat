5000|$|Whilst the TCAS is {{programmed}} {{to assume that}} both crews will promptly follow the <b>system's</b> instructions, the <b>operations</b> <b>manual</b> did not clearly state that TCAS should always take precedence over any ATC commands. The manual described TCAS as [...] "a backup to the ATC system", which could be wrongly interpreted to mean that ATC instructions have higher priority. This ambiguity was replicated in the Tu-154 Flight <b>Operations</b> <b>Manual,</b> which contained contradictory sections. On the one hand, chapter 8.18.3.4 emphasized {{the role of the}} ATC and describes the TCAS as an [...] "additional aid", whilst chapter 8.18.3.2 forbade manoeuvers contrary to the TCAS. The BFU recommended that this ambiguity should be resolved in favor of obeying TCAS advisories even when these were in conflict with ATC instructions.|$|R

While exceeding this level, a distinct increase of the amount of seepage water occurs. This correlation directly influences the plant’s operational mode (see “Manual vs. full automated operation”and “Evaluation of the plant’s utilization”) since storage levels beyond 15  m shall be avoided as far as possible. Both, the plant’s technical adaption (e.g., implementation of an adapted control <b>system</b> for <b>manual</b> <b>operation)</b> as well as the training of the operating personnel focused on this safety related issue.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Now-a-days power {{management}} plays {{a vital role}} in reducing the consumption and efficient utilization of the resource. In traditional <b>system,</b> <b>manual</b> <b>operation</b> of electrical devices in university gets unnoticed, that leads to maximum wastage of power i. e., with different device operating even when the classroom is abandoned. These extended hours of operation leads to maximum power wastage. In order to overcome this problem, we have designed a "smart and intelligent power saving system for Indian Universities", where every classroom is equipped with passive infrared sensor (PIR) which responds to occupancy, and corresponding devices are switched ON /OFF automatically. The entire system is monitored and controlled by the central base station...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to establish how non-adherence of Amathole District development projects to the Department of Social Development’s Community Development Systems and Operational Manual has contributed to failure of these projects. The background to this research lies in the deliberate policy efforts of the post 1994 democratic dispensation in South Africa to drive development through community-based development approaches. Explicitly pro-poor public policies, development plans and fiscal frameworks were anchored on the concept of community empowerment. The Reconstruction and Development Programme was the first such policy and strategy framework that sought to enshrine the principles of community empowerment and participation. As such, Provincial and Local government are often seen as key strategic drivers of community empowerment initiatives and interventions. South Africa’s governance model is still evolving, but it is clearly committed to local development and service delivery through a decentralised system of government that espouses community involvement. Government strategy has been heavily focused on speed and delivery {{in order to deal with}} the historical socio-economic backlogs it inherited. In the focus area of youth development projects, one recognises that poor management has dramatically reduced the effectiveness of many interventions. This research explores how non-adherence of these projects to policy guidelines set out in the Community Development <b>Systems</b> and <b>Operations</b> <b>Manual</b> has contributed to their failure. The research does this by looking at the various management procedures that are supposed to be undertaken during both the initial planning phases and during the subsequent implementation phases of youth development projects. Actual methodologies are compared against this standard. The research is undoubtedly a contribution to the field of strategic management of youth development initiatives which have as their primary intention the reduction of youth unemployment. Research surveys on this topic are limited, and the objective is to enrich the discourse on effective youth projects management practices...|$|R
