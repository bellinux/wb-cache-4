5|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family, Nurmi left school at 12 {{to provide for}} his family. In 1912, he was {{inspired}} by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military <b>service,</b> <b>setting</b> national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.|$|E
25|$|Titov wrote {{more than}} 200 compositions, {{all of them}} vocal music. They include {{complete}} settings of Divine Services (Sluzhby Bozhie, Службы Божие) and a psalter (by Simeon Polotsky), as well as numerous vocal concertos for feast days. His works range from short, three-voice pieces to large-scale compositions for 12- and 24-voice choirs. Titov {{was one of the}} most important followers of Nikolay Diletsky's Idea grammatiki musikiiskoi (1679), an influential treatise on composition. Znamenny Chant was another important influence on Titov's work: he even wrote a <b>Service</b> <b>setting</b> based entirely on the chant.|$|E
25|$|Treatments in {{psychiatric}} emergency service settings are typically transitory {{in nature and}} only exist to provide dispositional solutions and/or to stabilize life-threatening conditions. Once stabilized, patients suffering chronic conditions may be transferred to a setting which can provide long term psychiatric rehabilitation. Prescribed treatments within the emergency <b>service</b> <b>setting</b> vary dependent upon the patient's condition. Different forms of psychiatric medication, psychotherapy, or electroconvulsive therapy {{may be used in}} the emergency setting. The introduction and efficacy of psychiatric medication as a treatment option in psychiatry has reduced the utilization of physical restraints in emergency settings, by reducing dangerous symptoms resulting from acute exacerbation of mental illness or substance intoxication.|$|E

50|$|A basic <b>service</b> <b>set</b> {{consists}} of one access point and several wireless clients. An extended <b>service</b> <b>set</b> is a configuration with multiple access points and roaming capabilities for the clients. An independent basic <b>service</b> <b>set</b> or IBSS is {{the ad hoc}} configuration. This configuration allows wireless clients to connect to each other directly, without an access point as a central manager.|$|R
25|$|Involuntary commitment, or sectioning, {{refers to}} {{situations}} where police officers, health officers, or health professionals classify an individual as dangerous to themselves, others, gravely disabled, or mentally ill {{according to the}} applicable government law for the region. After an individual is transported to a psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>setting,</b> a preliminary professional assessment is completed {{which may or may}} not result in involuntary treatment. Some patients may be discharged shortly after being brought to psychiatric emergency services while others will require longer observation and the need for continued involuntary commitment will exist. While some patients may initially come voluntarily, it may be realized that they pose a risk to themselves or others and involuntary commitment may be initiated at that point.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{psychotic}} {{symptoms are}} common in psychiatric emergency service settings. The determination {{of the source of}} the psychosis can be difficult. Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency <b>service</b> <b>setting</b> {{will not be able to}} provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.|$|E
25|$|Byrd's {{output of}} about 470 {{compositions}} amply justifies {{his reputation as}} one of the great masters of European Renaissance music. Perhaps his most impressive achievement as a composer was his ability to transform so many of the main musical forms of his day and stamp them with his own identity. Having grown up in an age in which Latin polyphony was largely confined to liturgical items for the Sarum rite, he assimilated and mastered the Continental motet form of his day, employing a highly personal synthesis of English and continental models. He virtually created the Tudor consort and keyboard fantasia, having only the most primitive models to follow. He also raised the consort song, the church anthem and the Anglican <b>service</b> <b>setting</b> to new heights. Finally, despite a general aversion to the madrigal, he succeeded in cultivating secular vocal music in an impressive variety of forms in his three sets of 1588, 1589 and 1611.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} networking, a <b>service</b> <b>set</b> (SS) {{is a set}} {{consisting of}} all the devices associated with a consumer or enterprise IEEE 802.11 {{wireless local area network}} (WLAN). The <b>service</b> <b>set</b> can be local, independent, extended or mesh.|$|R

2500|$|Byrd's staunch {{adherence}} to Catholicism {{did not prevent}} him from contributing memorably to the repertory of Anglican church music. Byrd's small output of church anthems ranges in style from relatively sober early examples (O Lord, make thy servant Elizabeth our queen (a6) and How long shall mine enemies (a5) [...] ) to other, evidently late works such as Sing joyfully (a6) which is close in style to the English motets of Byrd's 1611 set, discussed below. Byrd {{also played a role}} in the emergence of the new verse anthem, which seems to have evolved in part from the practice of adding vocal refrains to consort songs. Byrd's four Anglican service settings range in style from the unpretentious Short Service, already discussed, to the magnificent so-called Great Service, a grandiose work which continues a tradition of opulent settings by Richard Farrant, William Mundy and Robert Parsons. Byrd's setting is on a massive scale, requiring five-part Decani and Cantoris groupings in antiphony, block homophony and five, six and eight-part counterpoint with verse (solo) sections for added variety. This <b>service</b> <b>setting,</b> which includes an organ part, must have been sung by the Chapel Royal Choir on major liturgical occasions in the early seventeenth century, though its limited circulation suggests that many other cathedral choirs must have found it beyond them. Nevertheless, the source material shows that it was sung in York Minster as well as Durham, Worcester and Cambridge, in the early seventeenth century.. The Great Service was in existence by 1606 (the last copying date entered in the [...] so-called Baldwin Commonplace Book) and may date back as far as the 1590s. Kerry McCarthy has pointed out that the York Minster manuscript of the Great Service was copied by a vicar-choral named John Todd, apparently between 1597–99, and is described as 'Mr Byrd's new sute of service for means'. [...] This suggests the possibility that the work may have been Byrd's next compositional project after the three Mass settings.|$|E
