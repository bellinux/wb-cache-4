Additionally, Epic's tech was also being used by a top five defense contractor and a national laboratory for custom-made model integrations and visualization. Later in December, defense IT and software firm IPKeys Technologies licensed the third version of the engine for development of I-GAME, a tool intended to train tactics and techniques in regards to Counter-IEDs.|$|E

25|$|By October 2007 {{the elders}} and mullahs of the Kamdesh area had been {{inspired}} by Rahman to gather at Kamdesh for a mass meeting, or shura to plan the future of Nuristan. This series of meetings over two days involved more than 800 representatives {{of the people of}} Nuristan, and had the goal of bringing order and economic development to the region. The village leaders elected a representative council of 100 members to form a shura that would produce a regional security plan and obtain an agreement with the American military and the Afghan Karzai government. This agreement would recognize the authority of the Hundred Man Shura, and provide funds for economic development. Formalized as “The Commitment of Mutual Support” the agreement also provided the Shura would provide local security in return for an end to uninvited American military searches of local towns and mosques. From November through January 2008 members of the Shura traveled the villages of the Kamdesh area, informing the residents of the <b>support</b> <b>agreement</b> and stating that the era of holy war was over, and that local government would bring peace and prosperity. This agreement did bring down the level of combat in the Kamdesh area. In the year that followed the agreement, ANA and American deaths dropped from thirty to three.|$|E

2500|$|The Danskammer plant {{sale was}} far more troubled. The plant was heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{rendering}} it inoperable. On December 10, Dynegy said that ICS NY Holdings would buy the plant for $3.5 million and demolish it. But the ICS sale stalled. Under {{the terms of the}} auction, ICS NY had to replace or find a substitute for its credit <b>support</b> <b>agreement,</b> and pay its portion of the plant's outstanding property taxes. But, Dynegy said, the company never did either. [...] ICS defended itself, saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement. On May 25, 2013, Dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ICA to fulfill its obligations. The court imposed a July 31 deadline for ICS to close the sale, but it did not meet the deadline. Dynegy subsequently sought another buyer. Helios Power Capital, a private equity firm, agreed to purchase the plant for $3.5 million in cash on August 20. The court approved the sale on September 2.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{enactment}} of the twenty-sixth amendment to the United States Constitution, most states passed legislation lowering the age of majority from twenty-one to eighteen. A crucial question arising from these statutes is whether they affect or should affect child support settlements which provide for support to the child until he or she reaches the age of majority. This note discusses the key question whether children have a continuing right to support until age twenty-one under settlements resulting from divorce decrees and agreements made prior to {{the enactment}} of the new age of majority laws. The note analyzes the conflicts among state court decisions as to: (1) child support mandated by judicial decrees; (2) child <b>support</b> <b>agreements</b> pursuant to separation agreements or property settlements; and (3) child <b>support</b> <b>agreements</b> incorporated into divorce decrees. The note concludes that there is little agreement as to the effect of the age of majority statutes on existing support settlements but suggests that courts should not forget that even person between the age of eighteen and twenty-one are encumbered with numerous economic disabilities...|$|R
