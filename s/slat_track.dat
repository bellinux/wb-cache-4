50|$|Due to the accident, on August 25, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered {{emergency}} {{inspections of}} wing leading-edge slat tracks on all Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft. The Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) from the FAA requires operators {{to inspect the}} <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> downstop to check for missing parts, ensure proper installation, and check {{the inside of the}} slat can for foreign object debris and damage. The directive requires operators to inspect within 24 days and every 3000 flight cycles thereafter. Following feedback from completed inspections revealing loose parts in several other aircraft and one with a damaged slat can, the FAA issued a new emergency airworthiness directive on August 28. Airlines were then required to perform the inspection on Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft within 10 days instead of 24 days. In addition, the AD required a one-time torquing of the nut and bolt in the downstop assembly for the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> within 24 days.|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the major}} {{contributors}} to aircraft noise, the noise generated by high-lift devices has been explored for many years. However, the noise related to the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> system, which includes all the extrusive components connecting the slat and the main element, is still generally studied through experimentation due to the complex geometry. In this project, the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> and cut-out, especially the main element cut-out, were investigated through numerical simulations for the first time. Two methods were employed in this work. Noise propagation is first studied via a compact source model to evaluate the contribution of each source individually and to investigate the influence of the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> system on the noise propagation in the slat region. The APE-IV system was employed but modified by using a more accurate expression of enthalpy perturbation to calculate the acoustic fields. The results show that both the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> system and the background flow modify the sound propagation path. The energy radiated towards the ground is increased due to the interaction of sound waves with the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> system and the background flow. Detached eddy simulations were run to investigate the mechanisms of the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> and cut-out noise generation. Major noise sources in the slat cove region are identified and a noise generation feedback loop is proposed. The results show that the increment of noise levels due to the existence of the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> system is two-fold. The <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> and the cut-out generate noise individually and they also amplify the noise generated within the slat region when the sound waves propagate though the slat cove area and interact with the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> and cut-out. The dominant frequencies of the spectrum are seen to shift towards the high frequencies due to these added on components. In this work, two kinds of possible noise attenuation approaches were proposed and studied. Geometries based on replacing the sharp cut-out on the main element leading edge with an edge-rounded or a sealed cut-out have been proved to be able to reduce the cut-out noise significantly. Application of acoustic bulk absorbing material can also attenuate the cut-out noise efficiently for a certain range of frequencies...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} numerical {{studies by}} DLR {{devoted to the}} computation of the DLR F- 11 high lift configuration {{as part of the}} 2 nd phase of the AIAA High Lift Prediction Workshop. The model geometry is representative for a wide-body commercial aircraft with a classical three element high lift system at the wing leading and trailing edge in a landing setting. Being a follow-up of the NASA Trapezoidal wing of the 1 st phase of the workshop, the F- 11 wing/body wind tunnel model features only a modest overall complexity increase in the basic set-up. Yet, the most complex geometry representation includes model details, such as <b>slat</b> <b>tracks,</b> flap track fairings, and pressure tube bundles. According to the available experimental evidence, low and high Reynolds numbers have been investigated. In addition to force, moment, and pressure distributions, surface streamlines have been analyzed. The studies have been carried out using the DLR TAU code in conjunction with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in the original formulation. DLR contributed to the grid generation activities by providing a set of hexahedral-based hybrid unstructured grids for all complexity stages and both Reynolds-numbers. For the most simplified configuration, a family of three grids has been generated to study grid resolution aspects. In general, a good agreement to the experimental data is obtained. It turns out that for the present wind tunnel configuration, the inclusion geometry details of the wind tunnel model, such as <b>slat</b> <b>tracks</b> and even pressure tube bundles, is essential for the agreement to the experimental evidence and the prediction of maximum lift...|$|R
40|$|Effects of the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> and cut-out on noise {{propagation}} were investigated using compact source models for a high-lift wing. Two different geometries of the high-lift devices, {{with and without}} the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> and cut-out, were investigated. Convection effects were also considered with the mean flows obtained from precursor simulations of corresponding high-lift configurations. Major noise sources in the slat cove region were modelled with equivalent compact dipoles placed along the slat trailing edge and cusp. Results show that sound propagation is modified by the add-on components. The acoustic waves are amplified significantly and radiate more energy towards the ground due to the interaction between propagating waves and the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> and cut-out. Although the cancellation caused by interference of the radiated and reflected waves happens {{in both of these}} configurations especially in the downwards direction, it is more prominent once sound waves pass the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> and cut-out. Wave cancellation is also significant when the wavelength is comparable {{to the size of the}} barrier such as the gap between the slat and the main element. It is also noticed that higher frequencies radiate large proportion of energy towards ground for the sources at slat cusp...|$|E

A two step computational procedure which involves the solution of Navier-Stokes equations in the first-step and an integral surface solution of the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equation in the subsequent step, is used to predict the far-field noise. Two main approaches are used for the computational work in this project. Firstly, the simulations based on the Linearized Euler Equations and the Acoustic Perturbation Equations are used in two- and three-dimensions to understand the effect of the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> on the acoustic wave propagation. Dipoles and quadrupole are used as the simulated acoustic source. Also the effect of the mean flow in the wave propagation is studies by including a background mean flow in the APE simulations.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} a high lift segment using an unstructured RANS method shows, that a <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> can have a significant influence on the overall aerodynamic properties. Two track types are considered, one which is representative of a wind tunnel model, and a second one derived from an aircraft track. The major differences are the larger cross-section area of the model track, and the intersection with the fixed wing. The high lift devices are positioned in a landing setting. The onflow conditions refer to wind tunnel conditions. Periodic lateral boundary conditions are applied. Compared to a reference high lift wing segment without track, a 10 % increase in lift and a 20 % increase in drag is being computed for the model track. For the aircraft track only a minor lift change is found, but also a 20 % drag increase. Based {{on the outcome of}} the present investigations, the major impact of the lift is caused by the downstream shift of the stagnation line {{in the vicinity of the}} junction of the model track and the fixed wing...|$|E

40|$|Maraging steels {{have got}} high {{strength}} and good toughness. Maraging steel MDN 250 A grade {{is used for}} <b>slat</b> <b>tracks</b> {{on the leading edge}} of the wing of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). This application requires high strength and good wear resistance. Required wear resistance for this application can be achieved by ion-nitriding (also called as Plasma nitriding or Glow discharge nitriding) process of case hardening. In conventional gas nitriding process the nitriding temperature is 500 – 550 0 C, which is above the aging temperature of maraging steel. Ion-nitriding at temperatures lower than 480 0 C is thought to be suitable for surface hardening for application of this material in <b>slat</b> <b>tracks</b> of {{the leading edge of the}} wing of LCA. Besides this ion-nitriding is stated to improve fatigue & wear resistance properties without significantly affecting other properties. Also this is a process where the thickness requirement is minimum for the wear properties accomplished. Further, no distortion, warpage and such other dimensional inhomogeneity problems are encountered. In ion-nitriding method glow discharge technology is used to introduce nascent (elemental) nitrogen to the surface of a metal part for subsequent diffusion into the material. The plasma assisted surface modification techniques offer a great flexibility and are capable in tailoring desirable chemical and structural surface properties independent of the bulk properties. It has other advantages like nil or very thin white layer after nitriding and there is no machining or grinding involved for complex parts after the process. The hardened surface layers become an integral part of the basic material without any significant reduction in the properties of base material. Aim of the present work is to study ion-nitriding process on Maraging steels, to carry out ion nitriding of Maraging steel MDN 250 A grade at different temperatures and evaluation of properties. Presently, the ion-nitrided <b>slat</b> <b>tracks</b> have been cleared for limited usage instead of full expected life. Studies are also needed to understand the fatigue behavior upon nitriding. The main aspects considered in this study are, optimization of thickness of the ion-nitrided layer and properties required for aircraft applications like <b>slat</b> <b>tracks</b> on the leading edge of the wing where wear resistance, corrosion resistance, mechanical properties like tensile strength, impact strength and fatigue strength are important. To establish the variation in the basic properties of maraging steel (MDN 250 A Grade) because of ion nitriding. Aging of Maraging steel is done at 480 ± 5 0 C with very close temperature control. In industrial ion-nitriding furnaces the temperature control is of the order of ± 10 0 C. As a part of this research work ion-nitriding at three different temperatures which are well below 480 0 C were chosen. These temperatures are 435 0 C, 450 0 C and 465 0 C and soaking time i. e., ion-nitriding duration is 10 hours. Microstructure is characterized using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope and X-ray Diffraction. Properties evaluated include Hardness, Case depth, Tensile, Low Cycle Fatigue, Impact and Corrosion by Salt Spray. Optical microscopy and SEM examination don’t show change in core microstructure of the material after ion-nitriding. The iron compound formed in the hardened layer is Fe 4 N for all the three nitriding temperatures. Ion-nitrided specimens exhibit higher surface hardness and good case depth. Salt spray test results shows that there is animprovement in corrosion resistance after nitriding. The nitrided samples shown higher UTS and 0. 2 % PS values than un nitrided ones, where as % Elongation and % Reduction in Area are lower for nitrided samples as compared to un nitrided samples. This can be attributed to the surface layer getting hardened because of ion nitriding. Impact strength of nitrided samples is lower compared to un nitrided samples. This is again due to the surface layer getting hardened because of ion nitriding. Low cycle fatigue properties obtained on ion-nitrided samples show improvement in the fatigue strength due to introduction of the residual compressive stresses. The mechanical properties satisfy the design requirements. Thus ion-nitriding of this Maraging steel (MDN 250 A Grade) is suitable for parts which are subjected to constant wear and are complex in shape...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, ion {{nitriding}} of Maraging steel (250 grade) {{has been carried}} out at three different temperatures i. e., at 435 degrees C, 450 degrees C and 465 degrees C for 10 h duration in order to achieve good wear resistance along with high strength required for the <b>slat</b> <b>track</b> component of aircraft. The microstructure of the base material and the nitrided layer was examined by optical and scanning electron microscope, and various phases present were determined by X-ray diffraction. Various properties, such as, hardness, case depth, tensile, impact, fatigue properties and corrosion resistance were investigated for both un-nitrided and ion-nitrided materials. It is observed that the microstructure of the core material remains unaltered and Fe 4 N is formed in the hardened surface layer after ion nitriding at all the three temperatures employed. Surface hardness increases substantially after ion nitriding. Surface hardness remains almost the same but case depth increases with the increase in ion nitriding temperature due to greater diffusivity at higher temperatures. Tensile strength, fatigue strength and corrosion resistance are improved but ductility and energy absorbed in impact test decrease on ion nitriding. These results are explained on the basis of microstructural observations. The properties obtained after ion nitriding at 450 degrees C for 10 h are found to be optimum when compared to the other two ion nitriding temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Localization is {{essential}} for a soccer robot to deter-mine the kicking direction. However, {{one of the key}} challenges of SPL this year is that both of the goal posts are in yellow, which makes the field symmetric. Local-ization using map features could often generate two fea-sible solutions. This problem is especially critical when the robot is around the center of the field as the loca-tions of the two symmetric solutions are close to each other in which the state-of-the-art localization ap-proaches such as particle filtering could still fail. For instance, if a robot were unwarily turned 180 degrees around the center circle due to the collision with the other robots, it would be very challenging for the robot to select the correct localization solution from the two ambiguous ones using the map features only. While the map features are symmetric, {{it is unlikely that the}} positions of all robots in the field are symmetric.

In this case, the SLAT performance limits are crucial for the SLAT algorithm design and WSN deployment, and the study of localization EP principle is desirable. In this paper, we focus on the EP issues for the received signal strength-based SLAT scheme, where the measurement accuracy is assumed to be spatialtemporal- domain doubly random due to the target mobility, environment dynamics and different surroundings at different reference nodes. Firstly, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to unveil both the target tracking EP and the node location calibration EP. In both cases, the EP principles turn out to be in a consistent form of the Ohm’s Law in circuit theory. Secondly, the asymptotic CRLB analysis is then presented to reveal that both EP principles scale with the inverse of sensor node density. Meanwhile, it is shown that, the tracking and calibration accuracy only depends on the expectation of the measurement precision. Thirdly, the convergence conditions, convergence properties and the balance state of the target tracking EP and the location calibration EP are examined to shed light on the EP characteristics of the SLAT scheme.

Knowledge about nematode behavior can be applied as a model to study the physiological addiction process or other nervous system processes in animals and humans. Tracking is performed by using a special manipulator positioning a microscope with a camera over a dish with an observed individual. In the paper, the accuracy of a nematode’s trajectory reconstruction is investigated. Special {{attention is paid to}} analyzing errors that occurred during the microscope displacements. Two sources of errors in the trajectory reconstruction are shown.

The method Simultaneously Localizes And <b>Tracks</b> (<b>SLAT)</b> the nematodes, and is robust to the positioning system displacement errors. The proposed method predicts the nematode position by using NonParametric Regression (NPR). In addition, two other methods of the SLAT problem are implemented to evaluate the NPR method.

One of the established methods for achieving this is to iteratively maximize a likelihood function (ML) of positions given the ob-served ranges, which requires initialization with an approximate solution to avoid convergence towards local extrema. This paper develops methods for handling both Gaussian and Laplacian noise, the latter modeling the presence of outliers in some prac-tical ranging systems that adversely affect the performance of localization algorithms designed for Gaussian noise. A modified Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) completion problem is solved for a block of target range measurements to approximately set up initial sensor/target positions, and the likelihood function is then iteratively refined through majorization-minimization (MM). To avoid the computational burden of repeatedly solving increasingly large EDM problems in time-recursive operation, an incremental scheme is exploited whereby a new target/node position is esti-mated from previously available node/target locations to set up the iterative ML initial point for the full spatial configuration. The above methods are first derived under Gaussian noise assump-tions, and modifications for Laplacian noise are then considered. Analytically, the main challenges to overcome in the Laplacian case stem from the non-differentiability of norms that arise in the various cost functions.
