While {{investigating}} a <b>sand</b> <b>pit,</b> they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E

40|$|Remote sensing {{images are}} a {{valuable}} tool to monitor {{the environmental impacts of}} the mining activity of <b>sand</b> <b>pits.</b> It has often been used to monitor the sector of the Paraíba do Sul River valley located in São Paulo State. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the spatial increase of <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> mining activity between 2004 and 2008 using cloud free Landsat- 5 TM images acquired in April and August of 2008 and a base map carried out in 2004 for comparison. Images were resampled to a 10 x 10 pixel size to improve visual image quality in order to better identify the <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> during the visual interpretation on the computer screen. The official Environmental Zoning for Mining Activity, elaborated by the São Paulo State Environmental Secretary, was used to evaluate legal and illegal mining activities. The results showed an increase of 30 % of the total <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> size which corresponds to 513 ha. It was also observed that 58. 2 % of the total explored area of <b>sand</b> <b>pits</b> were located in illegal areas according to the Environmental Zoning for Mining Activity.

500|$|Following the war, Smythe {{returned}} to Toronto. With his accrued Army salary and {{the proceeds from}} the sale of his homestead plot, he [...] started a sand and gravel business. For a while, the business became a partnership with Frank Angotti, who owned a paving business. To support the need for sand and gravel, Smythe bought land northwest of Toronto for a <b>sand</b> <b>pit.</b> He {{returned to}} the University of Toronto and finished his civil engineering degree in 1920. Irene and Conn were married during the school year. Smythe and his paving business partner split, and Smythe retained the sand and gravel business. The company was named C. Smythe Limited and the company slogan was [...] "C. Smythe for sand", which he had painted on his trucks, the lettering in white on the blue of the trucks. Frank Selke, who had moved to Toronto, was one of Smythe's first employees in the business. Irene took sand and gravel orders over the phone as well as taking care of newborn son Stafford. Smythe would own the business until 1961.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the main line, there were 11 branches and spurs, totaling [...] At Lillesand Station, there was a station building, a wagon depot, a locomotive depot and tracks to the docks. At Møglestu, there was an extra parallel track and at Sandvad, there was a branch to a gravel pit. Extra tracks were laid at Storemyr for parking of wagons and at Ydderstad, there was a spur to load lumber. At Eikeland there three spurs, including one [...] long to a stone quarry. At Jordbruna, there was a spur for loading lumber, and at Tveite, there were three spurs, of which two went to the <b>sand</b> <b>pit</b> at Moelva and one to Myhre Torvstrøfabrikk. North of Tveite, there was a spur to leave part of the train if the locomotive needed to take two trips to get up the hill. At Birkeland Station, there were two extra tracks, one for stationing cargo trains and one to the sawmill. At Flaksvand Station, there were five tracks, of which three were at the station, one to the sawmill and for loading lumber.|$|E

2500|$|By 1904 {{the area}} was {{recognised}} {{as a source of}} gravel and pits were established by 1907, especially on the east bank, and continue to produce aggregates and take in clean fill. Other landfilling ended in 2006, when a 1999 consent for a Hamilton City Council landfill expired. It had been started in October 1985 on a [...] <b>sand</b> <b>pit</b> (worked from about 1970 to 2000) and was replaced by Hampton Downs. It was closed earlier than originally planned, due to leachate problems. The 1999 consent required use of a vacuum to extract gas from the bores and leachate. Therefore, from November 2004 until 2012, when the emissions declined, methane from the landfill ran a 900kWe Waukesha VHP5904LTD Enginator gas engine generator set.|$|E
2500|$|Irregular cast silver ingots {{circulated}} {{from about}} 11th to early 12th centuries. Only one such example is known from Lithuania, found in 1938 in Graužiai. Around {{the second half}} of the 12th century, supply of minted Western European coins dried up and there was no centralized power in Eastern Europe to take up coin mintage. The period is known as [...] "coinless period". However, merchants needed a means of exchange. Therefore, a local system of cast silver ingots was developed. While silver was imported (there are no silver mines in the region; the main mining area was in the Upper Harz in Germany), the ingots were cast locally. At first, a wax model was created. Then it was coated with clay and fired in a furnace inside a clay or <b>sand</b> <b>pit.</b> The wax would melt leaving a mold for the ingot. Molten silver was poured into the mold using a special clay scoop. After cooling off, the mold was broken to remove the ingot. Therefore, most molds were one-time use though a few examples of ingots are known that were cast using the same mold. Because of this technique, archaeologists have not discovered any furnaces or molds, only clay spoons and pouring cups.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1870s {{she began}} {{an affair with}} the Mexican lawyer and {{entrepreneur}} Julián Montiel y Duarte, which caused a scandal in Mexico City. The city's social elite boycotted her performances and hired hecklers to harass her during performances. Her reputation recovered following her performance in Linda di Chamounix, but she kept her vow never to sing in Mexico City again. In 1883, with her reputation (and economic situation) again in decline, she began a tour of northern Mexico with her troupe of Italian opera singers. The tour began in Guaymas and proceeded to La Paz, Baja California Sur. It was in La Paz that she sang {{for the last time}} on stage [...] the title role in Maria di Rohan [...] with the performance taking place in a theatre improvised from a disused <b>sand</b> <b>pit.</b> On 22 August, the troupe arrived in the port city of Mazatlán, where they were to perform Il trovatore and Aida. The city of Mazatlán prepared an elaborate welcome for her. Her boat docked at a pier decorated with garlands of flowers, and she was greeted by a band playing the Mexican National Anthem. When her carriage arrived, her admirers unhitched the horses and pulled it themselves to the Hotel Iturbide, where she once again saluted the crowds from her balcony. However, within a few days, she and 76 of the troupe's 80 members were to die in the yellow fever epidemic that swept the city shortly after their arrival.|$|E
