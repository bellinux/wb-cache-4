50|$|Quinimax and {{quinidine}} are the {{two most}} commonly used alkaloids related to quinine in the treatment or prevention of malaria. Quinimax is a combination of four alkaloids (quinine, quinidine, cinchoine and cinchonidine). This combination has been shown in several studies to be more effective than quinine, supposedly due to a <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> between the four cinchona derivatives. Quinidine is a direct derivative of quinine. It is a distereoisomer, thus having similar anti-malarial properties to the parent compound. Quinidine is recommended only for the treatment of severe cases of malaria.|$|E
50|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking {{is a phenomenon}} where a <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of corrosion and tensile stress leads to brittle fracture of normally ductile materials at generally lower stress levels.

Season cracking and caustic embrittlement are two stress corrosion cracking processes which affected the serviceability of brass cartridge cases and riveted steel boilers respectively.|$|E
40|$|Tocotrienols (T 3 s), {{members of}} the vitamin E family, exhibit potent anti-cancer, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and some other {{biological}} activities. To better understand the bioavailability and metabolism of T 3 s, T 3 s and their metabolites were identified in urine and fecal samples from mice on diet supplemented with mixed T 3 s using HPLC/electrochemical detection and liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (LC–ESI–MS). Whereas the short-chain metabolites carboxyethyl hydroxychromans (CEHCs) and carboxymethylbutyl hydroxychromans (CMBHCs) were the major metabolites of T 3 s, several new metabolites with double bonds were also identified. Similar to tocopherols, the majority of T 3 metabolites were excreted as sulfate/glucuronide conjugates in mouse urine. The distribution of γ- and δ-T 3 and γ-T 3 metabolites were also determined in different organs {{as well as in}} urine and fecal samples from mice on diets supplemented with corresponding T 3 s. The <b>synergistic</b> anti-cancer <b>actions</b> of γ-T 3 and atorvastatin (ATST) were studied in HT 29 and HCT 116 colon cancer cell lines. The combination greatly potentiated the ability of each individual agent to inhibit cancer cell growth and to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The triple combination of γ-T 3, ATST, and celecoxib exhibited <b>synergistic</b> <b>actions</b> when compared with any double combination plus the third agent. Mechanistic studies revealed that the <b>synergistic</b> <b>actions</b> of γ-T 3 and ATST could be attributed to their mediation of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, and the subsequent inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation. It remains to be determined whether such a synergy occurs in vivo...|$|R

5000|$|In the Bernard group's {{study of}} 226 {{children}} in Brussels and the Ardenne region in 2003, asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (a test related to potential breathing difficulties) {{were not found}} to have any statistically significant correlation with the demographic and environmental factors of age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status or exposure to pets or passive smoking alone. However, when the time spent at chlorinated swimming pools (modified for pool height as a statistical way to indicate likely concentrations of chlorine related gases) was adjusted for exposure to pets and passive smoking, {{the significance of the}} correlations with asthma increased further. The authors describe this saying that a [...] "very strong argument in favour of causality pool attendance and asthma comes from the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of exposure to pets and smoking, two well documented risk factors for asthma, which together considerably increase the strength of the associations, to levels largely above those usually observed in asthma epidemiology." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bone morphogenic protein 15 (BMP15) {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in the oocyte and the surrounding follicular cells contributing greatly to folliculogenesis and oogenesis. Like GDF9, BMP15 belongs to the TGF-ß superfamily. Differences in the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of BMP15 and GDF9 appear to be species dependent. BMP15 and GDF9 act in an additive manner to increase mitotic proliferation in sheep granulosa cells, although the same effect is not observed in bovine granulosa cells. The silencing of ‘’Bmp15’’ in mice results in partial fertility but normal histological appearance of the ovary. Although, when this is combined with the silencing of one allele of ‘’Gdf9’’, mice are completely infertile due to insufficient folliculogenesis and altered cumulus cell morphology. Mice with this genome also fail to release oocytes resulting in trapped oocytes in the corpus lutea. This phenotype is absent in ‘’Gdf9’’ silenced mice and only present a small population of ‘’Bmp15’’ silenced mice. [...] This reveals the synergistic relationship of GDF9 and BMP15 whereby the silencing of both genes results in more severe outcome then either of the genes alone. It is thought that any co operative effects of GDF9 and BMP15 are modulated through the BMPRII receptor.|$|E

5000|$|The realist turn {{carried out}} by Maurizio Ferraris {{starting}} from the formulation of aesthetics not as philosophy of art, but as ontology of perception and sensory experience (Estetica razionale 1997 new edition 2011), finds a further declination in the Manifesto del nuovo realismo (2012) of new realism, SUNY Press, 2014. New Realism - the principles of which were anticipated by Ferraris {{in an article published}} in La Repubblica on August 8, 2011 and which then started a massive debate - is primarily a consideration of some historical, cultural and political phenomena (i.e. the analysis of postmodernism up to its deteriorating into media populism). From these reflections follows the urge to shed light over the outcomes produced by the derivations of postmodernism within contemporary thought (i.e. the interpretation of philosophical realisms and [...] "theories of truth" [...] that developed starting from the end of last century in response to a deviation {{of the relationship between the}} individual and reality). This, in turn, leads to the proposal of an antidote to the degeneration of postmodernist ideology and the degraded and mendacious relationship with the world that it has caused: New Realism, in fact, identifies itself with the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of three key words, Ontology, Critique and Enlightenment. New Realism has been the subject of several debates and national and international conferences and has called for a series of publications that involve the concept of reality as a paradigm even in non-philosophical areas. In fact, the debate on new realism, for number of contributions and media response, has no equivalent in the recent cultural history, to the point of being chosen as 'case study' for the analysis of the sociology of communication and linguistics.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{underlying}} {{etiology of}} the toxic oil syndrome {{may be related}} to any of several toxic contaminants. The hypothesis is made that two or more toxic compounds may act synergistically to cause vascular damage in the toxic oil syndrome. To support this hypothesis, previous studies are reviewed concerning the remarkable <b>synergistic</b> toxic <b>action</b> of allylamine and beta-aminopropionitrile on the media of blood vessels. Although these toxins are not directly related to the toxic oil syndrome, this previous experimental work emphasizes the possibility that unexplored <b>synergistic</b> <b>actions</b> may be important. Furthermore, the hypothesis that contaminating fatty acid anilides in toxic oil undergo alterations during cooking is supported by high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis. The theoretic metabolism of fatty acid anilides is discussed. Recent data concerning the toxic actions of the anilides of oleic and linoleic acid are given. These data suggest that these anilides induce immunologic alterations that may be similar to those seen in the toxic oil syndrome. In addition, the heated anilides appear to have increased toxicity, supporting the concept that the use of toxic oil in cooking may increase its toxicity...|$|R

40|$|Resistance to {{ampicillin}} in Escherichia coli is due {{generally to}} the presence of a β-lactamase (penicillinase). Resistant strains have been found to fall into two groups: those with high-level resistance (1, 000 μg/ml or greater) and those with low-level resistance (8 to 250 μg/ml). Most of the high-level resistant organisms posses β-lactamases whose synthesis is episomally mediated. These strains release penicillinase from the cell when they are subjected to osmotic shock. Low-level resistant strains do not release the enzyme with osmotic shock. High-level resistant strains are not susceptible to the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of a penicillinase-resistant penicillin with ampicillin. Seventy eight per cent of low-level resistant strains are susceptible to the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of ampicillin and oxacillin. The two types of β-lactamases are similar in regard to most properties; both enzymes are subject to competitive inhibition by penicillinase-resistant penicillins.
