40|$|A rolling joint is {{provided}} for obtaining slewing maneuvers for various apparatus including space structures, space vehicles, robotic manipulators, and simulators. Two noncircular cylinders, namely a drive and a driven cylinder, {{are provided in}} driving contact with one another. This contact is maintained by two pairs of generally S-shaped bands, each pair forming a generally 8 -shaped coupling tightly about the circumferential periphery of the noncircular drive and driven cylinders. A stationarily fixed arm extends between and is rotatably journalled with a drive axle and a <b>spindle</b> <b>axle</b> respectively extending through selected rotational points of the drive cylinder and of the driven cylinder. The noncircular cylinders are profiled to obtain the desired varying gear ratio. The novelty of the present invention resides in using specifically profiled noncircular cylinders to obtain a desired varying gear ratio...|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of methods used to attach the cranks to the bottom bracket <b>spindle</b> (or <b>axle).</b>|$|R
50|$|Common {{applications}} of the process are for piston rods of shock absorbers, cylinders and rods for hydraulic systems, pumps, <b>axles,</b> <b>spindles</b> and valves.|$|R
50|$|A lot {{of engine}} {{problems}} emerged {{within the first}} 100 laps in addition to faulty <b>spindles,</b> decaying <b>axles,</b> and one crash involving Richard Petty on the 281st lap. While Rex White would zoom into the pole position driving at speeds up to 77.687 mph during solo qualifying runs, Bob Welborn would defeat Lee Petty by three laps averaging speeds up to 71.633 mph. Welborn would go winless after this race until he retired after {{the running of the}} 1964 Pennsylvania 200 in New Oxford, Pennsylvania.|$|R
5000|$|The pole {{speed that}} was {{accomplished}} by Dink Widenhouse was [...] while the average speed was [...] Other notable drivers who participated included Lee Petty, Herb Thomas, Dink Widenhouse, Fonty Flock, and Junior Johnson. All twenty-two drivers who qualified were American-born. Twelve drivers failed to finish the race due to <b>axle,</b> <b>spindle,</b> coil, wheel, frame, vapor lock, tire, gasket, and bearing problems.|$|R
5000|$|Athearn {{acquired}} the Globe Models product line and improved upon it, introducing a comprehensive array of locomotive, passenger, and freight car models. Improvements included all-wheel drive and electrical contact. One innovation was the [...] "Hi-Fi" [...] drive mechanism, employing small rubber bands to transfer motion from the motor <b>spindle</b> to the <b>axles.</b> Another was the double-ended ring magnet motor, which permitted easy connection to all-wheel-drive assemblies. Athearn was {{also able to}} incorporate flywheels into double-ended drives.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, Jeep used {{a unique}} Dana 44 IFS setup, that was short lived. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ford used {{a form of}} IFS known as [...] "Twin Traction Beam" [...] (TTB). This Dana 44 had no axle tubes but {{attached}} to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had [...] "open air" [...] axles which traveled through the beams to the <b>spindles.</b> The <b>axles</b> had u-joints {{to allow for the}} independent action of the beams. Individual pivot points for the beams at greater than center made each beam longer than half the overall width crossing in the middle. This allowed for an independent front suspension design. Ford TTB Dana 44 axles all utilized locking hubs. The TTB set-up is based on Ford's highly successful Twin I-beam design on two-wheel-drive pick-up truck models.|$|R
5000|$|The 47/32 {{was built}} in two versions, the first with semi-pneumatic disk wheels, and the second (in 1939, from which the name 47/32 mod. 39) with {{improved}} barrel and suspension (in some series also light-alloy wheels with semi-pneumatic tires). To tow this piece, the Fiat-OCI 708 CM tractor and the L3 tankette were used, but these projects were soon abandoned as the gun was subjected to breaking at the <b>axles</b> <b>spindles</b> and shanks. Due to its shape, the 47/32 was commonly called [...] "elefantino" [...] (little elephant) by the troops.|$|R
50|$|A {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}}, {{also known as}} a torsion spring suspension (not to be confused with a torsion beam rear suspension), is a general term for any vehicle suspension that uses a torsion bar as its main weight-bearing spring. One end of a long metal bar is attached firmly to the vehicle chassis; the opposite end terminates in a lever, the torsion key, mounted perpendicular to the bar, that is attached to a suspension arm, a <b>spindle,</b> or the <b>axle.</b> Vertical motion of the wheel causes the bar to twist around its axis and is resisted by the bar's torsion resistance. The effective spring rate of the bar is determined by its length, cross section, shape, material, and manufacturing process.|$|R
50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a fixed <b>spindle.</b> A full-floating <b>axle</b> can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle shaft flange is bolted. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{finish and}} {{dimensional}} accuracy {{play a vital}} role in the todayâ€™s engineering industry. There are several methods used to achieve good surface finish like burnishing, honing and lapping, and grinding. Grinding is one of these ways that improves the surface finish and dimensional accuracy simultaneously. C 40 E steel has good industrial application in manufacturing of shafts, <b>axles,</b> <b>spindles,</b> studs, etc. In the present work the cylindrical grinding of C 40 E steel is done for the optimization of grinding process parameters. During this experimental work input process parameters i. e. speed, feed, depth of cut is optimized using Taguchi L 9 orthogonal array. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) concluded that surface roughness is minimum at the 210 rpm, 0. 11 mm/rev feed, and 0. 04 mm depth of penetration. ...|$|R
40|$|By {{fatigue tests}} under {{simulated}} {{operational loading conditions}} on forged spindels, hubs and axles of commercial vehicles {{as well as on}} test specimens taken from the components, the accuracy of the fatigue life prediction using conventional local strain approach was controlled. The material data for the life prediction were determined on the specimens machined out of the critical areas of the components. For the component tests service-like stress-time histories with mean stress variation (spindle) and without (hub) as well as load time histories with a Gaussian frequency distribution (<b>axle,</b> <b>spindle)</b> were used. The comparison of the calculated fatigue life of the components, based on the material data, with the experimentally obtained life shows, that a reliable fatigue life prediction with the conventional local strain approach is not achieved. The accuracy of the fatigue life prediction should be improved by a systematic, phenomenologic description of the decisive effects...|$|R
40|$|DE 3213983 A UPAB: 19930925 The pallet {{carrying}} carriages for a warehousing or {{stacking system}} has a frame housing a motor and transmission elements for its driving wheels, and a load supporting platform {{which can be}} raised and lowered. Interconnected with the transmission elements is a chain which travels around four pulleys rotating about vertical axes and around two pulleys mounted on front and rear spindles. The rear <b>spindle</b> is the <b>axle</b> for the rear wheels and the upper four pulleys are mounted on the platform. This enables the platform to move for a short distance {{in the opposite direction}} to the direction of travel, so that the platform is lifted. The platform has supports carrying rollers which travel along sloping surfaces on the base frame are the lifting action results from the movement of the rollers along these surfaces. The carriage has smaller wheels behind the main wheels, so that jolts are reduced where gaps in the track occur...|$|R
5000|$|The dish of a wheel {{measures}} {{the amount of}} asymmetry between the rim and the hub flanges. To accommodate a large cassette, more space is needed on the drive side of the axle; this increases the complexity of manufacturing and truing the wheel. Tandem rear wheels tend to run a wider hub/axle to allow the right-side hub flange to be further right of wheel center and thus reduce the total dish of the wheel. Some modern tandems use a 160mm wide axle which allows a wheel that is completely [...] "dishless" [...] (i.e. symmetric). The disadvantage is this may increase the Q-factor of the stoker's cranks and may also cause [...] "heel-strike" [...] of the stoker's shoes on the chain stays. Others use shorter axles (often 145mm wide) thereby trading a little decrease in {{the strength of the}} wheel for the advantage of a similar decrease in the bending moment of the <b>axle</b> <b>spindle.</b> Rear hubs may also be threaded on the left side to allow the use of a drum brake.|$|R
2500|$|Bicycle cranks {{can vary}} in length to {{accommodate}} different sized riders and {{different types of}} cycling. Crank length is measured {{from the center of}} the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket <b>spindle</b> or <b>axle.</b> The larger bicycle component manufacturers typically offer crank lengths for adult riders from 165mm to 180mm long in 2.5mm increments, with 170mm cranks being the most common size. A few small specialty manufacturers make bicycle cranks in a number of sizes smaller than 165mm and longer than 180mm. Some manufacturers also make bicycle cranks that can be adjusted to different lengths. While logic would suggest that, all other things being equal, riders with shorter legs should use proportionally shorter cranks and those with longer legs should use proportionally longer cranks, this is not universally accepted. However, very few scientific studies have definitively examined the effect of crank length on sustained cycling performance and the studies' results have been mixed. Bicycle crank length has not been easy to study scientifically for a number of reasons, chief among them being that cyclists are able to physiologically adapt to different crank lengths. Cyclists are typically more efficient pedalling cranks with which they have had an adaptation period. Several different formulas exist to calculate appropriate crank length for various riders. In addition to the rider's size, another factor affecting the selection of crank length is the rider's cycling specialty and the type of cycling event. Historically, bicycle riders have typically chosen proportionally shorter cranks for higher cadence cycling such as criterium and track racing, while riders have chosen proportionally longer cranks for lower cadence cycling such as time trial racing and mountain biking. However, the evolution of very low rider torso positions to reduce aerodynamic drag for time trial racing and triathlon cycling can also affect crank selection for such events. Some have suggested that proportionally shorter cranks may have a slight advantage for a rider with a very low torso position and an actute hip angle, especially as the rider pedals near the top-dead-center position of the pedal stroke. Cranks can be shortened for medical reasons using shorteners such as Ortho Pedal ...|$|R
