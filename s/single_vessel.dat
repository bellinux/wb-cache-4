25|$|Intussusception {{was first}} {{observed}} in neonatal rats. In {{this type of}} vessel formation, the capillary wall extends into the lumen to split a <b>single</b> <b>vessel</b> in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish a zone of contact. Second, the endothelial cell junctions are reorganized and the vessel bilayer is perforated to allow growth factors and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the 2 new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with pericytes and myofibroblasts. These cells begin laying collagen fibers into the core to provide an extracellular matrix for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception {{is important because it}} is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast {{increase in the number of}} capillaries without a corresponding increase in the number of endothelial cells. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich microvasculature with new cells every time a new vessel develops.|$|E

Magellan died in the battle of Mactan in the Philippines, leaving the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano the task of completing the voyage, reaching the Spice Islands in 1521.

All patients were given 2 i. v. injections of 99 mTc tetrofosmin, one at peak exercise (370 MBq) and the other (1110 MBq) at rest 3 hours after exercise (images 15 - 30 min after injection for both studies). All patients with CAD (> or = 50 % luminal stenosis) (n = 50) had abnormal 99 mTc tetrofosmin tomogram (100 % sensitivity). Only one patient without CAD had abnormal 99 mTc tetrofosmin tomogram (91 % specificity). Overall sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of <b>single</b> stenosed <b>vessels</b> were 77 %, 93 % and 85 %, respectively. No significant differences among single vascular areas were observed.
