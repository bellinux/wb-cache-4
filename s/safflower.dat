5|$|Drying oils are {{vegetable}} oils that dry to a hard finish at normal room temperature. Such oils {{are used as}} the basis of oil paints, and in other paint and wood finishing applications. In addition to the oils listed here, walnut, sunflower and <b>safflower</b> oil are also considered to be drying oils.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and <b>safflower,</b> and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm. He {{notes that}} some have a hollow stem, such as deadly {{nightshade}} and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, <b>safflower,</b> and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (<b>safflower,</b> sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Aoki, {{a wrestler}} who had {{qualified}} for {{but did not}} attend the 1960 Summer Olympics, started the restaurant with $10,000 earned from driving an ice cream truck in Harlem. The first restaurant, Benihana of Tokyo, was named for the red <b>Safflower</b> that was the name for the coffee shop owned by his parents in Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} the leading {{producer}} of many oilseeds, including 92% of the U.S. canola crop, 94% of flax seed, 53% of sunflower seeds, 18% of <b>safflower</b> seeds, and 62% of mustard seed. Canola is suited to the cold winters and it matures fast. Processing of canola for oil production produces canola meal as a by-product. The by-product is a high-protein animal feed.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthetic {{human insulin}} (insulin human rDNA, INN) for {{clinical}} use is manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Biosynthetic human insulin has increased purity when compared with extractive animal insulin, enhanced purity reducing antibody formation. Researchers have succeeded in introducing the gene for human insulin into plants as another method of producing insulin ("biopharming") in <b>safflower.</b> This technique is anticipated to reduce production costs.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, oils can be {{heated and}} used to cook other foods. Oils {{suitable}} for this objective must have a high flash point. Such oils include the major cooking oils – soybean, rapeseed, canola, sunflower, <b>safflower,</b> peanut, cottonseed, etc. Tropical oils, such as coconut, palm, and rice bran oils, are particularly valued in Asian cultures for high-temperature cooking, because of their unusually high flash points.|$|E
25|$|Palm oil {{contains}} more saturated fats than canola oil, corn oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, <b>safflower</b> oil, and sunflower oil. Therefore, palm oil can withstand deep frying at higher temperatures and is resistant to oxidation compared to high-polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Since about 1900, palm oil has been increasingly incorporated into food {{by the global}} commercial food industry because it remains stable in deep frying, or in baking at very high temperatures, and for its high levels of natural antioxidants.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} to replace saffron with a cheaper dye. Saffron's usual substitutes in foodturmeric and <b>safflower,</b> among othersyield a garishly bright yellow that could hardly be confused with that of saffron. Saffron's main colourant is the flavonoid crocin; it has been discovered in the less tediously harvestedand hence less costlygardenia fruit. Research in China is ongoing. In Europe saffron threads were {{a key component of}} an aromatic oil known as crocinum, which comprised such motley ingredients as alkanet, dragon's blood (for colour), and wine (again for colour). Crocinum was applied as a perfume to hair. Another preparation involved mixing saffron with wine to produce a viscous yellow spray; it was copiously applied in sudoriferously sunny Roman amphitheatresas an air freshener.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel is {{made from}} animal fats or {{vegetable}} oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, <b>safflower,</b> canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.|$|E
25|$|Many Indian {{dishes are}} cooked in {{vegetable}} oil, but peanut oil is popular in northern and western India, mustard oil in eastern India, and coconut oil {{along the western}} coast, especially in Kerala. Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty aroma. In recent decades, sunflower, <b>safflower,</b> cottonseed, and soybean oils have become popular across India. Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium. Butter-based ghee, or deshi ghee, is used frequently, though less than in the past. Many types of meat are used for Indian cooking, but chicken and mutton {{tend to be the}} most commonly consumed meats. Fish and beef consumption are prevalent in some parts of India, but they are not widely consumed except for coastal areas, as well as the north east.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{its high}} cost saffron was often {{replaced}} by or diluted with <b>safflower</b> (Carthamus tinctorius) or turmeric (Curcuma longa) in cuisine. Both mimic saffron's colour well, but have distinctive flavours. Saffron {{is used in the}} confectionery and liquor industries; this is its most common use in Italy. Chartreuse, izarra, and strega are types of alcoholic beverages that rely on saffron to provide a flourish of colour and flavour. The savvy often crumble and pre-soak saffron threads for several minutes prior to adding them to their dishes. They may toss threads into water or sherry and leave them to soak for approximately ten minutes. This process extracts the threads' colour and flavour into the liquid phase; powdered saffron does not require this step. The soaking solution is then added to the hot cooking dish, allowing even colour and flavour distribution, which is critical in preparing baked goods or thick sauces.|$|E
25|$|The {{treasure}} ships had {{an enormous}} cargo of various products. Admiral Zheng returned to China with many kinds of tribute goods, such as silver, spices, sandalwood, precious stones, ivory, ebony, camphor, tin, deer hides, coral, kingfisher feathers, tortoise shells, gums and resin, rhinoceros horn, sapanwood and <b>safflower</b> (for dyes and drugs), Indian cotton cloth, and ambergris (for perfume). They even brought back exotic animals, such as ostriches, elephants, and giraffes. There was so much cobalt oxide from Persia that the porcelain center Jingdezhen had a plentiful supply for decades after the voyages. The fleet also returned with such {{a large amount of}} black pepper that the once-costly luxury became a common commodity in Chinese society. It has been said that there was sometimes so many Chinese goods unloaded into a single foreign port that it could take about three months to price everything. The treasure voyages resulted in a flourishing Ming economy, while boosting the lucrative maritime commerce to an all-time high.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{attempts}} at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration, {{particularly among the}} cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the Safranschou code. Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like beetroot, pomegranate fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income. <b>Safflower</b> is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron. The spice is reportedly counterfeited with horse hair, corn silk, or shredded paper. Tartrazine or sunset yellow {{have been used to}} colour counterfeit powdered saffron.|$|E
25|$|Lecithin is a {{naturally}} occurring lipid. It {{can be found}} in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. it is an emulsifier and thus is used in many foods. Corn, soy and <b>safflower</b> oil are sources of lecithin, though the majority of lecithin commercially available is derived from soy. Sufficiently processed lecithin is often undetectable with standard testing practices. According to the FDA, no evidence shows or suggests hazard to the public when lecithin is used at common levels. Lecithin added to foods amounts to only 2 to 10 percent of the 1 to 5 g of phosphoglycerides consumed daily on average. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about GM food extend to such products. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in Europe in 2000, when Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because of the difficulty of detecting the origin of derivatives like lecithin with current testing practices, European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to employ a comprehensive system of Identity preservation (IP).|$|E
25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, <b>safflower</b> or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, and broccoli stir-fried with extra virgin olive oil or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other edible oils.|$|E
500|$|Ukiyo-e artists {{often made}} both prints and paintings; some {{specialized}} {{in one or}} the other. [...] In contrast with previous traditions, ukiyo-e painters favoured bright, sharp colours, and often delineated contours with sumi ink, an effect similar to the linework in prints. [...] Unrestricted by the technical limitations of printing, {{a wider range of}} techniques, pigments, and surfaces were available to the painter. [...] Artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances, such as <b>safflower,</b> ground shells, lead, and cinnabar, and later synthetic dyes imported from the West such as Paris green and Prussian blue. [...] Silk or paper [...] kakemono hanging scrolls, makimono handscrolls, or byōbu folding screens were the most common surfaces.|$|E
500|$|Yellow dyes are [...] "about as {{numerous}} as red ones", {{and can be}} extracted from saffron, pomegranate rind, turmeric, <b>safflower,</b> onionskins, {{and a number of}} weedy flowering plants. [...] Limited evidence suggests the use of weld (Reseda luteola), also called mignonette or dyer's rocket before the Iron Age, but it was an important dye of the ancient Mediterranean and Europe and is indigenous to England. Two brilliant yellow dyes of commercial importance in Europe from the 18th century are derived from trees of the Americas: quercitron from the inner bark of Eastern Black Oak (Quercus velutina), native to eastern North America and fustic from the dyer's mulberry tree (Maclura tinctoria) of the West Indies and Mexico.|$|E
500|$|While colour {{printing}} in Japan {{dates to the}} 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink. [...] Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in tan-e prints, or later in a pink <b>safflower</b> ink in beni-e prints. [...] Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour. [...] Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours. [...] The mid-1760s brought full-colour nishiki-e prints made from ten or more woodblocks. [...] To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly registration marks called kentō were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{less likely}} than some other oils to become rancid. [...] It is more stable than <b>safflower</b> oil and linseed oil.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, the Standard of Identity for {{a product}} labeled as [...] "vegetable oil margarine" [...] {{specifies}} only canola, <b>safflower,</b> sunflower, corn, soybean, or peanut oil may be used. Products not labeled [...] "vegetable oil margarine" [...] do not have that restriction.|$|E
2500|$|Meat {{is usually}} fried between , and most oils start to smoke before a {{temperature}} of [...] is reached, but {{there are at least}} two cooking oils (refined <b>safflower</b> oil at 265°C (510°F) and avocado oil at 271°C (520°F)) that have a higher smoke point.|$|E
2500|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} notable for being {{especially}} high in tocopherols other than vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). [...] Poppyseed oil from one source {{has been reported}} to contain 30.9mg gamma-tocopherol per 100 g. [...] It also contains alpha and gamma tocotrienols, but not others. [...] Compared to other vegetable oils, poppyseed oil has a moderate amount of phytosterols: [...] higher than soybean oil and peanut oil, lower than <b>safflower</b> oil, sesame oil, wheat germ oil, corn oil, and rice bran oil. [...] Sterols in poppyseed oil consist almost entirely of campesterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol and delta 5-avenasterol. [...] Poppyseed oil is high in linoleic acid. Although not generally higher than <b>safflower</b> oil, it can be as high as 74.5%. [...] Other triglycerides present in notable quantities are oleic acid and palmitic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Cooking oils are {{composed}} of various fractions of fatty acids. [...] For the purpose of frying food, oils high in monounsaturated or saturated fats are generally popular, while oils high in polyunsaturated fats are less desirable. [...] High oleic acid oils include almond, macadamia, olive, pecan, pistachio, and high-oleic cultivars of <b>safflower</b> and sunflower.|$|E
2500|$|On food packaging, {{the term}} [...] "vegetable oil" [...] {{is often used}} in {{ingredients}} lists instead of specifying the exact plant being used, especially when the oil used is less desirable to the consumer or if a mix is used, such as palm, canola, soybean, and <b>safflower</b> oils, (whereas coconut oil and olive oil {{may be perceived as}} more desirable).|$|E
2500|$|Such oils {{have been}} part of human culture for millennia. [...] Poppy seed, rapeseed, linseed, almond oil, sesame seed, <b>safflower,</b> and cotton seed were used since at least the bronze age {{throughout}} the Middle East and Central Asia. [...] In 1780, [...] Carl Wilhelm Scheele demonstrated that fats were derived from glycerol. [...] Thirty years later Michel Eugène Chevreul deduced that these fats were esters of fatty acids and glycerol.|$|E
2500|$|Since Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company, McDonald's has {{streamlined}} {{the menu}} {{which in the}} United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has also looked to introduce healthier options, and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has also removed artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets, replacing chicken skin, <b>safflower</b> oil and citric acid found in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.|$|E
2500|$|Hay {{is one of}} Australia's leading wool {{growing and}} sheep meat {{producing}} areas, with the area home to around 26 parent studs. Cattle are also produced for sale for slaughter and, in recent years, for sale to feedlots for fattening. [...] In irrigated areas, crops such as lettuce, pumpkins, tomatoes, garlic, corn, rockmelons, watermelons and broccoli are grown, picked and packaged in the area. [...] Hay is also the leading producer in the Riverina of <b>safflower,</b> lettuce and broccoli.|$|E
2500|$|Honey was {{the primary}} sweetener, but was rather expensive. There was honey {{collected}} from the wild, and honey from domesticated bees kept in pottery hives. A cheaper alternative would have been dates or carob. There was even a hieroglyph (nedjem/bener) depicting a carob pod, that bore the primary meaning of [...] "sweet; pleasant." [...] Oils would be made from lettuce or radish seed, <b>safflower,</b> ben, balanites and sesame. Animal fat was employed for cooking and jars used for storing it {{have been found in}} many settlements.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{essential}} fatty acids that you must consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Experts say that you need to eat a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice. Sources of omega-3 include flax seeds, chia seeds, walnuts, sea vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and cold water fish. [...] You can find sources of omega-6 in walnuts, hazelnuts; sunflower, <b>safflower,</b> corn, and sesame oils.|$|E
2500|$|Saffron's aroma {{is often}} {{described}} by connoisseurs as reminiscent of metallic honey with grassy or hay-like notes, while its taste has also been noted as hay-like and sweet. Saffron also contributes a luminous yellow-orange colouring to foods. Saffron is widely used in Persian, Indian, European, and Arab cuisines. Confectioneries and liquors also often include saffron. Saffron is used in dishes ranging from the jewelled rice and khoresh of Iran, [...] the Milanese risotto of Italy, the paella of Spain, the bouillabaisse of France, to the biryani with various meat accompaniments in South Asia. One of the most esteemed use for saffron is {{in the preparation of}} the Golden Ham, a precious dry-cured ham made with saffron from San Gimignano. Common saffron substitutes include <b>safflower</b> (Carthamus tinctorius, which is often sold as [...] "Portuguese saffron" [...] or [...] "açafrão"), annatto, and turmeric (Curcuma longa).|$|E
6000|$|The {{principal}} {{exports from}} Harar are slaves, ivory, coffee, tobacco, Wars (<b>safflower</b> or bastard saffron), Tobes and woven cottons, mules, holcus, wheat, [...] "Karanji," [...] {{a kind of}} bread used by travellers, ghee, honey, gums (principally mastic and myrrh), and finally sheep's fat and tallows of all sorts. The imports are American sheeting, and other cottons, white and dyed, muslins, red shawls, silks, brass, sheet copper, cutlery (generally the cheap German), Birmingham trinkets, beads and coral, dates, rice, and loaf sugar, gunpowder, paper, and the various other wants of a city in the wild.|$|E
60|$|The Wars or <b>Safflower</b> is {{cultivated}} in considerable quantities around the city: an abundance is {{grown in the}} lands of the Gallas. It is sown when the heavy rains have ceased, and is gathered about two months afterwards. This article, together with slaves, forms the staple commerce between Berberah and Muscat. In Arabia, men dye with it their cotton shirts, women and children use it to stain the skin a bright yellow; besides {{the purpose of a}} cosmetic, it also serves as a preservative against cold. When Wars is cheap at Harar, a pound may be bought for a quarter of a dollar.|$|E
