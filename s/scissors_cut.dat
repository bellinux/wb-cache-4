500|$|Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one {{songs in}} total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, {{a cover of}} [...] The Everly Brothers' [...] "Wake Up Little Susie", and the medley version of [...] "Maybellene". Each {{performer}} sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic [...] "Bridge Over Troubled Water" [...] and [...] "April Come She Will", and [...] "A Heart in New York", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album <b>Scissors</b> <b>Cut,</b> which had been released the previous month. Simon's solo performances were the title song of his 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years, the number-one single [...] "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover", and the unreleased [...] "The Late Great Johnny Ace", which would appear on his 1983 album Hearts and Bones.|$|E
500|$|Planning and rehearsals for {{the concert}} took {{about three weeks}} in a Manhattan theater. The rehearsals were {{characterized}} by past tensions that resurfaced between the performers under the intense time pressure. Paul Simon later said: [...] "Well, the rehearsals were just miserable. Artie and I fought all the time." [...] An early concept was for each singer to give a solo performance, with Simon allotted the greater amount of time, and to conclude with the duo performing their joint works. This idea was rejected because, according to Garfunkel, [...] "It didn't seem right to either of us that Paul should be the opening act for Simon & Garfunkel, {{and for him to}} follow Simon & Garfunkel didn't make show-business sense". The two decided to perform most of the show together, with room for each to showcase some solo material. [...] Simon, who had resumed songwriting after a long hiatus, interrupted a series of studio recording sessions for the concert preparations. He used the live show as an opportunity to test one of his new songs in front of an audience. Garfunkel also planned to present a new song, [...] "A Heart in New York", from his soon-to-be released album <b>Scissors</b> <b>Cut.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Scissors</b> <b>Cut</b> is a {{challenging}} one handed cut, {{which is also}} really used {{in a lot of}} card flourishes (Squeeze by Daren Yeow and Very Bad Habit by Brian Tudor).

2500|$|Cutting a Möbius strip {{along the}} center {{line with a}} pair of {{scissors}} yields one long strip with two full twists in it, rather than two separate strips; the result is not a Möbius strip. This happens because the original strip only has one edge that is twice as long as the original strip. [...] Cutting creates a second independent edge, half of which was {{on each side of the}} <b>scissors.</b> <b>Cutting</b> this new, longer, strip down the middle creates two strips wound around each other, each with two full twists.|$|R

50|$|Following disappointing {{sales of}} <b>Scissors</b> <b>Cut,</b> Garfunkel reunited with Simon for The Concert in Central Park {{and a world}} tour.

It was initially slated to be a Simon & Garfunkel studio reunion, but was ultimately released as a Simon solo album (Hearts and Bones).

5000|$|In Britain in 1924 it was {{described}} {{in a letter to}} The Times as a hand game, possibly of Mediterranean origin, called [...] "zhot".A reader then wrote in to say that the game [...] "zhot" [...] referred to was evidently Jan-ken-pon, which she had often seen played throughout Japan. Although at this date the game appears to have been new enough to British readers to need explaining, the appearance by 1927 of a popular thriller with the title <b>Scissors</b> <b>Cut</b> Paper, followed by Stone Blunts Scissors (1929), suggests it quickly became popular.|$|E
