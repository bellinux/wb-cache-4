Recovery of metals and precious metals from <b>spent</b> <b>catalysts</b> {{has been an important}} topic not only from economic aspect but also for recycling rare natural sources and reducing the catalyst waste to prevent the environmental pollution. Various methods for recovering metals form <b>spent</b> auto <b>catalyst,</b> petroleum reforming and other industrial catalysts are reviewed. Design/methodology/approach: The article presents the methods used in the world for metals recovery from <b>spent</b> industrial <b>catalysts.</b> Findings: To recover precious metals from <b>spent</b> <b>catalysts</b> many hydro- and pyrometallurgical methods are used. But none of these methods is an universal method {{that can be used to}} recover all type of <b>spent</b> <b>catalysts.</b> These recovery methods have also some disadvantages: pyrometallurgical methods require special equipment, reaching the desired temperature, and they are not only expensive but also highly energy consuming. The application of hydrometallurgical methods requires to solve the problem of harmful waste solutions generated during the process.

Spent NiMo/Al 2 O 3 dan CoMo/Al 2 O 3 catalysts showed contrasting activities in HDS. HDS over spent CoMo/Al 2 O 3 was much improved by H 2 refreshment. The effect of two-stage hydrodesulfurization was markedly reduced over the spent NiMo/Al 2 O 3. <b>Spent</b> <b>catalysts</b> apparently lost their activity due to the carbon deposition, which covered the active sites more preferentially...|$|R

50|$|The {{catalyst}} {{used for}} the ebullated bed is typically a 0.8-mm diameter extrudate, and is held in a fluidized state through the upward lift of liquid reactants and gas. The liquid and gas enter in the reactor plenum, and are distributed across the bed through a distributor and grid plate. The height of the ebullated catalyst bed can be controlled by the rate of liquid recycle flow. This liquid rate is adjusted by varying {{the speed of the}} ebullating pump, a canned centrifugal pump which controls the flow of ebullating liquid obtained from the internal vapor/liquid separator inside the reactor. Fresh catalyst can be added, and <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> withdrawn, to control the level of catalyst activity within the reactor. The capability of regular addition of a small quantity of catalyst is instrumental to ebullated-bed reactors' consistent product quality over long time periods. To adjust operation and/or different feedstocks, the type of catalyst used can also be changed without shutting down the reactor.|$|E

The physico-chemical characteristics of Unclarified Oil (UCO) and the properties of Equilibrium catalyst [E-cat] from the commercial Fluidized bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit were studied. <b>Spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> was blended with the regenerated equilibrium catalyst from commercial unit in different proportions.

The yield pattern was compared for various catalyst combination of Ecat + <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> at constant conversion 91. With <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> in the blend the light gas (LG) yield decreases, with increase in C/O ratio. There is no significant change in bottoms (residue) yield, while there is a decrease in the diesel when C/O ratio is increased from 4. 0 to 6. 0.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} on October 1, 1989, {{for the purpose}} of recovering metals from <b>spent</b> coal liquefaction <b>catalysts.</b> Two catalyst types were the subject of the contract. The first was a Ni-No catalyst support on alumina (Shell 324), the catalyst used in a pilot scale coal liquefaction facility at Wilsonville, Alabama. The second material was an unsupported ammonium molybdate catalyst used in a pilot process by the Department of Energy at the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. This material was obtained in late February 1990 but has not been pursued since the Mo content of this particular sample was too low for the current studies and the studies at the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center have been discontinued.

40|$|Nickel {{containing}} catalysts or nickel catalyst {{are well}} known in process industries. In Malaysia, there are about 500 metric ton of nickel catalysts being imported every year. They have been used many reactions such as hydrogenation reaction, alkylation reactions, hydroalkylation reactions and cracking reactions. The initial composition of nickel catalyst depends on reaction involved for example catalysts for hydroalkylation reaction containing other metals such as tungsten beside nickel itself. Initially, these catalysts perform at high activity but by time they become less active and reach {{at a point where}} they are no more effective to be used in a commercial process. Considerable research has been carried out on developing the process for regenerating the <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> since nickel is expensive to be discarded and more over, the safe disposal of waste nickel requires consideration of environmental hazard.

The results confirm that at relatively high replacement levels, the pozzolanic property of the <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> and the increased open pore volume of such blended cements may result in contradictory consequences. Specimens of relatively higher replacement levels exhibit higher rates of deterioration in spite of their superior mechanical strength behavior caused by pozzolanic reaction.

This culture was initially grown in the 9 K- medium (absence of 9 g/L Fe(II)) where ferrous sulphate (FeSO 4) was replaced by pyrite, and then applied in this bioleaching study. Bacterial action on pyrite catalysed the formation of ferric ion (Fe+ 3), proton (H+) and sulphate ions (SO 4 - 2) in the solution which leached metals (Ni, Mo and V) from the <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Experiments were conducted by varying the reaction time, amount of <b>spent</b> <b>catalyst</b> and pyrite, and temperature.
