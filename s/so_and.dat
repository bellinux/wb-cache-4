5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did <b>so</b> <b>and</b> discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that {{it is doubtful that}} he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|According to Lokasenna, Loki rebukes {{the gods}} {{at the start}} of the poem for not {{properly}} welcoming him to the feast at Ægir's hall. In stanza 10, Odin finally relents to the rules of hospitality, urging Víðarr to stand and pour a drink for the quarrelsome guest. Víðarr does <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> then Loki toasts the Æsir before beginning his flyting.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{entrance}} to the pass had been secured by a regiment, the remainder of the 10th Cavalry Brigade did not reinforce the regiment. The brigade commander, Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse had disobeyed divisional orders to do <b>so</b> <b>and</b> when the brigade finally advanced, twice got lost. In consequence, Barrow, the commander of the 4th Cavalry Division, relieved Howard-Vyse of his command on the spot. Lieutenant Colonel W. G. K. Green of the Jacob's Horse took command of the brigade.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E
5|$|Caspian {{invites the}} Telmarines {{to remain in}} Narnia if they will coexist peacefully with the Narnians; but if they wish, they can return to the human world from which they {{originally}} came to Narnia. Some, including General Glozelle, agree to do <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> Aslan creates a portal for them and the four Pevensies. Susan kisses Caspian, knowing they will never meet again, as Aslan told her and Peter that they will never return to Narnia. The Pevensies return to England, leaving Caspian as King.|$|E

5|$|Even <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> {{partly because}} of Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did not proceed according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left to join a simultaneous two-division push {{on either side of}} the Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.|$|E
5|$|From 2 to 11 August, Carlsen {{competed in}} the Sinquefield Cup, the first {{classical}} event of the Grand Chess Tour. He finished joint second with Anand, scoring 5½/9 (+3–1=5). He recorded three victories (against Karjakin, <b>So</b> <b>and</b> Aronian) and his one loss was to Vachier-Lagrave, who won the tournament with 6/9 (+3–0=6). This result left Carlsen in {{first place in the}} Grand Chess Tour standings with 34 points, three points ahead of second place Vachier-Lagrave.|$|E
5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E

5|$|Identification of AVMs {{requires}} detailed {{medical imaging}} of the organs most commonly affected by these lesions. Not all AVMs cause symptoms or {{are at risk}} of doing <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> hence there is a degree of variation between specialists as to whether such investigations would be performed, and by which modality; often, decisions on this issue are reached together with the patient.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an extremely high Q with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 or <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy.

US officials were frustrated at Quwatli for not attempting to stop the demonstrations.
