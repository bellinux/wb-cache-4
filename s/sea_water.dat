There have been experiments to extract uranium from <b>sea</b> <b>water,</b> but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E

For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and <b>sea</b> <b>water</b> would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E

5|$|The average {{salinity}} of Earth's oceans {{is about}} 35grams of salt per kilogram of <b>sea</b> <b>water</b> (3.5% salt).

5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} <b>sea</b> <b>water</b> and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure {{and began to}} build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and <b>sea</b> <b>water</b> meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E

5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of <b>sea</b> <b>water</b> is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the <b>sea.</b> <b>Water</b> in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E
