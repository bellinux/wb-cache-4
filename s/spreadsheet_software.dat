Computer-aided auditing employs end user technology including <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>software,</b> such as Microsoft Excel, to allow traditional auditors to run audit-specific analyses as they conduct the periodic audit. Continuous auditing, on the other hand, involves advanced analytical tools that automate a majority of the auditing plan. Where auditors manually extract data and run their own analyses in computer-aided auditing during the course of their traditional audit, high-powered servers automatically extract and analyze data at specified intervals as a part of continuous auditing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{show how}} spreadsheets, an {{end-user}} development paradigm {{proven to be}} highly productive and simple to learn and use, {{can be used for}} complex service compositions. We identify the requirements for spreadsheet-based service composition and present our framework that implements these requirements. Our framework enables spreadsheets to send requests and retrieve results from various local and remote services. We show how our tools support different composition patterns and how the style of declarative dependencies of spreadsheets can facilitate service composition. We also discuss novel issues identified by using the framework in several projects and education.

Currently, programming languages, graphing <b>software,</b> <b>spreadsheets,</b> geometry <b>software,</b> computer algebra systems, {{and other kinds of}} new tools for the learning of mathematics are widely disseminated. Originally, optimism dominated the debate: technology would free the student from calculation and procedural drudgery, and would enable mathematics education to focus on more relevant issues such as realistic applications, modeling, conceptual understanding, and higher order skills.

40|$|Spreadsheets {{are used}} {{extensively}} in industry: {{they are the}} number one tool for financial analysis and are also prevalent in other domains, such as logistics and planning. Their flexibility and immediate feedback make them easy to use for non-programmers. But as easy as spreadsheets are to build, so difficult can they be to analyze and adapt. This dissertation aims at developing methods to support spreadsheet users to understand, update and improve spreadsheets. We took our inspiration for such methods from software engineering, as this field is specialized {{in the analysis of}} data and calculations. In this dissertation, we have looked at four different aspects of spreadsheets: metadata, structure, formulas and data. We found that methods from software engineering can be applied to spreadsheets very well, and that these methods support end-users in working with <b>spreadsheets.</b> <b>Software</b> EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Thanks {{to their}} {{flexibility}} and intuitive programming model, spreadsheets {{are widely used}} in industry, often for businesscritical applications. Similar to <b>software</b> developers, professional <b>spreadsheet</b> users demand support for maintaining and transferring their spreadsheets. In this paper, we first study the problems and information needs of professional spreadsheet users {{by means of a}} survey conducted at a large financial company. Based on these needs, we then present an approach that extracts this information from spreadsheets and presents it in a compact and easy to understand way, using leveled dataflow diagrams. Our approach comes with three different views on the dataflow and allows the user to analyze the dataflow diagrams in a top-down fashion also using slicing techniques. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we conducted a series of interviews as well as nine case studies in an industrial setting. The results of the evaluation clearly indicate the demand for and usefulness of our approach in ease the understanding of <b>spreadsheets.</b> <b>Software</b> TechnologyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Spreadsheets {{are used}} {{extensively}} in business processes {{around the world}} and just like <b>software,</b> <b>spreadsheets</b> are changed throughout their lifetime causing maintainability issues. This paper adapts known code smells to spreadsheet formulas. To that end we present a list of metrics by which we can detect smelly formulas and a visualization technique to highlight these formulas in spreadsheets. We implemented the metrics and visualization technique in a prototype tool to evaluate our approach in two ways. Firstly, we analyze the Euses spreadsheet corpus, to study the occurrence of the formula smells. Secondly, we analyze ten real life spreadsheets, and interview the spreadsheet owners about the identified smells. The results of these evaluations indicate that formula smells are common and that they can reveal real errors and weaknesses in <b>spreadsheet</b> formulas. <b>Software</b> TechnologyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
