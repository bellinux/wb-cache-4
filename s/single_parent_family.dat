2500|$|Mui {{experienced}} much hardship in her childhood. She was {{the youngest}} daughter {{in a family of}} four children. Her elder sister, Ann Mui, was also a singer. The children were raised in a <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>family.</b> In some of her interviews, Mui mentioned that she had never met her father. This meant that she had to help provide for her siblings at an early age, dropping out of school at the age of 13 or 14. More hardship followed the family when the bar that her mother ran was destroyed by a fire. To earn a living, Mui entered the show business at around the age of four with her sister Ann. She performed Chinese operas and pop songs in theatres and on the streets. Both Mui and her elder sister Ann performed in practically any nightclub that offered them a chance to make a living.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a {{research}} project that addressed social exclusion and poverty {{as it relates to}} <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> and their children in particular. The rising numbers of <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> and children throughout the EU and the increased likelihood that these families will live in poverty and experience many different forms of social exclusion in their daily lives brings in sharp focus the need to address the issue as an urgent one in our efforts to eradicate poverty and social exclusion. The focus on the children of <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> seeks to rectify a long-standing problem in our knowledge and understanding of <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> and the social problems they face, namely, the fact that little, if anything, is known about how these children experience and understand their lives as members of these families. The research set out to contribute to policy development and the transnational exchange of best practice by adding a much-neglected dimension on <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families.</b> The project used a cross-national comparative qualitative research design and methods (Mangen 1999) which involved all partners in the design of each research phase including the analysis; partners were England, Cyprus and Greece...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} research investigated {{the effects of}} both income and family type upon the availability of social capital among families in British Columbia. It was hypothesized that the accumulation of social capital was more difficult for <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families,</b> and especially difficult for <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> of a low-income status. This {{was expected to be}} due to variables associated with such families having a limited capacity to balance work and family life demands and being at a relatively high risk of living in poverty. Results showed that high rates of housing instability and negative neighbourhood assessments were significantly correlated with low levels of social support among <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> living below the LICO.

40|$|Abstract This {{critical}} review illustrates the structural barriers to equity {{of access to}} the NHS through the example of <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families.</b> An analysis of literature demonstrates that these structural barriers are classified as macro, meso and micro barriers and include the UK economy, government policy and the welfare system, and the education system on a macro level, right down to micro factors such as childcare and individual motivation. These barriers were found not just {{to have an impact on}} the <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> ability to access NHS services but effect them in every aspect of daily life. It is suggested that government policy reform including the increasing of welfare entitlement would help improve the situation. It has been identified that an important detriment to health is the inequality in society so polices have been suggested as a means of bringing equality. <b>Single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> are an important group with regards to their accessing of the NHS due to their increasing number in society and high needs as consumers of NHS care. Nursing practice is made reference to throughout the dissertation with recommendations for practice including: non- discriminatory care, flexible enforcement of hospital rules and regulations relating to visiting times and accompanying children and using the political vote to elect a party committed to eradicating health inequalities and improving access to the NHS for societal groups such as <b>single</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families...</b>|$|R
