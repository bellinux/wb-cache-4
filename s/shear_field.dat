40|$|As a {{sequence}} of Ugai (2010 b), the present paper studies in detail the structure and dynamics of large-scale (principal) plasmoid, generated by the fast reconnection evolution in a sheared current sheet with no initial northward field component. The overall plasmoid domain is divided into the plasmoid reconnection region P and the plasmoid core region C. In the region P, the magnetized plasma with reconnected field lines are accumulated, whereas in the region C, the plasma, which was intially embedded in the current sheet and has been ejected away by the reconnection jet, is compressed and accumulated. In {{the presence of the}} <b>sheared</b> magnetic <b>field</b> in the east-west direction in the current sheet, the upper and lower parts of the reconnection region P are inversely shifted in the east-west directions. Accordingly, the plasmoid core region C with the accumulated <b>sheared</b> <b>field</b> lines is bent in the north-south direction just ahead of the plasmoid center x=XC, causing the magnetic field component in the north-south direction, whose sign is always opposite to that of the reconnected field lines. Therefore, independently of the sign of the initial <b>sheared</b> <b>field,</b> the magnetic field component Bz in the north-south direction has the definite bipolar profile around XC along the x-axis. At x=XC, the <b>sheared</b> <b>field</b> component has the peak value, and as the <b>sheared</b> <b>fields</b> accumulated in the region C become larger, the bipolar field profile becomes more distinct...|$|R

One method, the fibre assembles completely on to perforated drum before their transfer to the rotating sheath. In the other method, fibres are laid directly on to rotating sheath.|$|E
50|$|When solute and solvent atoms {{differ in}} size, local stress fields are created that can attract or repel dislocations in their vicinity. This {{is known as}} the size effect. By {{relieving}} tensile or compressive strain in the lattice, the solute size mismatch can put the dislocation in a lower energy state. In substitutional solid solutions, these stress fields are spherically symmetric, meaning they have no shear stress component. As such, substitutional solute atoms do not interact with the shear stress fields characteristic of screw dislocations. Conversely, in interstitial solid solutions, solute atoms cause a tetragonal distortion, generating a <b>shear</b> <b>field</b> that can interact with edge, screw, and mixed dislocations. The attraction or repulsion of the dislocation centers to the solute particles increase the stress it takes to propagate the dislocation in any other direction. Increasing the applied stress necessary to move the dislocation increases the yield strength of the material.|$|E

We find evidence that each of these flares was triggered by strongly <b>sheared</b> magnetic <b>field</b> via "tether-cutting" reconnection with adjacent/overlying strongly <b>sheared</b> <b>field.</b> In the first flare, the initial brightening in H-alpha: (1) was partly rooted in emerging <b>sheared</b> magnetic <b>field</b> {{along the edge of the}} large positive-polarity flux domain of the delta sunspot, and (2) consisted of four flare kernels, two in negative magnetic flux and two in positive magnetic flux. In the second flare, the brightening started in the core of a Z-shaped sigmoidal <b>sheared</b> magnetic <b>field</b> and the inner two of four H-alpha kernels were visible in 30 - 50 Kev hard X-ray image from RHESSI. Each flare spread from the initial quadrupolar brightening to develop into a much larger two-ribbon flare straddling a much more extensive swath of strongly <b>sheared</b> <b>field</b> along the edge of the large positive-flux domain of the delta sunspot, the first flare on the leading side and the second flare on the trailing side of this domain.

40|$|We present multi-wavelength {{observations}} {{of the evolution of}} the <b>sheared</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> in NOAA Active Region 10930, where two X-class flares occurred on 2006 December 13 and December 14, respectively. Observations made with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) and the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard Hinode suggest that the gradual formation of the <b>sheared</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> in this active region is caused by the rotation and west-to-east motion of an emerging sunspot. In the pre-flare phase of the two flares, XRT shows several highly sheared X-ray loops in the core field region, corresponding to a filament seen in the TRACE EUV observations. XRT observations also show that part of the <b>sheared</b> core <b>field</b> erupted, and another part of the <b>sheared</b> core <b>field</b> stayed behind during the flares, which may explain why {{a large part of the}} filament is still seen by TRACE after the flare. About 2 – 3 hours after the peak of each flare, the core field becomes visible in XRT again, and shows a highly sheared inner and less-sheared outer structure. We also find that the post-flare core field is clearly less sheared than the pre-flare core field, which is consistent with the idea that the energy released during the flares is stored in the highly <b>sheared</b> <b>fields</b> prior to the flare...|$|R

40|$|Tidal torque theory {{suggests}} that galaxies gain angular momentum in the linear stage of structure formation. Such a theory predicts alignments between the spin of haloes and tidal <b>shear</b> <b>field.</b> However, non-linear evolution and angular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly. In this paper, we use a reconstruction of the cosmic <b>shear</b> <b>field</b> from observed peculiar velocities combined with spin axes extracted from galaxies within $ 115 \, \mathrm{Mpc} $ ($\sim 8000 \, {\mathrm {km}}{\mathrm s}^{- 1 }$) from 2 MRS catalog, to test whether or not galaxies appear aligned with principal axes of <b>shear</b> <b>field.</b> Although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked at similar issues, {{this is the first}} such study to examine galaxy alignments with velocity-shear field. Ellipticals in the 2 MRS sample, show a statistically significant alignment with two of the principal axes of the <b>shear</b> <b>field.</b> In general, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis of greatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression. Spiral galaxies show no signal. Such an alignment is significantly strengthened when considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity field reconstruction. When examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axis of greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. This result indicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairly noisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with <b>shear</b> <b>field</b> is strong enough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered - especially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.

This work examines, {{by means of a}} population balance technique, the kinetics of platelet aggregation in a <b>shear</b> <b>field.</b> The particle collision efficiency, epsilon, and the particle void volume fraction, phi, are estimated from particle number density data. The collision efficiency represents the fraction of particle collisions that result in the binding together of the involved particles.

Experiments focused on the dependence of epsilon on platelet concentration, shearing rate, and time in a controlled <b>shear</b> <b>field.</b> The collision efficiency is lower in dilute platelet suspensions. This finding supports an ADP-mediated mechanism for shear aggregation. The collision efficiency passes through a maximum with respect to shearing rate, suggesting a competition between the opposing effects of increasing platelet activation and increasing collision violence.
