Pinned at their ten-yard line by the Georgia punt, Virginia Tech went three-and-out and was itself forced to punt.|$|E

40|$|The {{deflection}} of Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer Reinforced Concrete (GFRP RC) {{is often}} the governing criterion for design. The lack of fundamental research particularly on the tension <b>stiffening</b> behaviour of GFRP RC has hindered both the development of fundamental equations to predict deflection {{and the use of}} nonlinear Finite Element (FE) analysis for predicting the structural behaviour of GFRP RC. This thesis investigates the tension <b>stiffening</b> effect of GFRP RC in an effort to improve the predictability of GFRP RC deformation behaviour. The study adopts a holistic approach for tension <b>stiffening</b> which considers the bond as the building block for tension <b>stiffening</b> modelling and tension <b>stiffening</b> as being a macroscopic representation of bond modelling. In this study tension <b>stiffening</b> is experimentally evaluated first against more generic variables like concrete strength, reinforcement ratio and bar diameter. This is followed by a detailed study on bond between concrete and GFRP which results {{in the development of a}} strain distribution function to represent bond between cracks. This formed the basis for the development of a comprehensive model to analyse the tension <b>stiffening</b> behaviour of direct tension tests. After evaluating the tension <b>stiffening</b> test results against existing code-based formulations, the CEB-FIP model is recalibrated to represent the tension <b>stiffening</b> behaviour of GFRP RC, thereby providing a simplified means to evaluate tension <b>stiffening</b> behaviour of GFRP RC. The successful implementation of the tension <b>stiffening</b> model is demonstrated through the prediction of deflection of flexural elements using a general nonlinear FE analysis package (ABAQUS) that uses the smeared crack approach to model the reinforced concrete behaviour.

40|$|Building codes {{consider}} the tension <b>stiffening</b> when calculating the crack {{width of the}} flexural members. A simple analytical procedure is proposed for the determination of forces, stresses and strains acting on a reinforced concrete section subjected to flexure considering the concrete contribution in tension up to tensile concrete strain corresponding to the cracking strength of concrete. This analytical method gives the minimum value (lower bound) of tension <b>stiffening.</b> Also, a commercial Finite Element Program (ABAQUS 2007) was used to perform non-linear analysis in order to evaluate the total contribution of the tensioned concrete in carrying loads which may be considered as the upper bound of tension <b>stiffening.</b> In addition, a comparison is carried out among the different codes using four reinforced concrete rectangular models to compare and evaluate the tension <b>stiffening</b> with proposed analytical lower bound tension <b>stiffening</b> and upper bound as obtained by ABAQUS. The models include different percentages of flexural steel ratio. The comparison revealed that the codes’ equations always consider tension <b>stiffening</b> lying between lower and upper bound of tension <b>stiffening</b> proposed in this study.

40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) {{is associated}} with structural and mechanical changes in the pulmonary vascular bed that increase right ventricular (RV) afterload. These changes, characterized by narrowing and <b>stiffening,</b> occur in both proximal and distal pulmonary arteries (PAs). An important consequence of arterial narrowing is increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Arterial <b>stiffening,</b> which can occur in both the proximal and distal pulmonary arteries, is an important index of disease progression and is a significant contributor to increased RV afterload in PH. In particular, arterial narrowing and <b>stiffening</b> increase the RV afterload by increasing steady and oscillatory RV work, respectively. Here we review {{the current state of}} knowledge of the causes and consequences of pulmonary arterial <b>stiffening</b> in PH and its impact on RV function.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense <b>stiffened</b> and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|As had Virginia Tech, Air Force {{began moving}} {{the ball on}} the ground. The Falcons were aided by two offsides {{penalties}} against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory.

The Tech defense <b>stiffened,</b> forcing a fourth down at the two-yard line. Rather than kick a field goal, Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown, and Mike Brown ran the needed twoyards. The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 177 lead with 6:00 remaining in the game.|$|E
40|$|Tension <b>stiffening</b> is a {{characteristic}} behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams which is {{directly affected by}} the bond-slip property of steel bar and concrete interfaces. A beam strengthened with a near-surface mounted (NSM) technique {{would be even more}} affected by tension <b>stiffening,</b> as the NSM reinforcement also possess a bond-slip property. Yet assessing how much the tension <b>stiffening</b> of NSM contributes to the behavior of RC beams is difficult {{due to the fact that}} bond-slip effects cannot be directly incorporated into a strain-based moment-curvature analysis. As such, the tension <b>stiffening</b> is typically incorporated through various empirical formulations, which can require a great deal of testing and calibrations to be done. In this paper a relatively new method, which can be called the mechanics-based segmental approach, is used to directly simulate the tension <b>stiffening</b> effect of NSM reinforcements on RC beams, without the need for empirical formulations to indirectly simulate the tension <b>stiffening.</b> Analysis shows that the tension <b>stiffening</b> of NSM fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) contributes a significant portion to the stiffness and strength of the strengthened RC beam not only during serviceability, but at all load levels...|$|R

The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is <b>stiffened</b> by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects.

5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was <b>stiffened</b> with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E

Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights <b>stiffened</b> resistance.

The influence of concrete strength, reinforcement ratio and bar diameter on tension <b>stiffening</b> is investigated by testing elements in direct tension.

An {{increase in the}} tension <b>stiffening</b> behavior with decrease in reinforcement ratio and increase in concrete strength was observed.
