5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do <b>see</b> <b>is</b> a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church, {{also known}} as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.29billion members worldwide.

5|$|The visible {{surface of}} the Sun, the {{photosphere}}, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, {{and almost all of}} its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light we <b>see</b> <b>is</b> produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.|$|E

5|$|At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report.

On the other hand, titles such as archbishop or patriarch imply no ontological alteration, and existing bishops who rise to those offices do not require further ordination.|$|E
