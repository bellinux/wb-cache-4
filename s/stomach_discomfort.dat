40|$|Purging Disorder (PD) is {{characterized}} by purging after normal or small amounts of food among individuals who are not underweight. Several studies indicate that PD is associated with distress and impairment, underscoring the need for intervention. However, {{little is known about}} factors that trigger and maintain purging in PD. This study examined antecedents and consequences of purging using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), a design that involved repeated assessments of current psychological states in participants 2 ̆ 7 natural environments. Women with PD (N = 24) were recruited from the community to make multiple daily ratings of affect, shape/weight concerns, violation of dietary rules, and <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort</b> using random-, interval-, and event-contingent recordings over a two-week period. Multilevel model analyses were used to examine between-day differences (purge versus non-purge day) and within-day changes in psychological variables relative to purging behavior. Results supported study hypotheses that negative affect and shape/weight concerns would be higher and positive affect would be lower on days when participants purged compared to days they did not purge. In addition, antecedent analyses supported within-day increases in negative affect, shape/weight concerns, and <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort</b> prior to purging; however, only changes in positive affect and shape/weight concerns on purge days differed from naturally-occurring changes observed on non-purge days. For consequence analyses, negative affect, shape/weight concerns, and <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort</b> decreased following purging on purge days, and trajectories of change were significantly different from non-purge days. Finally, exploratory analyses suggested that lower levels of impulsivity enhanced associations between antecedent affect and purging. These data are crucial to understand why women with PD purge after consuming normal or small amounts of food and may point to specific targets for the development of effective interventions...|$|E

The extract revealed the presence of flavonoids, tannins, terpenes, steroidal and cardiac glycosides. The antimicrobial activity of the plant extract was assayed by the agar plate disc diffusion and nutrient broth dilution techniques. Test microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella spp. and Candida albicans; all the organisms were laboratory isolates. The extract inhibited the growth of all the test organisms especially against Klebsiella spp. and S. aureus which had mean inhibition zone of 42. 3 ± 1. 5 and 32. 3 ± 1. 5 mm respectively.

40|$|Specific amino acids, such as arginine, lysine and ornithine, {{can stimulate}} growth hormone (GH) release when infused {{intravenously}} or administered orally. Many individuals consume amino acids before strength training workouts, believing this practice accentuates the exercise-induced GH release, thereby promoting greater gains in muscle mass and strength. The GH response to amino acid administration {{has a high}} degree of interindividual variability and may be altered by training status, sex, age, and diet. Although parenteral administration consistently leads to increased circulating GH concentration, oral doses that are great enough to induce significant GH release are likely to cause <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort</b> and diarrhea. During exercise, intensity is a major determinant of GH release. Although one study showed that arginine infusion can heighten the GH response to exercise, no studies found that pre-exercise oral amino acid supplementation augments GH release. Further, no appropriately conducted scientific studies found that oral supplementation with amino acids, which are capable of inducing GH release, before strength training increases muscle mass and strength {{to a greater extent than}} strength training alone.

The histological assessment was done by two experienced pathologists following clinical guidelines according to “the updated Sydney System” (Dixon et al., 1996). The inclusion criteria were a confirmed diagnosis of gastritis according to histological examination. Autoimmune gastritis patients were excluded. The Helicobacter pylori infection for all patients was identified by pathological examination. Healthy volunteers were recruited from Tsinghua University during their annual physical examination in the hospital.

40|$|Objective: In Rheumatology, non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{has been}} widely prescribed and used. However, despite their clinical benefits {{in the management of}} inflammatory and degenerative joint disease, NSAIDs have considerable side effects, mostly affecting the upper gastrointestinal system, which therefore, limit their use. This study was conducted to determine the patients’ knowledge and perception regarding the used of NSAIDS. Methods: A total of 120 patients who attended the rheumatology clinic Hospital, Raja Permaisuri Bainun, Malaysia, and received NSAIDs more than 3 months were interviewed irrespective of the irrheumatological conditions. Patient’s knowledge and perception on the side effects of NSAIDs were recorded. Result: Fifty-four percent of the patients obtained information regarding the side effect of NSAIDs either from the rheumatologist, rheumatology staff nurse or other medical staffs (75. 4 %). The remaining 45. 8 % were naive of such knowledge. Fifteen percent obtained the information by surfing the internet and 9. 2 % from printed media.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The {{concentration}} of H 2 S in groundwater {{is a significant}} problem in various areas across Canada. Hydrogen sulphide dissolves in ground water imparting undesirable taste and irritating rotten egg smell which makes it unpalatable. Ingestion of sulphides through drinking water can result in <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort,</b> nausea and vomiting. Humans exposed to high concentrations of H 2 S for prolonged periods show symptoms of gastro-intestinal upset, anorexia, nausea, somnolence, amnesia, loss of consciousness, delirium, hallucinations, difficulty in swallowing, low blood pressure, slowing of heart rate, double vision and epileptiform convulsions. Hydrogen sulphide in blood is rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen and thus reduces the oxidation power of haemoglobin. Unoxidized hydrogen sulphide can act upon {{the central nervous system}} and cause either paralysis or respiratory failure. It is therefore, necessary to have a very low {{concentration of}} H 2 S in the water. Approach: An automatic system for the addition of KMnO 4 and removal of hydrogen sulphide from ground water was developed and tested. The system consisted of a freshwater tank, a pump, a chemical storage tank, a solenoid valve, a photocell and electronic circuit, a drainage tank, a filter and a set of valves. It was possible to use a photocell to detect the presence of excess KMnO 4 in the system and to control the addition of KMnO 4 into the system.

The current pharmacological management for diabetes {{has been reported to}} have some unpleasant side effects such as hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, and <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort</b> [2]. Medicinal plants are considered a good source for mining biologically active compounds. The current study investigates the potential of Calliandra surinamensis to yield anti-diabetic compounds. C. surinamensis leaves and bark were collected from the Cayman Islands in 2015. The plant materials were ground and then Soxhlet extraction was performed using hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Ethyl acetate and hexane extracts were subjected to open column silica gel chromatography, while the methanol extracts were separated by Sephadex column chromatography. Structural elucidation of isolated compounds was carried out using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H NMR and 13 C NMR). Three compounds, not previously reported in C. surinamensis were isolated; these were myricitrin, lupeol, and ferulic acid. Myricitrin is known to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [3], lupeol is reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities [4], and ferulic acid has shown anti-microbial activities in previous studies [5]. C. surinamensis and the isolated compounds have not been investigated for anti-diabetic activity before and so in this study, crude extracts of C. surinamensis were biologically tested for anti-diabetic activity using various in vitro assays such as dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) enzyme assays. These produced negative results (P > 0. 05) and so other in vitro assays (α-amylase, and α-glucosidase) as well as the isolated compounds are being assessed for anti-diabetic potential...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze {{potential}} drug interactions and adverse reactions to NSAIDs in elderly users of a private drug distribution service. Method: A prospective, exploratory and descriptive study with a quantitative approach was performed. The elderly users of NSAIDs attended by the service were interviewed and their prescriptions analyzed between May and September, 2014. Analysis of drug interactions was performed through computerized databases. The post-sales analysis of adverse reactions was performed using the Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale. Statistical analysis was performed with the Chi-squared and Fisher's Exact tests. Results: The study evaluated 200 elderly persons, among whom women predominated (56. 5 %). The average age was 65 years ± 10. The NSAIDs accounted for 38. 7 % of prescription drugs used, and included dipyrone (26. 9 %), nimesulide (22. 8 %) and ketoprofen (16. 3 %). A total of 8. 5 % of such drugs were considered inappropriate medications for the elderly. A total of 104 potential drug interactions were identified, of which 24 % were considered highly clinically significant. The NSAIDs with the greatest risk of interactions were ketoprofen 46. 2 %, ketorolac 14. 4 %, nimesulide 12. 5 % and diclofenac 9. 6 %. In post-sales monitoring 30. 5 % of the elderly persons reported undesirable symptoms after the use of NSAIDs, with <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort</b> the most prevalent (17 %). Conclusion: The present study confirmed the importance of monitoring the use of NSAIDs among the elderly due to the increased risk of drug interactions and adverse reactions associated with age, concomitant diseases, multi- prescriptions and polypharmacy. The choice of appropriate drugs for the elderly, the reconciliation of all the medications taken by the patient, and effective pharmaceutical care are measures that can contribute to the rational and safe use of NSAIDs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bixa orellana L. {{has been}} {{traditionally}} used in Central and South America {{to treat a}} number of ailments, including internal inflammation, and in other tropical countries like Malaysia as treatment for gastric ulcers and <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort.</b> The current study aimed to determine the major chemical constituents of the aqueous extract of B. orellana (AEBO) and to evaluate the antihistamine activity of AEBO during acute inflammation induced in rats. Methods Acute inflammation was produced by subplantar injection of 0. 1 [*]mL of 0. 1 % histamine into the right hind paw of each rat in the control and treatment groups. The degree of edema was measured before injection {{and at the time}} points of 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 [*]min after injection. Changes of peritoneal vascular permeability were studied using Evans blue dye as a detector. Vascular permeability was evaluated by the amount of dye leakage into the peritoneal cavity in rats. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of AEBO on biochemical mediators of vascular permeability, the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined in histamine-treated paw tissues. The major constituents of AEBO were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results AEBO produced a significant inhibition of histamine-induced paw edema starting at 60 [*]min time point, with maximal percentage of inhibition (60. 25 %) achieved with a dose of 150 [*]mg/kg of AEBO at 60 [*]min time point. Up to 99 % of increased peritoneal vascular permeability produced by histamine was successfully suppressed by AEBO. The expression of biochemical mediators of vascular permeability, NO and VEGF, was also found to be downregulated in the AEBO treated group. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the major constituent in AEBO was acetic acid. Conclusions The experimental findings demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory activity of AEBO was due to its inhibitory effect on vascular permeability, which was suppressed {{as a result of the}} reduced expression of biochemical mediators (NO and VEGF) in tissues. Our results contribute towards the validation of the traditional use of Bixa orellana in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. </p...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{concentration}} of H 2 S in groundwater {{is a significant}} problem in various areas across Canada. Hydrogen sulphide dissolves in ground water imparting undesirable taste and irritating rotten egg smell which makes it unpalatable. Ingestion of sulphides through drinking water can result in <b>stomach</b> <b>discomfort,</b> nausea and vomiting. Humans exposed to high concentrations of H 2 S for prolonged periods show symptoms of gastro-intestinal upset, anorexia, nausea, somnolence, amnesia, loss of consciousness, delirium, hallucinations, difficulty in swallowing, low blood pressure, slowing of heart rate, double vision and epileptiform convulsions. Hydrogen sulphide in blood is rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen and thus reduces the oxidation power of haemoglobin. Unoxidized hydrogen sulphide can act upon {{the central nervous system}} and cause either paralysis or respiratory failure. It is therefore, necessary to have a very low {{concentration of}} H 2 S in the water. Approach: An automatic system for the addition of KMnO 4 and removal of hydrogen sulphide from ground water was developed and tested. The system consisted of a freshwater tank, a pump, a chemical storage tank, a solenoid valve, a photocell and electronic circuit, a drainage tank, a filter and a set of valves. It was possible to use a photocell to detect the presence of excess KMnO 4 in the system and to control the addition of KMnO 4 into the system. Results: The system accomplished complete removal of hydrogen sulphide in the range of 1 - 30 ppm. The present system utilizes on/off control for the addition of the chemical. The amount of KMnO 4 needed {{as a percentage of the}} amount used was in the range of 5 - 28 %. Conclusion: The photocell and circuit could be used to add an amount of chemical that is constantly proportional to the amount of hydrogen sulphide in the water. The control of a positive displacement chemical feed pump would be an ideal application for this system. The speed of the pump could be controlled in such a manner that would allow a very small excess amount of potassium permanganate to be maintained in the system...|$|E
40|$|Background: Forced expiratory {{volume in}} one second (FEV 1) {{is a good}} {{predictor}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). COPD is characterized by a chronic limitation of airflow. This study was designed to compare the effects and complications of theophylline alone, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) alone, and {{a combination of the two}} drugs on the rates of FEV 1 in patients with COPD who were candidates for off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 100 patients who had a smoking history of 27 pack years with a range of 20 to 40 pack years but were not heavy smokers and were candidates for elective off-pump CABG surgery in Afshar Cardiovascular Hospital, Yazd, Iran. The patients with a history of asthma and bronchospasm and non-COPD respiratory disorders were excluded. There were three groups, that is, the theophylline group (n= 33) that received theophylline 10 mg/kg TDS after consumption of food, NAC group (n= 33) who received NAC 10 - 15 mg/kg BD after consumption of food, and the combined group (n= 32) who received theophylline and NAC together. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi-square, and exact test for quantitative and qualitative variables. Results: One hundred patients with COPD enrolled in this study as possible candidates for CABG surgery. Average age of the patients was 60. 36 ± 10. 21 years. Of the participants, 83 (83. 3 %) were male and 17 (17 %) were female. Rate of postoperative FEV 1 to basal FEV 1 was 0. 76 ± 0. 32, 0. 66 ± 0. 22, and 0. 69 ± 0. 24 in the treatments with theophylline, NAC, and the combination, respectively. Theophylline, NAC, and a combination of these drugs can decrease the rate of postoperative FEV 1 compared to basal FEV 1 significantly. (P= 0. 0001) Conclusion: Theophylline alone, NAC alone, and a combination of these drugs improve pulmonary function, and there are no significant differences between these protocols. <b>Stomach</b> <b>discomfort</b> and cardiac complications in treatment with theophylline alone is significantly higher than NAC alone and the combination...|$|E
