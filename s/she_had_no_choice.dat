5|$|After {{spending}} {{two months}} in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin {{and his wife and}} daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped {{that he would not be}} punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several unsuccessful attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel Trimardeur.|$|E
25|$|The {{daughter}} {{was not only}} in her father's power to be given in marriage, but he might dedicate her {{to the service of}} a god as a vestal or a hierodule or give her as a concubine. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> in these matters, often decided in her childhood. An adult daughter might wish to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial marriage, and it seems that her father could not refuse her wish.|$|E
25|$|In {{a session}} in {{parliament}} {{on the issue}} of Hirsi Ali's citizenship, Verdonk said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to revoke her passport, as it had been issued under a false name and false date of birth. Some members of parliament suggested that Verdonk's stern actions were a result of her political ambitions in the 2006 VVD leadership elections. The result of the debate was that Verdonk promised to have another look at the case and see if it was possible for Hirsi Ali keep her citizenship.|$|E

25|$|The next year, in 1993, Karam {{signed with}} another record label {{for her new}} album. This time it was an even less-known Saudi Arabian company. The new album was called Ana Ma'akon ("I am with you"). The album was classic in style and quite {{different}} from Shams el-Ghinnieh, not really reflecting Najwa's artistic identity. Despite her personal discontent, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but release it, bound by a contract with her production company. As expected, the album failed to {{do as well as}} Shams el-Ghinnieh. Poor marketing and lack of resources did not help much either and were blamed for the low sales of the album. It remains Karam's least-known album, although many of her fans consider it the best, in terms of showing Najwa's abilities and voice-power.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, Kathy {{has escaped}} Gavin, and she {{contacts}} her old friend Tracey (Jane Slaughter), at The Queen Vic, giving her {{an address to}} pass on to Phil. Gavin follows Phil to a small hotel. He reaches Kathy first and takes her to a small airfield, with the intent of flying away from England. Phil and Ronnie intercept them and convince Kathy to come back to Walford with them. While Phil arranges a hotel for her to stay in, she hides in The Arches, where she comes face to face with Sharon, who is stunned to find she is alive. They have an angry confrontation which leads to a physical fight, before Phil moves Kathy to a nearby hotel. Within a week, Kathy is revealed to have Gavin hidden in her bathroom, with him controlling her again. After Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) talks him out of suicide, Ian is shocked to see Kathy is alive and has witnessed the event. As Ian crosses the road to meet Kathy, he is hit by an oncoming car and rushed to hospital. Ian eventually regains consciousness and breaks down in happiness when he realises that Kathy is alive, but reveals he wants answers for her faking her death. As Ian is leaving hospital, Jane threatens Kathy to stay away from Walford in a bid to protect Ian. Ian demands to see Kathy and she explains to him that Gavin forced her to go on the run with him as part of an insurance scam and he had controlled her for years and she felt <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> Ian persuades her to go to the police and she agrees, however, she lies about why she is there when she enters the station by claiming her handbag is stolen and later tells Ian that she told them everything and they are looking for Gavin. She then secretly meets Gavin who reminds her of their plan.|$|E
500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear {{coming out of her}} eye. She didn’t want to do it, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> — almost like how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> to kill her father. I’m not saying I agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Basically, this is {{the tale}} of a 16-year-old black girl living in a right-wing, dystopian future California.

She is forced to give her baby up for adoption, since she cannot afford to feed two.|$|R
500|$|Late in 1940, Stevenson was {{nominated}} {{to be the}} first Director of the planned Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF). Although keen to support the war effort in some capacity, she refused owing to the administrative and social obstacles she foresaw in the role, but her appointment went ahead regardless on 21 May 1941. The Air Member for Personnel, Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, had selected Stevenson on the basis of her management background, academic qualifications and knowledge of women's organisations, and because she was not a [...] "socialite". [...] Despite her initial misgivings, Stevenson felt <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept the appointment, which took effect on 9 June.|$|E
500|$|The {{hold that}} the {{darkness}} has over her does not disappear when she escapes and the Tombs are brought {{down in an}} earthquake by the nameless ones. She contemplates killing Ged, blaming him for her pain, but eventually learns to accept her guilt over her actions, realizing that though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> in her actions as a priestess, she now has a choice {{to move away from}} them; but this [...] "freedom is a heavy load". Le Guin ends the novel with the reassuring sentence [...] "Gravely she walked beside [...] up the white streets of Havnor, holding his hand, like a child coming home", suggesting that she has been successful in finding new connections in her life. The conclusion of the novel represents the successful end of a quest that Ged undertook as a mature wizard, part of the story arc that traces his character development across the first three Earthsea books; thus The Tombs of Atuan has been described as part of Ged's coming-of-age as well.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Byrd had no history of drug {{addiction}} or abuse and no criminal record, she felt like <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to agree to drug court supervision or go to prison.

2500|$|This coolness between 1955 and 1959 is {{the only}} hint that perhaps she did mind his other lady friends, but little is known of Rudge's views of Pound's [...] "other women". <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to {{tolerate}} the existence of his wife. Marcella Spann, an English teacher, began to write to him in St. Elizabeth's, which led to visits. Following his release, Spann accompanied Ezra and Dorothy back to Italy, acting as his secretary. Pound {{is alleged to have}} proposed to her (although he was already married), but Dorothy sent Spann packing. Nevertheless, Spann and Pound jointly edited the 1964 volume Confucius to Cummings: An Anthology of Poetry.|$|E
2500|$|In the basement, while Hook contemplates an escape, Zelena {{says that}} her anti-magic cuff is the real problem. Hook says he has magic in his hook, but says that {{the last time he}} helped her, she betrayed him. She says that even though he doesn't know if he can trust her, he has no choice now. He slips off the cuff and she gets rid of her shackles, and puts herself into a fresh outfit, before coming over to Hook and undoing his shackles. Zelena tells Hook they have to sneak out the back, but Hook says he’s not going. When Zelena {{questions}} why, Hook says he needs to stop Emma, and Zelena bids him goodbye. Hook searches Emma's house then takes a painting off the wall, but then, Emma comes in, saying that she was trying to help Hook. Hook finds the squid ink {{on the back of the}} painting and splashes her with it, saying that she’s a villain now, like Regina said. He says she has to tell him what happened in Camelot, but Emma says that he can't make her. Zelena returns and says she that she couldn't leave without making the Dark One pay. Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can explain everything. Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and says <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them. She says all she did was to try to save him, but Hook is enraged, saying, [...] "So much for our future, Swan." [...] Zelena asks if he’s ready to find out what else happened in Camelot and he says yes, much to Emma's dismay. But Hook tells Zelena that first, they have to take care of Emma.|$|E
