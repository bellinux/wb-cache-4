40|$|Abstract—In this work, we {{analyze the}} {{deformation}} of surface waves in shallow flows conditions, propagating in a channel of slowly varying cross-section. Based on a singular perturbation technique, {{the main purpose}} is to predict the motion of waves by using a dimensionless formulation of the governing equations, considering that the longitudinal variation of the transversal section obey a power-law distribution. We show that the spatial distribution of the waves in the varying cross-section {{is a function of}} a kinematic parameter, κ, and two geometrical parameters ε h and wε. The above spatial behavior of the surface elevation is modeled by an ordinary differential equation. The use of single formulas to model the varying cross sections or transitions considered in this work can be a useful approximation to natural or artificial geometrical configurations.

40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} experimental results {{obtained in the}} SILENE test reactor on pressure waves accompagnying fast power transients. Measurement data from a pressure sensor in the fissile solution {{was used to determine}} the relation between the maximum pressure wave amplitude bp and certain characteristic parameters of the first peak:w(the reciprocal of the period) and 2 (the energy integrated up to the maximum of the pressure peak). The results indicate that the pressure signal is initiated prior to the maximum of the power peak; it is very likely that the radiolysis gases contribute negative reactivity to the excursion kinetics, compounding the temperature effect. On the basis of theses findings it may be affirmed that a signifi-cant pressure wave would only be generated during a fissile <b>solution</b> <b>power</b> excursion if the phenomenon occurred very quickly (i. e. in less thant 10 msec). ...|$|E

The Continuous Class-E Sub-Waveform Solution PA prototype shows efficiency as high as 80 % while delivering output power of 4 W and gain > 10 dB at 2 GHz of frequency and ambient temperature. The PA module has also been tested at high temperature T = 150 °C revealing targeted performance with efficiency up to 71 % while delivering 3. 5 W of output power.

The compensation of the variations of the total flow through the evaporators is implemented using the variation of the capacity of the compressor and a corresponding change in flow through the auxiliary gas cooler of the heat pump. Control system of this gas cooler is constructed using the invariance principle of the output value (outlet temperature of the heated agent) with respect to perturbations on the control channel (the refrigerant flow through the gas cooler). Principle of dual-channel compensation of the disturbance and advancing signal on input of control valve of the refrigerant through the gas cooler is ensured.

Dairy powders are a dehydrated nonperishable globally important food commodity providing nutrition in both developed and developing regions around the world. The ability to rehydrate powders for use as food ingredients differs depending on the composition, processing history, and handling conditions with certain powders being more difficult to solubilize than others. In this chapter we focus mainly on the easily hydrated whey protein-based powders and the often more difficult powders to solubilize in the form of milk protein concentrates. Taking frequency into account, we discuss the use of high-power ultrasound as a method to aid powder solubilization through particle dissociation. Ultrasound as a technology is yet to be adopted commercially as a processing tool by the food-manufacturing industry, and limitations associated with the technique including equipment design are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of increasing component power consumption, {{a desire for}} denser systems, and the required performance growth {{in the face of}} technology-scaling issues are posing enormous challenges for powering and cooling of server systems. The challenges are directly linked to the peak power consumption of servers. Our <b>solution,</b> <b>Power</b> Shifting, reduces the peak power consumption of servers minimizing the impact on performance. We reduce peak power consumption by using workload-guided dynamic allocation of power among components incorporating real-time performance feedback, activity-related power estimation techniques, and performance-sensitive activity-regulation mechanisms to enforce power budgets. We apply our techniques to a computer system with a single processor and memory. Power shifting adds a system power manager with a dynamic, global view of the system’s power consumption to continuously re-budget the available power amongst the two components. Our contributions include: • Demonstration of the greater effectiveness of dynamic power allocation over static budgeting, • Evaluation of different power shifting policies, • Analysis of system and workload factors critical to successful power shifting, and • Proposal of performance-sensitive power budget enforcement mechanisms that ensure system reliability...|$|E
30|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of electronic}} loads has produced several power quality issues to the utility grid [1]. This kind of loads, also referred as nonlinear loads (NLLs), have negative effects on the power system, for instance, distorted grid currents, low power factor, distorted grid voltage, overheating of electrical machines as well as distribution transformers, among others [2]. Since the power quality {{is a measure of}} the efficient use of the electrical energy, this concept has become a critical concern in electrical distribution systems. Thus, several standards like IEC 555 - 2, IEC 1000 - 3 - 2 and IEC 519 [3, 4, 5] have been developed to maintain safe limits on the harmonic distortion produced and injected by the NLL to the grid. The power electronics equipment involved in a rectification process is commonly related with current harmonic distortion. Examples of these equipments are uncontrolled rectifiers, phase angle controller rectifiers among others, which produce highly distorted grid currents. As a <b>solution,</b> <b>power</b> converters with capacity of power factor corrector (PFC) have been developed [6, 7]. This kind of power converters are able to mitigate the harmonic pollution and thus, achieve a power factor close to unity.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} fluid-structure {{interaction model}} is {{developed for the}} analysis of viscous flow over elastic membrane structures. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized on a moving body-fitted unstructured triangular grid using the finite volume method, taking into account grid non-orthogonality, and implementing the SIMPLE algorithm for pressure <b>solution,</b> <b>power</b> law implicit differencing and Rhie-Chow explicit mass flux interpolations. The membrane is discretized as a set of links that coincide with a subset of the fluid mesh edges. A new model is introduced to distribute local and global elastic effects to aid stability of the structure model and damping effects are also included. A pseudo-structural approach using a balance of mesh edge spring tensions and cell internal pressures controls the motion of fluid mesh nodes based on the displacements of the membrane. Following initial validation, the model is applied to the case of a two-dimensional membrane pinned at both ends at an angle of attack of 4 ° to the oncoming flow, at a Reynolds number based on the chord length of 4 × 103. A series of tests on membranes of different elastic stiffness investigates their unsteady movements over time. The membranes of higher elastic stiffness adopt a stable equilibrium shape, while the membrane of lowest elastic stiffness demonstrates unstable interactions between its inflated shape and the resulting unsteady wake. These unstable effects are shown to be significantly magnified by the flexible nature of the membrane compared with a rigid surface of the same average shape...|$|E
