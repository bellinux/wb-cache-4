30|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to develop a {{protection}} scheme that utilizes the highly nonlinear input–output mapping characteristics of ANN and multi resolution feature extraction capability of wavelet transform, this paper introduces a new approach based on wavelet transform and modular neural network to classify and locate the fault using one end transmission line data. As compared to the conventional stand alone single neural network, the incorporation of modularity allows reduction in the model complexity, higher learning capability and immunity from disturbances (Santos and Senger 2011). The complexity of conventional standalone ANNs increases with increase in the input output data. Considering the very large data resulting from different faults in six phase lines with varying parameters, in the present work modular ANN has been adopted. The proposed algorithm uses the standard deviation of approximate coefficients of voltage and current signals {{at one end of the}} line and thus evades the need of data transfer. The test results ascertain that the proposed algorithm correctly detects and classifies all type of shunt faults within one cycle from the inception of fault and locates the fault accurately with maximum error of ± 0.688  %. The results also validate the aptness of the proposed algorithm for any type of <b>shunt</b> <b>fault</b> irrespective of its fault location, fault inception angle, fault resistance, short circuit capacity and its X/R ratio, voltage or frequency variation.|$|E

30|$|The wavelet transform, WT [11, 12] {{has been}} used as a potent tool for {{transient}} fault analysis. It provides the number of filter banks like H.P and L.P filters, which divide input signal of frequency-band into high-frequency and low-frequency signal discussed in the Mallat’s algorithm [12].The performance based on variable-sized, windowing technique. More precise low-frequency information’s can be achieved using longer time intervals on the other way high-frequency information’s can be obtained by means of short interval window size. WT analysis occasionally compresses /de-noise the signal lacking significant degradation of performance. It decomposes the signal into the number of basic function set called as wavelets. Mother wavelet [13] can be decomposed into the various types of scaled & shifted versions to obtain prototype wavelets. Appropriate mother wavelet selection [14] is also a very important issue for fault signal analysis to achieve better accuracy. The most convenient and highly accurate signal processing technique utilized is the wavelet analysis. The wavelets are the families of the functions produced from a single function, known as the mother wavelet. It can be done by means of scaling and translating operations. The scaling operation is used to dilate and compress the mother wavelet to obtain the respective high and low frequency information of the function to be analyzed. Then the translation is used to obtain the time information. In this way a family of scaled and translated wavelets is created and it serves as the base for representing the function to be analysed.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a {{design for a}} fault diagnosis system (FDS) for tapped high/extra-high voltage (HV/EHV) power transmission lines (TL's). These tapped lines have two different protection zones. The proposed approach reduces the cost and {{the complexity of the}} FDS for these types of lines. The FDS, basically, utilizes fifteen artificial neural networks (ANN's) to reach its output diagnosis. The FDS basic objectives are mainly: 1. the detection of the system fault; 2. the localization of the faulted zone; 3. the classification of the fault type; and finally 4. the identification of the faulted phase. This FDS is structured in a three hierarchical stages. In the first stage, a preprocessing unit to the input data is performed. An ANN, in the second stage, is designed in order to detect and zone localize the line faults. In the third stage, two zone diagnosis systems (ZDS) are designed. Each ZDS is dedicated to one zone and consists of seven parallel-cascaded ANN's. Four-parallel ANN's are designed in order to achieve the fault type classification. While, the other three cascaded ANN’s are designed mainly for the selection of the faulted phase. A smoothing unit is also configured to smooth out the output response of the proposed FDS. The proposed FDS is designed and evaluated using the local measurements of the three-phase voltage and current samples acquired at only one side. A sampling rate of 16 samples per cycle of the power frequency was taken. A data window of 4 samples was also utilized. These samples were generated using the EMTP simulation program, applied to the High-Dam/Cairo 500 kV tapped TL. All possible <b>shunt</b> <b>fault</b> types were considered.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach for}} estimating {{the locations of}} transmission line faults has been to measure the apparent impedance from a line terminal to the fault and to convert the reactive component of the impedance to line length. Several methods, that use voltages and currents measured at one or both line terminals, have been proposed in the past. Methods for locating faults on radial transmission lines and rural distribution feeders have also been suggested. These methods do not adequately address {{the problems associated with}} fault location on distribution systems that have single or multiphase laterals and/or tapped loads. A technique that estimates the location of a <b>shunt</b> <b>fault</b> on a radial distribution system that has several single and/or multiphase laterals has been developed. Load taps and non-homogeneity of the system are taken into account. The apparent location of a fault is first estimated by computing the impedance from the fundamental frequency voltage and current phasors, and converting the reactive component of the impedance to line length. The sequence voltages and currents at the fault are expressed as functions of the distance to the fault as well as the impedances of loads beyond the fault. The expression for the imaginary component of the fault impedance is equated to zero and the resulting equation is solved using an iterative approach. Multiple estimates may be obtained for a fault in a distribution system that has laterals. One of the estimates is identified as the most likely fault location by using information from fault indicators which are strategically placed on the laterals. The developed technique, which can handle single-phase-to-ground, two-phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase and balanced three-phase faults was tested to evaluate its suitability. Results from computer simulations of faults indicate that the proposed technique is more accurate than the reactive component method. Studies also demonstrate that the sensitivity of the proposed technique is comparable to that of the reactive component method. A prototype fault location system was also developed. The system was tested using simulated voltage and current waveforms. Results show a close agreement with those obtained from the non-real time tests...|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{involvement}} of larger number of conductors, the possibility of occurrence of faults in six phase transmission line is more as compared to three phase line. The total number of <b>shunt</b> <b>faults</b> that can occur in six phase system is 120, {{which is much more}} as compared to 22 in three phase double circuit and 11 in three phase single circuit transmission lines (Bhatt et al. 1977; Nanda et al. 1981; Venkata et al. 1982 a, b). The greater number of possible faults in six phase transmission line, demands the use of a relatively more complex, reliable and fast protection scheme. In this regard, limited protection techniques have been reported for protection of six phase lines in literature (Rebbapragada et al. 1992; Apostolov and George 1992; Apostolov and Raffensperger 1996; Oppel et al. 1998; Oppel and Krizauskas 1999; Redfern 1997; Hajjar and Mansour 2006; Hajjar and Mansour M 2007; Coury et al. 2002). Rebbapragada et al. reviewed the applicability of the commercially available digital protection scheme for the protection of six phase line in (Rebbapragada et al. 1992). Apostolov et al. analyzed the implementation of microprocessor based relays with programmable logic (designed for conventional three-phase systems) {{for the protection of the}} six phase test line in (Apostolov and George 1992; Apostolov and Raffensperger 1996). These techniques use voltage and current signals at both ends and thus require a complicated communication channel, which affects the reliability and cost of the protection schemes. A step distance scheme utilizing three phase relays as backup protection has been described in (Oppel et al. 1998). However, the scheme was able to detect only 83  % of the simulated faults cases. Also, for fault cases involving adjacent phases with fault impedance 20  Ω or greater, it’s response was not proper. The performance of a protection scheme developed for six phase test line has been analyzed in (Oppel and Krizauskas 1999). A non unit distance protection scheme for various fault conditions has been addressed by Redfern (1997). A microprocessor and wavelet based relaying approach for detection and classification of <b>shunt</b> <b>faults</b> have been reported in (Hajjar and Mansour 2006).

It offers a viable alternative for transmitting more power, without major modification in existing structure of three phase double circuit transmission system.

Real transmission system parameters of 400 kV Wardha - Aurangabad transmission line, India (400 km) with 40 % compensation at one end are implemented for this research. Percent absolute error is calculated for performance evaluation of the proposed method. Large numbers of test cases are generated which provide complete distance protection scheme giving quite accurate results with percent absolute errors mostly within 2. 75 % demonstrating more accuracy as compared to previous fuzzy based fault location schemes, least complexity and robustness of the proposed techniqu...|$|R
