5|$|This {{classification}} {{is important}} in geochemistry. Minerals such as olivine, (Mg,Fe)SiO4 are classed as ultramafic; olivine is a compound of a very basic oxide, MgO, with an acidic oxide, <b>silica,</b> <b>SiO2.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the <b>silica</b> (<b>SiO2)</b> of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E

50|$|Step-index {{optical fiber}} is {{generally}} made by doping high-purity fused <b>silica</b> glass (<b>SiO2)</b> with different concentrations of materials like titanium, germanium, or boron.|$|R
25|$|<b>Silica</b> (<b>SiO2)</b> is {{a common}} {{fundamental}} constituent of glass. In nature, vitrification of quartz occurs when lightning strikes sand, forming hollow, branching rootlike structures called fulgurites.|$|E
25|$|Fused quartz, {{also called}} fused-silica glass, vitreous-silica glass: <b>silica</b> (<b>SiO2)</b> in vitreous, or glass, form (i.e., its {{molecules}} are disordered and random, without crystalline structure). It has very low thermal expansion, is very hard, and resists high temperatures (1000–1500°C). It {{is also the}} most resistant against weathering (caused in other glasses by alkali ions leaching out of the glass, while staining it). Fused quartz is used for high-temperature applications such as furnace tubes, lighting tubes, melting crucibles, etc.|$|E
25|$|During its formation, the {{composition}} of the molten rock (magma) feeding the eruption changed from basaltic andesite to andesite and then back to basaltic andesite, but with a higher titanium content. Chemically, basaltic andesites are volcanic rocks containing 53 to 57% <b>silica</b> (<b>SiO2),</b> and andesites are those containing 57 to 63% silica. Though chemically distinct, the lava flows and scorias at Cinder Cone are similar in appearance. They are dark, fine-grained rocks, containing a few visible crystals of the minerals olivine, plagioclase, and quartz.|$|E
5000|$|Lechatelierite is <b>silica</b> glass, {{amorphous}} <b>SiO2,</b> non-crystalline mineraloid.|$|R
25|$|Tridymite and {{cristobalite}} are high-temperature polymorphs of SiO2 {{that occur}} in high-silica volcanic rocks. Coesite is a denser polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the Earth's crust. Stishovite is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites. Lechatelierite is an amorphous <b>silica</b> glass <b>SiO2</b> which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand.|$|R
50|$|Fire-protective {{glass is}} another {{application}} of nanotechnology. This {{is achieved by}} using a clear intumescent layer sandwiched between glass panels (an interlayer) formed of <b>silica</b> nanoparticles (<b>SiO2),</b> which turns into a rigid and opaque fire shield when heated. Most of glass in construction is on the exterior surface of buildings. So the light and heat entering the building through glass has to be prevented. The nanotechnology can provide a better solution to block light and heat coming through windows.|$|R
25|$|Thus {{there is}} reason to believe that ophiolites are indeed oceanic mantle and crust; however, certain {{problems}} arise when looking closer. Compositional differences regarding <b>silica</b> (<b>SiO2)</b> and titania (TiO2) contents, for example, place ophiolite basalts in the domain of subduction zones (~55% silica, <1% TiO2), whereas mid-ocean ridge basalts typically have ~50% silica and 1.5-2.5% TiO2. These chemical differences extend to a range of trace elements as well (that is, chemical elements occurring in amounts of 1000 ppm or less). In particular, trace elements associated with subduction zone (island arc) volcanics tend to be high in ophiolites, whereas trace elements that are high in ocean ridge basalts but low in subduction zone volcanics are also low in ophiolites.|$|E
25|$|If {{the desired}} glass {{property}} {{is not related}} to crystallization (e.g., liquidus temperature) or phase separation, linear regression can be applied using common polynomial functions up to the third degree. Below is an example equation of the second degree. The C-values are the glass component concentrations like Na2O or CaO in percent or other fractions, the b-values are coefficients, and n is the total number of glass components. The glass main component <b>silica</b> (<b>SiO2)</b> is excluded in the equation below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%. Many terms in the equation below can be neglected based on correlation and significance analysis. Systematic errors such as seen in the picture are quantified by dummy variables. Further details and examples are available in an online tutorial by Fluegel.|$|E
500|$|The {{basis of}} textile-grade glass fibers is <b>silica,</b> <b>SiO2.</b> [...] In its pure form it exists as a polymer, (SiO2)n. [...] It has no true melting point but softens up to 1200°C, where {{it starts to}} degrade. [...] At 1713°C, most of the {{molecules}} can move about freely. [...] If the glass is extruded and cooled quickly at this temperature, it {{will be unable to}} form an ordered structure. [...] In the polymer it forms SiO4 groups which are configured as a tetrahedron with the silicon atom at the center, and four oxygen atoms at the corners. These atoms then form a network bonded at the corners by sharing the oxygen atoms.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen darkening is a {{physical}} degradation of the optical properties of glass. Free hydrogen atoms are able to bind to the <b>SiO2</b> <b>silica</b> glass compound forming hydroxyl (OH) - a chemical compound that interferes {{with the passage of}} light through the glass.|$|R
50|$|Chemically, {{trachyte}} contains 60 to 65% <b>silica</b> content; less <b>SiO2</b> than rhyolite {{and more}} (Na2O plus K2O) than dacite. These chemical differences {{are consistent with}} the position of trachyte in the TAS classification, and they account for the feldspar-rich mineralogy of the rock type.|$|R
5000|$|The {{persistence}} of cristobalite outside of its thermodynamic stability range occurs because {{the transition from}} cristobalite to quartz or tridymite is [...] "reconstructive", requiring the breaking up and reforming of the silica framework. These frameworks are composed of SiO4 tetrahedra in which every oxygen atom is shared with a neighbouring tetrahedron, so that the chemical formula of <b>silica</b> is <b>SiO2.</b> The breaking of these bonds required to convert cristobalite to tridymite and quartz requires considerable activation energy and may not happen on a human time frame. Framework silicates are also known as tectosilicates.|$|R
2500|$|A former – {{to provide}} the network of atoms forming the matrix of the glass. [...] This is <b>Silica</b> (<b>SiO2),</b> which in ancient times was added as crushed quartz, and from Roman times onwards {{in the form of}} sand.|$|E

Poorly crystallized <b>silica</b> (<b>SiO2)</b> dissolves and dissociates at high pH (12.5 - 13.5) in alkaline water. The soluble dissociated silicic acid reacts in the porewater with the calcium hydroxide (portlandite) present in the cement paste to form an expansive calcium silicate hydrate (CSH). The alkali–silic{{a reaction}} (ASR) causes localised swelling responsible for tensile stress and cracking. The conditions required for alkali silica reaction are threefold: ...|$|E
2500|$|The APXS {{works by}} {{irradiating}} rocks and soil samples with alpha particles (helium nuclei, which consist of two protons and two neutrons). The {{results indicated that}} [...] "Barnacle Bill" [...] is much like Earth's andesites, confirming past volcanic activity. [...] The discovery of andesites shows that some Martian rocks have been remelted and reprocessed. [...] On Earth, Andesite forms when magma sits in pockets of rock {{while some of the}} iron and magnesium settle out. [...] Consequently, the final rock contains less iron and magnesiums and more silica. [...] Volcanic rocks are usually classified by comparing the relative amount of alkalis (Na2O and K2O) with the amount of <b>silica</b> (<b>SiO2).</b> [...] Andesite is different from the rocks found in meteorites that have come from Mars.|$|E
50|$|Silicon {{oxynitride}} is {{a ceramic}} material with the chemical formula SiOxNy. While in amorphous forms its composition can continuously vary between <b>SiO2</b> (<b>silica)</b> and Si3N4 (silicon nitride), {{the only known}} intermediate crystalline phase is Si2N2O. It is found in nature as the rare mineral sinoite in some meteorites and can be synthesized in the laboratory.|$|R
50|$|Note: Light {{scattering}} in {{an ideal}} defect-free crystalline (non-metallic) solid which provides no scattering centers for incoming lightwaves will be due primarily to any effects of anharmonicity within the ordered lattice. Lightwave transmission will be highly directional due to the typical anisotropy of crystalline substances, which includes their symmetry group and Bravais lattice. For example, the seven different crystalline forms of quartz <b>silica</b> (silicon dioxide, <b>SiO2)</b> are all clear, transparent materials.|$|R
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ <b>silica</b> as the <b>SiO2</b> is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|R
2500|$|A {{colloidal}} crystal is {{a highly}} ordered array of particles that can be formed over a very long range (typically {{on the order of}} a few millimeters to one centimeter) and that appear analogous to their atomic or molecular counterparts. One of the finest natural examples of this ordering phenomenon can be found in precious opal, in which brilliant regions of pure [...] color result from close-packed domains of amorphous colloidal spheres of silicon dioxide (or <b>silica,</b> <b>SiO2).</b> These spherical particles precipitate in highly siliceous pools in Australia and elsewhere, and form these highly ordered arrays after years of sedimentation and compression under hydrostatic and gravitational forces. The periodic arrays of submicrometre spherical particles provide similar arrays of interstitial , which act as a natural diffraction grating for visible light waves, particularly when the interstitial spacing is of the same order of magnitude as the incident lightwave.|$|E

2500|$|Inorganic {{synthetic}} {{methods can}} be classified roughly according to the volatility or solubility of the component reactants. [...] Soluble inorganic compounds are prepared using methods of organic synthesis. [...] For metal-containing compounds that are reactive toward air, Schlenk line and glove box techniques are followed. [...] Volatile compounds and gases are manipulated in “vacuum manifolds” consisting of glass piping interconnected through valves, the entirety {{of which can be}} evacuated to 0.001mm Hg or less. [...] Compounds are condensed using liquid nitrogen (b.p.78K) or other cryogens. [...] Solids are typically prepared using tube furnaces, the reactants and products being sealed in containers, often made of fused <b>silica</b> (amorphous <b>SiO2)</b> but sometimes more specialized materials such as welded Ta tubes or Pt “boats”. [...] Products and reactants are transported between temperature zones to drive reactions.|$|R
50|$|IMC is {{also being}} used in {{environmental}} toxicology. In an early study (Thorén 1992) toxicity against monolayers of alveolar macrophages of particles of MnO2, TiO2 and <b>SiO2</b> (<b>silica)</b> were evaluated. IMC results were in accord with results obtained by fluorescein ester staining and microscopic image analysis - except that IMC showed toxic effects of quartz not discernable by image analysis. This latter observation - in accord with known alveolar effects - indicated to the authors that IMC was a more sensitive technique.|$|R
50|$|Mozarkite {{consists}} essentially of <b>silica</b> (quartz - <b>SiO2)</b> {{with varying}} amounts of chalcedony. It has won distinction as a particular form or variety of chert {{because of its}} unique variation of colors {{and its ability to}} take a high polish. It has the hardness of 7-7.5 on the Mohs scale, which qualifies it as a suitable material for semi-precious gemstone, and has a density of about 2.65 g/cm3. Typically, the colors are different hues of red, pink, and purple with varying tints of green, gray and brown. It is collected and admired by lapidarists across the country.|$|R

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that nanoparticles can induce endothelial dysfunction. Here, the effect of monodisperse amorphous <b>silica</b> nanoparticles (<b>SiO(2)</b> -NPs) of different diameters on endothelial cells function is examined. Human endothelial cell line (EA. hy 926) or primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAEC) are seeded in inserts introduced or not above triple cell co-cultures (pneumocytes, macrophages, and mast cells). Endothelial cells are incubated with SiO(2) -NPs at non-cytotoxic concentrations for 12 h. A significant increase (up to 2 -fold) in human monocytes adhesion to endothelial cells is observed for 18 and 54 nm particles. Exposure to SiO(2) -NPs induces protein expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1) as well as significant up-regulation in mRNA expression of ICAM- 1 in both endothelial cell types. Experiments performed with fluorescent-labelled monodisperse amorphous SiO(2) -NPs of similar size evidence nanoparticle uptake into the cytoplasm of endothelial cells. It is concluded that exposure of human endothelial cells to amorphous silica nanoparticles enhances their adhesive properties.

5000|$|Fused quartz is a glass {{made from}} chemically-pure <b>SiO2</b> (<b>silica).</b> It has {{excellent}} resistance to thermal shock, {{being able to}} survive immersion in water while red hot. However, its high melting temperature (1723 °C) and viscosity {{make it difficult to}} work with. [...] Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, [...] "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium oxide, generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.|$|R
50|$|Another {{application}} of material science is {{the structures of}} ceramics and glass typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with <b>SiO2</b> (<b>silica</b> or sand) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning Gorilla Glass is a well-known example of the {{application of}} materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form {{are considered to be}} ceramics.|$|R
