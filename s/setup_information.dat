30|$|LRE qPCR, as {{reported}} by Rutledge and Stewart (2010), features the CAL 1 reaction for calibration, which consists of lambda bacteriophage genome as target and a high-performance primer pair (Tables  1, 2; Fig.  1). By contrast for SC qPCR the primer pair and target sequence under investigation are normally used as the standard curve (Pabinger et al. 2014). Quantification from a universal reference standard such as CAL 1 could introduce far greater reproducibility of absolute qPCR data across facilities and could in future be coupled to absolute of fluorescence meaurement standards (Würth et al. 2013) for even greater accuracy and reproducibility in sequence-specific DNA quantitation. As such we the suggest adoption of CAL 1 reaction as a qPCR standard represents an excellent opportunity to improve standardisation within the synthetic biology and biotechnology communities. Standardisation between qPCR assays currently extends only to experimental <b>setups,</b> <b>information</b> reporting, such as the MIQE guidelines, and testing {{of food and water}} sources for contaminants.|$|R

Then we evaluated the display of information in the periphery on both WSD setups in a user study.

40|$|When a drop impinges on a {{dry solid}} surface it can {{stick to the}} surface, spread, bounce off the surface or splash. It is shown that {{critical}} conditions of splashing inception, the so-called splashing threshold, have often been obtained under slightly different experimental conditions and are partly contradictory. Furthermore, no general agreement on the basic physical mechanism causing splashing does exist. After considering those parameters {{that are likely to}} govern splashing in a dimensional analysis, limiting conditions of splashing are re-evaluated comparing the specifics of different experimental <b>setups.</b> <b>Information</b> drawn from these considerations is used to distinguish between different splashing thresholds. Existing correlations of the threshold can be divided into (at least) two groups. In addition to the roughness also the degree of dryness of the surface may be important. Finally, for smooth surfaces there is evidence that the wetting behaviour plays an important role for the inception of splashing. Based on the discussion a possible mechanism causing the onset of splashing on smooth surfaces is proposed. This mechanism may also explain the well-known fingering of the liquid lamella formed after impact...|$|R
