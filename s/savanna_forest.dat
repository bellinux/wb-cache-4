40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} assess vegetal cover {{evolution}} on a river island within the Ecological Station of (EEP), by remote sensing. For this purpose, Normalized Difference Vegetation Indexes were generated for Landsat 1 (1973) and Landsat 5 (1984, 1990, 2000 and 2011) images. Five landscape units {{were identified in}} the field: bare soil, Rough <b>savanna,</b> Typical <b>savanna,</b> <b>Forested</b> <b>savanna</b> and Evergreen dry woods. Only <b>Forested</b> <b>savanna</b> and Evergreen dry woods showed poor spectral splitting, being thus considered as a forestry complex. Changes throughout time have occurred in all units, with decreasing in bare soil areas (- 2. 56 ha year&# 8722; 1), Rough savanna (- 0. 66 ha year&# 8722; 1) and Typical savanna (- 0. 94 ha year&# 8722; 1) and {{with an increase in}} the <b>Forested</b> <b>savanna</b> (5. 97 ha year&# 8722; 1).

50|$|This shrub {{grows in}} coastal plain habitat among pines such as loblolly, slash, and shortleaf pines, and oak species. It occurs in several habitat types {{including}} <b>savanna,</b> <b>forest,</b> bog, and pocosin. The climate is mild {{in the winter}} and hot and humid in the summer. It is not tolerant of shade and is usually found in full sunlight. It can be found growing with swamp blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora), loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus), sweetbay (Persea borbonia), red maple (Acer rubrum), titi (Cyrilla racemiflora), southern white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), hurrahbush (Lyonia lucida), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), and laurelleaf greenbrier (Smilax laurifolia).|$|E
50|$|They are {{widespread}} {{residents of}} woodland, mesic <b>savanna,</b> <b>forest</b> edge and suburban gardens. They occur only sparsely in dry savanna or low dry regions, where they keep to riparian woods or concentrations of nectar-bearing plants, and are decidedly scarce in the Limpopo valley and mopane regions. A distinct summer influx is notable in the Zambezi valley and Great Zimbabwe woodlands, {{and they are}} strictly summer visitors (September/October to April) to the Kalahari sand (or Gusu) woodlands, where they appear in high densities when the Baikiaea trees are in flower. On seaward-facing slopes, they are very common residents up to 1,800 metres, with high reporting rates in afromontane forest and valley bushveld.|$|E

50|$|Any {{remaining}} pine habitat {{occurs in}} isolated blocks {{and is often}} degraded {{by the lack of}} periodic wildfires. The suppression of natural fire events may represent the greatest threat to the Louisiana pine snake in recent years, decreasing both {{the quantity and quality of}} habitat available to pine snakes. The Longleaf Pine <b>savanna</b> <b>forest</b> evolved as a fire climax community, adapted to the occurrence of frequent, but low-intensity, ground fires. These natural fire events on sandy, well-drained soils typically maintained an overstory dominated by Longleaf Pine, with minimal midstory cover but a well-developed understory of native bunch grasses and herbaceous plants. These park-like forests supported ideal habitat for pocket gophers and, subsequently, pine snakes.|$|E
5000|$|As of 1996, {{the entire}} area of the reserve is found within the {{catchment}} area of the Mambili River, which drains the area towards the south. The region is quite varied due to the juxtaposition of several habitat types, including <b>savanna,</b> <b>forest</b> and rivers. The site is astride the savanna-forest boundary of North-Central Congo, allowing for a high biodiversity of flora and fauna, with species from forest, savanna and riverine forest. The area is densely forested in the northwest; towards {{the south and east}} the forest becomes more open with an understorey of Marantaceae carpeting the ground. In the south of the region an extensive forest-savanna mosaic is found, including gallery forests and dry and swamp savanna.|$|E

5000|$|The {{player can}} enter a [...] "World Championship" [...] mode {{consisting}} of three stages: Desert (which resembles African <b>savanna),</b> <b>Forest</b> (which resembles South American forests) and Mountain (which {{is based on}} a shortened Circuit de Monaco), where their finishing position {{at the end of one}} course is carried through to the starting position of the next course. In this mode, it is impossible to reach first-place position by the end of the first track; thus, the player must try to overtake as many opponent cars as possible on each track (while staying within the time limit), and gain the lead over several tracks. If, at the end of the third round, the player is in first place, they are able to play a fourth secret circuit called [...] "Lakeside" [...] (on the Saturn version, this course may then be played in time attack and split-screen multiplayer modes).|$|E
5000|$|Other {{than these}} rare cases, larger {{birds of prey}} such eagles are not usually harassed by Verreaux's eagle-owl and are more aptly viewed as competitors. In fact, the martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), in most regards the largest eagle in Africa, is {{sometimes}} regarded as the diurnal ecological equivalent of the Verreaux's eagle-owl. The martial eagle has rather similar habitat preferences to the eagle-owl and has a similarly broad, opportunistic diet. At roughly 4200 g in average body mass, the martial eagle is roughly twice as heavy so Verreaux's eagle-owl and takes correspondingly large prey, its average prey weight range being 1000 to 5000 g and the eagles are capable of exceptionally taking prey up to nearly nine times their own weight, whereas quantitatively most of the eagle-owls prey does not exceed 1000 to 1500 g. Verreaux's eagle-owl are likely to give martial eagles a respectful amount of space during daytime {{and there are no}} records of the two species harassing one another. Another particularly large and aggressive eagle, the crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), is largely a forest-dweller and so is less directly a diurnal equivalent. There a single recorded instance of an immature crowned eagle being aggressively displaced at night by an adult Verreaux's eagle-owl when it happen to encroach on the eagle-owl's territory but without bloodshed and eagle-owls would do well to avoid the exceptionally powerful eagle. Taken together, the Verreaux's, the Shelley's and the cape eagle-owls could be seen as nocturnally replacing the eagle species of martial, crowned and Verreaux's eagles in the respective habitats of <b>savanna,</b> <b>forest</b> and rocky areas but their increasingly diminishing size in comparison to the diurnal eagles means that, generally speaking, less large-bodied prey is likely to be attacked. [...] Despite its place {{near the top of the}} nocturnal avian food chain, in 2013 a remote wildlife camera videotaped a black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) attacking and killing a Verreaux's eagle owl at a watering hole. Similar rare successful attacks on great horned owls and Eurasian eagle-owls by smaller red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have been reported but in these cases the owls were mysteriously grounded in the horned owl and distracted by nesting into too-easily accessed sea cliffs in the eagle-owl. More often foxes are prey rather than predators for northern Bubo owls. Given that the Verreaux's eagle-owl is surprisingly bold about coming to their ground to, among other things capture beetles, feed on prey too large to carry in flight or, as is likely the case in the jackal attack, drink water, it is possible that the jackal was simply able to ambush an incautious eagle-owl rather than a grounded one.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTFire {{can change}} the species composition, diversity, and {{structure}} of savanna vegetation, thus altering growth and mortality rates. Such changes in the woody vegetation of burned <b>savanna</b> <b>forest</b> were evaluated over four years in comparison to unburned <b>savanna</b> <b>forest.</b> All woody plants with a diameter at breast height > 10 cm were measured in 100 permanent plots. Six months later, 38 of these plots were burned. Three {{and a half years}} later, all surviving individuals were re-sampled. Species richness, diversity, and the number of individuals did not change in the burned plots, although they had significantly higher (p < 0. 05) increases in basal area and mortality rates (5. 1 % year- 1) than the unburned plots (3. 0 % year- 1). Tachigali vulgarishad the greatest post-fire increase in basal area (53 %). The results indicate that fire alters the dynamics and structure of the <b>savanna</b> <b>forest,</b> excluding the less fire-tolerant species and smaller individuals (? 15 cm). Tachigali vulgaris is a key species for the recovery of <b>savanna</b> <b>forest</b> biomass due to its considerable post-fire gains in basal area, at least over the short term due to its short life cycle. It follows that frequent burning of <b>savanna</b> <b>forest</b> would result in a marked change in the species composition and structure of its woody vegetation...|$|E
