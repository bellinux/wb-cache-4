In the basic LocVSDP protocol, the service reply contains information about the closest <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> {{to the center of}} the RI. Since in our simulation scenario we assume that all the service requests specify the same RI, the closest <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> 116 located closer {{to the center of the}} RI than the other <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> handled 97 % of the total requests and 3 % of the total requests were dropped. However, in the QoSLocVSDP, service replies contain information about the closest less loaded <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> to the center of the RI.
