50|$|<b>Single</b> <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} cylinders are {{the simplest}} and most common design. As with a <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> rod style cylinder, the <b>single</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinder is extended using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure but retracts using external forces when the fluid medium is removed and relieved to the reservoir. This external retraction force is usually gravity acting on {{the weight of the}} load. This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work portion of the machine cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|R

50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke.

Directional control valves required for the easy operation of double acting cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Single</b> <b>acting</b> {{cylinders}} are economical and {{the simplest}} design. Hydraulic fluid enters through a port {{at one end}} of the cylinder, which extends the rod by means of area difference. An external force, internal retraction spring or gravity returns the piston rod.|$|R
