40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether {{improvement in the}} care of victims of major trauma could be made by using the revised trauma score as a triage tool to help junior accident and emergency doctors rapidly identify <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients</b> and thereby call a senior accident and emergency specialist to supervise their resuscitation. DESIGN [...] Comparison of results of audit of management of all <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients</b> before and after these measures were introduced. SETTING [...] Accident and emergency department in an urban hospital. PATIENTS [...] All <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients</b> (injury severity score greater than 15) admitted to the department six months before and one year after introduction of the measures. RESULTS [...] Management errors were reduced from 58 % (21 / 36) to 30 % (16 / 54) (p less than 0. 01). Correct treatment rather than improvement in diagnosis or investigation accounted for almost all the improvement. CONCLUSIONS [...] The management of <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients</b> in the accident and emergency department can be improved by introducing two simple measures: using the revised trauma score as a triage tool to help junior doctors in the accident and emergency department rapidly identify <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients,</b> and calling a senior accident and emergency specialist to supervise the resuscitation of all <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients.</b> IMPLICATIONS [...] Care of patients in accident and emergency departments can be improved considerably at no additional expense by introducing two simple measures...|$|R

In this article, the author explores some of their main arguments regarding consent and rationality (particularly in relation to religious beliefs), as well as Erbay et al's normative claim that HCPs have an obligation to promote autonomy by helping patients to come to a ‘rational’ decision. Ultimately, the author agrees that the (temporary) solution to the dilemma presented in this scenario (which was to insert an intravenous cannula into the patient in order to allow an infusion of fluids in the event that he changed his mind) seemed both pragmatic and ethically permissible.

40|$|The {{transport}} of the <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patient</b> {{is associated with}} risk and requires particular expertise and attention. The aim of this review {{is to provide a}} historical overview of transport services available to trauma patients in the UK, describe the various transport platforms that are used, identify risks from a system and disease perspective and how they may be mitigated, and make international comparisons. The transfer of patients requiring medical attention has developed over the years and now includes complex undertakings that undoubtedly confer a degree of risk on the patient. A number of different transport platforms are in regular use in the UK, and a number of different health-care professions of varying training, experience, and seniority undertake these transfers. The general principles are to provide noworse care en route than has been provided at the departure destination and to transport patients to a destination capable of delivering whichever intervention the patient is deemed to require. When deciding to transport an injured patient, there are risks, and appropriate mitigationmust be in place, particularly if primary transfer to amajor trauma centre involves bypassing a nearer facility. It is clear that those clinicianswho undertake medical transfers must be appropriately trained and must have access to local or national guidelines. Medical transfersmust be the subject of ongoing research, both to ensure that best practice is in place and to continue to understand the safest way of achieving essential transfers effectively.

The Early Management of Severe Trauma (EMST) course fulfils their educational needs by providing skills for the systematic management of the <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patient.</b> However, with any skill there is a natural loss over time. This study surveyed GPs who have completed the EMST course to determine their confidence in trauma management. METHODS: A two-page survey was mailed in December 2004 to all GPs who had completed an EMST course from 1989 to 2004 and were currently residing in Western Australia. The survey consisted of background questions, open-ended questions regarding the EMST course and skills confidence ratings using visual analogue scales. The final sample size was 223. RESULTS: Response rate was 55 %. GPs were least confident in carrying out diagnostic peritoneal lavage and cricothyroidotomy. They were most confident inserting i. v. cannulas and managing fluid replacement. Their confidence in some of these skills were related to the frequency of managing trauma patients but not to the interval since completing the EMST course. GPs found the systematic approach to trauma management and practical/procedural skills as the most relevant components of EMST. They felt that EMST could be improved with more accessible refresher courses and more practical/procedural skills. CONCLUSION: Most of these GPs were involved in rural hospital work where they may be required to manage seriously injured patients. They require regular refresher courses to maintain their confidence levels in treating seriously injured patients...|$|E

Nationally representative data were collected from 171, 366 rural and urban households, comprising a total of 819, 429 population. Face-to-face interview was chosen as a data collection method. The overall rate of electrical injury was 73. 7 per 100, 000 population-year. The rate of permanent disability due to electrical injury in Bangladesh was 0. 366 per 100, 000 population-year. Among the total 604 non-fatal electrical injuries in the survey, 282 (46. 7 %) had suffered from temporary disabilities for different durations. A total of 172 students were injured from electrical injury and among them 139 (80. 8 %) missed school for different durations due to their illness. Mean duration of absence from school was 9. 72 days (SD 10. 98), ranging from 1 to 45 days.

DESIGN [...] Prospective audit of all cases of trauma in patients admitted to a hospital from an accident and emergency department. SETTING [...] Accident and emergency department in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS [...] 1577 Patients admitted with trauma, of whom 695 met the inclusion criteria for the study [...] that is, were admitted {{for more than three}} days, or admitted to intensive care, or died. 17 Patients were excluded because of failure to trace their notes. OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Review of case notes with TRISS (trauma score, injury severity score) methodology to compare expected and observed survival. RESULTS [...] Most (421 / 678) admissions were due to single orthopaedic injury. Serious injury was uncommon with only 43 patients having injury severity scores greater than 15. The calculated probability of survival matched the observed outcome for most of the <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients,</b> with only two unexpected deaths. However, 36 of the 61 deaths in the 678 patients occurred in elderly patients with a fractured neck of the femur, and all of these patients had a high probability of survival predicted by TRISS methodology.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{measure the}} {{effectiveness}} of management of major trauma in the United Kingdom. DESIGN [...] Review of the care of all <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients</b> seen over two years. SETTING [...] 33 hospitals which receive patients who have sustained major trauma. SUBJECTS [...] 14, 648 <b>injured</b> <b>patients</b> admitted {{for more than three}} days, transferred or admitted into an intensive care bed, or dying from their injuries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Death or survival in hospital within three months of the injury. RESULTS [...] 21 % of <b>seriously</b> <b>injured</b> <b>patients</b> (1299) took longer than one hour to reach hospital. Time before arrival at hospital was not related to severity of injury. A senior house officer was in charge of initial hospital resuscitation in 57 % (826 / 1445) of patients with an injury severity score > or = 16. More senior staff were commonly responsible for definitive operations, but only 46 % (165 / 355) of patients judged to require early operation arrived in theatre within two hours. Mortality for 6111 patients sustaining blunt trauma and treated in the 14 busiest hospitals was significantly higher (actual 408, predicted 295. 6, p < 0. 001) than in a comparable North American dataset. Large differences in the 14 hospitals assessed could not be explained by variations in case load or facilities. In contrast, the outcome of the 4. 1 % (597) of patients with penetrating injuries was better than that of a comparable group in the United States.

The data supporting this widely accepted approach are remarkably weak. Conversely, Schochl and colleagues, in an innovative, retrospective study, describe the use of fibrinogen concentrate, plasma complex concentrate, RBCs, FFP, and platelets driven by a thromboelastometry-based algorithm. Finally, it appears that transfusion therapy is becoming driven by physiology.
