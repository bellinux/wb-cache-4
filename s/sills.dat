5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle {{onto the surface of}} the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and <b>sills,</b> push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} done to a product {{development}} unit of a Finnish elevator technology com-pany and it was focused {{on one of the}} components of the whole elevator, the door <b>sill</b> as-sembly. The study had two goals, the main goal was to introduce and to further develop a test system created for testing door <b>sill</b> assemblies, and the secondary goal was to create a technical documentation about the door <b>sill</b> assembly for training purpose. The main issue with the <b>sill</b> assembly {{is that one of the}} main components of the whole as-sembly, the <b>sill</b> profile, does not have duty ranges. The <b>sill</b> profile is the visual part of the whole <b>sill</b> assembly and it guides the movement of elevator doors. Always when something is introduced to the elevator car, it goes over the <b>sill</b> profiles. There are different kinds of <b>sill</b> profiles available for different kind of use, but at the moment the main issue is that it is not known how much wear each profile can take. This often leads to a situation where wrong kinds of <b>sill</b> profiles are delivered with the elevator. A typical example is that too weak <b>sill</b> profiles are delivered with an elevator expecting heavy use, and eventually the <b>sill</b> profiles breaks down.

40|$|A non-hydrostatic {{model in}} {{cross-sectional}} form with an idealized <b>sill</b> {{is used to}} examine the influence of <b>sill</b> depth (h s) and aspect ratio upon internal motion. The model is forced with a barotropic tide and internal waves and mixing occurs at the <b>sill.</b> Calculations using a wide <b>sill</b> and quantifying the response using power spectra show that for a given tidal forcing namely Froude number F r as the <b>sill</b> depth (h s) increases the lee wave response and vertical mixing decrease. This is because of a reduction in across <b>sill</b> velocity U s due to increased depth. Calculations show that the <b>sill</b> Froude number F s based on <b>sill</b> depth and across <b>sill</b> velocity is one parameter that controls the response at the <b>sill.</b> At low F s (namely F s[*]≪[*] 1) in the wide <b>sill</b> case, there is little lee wave production, and the response is in terms of internal tides. At high F s, calculations with a narrow <b>sill</b> show that for a given F s value, the lee wave response and internal mixing increase with increasing aspect ratio. Calculations using a narrow <b>sill</b> with constant U s show that for small values of h s, a near surface mixed layer can occur on the downstream side of the <b>sill.</b> For large values of h s, a thick well-mixed bottom boundary layer occurs due to turbulence produced by the lee waves at the seabed.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. The house itself has three storeys constructed of red brick. The ground floor level has a rubbed brick band at nine courses, and another rubbed brick band exists on the second floor, along with a moulded stone cornice level with the <b>sills.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bricks {{from which}} the house was built were fired in the {{immediate}} vicinity (along the banks of the South Branch Potomac River), and the brick walls were reinforced with hand-wrought structural iron angles. The nails used in its construction were fabricated by a local blacksmith, and the wooden <b>sills</b> and joists were sawn by hand. As of 2012, all the original windows, trim and building materials in the main section of the house were still present.|$|E
5|$|The front façade of {{the house}} faces a hill to the southwest. It is five bays wide, with the front {{entrance}} at the first floor's center bay. Wide double-hung sash windows are uniformly placed on the house's front façade, with four nine-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the first story and five six-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the second. Each window is surrounded by green-painted wooden shutters and white-painted wooden lintels and <b>sills.</b>|$|E

5|$|The most {{apparent}} lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and <b>sills,</b> are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water's surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.|$|E
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase <b>sills</b> and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} <b>sills</b> of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E

These waves propagate toward the <b>sill</b> when the tide reverses leading to enhanced mixing in the <b>sill</b> region. The addition of small scale topography on the leeside of the <b>sill</b> changes the lee wave distribution with an associated increase in mixing depending upon wavelength and amplitude of topography.

5|$|Most of the {{interior}} of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial magmatic activity around 58 million years ago in the Paleogene period. This comprises an outer ring of coarse granite and an inner core of finer grained granite, which was intruded later. This granite was intruded into the Late Proterozoic to Cambrian metasediments of the Dalradian Supergroup. Other Paleogene igneous rocks on Arran include extensive felsic and composite <b>sills</b> in the south of the island, and the central ring complex, an eroded caldera system surrounded by a near-continuous ring of granitic rocks.|$|E

40|$|A {{free surface}} non-hydrostatic model in {{cross-sectional}} form namely two dimensional in the vertical {{is used to}} examine the role of larger scale topography, namely <b>sill</b> width and smaller scale topography namely ripples on the <b>sill</b> upon internal wave generation and mixing in <b>sill</b> regions. The present work is set in the context of earlier work, and the wider literature in order to emphasis the problems of simulating mixing in hydrographic models. Highlights from previous calculations, and references to the literature for detail together with new results presented here with smooth and “ripple” topography are used to show that an idealised cross sectional model can reproduce the dominant features found in observations at the Loch Etive <b>sill.</b> Calculations show that on both the short and long time scales the presence of small scale “ripple” topography influence the mixing and associated Richardson number distribution in the <b>sill</b> region. Subsequent calculations in which the position and form of the small scale <b>sill</b> topography is varied, show {{for the first time that}} it is the small scale topography near the <b>sill</b> crest that is particularly important in enhancing mid-water mixing on the lee side of the <b>sill.</b> Both short term and longer term calculations with a reduced <b>sill</b> width, and associated time series, show that as the <b>sill</b> width is reduced the non-linear response of the system increases. In addition Richardson number plots show that the region of critical Richardson number, and hence enhanced mixing increases with time and a reduction in <b>sill</b> width. Calculations in which buoyancy frequency N varies through the vertical show that buoyancy frequency close to the top of the <b>sill</b> is primarily controlling mixing rather than its mean value. Hence a Froude number based on <b>sill</b> depth and local N is the critical parameter, rather than one based on total depth and mean N. ...|$|R
