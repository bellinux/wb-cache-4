5|$|All Saints' Church, Shuart , in the north-west of the Isle of Thanet, Kent, in the {{south-east}} of England, {{was established}} in the Anglo-Saxon period as a chapel of ease for the parish of St Mary's Church, Reculver, which was centred on the north-eastern corner of mainland Kent, adjacent to the island. The Isle of Thanet was then separated from the mainland by the sea, which formed a strait known as the Wantsum Channel. The last church on the site was demolished by the early 17th century, and there is nothing remaining above ground to show that a church once <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bede relates {{that the}} East Anglian apostle Saint Felix came to England from Burgundy as a missionary bishop {{and was sent}} by Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, to assist in {{establishing}} Christianity in Sigeberht's kingdom. William of Malmesbury had the later story that Felix accompanied Sigeberht to East Anglia. In either case, this dates Sigeberht's accession to around 629–630, because Felix was bishop for seventeen years, his successor Thomas for five and Thomas' successor Berhtgisl Boniface for seventeen– and Berhtgisl died in around 669. Sigeberht established the bishop's seat of his kingdom for Felix at Dommoc, claimed variously for Dunwich or Walton, Felixstowe (both coastal sites in Suffolk). If the seat was at Walton (as Rochester claimed during the 13th century), the site of Dommoc may have been within the precinct of a Roman fort which formerly <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} {{was called for}} 17 September 1878. Fearful that Macdonald would be defeated in Kingston, his supporters {{tried to get him}} to run in the safe Conservative riding of Cardwell; having represented his hometown for 35years, he <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> again. In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by Alexander Gunn, but the Conservatives swept to victory. Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for Marquette, Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of Victoria, where the {{election was}} to be held on 21 October. Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria, although he had never visited either Marquette or Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The priory {{may also}} have owned a cell at Scarth Wood at Whorlton. A grant issued by Stephen de Meynell in the reign of Henry I records the {{donation}} of the hamlet of Scarth to enable the priory to establish a cell for habitation by a single monk or canon. It is unclear whether the cell was built as Scarth is {{not mentioned in the}} priory's deeds or in Henry VIII's commissioners' valuation of its property. Fragmentary building remains at Scarth are recorded as existing in the mid-18th century. They were cleared by the start of the 19th century so there is no trace of whatever might once have <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> or indication of what it might have been used for.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Harrison died in 1791. William Henry {{dropped the}} study of {{medicine}} and used Benjamin's connections with the Founding Fathers to get a commission in the Army. The seat {{of the federal government}} was then in Philadelphia, and President Washington granted him a commission. Harrison served under Mad Anthony Wayne, fighting against Native Americans in what is now western Ohio. He was promoted to captain and made commander of Fort Washington before returning to civilian life in 1798, disliking garrison duty. He was already seeking another position through his government connections, and the same year was appointed by President John Adams as secretary of the Northwest Territory. The following year, the territorial legislature narrowly elected him the territory's delegate to Congress. In 1800, the Indiana Territory was separated from the Northwest, and Harrison was made territorial governor by President Adams, a position he would hold for over a decade. Prior to taking office, he bought a large tract of land from his father-in-law, along the Ohio River at North Bend. When Harrison purchased it, there was a log cabin on the property, but by 1840 the structure had been absorbed into the mansion that <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} Vajpayee's {{moderate}} strategy {{led to a}} shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism. In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign {{for the construction of a}} temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya. The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527. There is a dispute about whether a temple once <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b> The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple had been demolished to construct the mosque. The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V. P. Singh.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} the {{building}} consist of holes and trenches for {{the placement of the}} pillars and walls that once <b>stood</b> <b>there.</b> Various floor levels were discernible, and it was possible to determine that the hof was initially erected in the 3rd century C.E. on the site of an unusually large longhouse, and then rebuilt six times without appreciable changes, the last version of the building dating to the early Viking Age. The building material was in all cases wood, which was also sunk into the ground.|$|E

On October 20, 920 Acadians from Piziquid were loaded on to four transports. Unlike the neighbouring community of Grand Pré, the buildings at Pisiquid were not destroyed by fire.

The family lost possession through a series of land sales and mortgage repossessions over a period of about a hundred years from the early 19thcentury. The agents of William Middelton (1815–1885) were responsible for the design of the new town of Ilkley to replace the village which had <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> before.|$|E

25|$|A temple (aedes) of Juno Lucina {{was built}} in 375 BC in the grove sacred to the goddess from early times.

The grove should have extended down the slope south of the temple. As Servius Tullius ordered the gifts for the newborn to be placed in the treasury of the temple though it looks that another shrine <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> before 375 BC. In 190 BC the temple was struck by lightning, its gable and doors injured. The annual festival of the Matronalia was celebrated here on March 1, day of the dedication of the temple.|$|E
