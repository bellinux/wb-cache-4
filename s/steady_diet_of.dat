25|$|For Fugazi's second studio-album <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> <b>of</b> Nothing, {{released}} in July 1991, the band once again asked Ted Niceley to produce. Niceley {{had become a}} chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves. After the success of Repeater and its subsequent world tour, Steady Diet was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release Dischord had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.|$|E
500|$|Ian Webster of Terrorizer {{wrote that}} [...] "First Blood" [...] is ultra-Exodus and goes {{head to head}} with the Slayer attack of [...] "Schizophrenia" [...] and [...] "Armoured Assault"", and hailed the album as [...] "the best UK thrash debut since Sabbat's History of a Time to Come", {{awarding}} nine out of ten stars. Giving Enter the Grave four out of five stars, Kerrang!s James Hoare commented that the album was [...] "honed on a <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> early Slayer, Sacred Reich and Nuclear Assault", summarizing the full-length as [...] "an absolute hair-swirling, air-punching beast". Terrorizer dubbed Enter the Grave the nineteenth best album of 2007, whereas Classic Rock rated the full-length the thirty-eighth best album of 2007.|$|E
500|$|Carnivàle {{was often}} {{compared}} to David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks and John Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath. Matt Roush of TV Guide called Carnivàle [...] "the perfect show {{for those who}} thought Twin Peaks was too accessible", whereas the show reminded Salon.com's Heather Havrilesky of the [...] "disappointment you feel as a kid {{when you come to}} the last few pages of The Grapes of Wrath." [...] She argued that a [...] "surreal Twin Peaks-style shockfest [...] hardly bears repeating," [...] especially if it [...] "avoid the 'hugging and learning' of mainstream television [...] such a <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> anguish and dashed hopes that viewers refuse to take the risk of making an emotional connection." [...] Carnivàle, as The Australian stated, [...] "seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms" [...] which [...] "can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television." [...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] can be a problem for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] {{the fact that it is}} so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E

50|$|Lately {{there has}} been quite a revival of {{interest}} in this now defunct track, thanks to the ongoing Dover Drag Strip Nostalgia reunion every year at Lebanon Valley Dragway.

2500|$|In February 2007, {{an article}} in The Harvard Crimson {{newspaper}} reported that {{a few of the}} professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.

2500|$|The {{sound of}} the album drew {{complimentary}} comparisons to Tool and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, being praised for its subtlety and gradual evolution of structure. However, some critical responses to the similarity with Tool were not so positive, with Joe Davenport arguing that [...] "In the Absence of Truth plays out like some mediocre hybrid of Tool and Panopticon". Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork Media posits that [...] "the set's so finely wound that on the first few listens {{it seemed like the}} <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> Tool had perhaps transformed Isis into an emaciated, innocuous version of their older selves". However, he continues to suggest that the album [...] "just require close (and repeated) listening to initiate an unravelling". Tracks selected as stand-outs include [...] "Not in Rivers, but in Drops", [...] "Garden of Light", and [...] "Dulcinea", specifically praising the climax of the piece. [...] "Holy Tears" [...] is labeled as revealing the [...] "true, outward strength of Isis",| publisher = Prefix Magazine| date=21 February 2007|accessdate =5 August 2007}} and is selected as [...] "a beacon of light in the darkness" [...] in a generally scathing Delusions of Adequacy review.|$|E
6000|$|Quite {{like other}} boys Lowell was {{subjected}} to the processes of the more formal education of books. He was first sent to a [...] "dame school," [...] {{and then to the}} private school of William Wells, under whose rigid tuition he became thoroughly grounded in the classics. Among his schoolfellows was W.W. Story, the poet-sculptor, who continued his life-long friend. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, {{who was one of the}} younger boys of the school, recalls the high talk of Story and Lowell about the Fairie Queen. At fifteen he entered Harvard College, then an institution with about two hundred students. The course of study in those days was narrow and dull, a pretty <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> Greek, Latin and Mathematics, with an occasional dessert of Paley's Evidences of Christianity or Butler's Analogy. Lowell was not distinguished for scholarship, but he read omnivorously and wrote copiously, often in smooth flowing verse, fashioned after the accepted English models of the period. He was an editor of Harvardiana, the college magazine, and was elected class poet in his senior year. But his habit of lounging with the poets in the secluded alcoves of the old library, in preference to attending recitations, finally became too scandalous for official forbearance, and he was rusticated, [...] "on account of constant neglect of his college duties," [...] as the faculty records state. He was sent to Concord, where his exile was not without mitigating profit, as he became acquainted with Emerson and Thoreau. Here he wrote the class poem, which he was permitted to circulate in print at his Commencement. This production, which now stands at the head of the list of his published works, was curiously unprophetic of his later tendencies. It was written in the neatly, polished couplets of the Pope type and other imitative metres, and aimed to satirize the radical movements of the period, especially the transcendentalists and abolitionists, with both of whom he was soon to be in active sympathy.|$|E
5000|$|The lyrical content <b>of</b> <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> is more overtly {{political}} {{than any}} other record Fugazi has released. This is most evident on [...] "Dear Justice Letter" [...] which was inspired by Supreme Court liberal stalwart William J. Brennan, who had recently retired. While obviously emotional, {{the language of the}} [...] "letter" [...] is more than a little obscure. Brennan's politics and defense of individual rights were largely quite in tune with Fugazi's so [...] "Dear...", on one level, can be read as a rant against abandonment of duty to the liberal block of the Supreme Court. [...] "Here comes the kiss off.." ...|$|R

The <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> both species was dominated by crustaceans, in particular euphausiids (mainly Euphausia superba and some Thysanoessa), which contributed 47 – 76 % of the biomass of crustaceans in the <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> P. georgicus, and copepods, which contributed 71 % of the biomass of crustaceans in the <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> P. urinatrix. Calanoides acutus was the most numerous copepod in the <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> both species; however, Rhincalanus gigas was more common in P. urinatrix than in P. georgicus. The dominant amphipod in the <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> P. georgicus, Primno macropa, was absent from the <b>diet</b> <b>of</b> Pelecanoides urinatrix, in which Themisto gaudichaudii (rare in Pelecanoides georgicus) dominated. Dietary differences were maintained in the period (2 weeks {{of a total of}} 10 weeks) when both species were simultaneously rearing chicks. Knowledge of the prey species and of the diving abilities and foraging habits of diving petrels suggests that at South Georgia Pelecanoides urinatrix feeds closer inshore and dives deeper than Pelecarnoides georgicus...|$|R
