However, the European Commission highlighted that Europe's current legal framework cannot effectively prevent network operators from degrading their customers' services. Therefore, the European Commission proposed that it should be empowered to impose a minimum quality of services requirements. In addition, an obligation of transparency was proposed to limit network operators' ability to set up restrictions on end-users' choice of lawful content and applications.|$|E

While Mexican prelates and others in Mexico failed to cooperate with Christ's grace, these graces were at the same time being extended to many others worldwide. There appear to be striking similarities in the founding of Opus Dei during the Spanish Civil War by Saint Josemaría Escrivá (1928); in the establishment of the Missionaries of Charity by Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta (1946-1950), the founding of the Poor Clare Monastery of the Angels by Mother Angelica (1962) and Eternal Word Television Network (1981); in the establishment of the Order of Saint Benedict Daughters of Mary, Mother of Israel's Hope, Handmaids of the Family, by Mother Miriam of Immaculate Heart Radio and Catholic Answers; the establishment in Vladivostok, Russia in 1991 of the Canons Regular of Jesus the Lord [...] followed in 2011 by the establishment of the CJD Canonissae in Jesu Domino or Sisters in Jesus the Lord, and in the call of Pope John Paul II for religious orders to renew their communities which inspired the founding of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal by Fr Benedict Groeschel, C.F.R. and seven (7) Order of Friars Minor Capuchin colleagues (1987); in the work of renewing Religious Life after Vatican II among the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia aka [...] "the Nashville Dominicans", which led to new Religious foundations, including the Sisters of Life (1991) and the Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist (1996-1997) established by Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor; and many other extraordinary Works of Atonement worldwide including the United States pro-life movement, which began in the USA between 1967 and 1970, and other manifestations of the Works of Atonement in Rwanda, Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, Russia, Korea, Eastern Europe and in many other countries.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Communication Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010 Magazine {{readers in}} South Africa {{have a wide}} choice: {{there are more than}} 188 {{consumer}} magazines on the shelf and this gives readers the opportunity to choose what they like. However, there are very few Afrikaans Christian magazines and they have to compete commercially with the other publications. The question that arises is how these magazines manage to maintain a Christian character {{while at the same time}} staying competitive. In an attempt to answer this question, this study investigates the covers and contents of Finesse, Lig and Lééf. A literature study was used to determine which features and approaches can be used to make a Christian magazine's agenda (and therefore approach) unique. A qualitative content analysis is used to investigate how the covers and contents of Finesse, Lig and Lééf correlate with what one associates with Christian journalism, and how these magazines differ from one another in this regard. All these findings are compared with the biggest Afrikaans women's magazine, Sarie, to identify correspondences and differences. Semi-structured interviews were also held with the editors of Finesse, Lig and Lééf. <b>Specific</b> <b>directive</b> arguments were formulated about the features of Christian journalism and about agenda setting and the role of magazine covers. These <b>specific</b> <b>directive</b> arguments were used as a guideline in the content analysis. It was found that all four publications in question use well-known personalities (like actresses, singers and sports stars) as cover models. However, there are differences in the way the covers are presented and framed. Ug and Leer give noticeably more attention to the spiritual lives of their models, and as a result these magazines have clear features that can be associated with Christian journalism. Signs of the so-called "celebrity" culture were particularly evident in the covers and contents of Finesse and Sarie. In summary, it may be argued that Ug and Leer (which are outspoken Christian publications) strongly display their Christian character. On the other hand, Finesse (who views itself not as a Christian publication but as a lifestyle publication for the Christian woman) less consistently displays a Christian character. There is a strong distinction between Lig and Lééf and the secular Sarie, whereas Finesse displays more correspondences with Sarie. Master...|$|R
