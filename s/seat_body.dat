40|$|Abstract: Although much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} constructing specific models or to measuring the response characteristics of seated subjects, investigations on a mathematical human model on a seat with a backrest to evaluate vehicular riding comfort have not yet attracted the same level of attention. For the responses of a <b>seated</b> <b>body</b> to vertical vibrations, mathematical models of the mechanisms must be at least two-dimensional in the sagittal plane. In describing the motions of a <b>seated</b> <b>body,</b> two multibody models representative of the automotive postures found in the literature were investigated, one with and the other without a backrest support. Both models were modified to suitably represent the different automotive postures with and without backrest supports, and validated by various experimental data from the published literature pertaining to the same postural conditions. On the basis of the analytical study and the experimental validation, the fourteen-degrees-of-freedom model proposed in this research was found to be best fitted to the test results; therefore, this model is recommended for studying the biodynamic responses of a <b>seated</b> human <b>body</b> exposed to vertical vibrations in various automotive postures...|$|R
40|$|Occupational on-road and {{off-road}} vehicle operators {{are exposed to}} low frequency whole-body vibration (WBV) of comprehensive magnitudes, and have shown a high prevalence of back disorders. Characterisation of <b>seated</b> <b>body</b> biodynamics response is considered vital for assessing potential injury risks of WBV and for developing effective biomechanical models for integration in the primary and secondary suspension design processes. The <b>seated</b> <b>body</b> biodynamic responses to single axis vibration have been investigated widely under vertical axis and a few under individual horizontal axis. The responses to simultaneous three-axis vibration, as encountered during vehicle driving, however, have been investigated in two recent studies. In this dissertation research, the biodynamic responses of <b>seated</b> <b>body</b> exposed to single as well as multiple axis vibration are characterised {{in terms of the}} apparent mass (APMS), vibration power absorbed (VPA) and seat-to-head vibration transmissibility (STHT) responses with both hands and back supports. The APMS responses are characterised considering two-driving-points formed by the buttocks-pan and upper-body backrest interfaces to fully describe the body-seat interactions. This study proposes a method to determine the total <b>seated</b> <b>body</b> APMS response from the forces measured at the two-driving points. Furthermore, it is shown that the commonly used frequency-response-function (H 1), would suppress the contributions of the cross-axis responses under uncorrelated simultaneous multi-axis excitations. Consequently an alternative frequency response estimator (Hv) is applied for analyses of responses to uncorrelated multi-axis. The results obtained, clearly revealed the contributions of cross-axis responses, which were not evident in the reported responses derived using H 1 function estimator. Further, it is shown that the total response along an axis can be estimated from super position of the direct and cross-axis response components along the same axis. The seat-to-head vibration (STHT) transmissibility responses are also obtained so as to obtain additional target functions for defining the biodynamic models. The STHT responses also revealed considerable coupling effects of multi-axis vibration, when Hv function estimator is applied. The total VPA of the body under multi-axis is further derived considering the power absorption attributed to cross-axis body responses. A methodology is proposed to derive frequency-weightings similar to those in ISO 2631 - 1 using the absorbed power responses. Thus derived weightings based on total responses of the <b>seated</b> <b>body</b> under multi-axis uncorrelated vibration, are proposed to better evaluate the vibration exposure risk due to the whole-body multi-axis vibration. The results of the study suggest that the frequency-weightings derived for the back supported postures differ substantially from the current standardised weighting. The current weighting is thus believed to be applicable only for back unsupported sitting conditions. ...|$|R

Cars had a glass fibre open two <b>seat</b> <b>body</b> fitted, but a hardtop was later available which had a reverse slanted rear window which later Fords also exhibited.Yet other versions included Alfa Romeo S.V. engines. Ernest Pieterse was the first to try this form of motive power. Requiring a machine for the Nine Hours Race (S.A.'s classic sports-car race), and having to beat such machines as Porsche Carreras, Ernest bought a Dart and fitted disc brakes, Alfa S.V.+ engine, etc. In the said Nine Hours Race, the car led for a while but retired with boiling brake fluid. This let John Love's Carrera into the lead but it too retired, or was delayed, and another Dart with 1,100-c.c. Climax engine stepped into the breach and was leading after nine hours. This was 1959. Since then Porsche Spyders and Lotus Fifteens have been used in the Nine Hours, rather squashing anyone with aspirations of further wins in a GSM Dart.|$|E

50|$|Joubert and White {{began the}} {{manufacture}} of high-grade buckboards in Glens Falls in 1865. They were the innovators and inventors of a famous model that was known for its suspension system and was sought by many wealthy people here and abroad. Notable owners of the buckboard included Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor, J. Pierpont Morgan, Louis Tiffany, Spencer Trask, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. A standard buckboard was constructed by running two planks of wood between {{the front and rear}} axles and mounting the passenger <b>seat</b> <b>body</b> on the planks. The only shock absorption was in the flexibility of the planks. When riding on the rough roads of their day, passengers felt like they were riding a bucking horse, hence the name. Joubert devised a way to attach two steel leaf springs, bowed upwards to the planks, with the passenger seat attached {{to the top of the}} springs. The seats moved vertically on the springs and also rocked forward and back, making for a more cushioned ride. In 1880, Joubert patented his suspension design in 1880. Some 50 carriage and sleigh models by Joubert and White were considered to be of superior quality. A good buggy would sell for $50 to $75, while the Joubert and White buckboard might cost $500 to $800 with some as high as $1000 or more if customized.|$|E
5000|$|New Avon [...] was a British vehicle coachbuilder. The company, {{based in}} Warwick, was started when a Mr Ben Tilton and a Captain Philips trading as Avon Coachworks went into {{business}} in 1919 to make bodywork for cars. Following {{a change of}} ownership and financial reconstruction it became New Avon in 1922.For {{the first few years}} their main customer was Lea-Francis but they also made coachwork for Hampton cars. Then, in 1927 they produced an open two <b>seat</b> <b>body</b> for the Austin 7 followed in 1928 by a fixed head coupé, which went by the name of Swan, and then in 1929 a [...] "sportsman's two seater" [...] appeared. The Swan was the work of Alan Jensen who had joined the company and would with his brother create Jensen Brothers which later became Jensen Motors. Alan had come to the attention of New Avon when at the encouragement of Alfred Herbert Wilde, (1891-1930) chief engineer of the Standard Motor Company, the brothers brought a new design for a body on a Standard 9 chassis which they wanted New Avon to put into production. This work came just in time as the Lea-Francis work stopped in 1931 when that company went into receivership.For most of the 1930s work on Standard chassis dominated the output with Swan coupés and Wayfarer saloons but in 1930 they also exhibited a coupé body on a Wolseley Hornet and took their own stand at the 1931 London Motor Show. Alan Jensen left the company in 1930 and was replaced by Charles F Beauvais, who amongst other previous projects had started the Bow-V-Car light car company, who produced more designs for Standard as well as work for Austin, Lanchester and Crossley Motors who he would go on to join in 1933 as chief designer. He was replaced at New Avon by Arthur Meredith who had been working as foreman of the experimental bodyshop. [...] Production peaked in 1933-35 with 30-40 cars a week being made by a workforce of around 80 in the three storey building in Wharf Street.In 1935 the company was bought by John Maudslay, son of the founder of Standard, Reginald Maudsley, and became part of the Maudslay Motor Group. A showroom in London's Mayfair was opened and at the London Olympia Show five cars were exhibited. A move was made to new premises at Ladbroke House in Millers road.|$|E

40|$|The seated {{occupant}} {{responses to}} whole body vibration {{have been widely}} investigated, mostly under vertical vibration stimuli. The vibration environment of heavy road and off-road vehicles also comprises significant components of horizontal vibration, with magnitudes either comparable to or {{higher than those of}} the vertical vibration. It is thus desirable to investigate the <b>seated</b> <b>body</b> responses to horizontal vibration. This study concerns with characterization of the biodynamic responses in terms of apparent mass and the power absorbed by seated human occupants exposed to longitudinal and lateral vibration in the 0. 5 - 10 Hz frequency range under automotive seating postures. The measured data revealed consistent trends in view of the factors considered, namely, the posture (back supported or unsupported), as well as the direction, magnitude, type and frequency of vibration. The results suggest strong influence of the acceleration magnitude, the back support condition and the type of whole-body vibration. The peak magnitudes of APMS and absorbed power revealed good correlation with the body mass, suggesting increased energy absorption by heavier subjects. The vibration energy absorption properties of the <b>seated</b> <b>body</b> in the low frequency range revealed highest correlation with the anthropometric factors and the magnitude of the stimulus. The data is expected to serve as a basis for developing mechanical equivalent models of the occupant for seating dynamics applications, and to enhance knowledge on the human behaviour under exposure to horizontal vibration...|$|R
40|$|Identification of most {{probable}} {{ranges of}} biodynamic {{responses of the}} human body exposed to whole-body vibration is essential for developing effective integrated human-machine system design tools, improved vibration mitigation devices and frequency-weighting for exposure assessment.

The reported data on biodynamic responses of the seated and standing human body exposed to whole-body vibration along different directions and the associated experimental conditions are systematically reviewed in an attempt to identify datasets that are likely to represent comparable and practical postural and exposure conditions. Syntheses of datasets, {{selected on the basis of}} a set of criterion, are performed to identify the most probable ranges of biodynamic responses {{of the human body}} to whole-body vibration. These include the driving-point biodynamic responses of the <b>body</b> <b>seated</b> with and without a back support while exposed to fore-aft, lateral and vertical vibration and those of the standing body to vertical vibration, and seat-to-head vibration transmissibility of the <b>seated</b> <b>body.</b> The proposed ranges are expected to serve as reasonable target functions in various applications involving coupled human-system dynamics in the design process, and potentially for developing better frequency-weightings for exposure assessments...|$|R
