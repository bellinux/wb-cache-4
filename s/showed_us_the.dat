[...] Game industry executives were confused by Mysts success, not understanding how an [...] "interactive slide show" [...] {{turned out to be a}} huge hit. Online magazine writer Russell Pitts of The Escapist called Myst [...] "unlike anything that had come before, weaving video almost seamlessly into a beautifully rendered world, presenting a captivating landscape filled with puzzles and mystery. In a game market dominated by Doom clones and simulators, Myst took us by the hand and <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> future of gaming. It took almost a decade for anyone to follow its lead." [...] Critics from Wired and Salon considered the games approaching the level of art, while authors Henry Jenkins and Lev Manovich pointed out the series as exemplifying the promise of new media to create unseen art forms.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, mostly complimenting Davies's performance as Daniel. Chris Carabott of IGN commented {{that if this}} is the last appearance of Davies on Lost, which he [...] "somehow" [...] doubts, then, [...] "I'm glad he had the opportunity to leave on such a strong note. He delivers in some really great, emotional, moments this week – especially in the scenes in which he is suffering from memory deterioration. I've become a huge fan of Davies {{over the course of the}} last couple of years thanks to his performance on this show." [...] Rachel Dovey of Paste said the episode revealed [...] "a whole different" [...] side of Daniel: [...] "We've oscillated before about the true nature of the physicist, whether it's good or evil [...] We decided he's mostly a decent guy, barring the whole experimenting-on-his-girlfriend-then-running-away-when-her-brain-turned-to-mush thing.

2500|$|As such, {{with power}} being {{seen by many}} of the {{characters}} as the ultimate goal, the play also deals with themes of disloyalty and betrayal, and outlines the results of political factionalism and social breakdown; a once calm world is seen spiralling toward chaos as barbarism and immorality come to the fore. As E.M.W. Tillyard has written of the Henry VI trilogy; [...] "The second part had <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> murder of Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, the rise of York, the destruction of two of Humphrey's murderers and the enmity of the two survivors, York and Queen Margaret.

2500|$|Debussy's {{great service}} to music was to reawaken among all musicians an {{awareness}} of harmony and its possibilities.

Now, what I am always asking myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? [...] Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made Ferruccio Busoni exclaim 'At last something truly new!' [...] Until 1911, Bartók composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera Bluebeard's Castle. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|According to his essay, [...] "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", in Christians Among the Virtues, he {{said that}} Christians are called to be patient {{patients}} in sickness and in health because [...] "patience is integral to the Christian life". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue {{we have in common}} with God. [...] "In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity." [...] He also says that God <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> best example of patience {{when it comes to the}} life of Jesus. Because God is the foundation, Hauerwas stated that “only patience shaped by Christ is true patience". As well as this, he later emphasized that patience is not developed by human will, but given through the Holy Spirit, who gives us the capacity to love, for “without [...] in us there cannot be patience because in good men it is the [...] of God which endures all things.” In the author’s essay, he gave people a framework of how to learn to practice patience when we are not sick: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1538, {{the church}} in Bagsværd was pulled down on the orders of the king so that the stones {{could be used to}} repair the old Catholic bishop's palace which, after the Reformation, was {{to be used as a}} seminary for the new Lutheran Church. Thereafter, the parishioners had to use {{the church in}} Gladsaxe though there was {{increasing}} interest in building a new church in Bagsværd. It therefore came as no surprise that the congregational council took special interest in the church Utzon had included in a competition exhibit for the town centre in Farum when it was displayed in Gladsaxe at an architectural exhibition in 1967. When he was asked whether he would like to submit a proposal for a church at Bagsværd, Utzon was elated: [...] "There I stood, and was offered the finest task an architect can have — a magnificent time when it was the light from above that <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> way." [...] The proposal he submitted the following year included four sketches: the first one showed a group of people under the clouds on a beach, the last one depicted the same people as a congregation in a church where the clouds had become the sculptural roof. They were intended to illustrate Utzon's understanding of the overall concept.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second.
