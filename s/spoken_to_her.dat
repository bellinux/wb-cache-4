500|$|The {{king and}} his new queen enjoyed a {{reasonably}} happy accord with periods of calm and affection. Anne Boleyn's sharp intelligence, political acumen and forward manners, although desirable in a mistress, were, at the time, unacceptable in a wife. She was once reported to have <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> uncle in words that [...] "shouldn't be used to a dog". After a stillbirth or miscarriage as early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the possibility of divorcing her without having to return to Catherine. Nothing came of the issue as the royal couple reconciled and spent summer 1535 on progress. By October, she was again pregnant.|$|E

Babe also claims that she misses having someone [...] "to share half a beer with {{at the end of a}} long day." [...] However, later scenes in the episodes depicted Babe talking to an unknown person off-screen as she opens a bottle of beer for the them to share.|$|E

Winnie has not <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father since his imprisonment; she blames Gordon for {{the suicide of}} her drugged-out brother, Rudy. The character has been {{said to be the}} [...] "moral center of the story" [...] and described as being liberal, and to some extent passive. Mulligan is British and had to speak with an American accent for her role. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps was her first major studio film. When she first met Stone for the role she explained that she did not want her character to be a [...] "token girlfriend;" [...] both agreed to work to make sure that would not happen. During the same encounter Stone learned that she had short hair, and he initially discussed having her wear a wig, but Mulligan said she did not feel like herself when wearing the hairpiece. Stone trusted her and made an exception. According to Mulligan, Stone cast her in the Wall Street sequel based on her performance in An Education (2009).|$|E

Takanohana has rarely <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> since. In June 2008 he spoke of his distress at the news that she had been named as a defence witness in a civil lawsuit brought by the Sumo Association against the tabloid magazine Shūkan Gendai over allegations that his father benefited from a thrown match for the championship in 1975, saying, [...] "she will essentially be fighting against me."

500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say.

At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney.

500|$|At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky {{was visited}} by Tatiana Melnik, née Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, {{the head of}} the Russian refugee office in Berlin, and the {{daughter}} of the imperial family's personal physician, Dr. Eugene Botkin, who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in February 1917. To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though [...] "the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was." [...] In a letter, Melnik wrote: [...] "Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child. She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narration... even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight." [...] Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state. Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to [...] "aid the patient's weak memory" [...] or as part of a deliberate charade, Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.|$|E
500|$|Aside from {{experts and}} {{security}} personnel, several eyewitnesses gave {{evidence to the}} inquest. Three witnessed parts of the shootings, and gave accounts which supported the official version of events—in particular, they did not witness the SAS shooting any of the suspects while {{they were on the}} floor. Witnesses uncovered by the journalists making [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] also appeared: Stephen Bullock repeated his account of seeing McCann and Savage raise their hands before the SAS shot them; Josie Celecia repeated her account of seeing a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground. Hucker pointed out that parts of Celecia's testimony had changed since she spoke to [...] "Death on the Rock", and suggested that the gunfire she heard was from the shooting of Savage rather than sustained shooting of McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, a suggestion Celecia rejected; the SAS's lawyer further observed that she was unable to identify the military personnel in photographs her husband had taken. Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car the Proettas saw was the one being driven by Inspector Revagliatte, carrying four uniformed police officers rather than plain-clothed soldiers, but Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' version did not make sense. His wife gave evidence the following day. Contrary to her statement to [...] "Death on the Rock", Carmen Proetta was no longer certain that she had seen McCann and Farrell shot while on the ground. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown.|$|E

In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and {{he believed that the}} shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car {{he and his wife had}} seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers, but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to [...] "Death on the Rock"; she was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown. Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after [...] "pestering" [...] from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was [...] "a bit confused". The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.|$|E

Harrison had <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{frequently}} throughout that year, however, since Arias was working as a secretary for A Records, and by extension, for his recently launched Dark Horse record label.
