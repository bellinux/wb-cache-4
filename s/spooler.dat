25|$|The XPS Print Path {{introduced}} in Windows Vista supports high quality 16-bit color printing. The XPS print path uses XML Paper Specification (XPS) as the print <b>spooler</b> file format, {{that serves as}} the page description language (PDL) for printers. The XPS <b>spooler</b> format is the intended replacement for the Enhanced Metafile (EMF) format which is the print <b>spooler</b> format in the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) print path. XPS is an XML-based (more specifically XAML-based) color-managed device and resolution independent vector-based paged document format which encapsulates an exact representation of the actual printed output. XPS documents are packed in a ZIP container along with text, fonts, raster images, 2D vector graphics and DRM information. For printers supporting XPS, this eliminates an intermediate conversion to a printer-specific language, increasing the reliability and fidelity of the printed output. Microsoft claims that major printer vendors are planning to release printers with built-in XPS support and that this will provide better fidelity to the original document.|$|E

40|$|A <b>spool</b> valve as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control of the <b>spool</b> valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the <b>spool.</b> To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the <b>spool.</b> Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the <b>spool.</b> The motion of the <b>spool</b> is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the <b>spool,</b> and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> valve dose not exist at present. Final target {{of this study is to}} develop numerical code to predict precisely the dynamic motion of the <b>spool</b> valve. As the first step, dynamic characteristics of a <b>spool</b> valve coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical effects have been conducted in the present paper...|$|R

40|$|Within the Oil industry, subsea {{pipelines}} {{are used}} to transport hydrocarbons from one location to another. After the installation of a subsea pipeline, the final connection between the pipeline ant the interconnecting facilities are done by using tie-in <b>spools.</b> In principle, tie-in <b>spools</b> serve two purposes. First, it needs to provide an interface that bridges the inaccuracies associated with offshore pipeline installation. Inaccuracies related to pipeline installation are numerous, but {{can be related to}} the existing seabed infrastructure, orientation/position of the tie-in facilities with respect to pipeline installation vessel, bathymetry & soil accuracy of data among others. These factors cause the tie-in <b>spool</b> to be measured, fabricated and installed after the pipeline has been laid in order to make up the connection. Secondly, the tie-in <b>spool</b> needs to be a flexible element as pipelines expands during operational conditions because of heat and pressure differences between installation and operational stages. By the tie-in <b>spool</b> being flexible, the forces in connectors are reduced in order to ensure safe transportation of hydrocarbons. These key requirements can have significant impact of the overall cost of a project as they will affect all necessary operations related to tie-in <b>spools.</b> This report assesses key requirements related to tie-in <b>spools</b> by a detailed review about issues related to the design, fabrication, installation and operation of tie-in <b>spools.</b> By presenting details from the design of an actual installed tie-in <b>spool</b> in the southern North Sea this is sought achieved. By presenting a tie-in <b>spool</b> and its important design parameters, load steps that it is subjected to, and the results from loading analysis it is wanted to educate about the importance of tie-in <b>spools.</b> A modification of the tie-in <b>spool</b> where done to develop a simple technique to quickly assess the preliminary design/configuration of a tie-in <b>spool</b> based on bending moment capacity of the associated connector. The design parameters, such as pipeline expansion, where extracted from the presented tie-in analysis. Four different analysis methods where used in order to give recommendations on which method are most suited for <b>spool</b> piece analysis. By comparing results with the actual installed <b>spool,</b> calculated results showed that three methods can be suited for simplified <b>spool</b> piece analysis. In order to qualify one of the analysis methods, a downscaled tie-in <b>spool</b> was manufactured based on the modified <b>spool.</b> By innovative use of simple mechanical equipment, the tie-in <b>spool</b> was applied pipeline expansion via a winch. The bending moment in the connector where measured using an adjustable torque wrench. Measured bending moment was compared to the analysis methods and by comparison it was evident that numbers did not correlate. Due to this, no further recommendation on suitable analysis method could be given. A search for possible error sources contributing to no correlation was conducted.
