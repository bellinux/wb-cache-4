5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of <b>solutes</b> affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the <b>solutes</b> are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} {{studies of the}} formation of <b>solute</b> concentration gradient in supersaturated binary solutions in a gravitational field were carried out. The formation of <b>solute</b> concentration gradient was associated with the gravity induced redistribution of subcritical <b>solute</b> clusters. The birth-death process of the new solute-rich phase domains (subcritical <b>solute</b> clusters) was described in terms of the time-dependent Ginzburg Landau model developed for metastable state relaxation in binary (<b>solute</b> + solvent) non-critical solutions {{in the presence of a}} gravitational field. A new mathematical Ansatz was developed for solution of the model equations. This Ansatz has allowed to approach for the first time the following important problems: (1) Microstructure of <b>solute</b> distribution inside of the subcritical <b>solute</b> clusters. The analytical results obtained demonstrate that <b>solute</b> inside of the subcritical <b>solute</b> clusters is heterogeneously distributed with a spatially periodic structure. (2) Macrostructure of the <b>solute</b> subcritical clusters distribution in a gravitational field. The subcritical <b>solute</b> clusters are found to be distributed heterogeneously in a gravitational field. This heterogeneity, which is due to the heterogeneous birth-death process of the subcritical <b>solute</b> clusters in a gravitational field, initiates a noticeable <b>solute</b> concentration gradient in vertical columns of supersaturated binary solutions. An analysis and comparison of theoretical results and experimental data related to the <b>solute</b> concentration gradient formation in a gravitational field are presented.

The number of experiments with multisampler devices that measure <b>solute</b> leaching {{as a function of}} space and time is increasing. The breakthrough curve (BTC) can characterize the temporal aspect of <b>solute</b> leaching, and recently the spatial <b>solute</b> distribution curve (SSDC) was introduced to describe the spatial <b>solute</b> distribution.

40|$|The {{transport}} of a spherical <b>solute</b> {{through a long}} circular cylindrical pore filled with an electrolyte solution is studied numerically, {{in the presence of}} constant surface charge on the <b>solute</b> and the pore wall. Fluid dynamic analyses were carried out to calculate the flow field around the <b>solute</b> in the pore to evaluate the drag coefficients exerted on the <b>solute.</b> Electrical potentials around the <b>solute</b> in the electrolyte solution were computed based on a mean-field theory to provide the interaction energy between the charged <b>solute</b> and the pore wall. Combining the results of the fluid dynamic and electrostatic analyses, we estimated the rate of the diffusive and convective {{transport of}} the <b>solute</b> across the pore. Although the present estimates of the drag coefficients on the <b>solute</b> suggest more than 10 % difference from existing studies, depending on the radius ratio of the <b>solute</b> relative to the pore and the radial position of the <b>solute</b> center in the pore, this difference leads to a minor effect on the hindrance factors. It was found that even at rather large ion concentrations, the repulsive electrostatic interaction between the charged <b>solute</b> and the pore wall of like charge could significantly reduce the transport rate of the <b>solute...</b>|$|R
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The <b>solutes</b> in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the <b>solutes</b> is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other <b>solutes</b> include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.|$|E
5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions.

With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes.

5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of <b>solutes</b> that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by <b>solutes</b> or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E
50|$|For example, when a <b>solute</b> is {{dissolved}} in water, water molecules {{are less likely}} to diffuse away via osmosis than when there is no <b>solute.</b> A solution will have a lower and hence more negative water potential than that of pure water.

40|$|<b>Solute</b> {{transport}} through {{articular cartilage}} under cyclic loading {{has recently been}} modelled mathematically using porous media and transport theories to investigate the role of advection that potentially enhance <b>solute</b> transport through cartilage. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a mathematical model describing the effects of cyclic deformation and ECM binding on <b>solute</b> transport through cartilage. The mechanical and transport theories for porous media are used to model the articular cartilage as a deformable multi-phase mixture. It is assumed that the total <b>solute</b> concentration is comprised of unbound <b>solute</b> in the cartilage fluid phase and <b>solute</b> bound to the solid phase (ECM). The <b>solute</b> in solution can be transported in the interstitial fluid by diffusion and advection or it may bound onto ECM (i. e. to binding proteins). It is shown that at low initial <b>solute</b> bath concentration, ignoring binding effects leads to a significant underestimation of the steady-state <b>solute</b> concentration within the cartilage tissue; however, the influence if binding becomes negligible at high bath concentrations due to the finite number of binding sites.

5|$|The {{solubility}} {{is highest}} in polar solvents (such as water) or ionic liquids, but {{tends to be}} low in nonpolar solvents (such as petrol/gasoline). This is principally because the resulting ion–dipole interactions are significantly stronger than ion-induced dipole interactions, so the heat of solution is higher. When the oppositely charged ions in the solid ionic lattice are surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule, the solid ions are {{pulled out of the}} lattice and into the liquid. If the solvation energy exceeds the lattice energy, the negative net enthalpy change of solution provides a thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and dissolve in the liquid. In addition, the entropy change of solution is usually positive for most solid <b>solutes</b> like ionic compounds, which means that their solubility increases when the temperature increases. There are some unusual ionic compounds such as cerium(III) sulfate, where this entropy change is negative, due to extra order induced in the water upon solution, and the solubility decreases with temperature.|$|E
5|$|During winter, {{asparagine}} is metabolised immediately, {{but other}} nutrients, especially phosphates and glutamine, {{are removed from}} the xylem sap and stored in mature stem, bark and leaf tissues for release back into the xylem just before shoot growth begins in mid summer. This is also {{the time when the}} oldest leaves senesce and die, returning nutrients to the plant at the time when they are needed most. When glutamine eventually reaches the leaves, it is broken down and used to synthesise protein and non-amide amino acids such as aspartate, threonine, serine, glutamate, glycine, alanine and cystine. Together with sucrose and other <b>solutes,</b> these are then circulated in the phloem. The phloem sap of B.prionotes is unusual in having an extremely low ratio of potassium to sodium cations, and very low concentrations of phosphate and amino acids compared to chloride and sulfate anions. The low levels of potassium and phosphate reflect the extremely low availability of these minerals in the soil. The unusually high levels of sodium and chloride—at concentrations usually only seen under saline conditions—may be due to the necessity of maintaining turgor pressure; that is, with so little potassium and phosphate available, and that needed in the building of new tissue, B.prionotes is forced to circulate whatever other ions are available in order to maintain turgor.|$|E

Other transporters assist in the movement of these <b>solutes</b> out of the cell through its apical surface.
