5|$|During the 1997 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl selection committee held contracts {{with both the}} Big East and Atlantic Coast Conferences. In exchange for guaranteeing to pay a total of $3.2 million to the participating teams, the committee held the right to the second pick of bowl-eligible teams from each conference. Each conference's champion was awarded an automatic <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bowl Alliance game, and {{it was expected that}} the Gator Bowl would select each conference's second-place team unless other circumstances arose.|$|E
5|$|For the 20002001 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl {{had the right}} to select the No. 2 bowl-eligible team from both the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the Big East Conference. The bowl game's administrators also had a contract to include Notre Dame if that school met certain entry requirements. The conference champions of the ACC and Big East were guaranteed a <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bowl Championship Series game, and there also was the possibility of an at-large BCS selection for any team in each conference if it finished high enough in the BCS Poll but did not win the conference championship.|$|E

As the music ends, the group watch fireworks as Malik walks towards his significant other and kisses her. The clip attracted positive commentary from fans of the group.|$|E

5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|Following the tie against Oklahoma, No. 16 Texas {{struggled}} against No. 14 Virginia in Austin. Not until the game's final play did the Longhorns secure their 1716 {{win over the}} favored Cavaliers. The game was the 700th victory in Texas football history and marked {{the only time in}} Texas' first 103 years of football that a game ended with Texas kicking a winning field goal. Following the victory over Virginia, Texas began a winning streak that continued through the remainder of the regular season. Heading into the final game of the regular season, it appeared that the winner of the Texas/Texas A game would clinch the Southwest Conference championship and a bid to a Bowl Alliance game. In Texas' final Southwestern Conference game, it secured the conference championship with a 166 win that guaranteed it a <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bowl Alliance game. On the next day, the Sugar Bowl's pick of Texas was made official.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Hall began a scripted {{rivalry with}} Massaro {{centered}} on Hall's jealousy of Massaro's recent Playboy appearance; the rivalry turned Hall into a villain and matches {{between the two}} mainly resulted in losses for Hall. During the feud, Hall attempted to prove that she was talented in areas beyond wrestling and being eye candy by creating a new in-ring persona, in which she sang badly at every opportunity, but {{thought she was a}} very good singer. She later attempted to impress music producer Timbaland by performing a song she claimed to have composed herself, looking for a <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> video he was preparing and a possible future collaboration on a music project, but he turned her down. Massaro, with whom she had been involved in a rivalry, was one of the wrestlers who was chosen to work with Timbaland instead. Jealous of Massaro's recent successes, she attacked her and, in storyline, seriously injured her, with the reasoning that if she could not appear in Timbaland's music project, neither could Massaro.|$|E

5|$|In the 2005 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference had an automatic bid to the Gator Bowl. By contract, the Gator Bowl Association—which produces the game—possessed {{the first pick}} of bowl-eligible ACC teams after {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game was given a <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game. This was the final year that the Gator Bowl had first pick of eligible ACC teams, as contract renegotiations later resulted in the Gator Bowl slipping to the third selection, beginning with the 2006 {{college football}} season. Virginia Tech, losers of the 2005 ACC Championship Game, were chosen by the Gator Bowl Association to participate as the ACC's representative to the 2006 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 2010, {{two days}} {{after the end of the}} 2009–10 season, West Ham {{announced}} the termination of Zola's contract with immediate effect. On 3 June 2010, Avram Grant signed a four-year deal to become the next manager of West Ham subject to a work permit. West Ham's form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone, placing Grant's future as manager under serious doubt. A 4–0 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> disappointing season. West Ham's form in the Premier League did not affect their form in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter final of the FA cup before a 2–1 defeat at Stoke City.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 2011, Rodríguez scored {{his second}} {{goal for the}} club, netting his side's second from the penalty <b>spot,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 win over FC Thun.

On 11 January 2012, Zürich {{officials}} announced that the club had accepted a bid for Rodríguez by German side Wolfsburg and that he {{was on the verge of}} completing the transfer, subject to a medical. Despite being sold midway through the season, Rodríguez was voted as the Fans' Player of the Season on 4 June 2012, ahead of Oliver Buff and Pedro Henrique.|$|E

5|$|Several {{popularity}} polls {{conducted over}} the past decade indicate that Freddie Mercury's reputation may, in fact, have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the 100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC. He was further listed at the 52nd <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes. Despite {{the fact that he had}} been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present. In 2008 Rolling Stone ranked Mercury 18 on its list of the Top 100 Singers Of All Time. Mercury was voted the greatest male singer in MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In 2011 a Rolling Stone readers' pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine's Best Lead Singers of All Time.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe began {{competition}} in 2002 at the Australian Championships in Brisbane in March, which {{were used to}} select the team for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match Spitz's seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break a world record was the talking point. He claimed the 100m and 200m events in times outside his best, making {{it the first time}} that he had failed to break a world record at a major meet since 1999. He also experimented by adding the 100m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second. This earned him a Commonwealth <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> seventh event, leading to further media speculation that he could match Spitz.|$|E
5|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} of the 2016–17 season against Sampdoria on 11 September, Totti equalled Paolo Maldini's record of playing in 25 Serie A seasons. With Roma trailing 2–1 at half time, Totti came off the bench and assisted Edin Džeko's temporary equaliser, later also scoring the match-winning goal from a penalty in injury time to secure a 3–2 home win in Serie A; Totti's goal meant that {{he had managed to}} score at least once {{in each of the past}} 23 consecutive seasons of his career. On 25 September, he scored his 250th Serie A goal from the penalty <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3–1 away defeat to Torino, just two days before his 40th birthday. On his first start two days after his 40th birthday, on 29 September, Totti was praised for his performance and longevity in a 4–0 home win over Astra Giurgiu in the Europa League; he played all 90 minutes of the match, providing two assists, while also being involved in a third goal. On 20 October, Totti made his 100th appearance in UEFA club competitions, setting up two goals in a 3–3 home draw against Austria Wien in the Europa League. In late October, he sustained a muscle injury to the flexor of his left thigh during a training session, which ruled him out indefinitely. He returned to action as a substitute in a 3–2 home win over Pescara on 27 November.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Laird {{scored in}} Stevenage's {{pre-season}} friendly victory over Histon. He {{started in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, a 2–2 home draw with Macclesfield Town. In September 2010, in games against Cheltenham Town and Torquay United respectively, Laird {{was used as a}} left midfielder, as opposed to playing in his usual left-back position. He reverted to the left-back spot in Stevenage's 1–0 win over Lincoln City at Sincil Bank. He scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season from the penalty <b>spot,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 win over Burton Albion in October 2010. A week later, he missed the chance to double his goal tally for the season, missing a second-half penalty in a 0–0 draw against Morecambe. Coincidentally, Laird's second goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Morecambe in January 2011; he scored from close range following John Mousinho's cross to give Stevenage the lead. Just three days later, Laird scored his third goal of the season, netting with a curling effort from 25 yards out to give Stevenage their third goal of a 3–0 win against Rotherham United. Laird was initially credited with scoring an 87th-minute winner in Stevenage's 1–0 away win at Crewe Alexandra on 19 February 2011, but the goal was eventually given to teammate Byron Harrison. At the age of 22, Laird captained Stevenage {{for the first time in}} their 1–0 loss to Hereford United on 8 March 2011. In the club's following match, against Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park, Laird was sent-off for two bookable offences, although Stevenage held on to win the match 1–0. Laird's fourth goal of the campaign came in Stevenage's 3–3 draw against Bury on 7 May 2011, as he opened the scoring with a strike from 25 yards out. He played a total of 54 games during the 2010–11 season, scoring four goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Laird playing the whole game.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{played in}} Peterborough's first match of the 2009–10 season, scoring from the penalty <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 defeat to Derby County at Pride Park. Three days later, Boyd netted Peterborough's {{third in the}} club's 4–0 away win at Wycombe Wanderers. He scored his third goal of the {{campaign}} in a 2–1 home win against Ipswich Town, as well as scoring in the club's 1–1 draw at Leicester City. His sixth of the season came in Peterborough's 3–2 home victory over Reading, with Boyd scoring the club's third goal with a backheel in injury-time. In October 2009, Boyd made a club record-equalling 124th consecutive appearance, scoring a last minute equaliser against Bristol City at Ashton Gate. He subsequently broke the record three days later in a match against Doncaster Rovers, before scoring twice in the following match against Scunthorpe United. He continued his goalscoring form throughout October with a goal at Ewood Park, scoring his third goal in Peterborough's League Cup campaign in a 5–2 defeat against Premier League team Blackburn Rovers. The following week, Boyd scored in a 2–1 defeat at home to Barnsley, as well as netting in a 2–2 draw against Middlesbrough shortly after. He assisted both of Peterborough's goals in a 2–1 victory at home to Watford. Boyd also scored in Peterborough's 4–4 draw against Cardiff City, scoring Peterborough's third goal as the club came back from four goals down to earn a point. Upon Mark Cooper's arrival as manager, Boyd was made team captain in January 2010. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} Peterborough rejected a bid for Boyd from fellow Championship side Middlesbrough in the January transfer window. The following day, Peterborough United director of football Barry Fry confirmed that Middlesbrough were in talks over Boyd, although talks broke down after the two clubs failed to agree a fee for the player. Boyd scored a total of 12 times in 37 appearances during the 2009–10 season.|$|E
