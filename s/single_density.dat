Disk capacity was 80 KB per side on 5¼-inch disks and 250.25 KB per side on 8-inch disks. Double-sided disk drives were treated as two independent disks with a drive letter per side. CP/M used the first 4 tracks on 5¼-inch disks and the first 3 tracks on 8-inch disks, reducing the usable capacity of a <b>single</b> <b>density,</b> single-sided 5¼-inch disk to 72 KB.|$|E

30|$|For extracting the OI (777.4) {{line from}} the {{measured}} spectra, measurement during a <b>single</b> F-region <b>density</b> peak is more suitable than during a <b>single</b> E-region <b>density</b> peak. However, the latter was adopted in this study. This is because soft-electron precipitations do not cause ionization at E-region heights or N 2 1 PG band emissions. The OI (777.4) intensity can be derived by simply adjusting {{the peak of the}} reference spectrum to match the measured spectrum via application of a multiplicative factor. However, such precipitation scarcely occurs in the auroral oval, although it might be observed in the polar cap and the cusp regions.|$|R

The attractive potential is modelled using a parameterised delta-function, allowing us to determine all single particle eigenfunctions analytically.

We discuss the <b>single</b> particle <b>densities,</b> the pair correlation functions, the reduced <b>single</b> particle <b>density</b> matrices and the momentum distributions as a function of particle number and strength of the attractive point potential.
