60|$|And then, one day, {{she did not}} run away. She waited our coming, {{and made}} soft peace-sounds. We could not get very near, however.

6000|$|David was now firmly {{convinced}} that {{he had once been}} wrecked on an island, while Oliver passed his days in dubiety. They used to argue it out together and among their friends. As I unfolded the story Oliver listened with an open knife in his hand, and David who was not allowed to have a knife wore a pirate-string round his waist. Irene in her usual interfering way objected to this bauble and dropped disparaging remarks about wrecked islands which were little to her credit. I was for defying her, but David, who had the knack of women, knew a better way; he craftily proposed that we [...] "should let Irene in," [...] in short, should wreck her, and though I objected, she proved a great success and recognised the yucca filamentosa by its long narrow leaves the very day <b>she</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> Thereafter we had no more scoffing from Irene, who listened to the story as hotly as anybody.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{had read}} one of our books," [...] Amelius answered; [...] "and she had her married sister at New York to go to. There were moments, after her {{recovery}} (she confessed it to me frankly), when the thought of suicide was in her mind. Her religious scruples saved her. She was kindly received by her sister and her sister's husband. They proposed to keep her with them to teach their children. No! the new life offered to her was too like the old life--she was broken in body and mind; she had no courage to face it. We have a resident agent in New York; and he arranged for her journey to Tadmor. There is a gleam of brightness, at any rate, {{in this part of}} her story. She blessed the day, poor soul, when <b>she</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> Never before had she found herself among such kind-hearted, unselfish, simple people.
