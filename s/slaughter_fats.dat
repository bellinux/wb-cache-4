The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate growth and carcase parameters of lambs, sired by five high and low muscle density Terminal sire rams, using three different covariates. Progeny (n= 394) were recorded for live weight at: birth; 8 weeks, 16 weeks and immediately pre-slaughter. Ultrasonic measurements were made at the third lumbar vertebrae, pre-slaughter. Carcase records include carcase weights, EUROP classification scores for fatness and conformation. Data were analysed using GENSTAT 15, using a sire nested within muscle density ANOVA design model, fitting sex; dam age (slaughter batch for carcase traits); birth/rear type and MyoMaxTM carrier status. The model was adjusted for the covariates, age at measurement (age) : live weight at slaughter (Slwt); or <b>slaughter</b> <b>fat</b> grade (fat). Low muscle density sired lambs were heavier at 8 weeks (age P= 0. 022; Slwt P= 0. 043 : fat P= 0. 04) and 16 weeks (age 0. 014; Slwt P= 0. 05; fat P= 0. 036). However high muscle density sired lambs had increased ultrasonic muscle depth (age 0. 0 19 : Slwt P= 0. 017; and fat P= 0. 017), heavier hot carcase weight (age P= 0. 004; Slwt P< 0. 001; fat P= 0. 004), 48 h cold carcase weight (age P= 0. 027; Slwt P< 0. 001 : fat P= 0. 013), higher killing out percentages (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001), and improved carcase conformation (age, Slwt and fat P< 0. 001). It is proposed that when compared at the same end point, high muscle density sired lambs have increased lean tissue which is expressed as higher carcase weight rather than live weight.

40|$|Correlations between cattle {{disposition}} {{and meat}} quality {{were expected to}} be found, as well as differences in meat quality traits among contemporary groups, sires, and families nested within sires. Temperament effects on meat quality were evaluated in Nellore ? Angus F 2 cross cattle (n = 238) over a 3 -yr period, with harvests twice a year. Five aspects of temperament [...] aggressiveness, nervousness, flightiness, gregariousness, and overall temperament [...] were evaluated at weaning and yearling ages, as well as an overall temperament score at slaughter. USDA quality grade, fat thickness, adjusted fat thickness, hot carcass weight, USDA yield grade, and chemical fat were correlated negatively (P < 0. 05) with weaning temperament scores, aggressiveness, nervousness, flightiness, gregariousness, and overall temperament. No significant correlation was found between Warner-Bratzler shear and weaning temperament traits. USDA quality grade and live weight were correlated negatively (P < 0. 05) with yearling temperament scores, nervousness, flightiness, gregariousness, overall temperament score as well as the temperament score observed at <b>slaughter.</b> <b>Fat</b> thickness and adjusted fat thickness also were correlated negatively (P < 0. 05) with yearling gregariousness, yearling overall, and slaughter overall temperament. Yearling gregariousness was correlated positively (P < 0. 05) with Warner-Bratzler shear from both ES and NON carcasses. Least squares mean differences were evaluated among contemporary groups, sires, and families nested within sires for overall temperament traits and meat quality traits. Contemporary group differences found were thought to be explained by environmental factors, as seen in contemporary group 5, which had the smallest ribeye possibly caused by the shortest feeding period. Steers sired by 297 J had the lowest (calmest) temperament scores, most 12 th rib fat, highest numerical yield grade, and the heaviest weights.

40|$|In boars, social {{relationships}} could influence pubertal development and feeding behaviour. The {{objectives of the}} present study were to determine the relationships between behaviour (agonistic, mounting and feeding behaviours), plasma sex steroids (oestradiol, testosterone) and fat androstenone. A total of 270 Pietrain x Large White boars, derived from four distinct genotypes were used. They were raised in groups of 11 - 12 pigs/pen. Animals were observed for about two times 10 h/day at the beginning or about 6 h at the end of fattening. Agonistic (fighting, hitting, biting, threatening, chasing) and sexual (mounting) behaviours were counted in early fattening shortly after a social mixing (for 177 of the 270 animals) and in late fattening after several weeks of social stability. Skin lesions were counted in the same periods and on carcasses. Data obtained from electronic feeders were used to determine the number and duration of meals, and the feed intake over 96 -h periods in the middle {{and at the end of}} fattening. At the end of fattening, blood was sampled to measure oestradiol and testosterone. At <b>slaughter,</b> <b>fat</b> was collected to measure androstenone. Using the agonistic behaviours, a dominance index was calculated (DRrank). As expected, numbers of skin lesions and agonistic acts were higher in early fattening (P < 0. 0001) whereas that of mounting acts was lower in early than in late fattening (P < 0. 05). The feeding characteristics (r = 0. 25 to 0. 39) were significantly correlated between ages, whereas numbers of mountings (r = 0. 18), of skin lesions (r = 0. 05) and agonistic acts (r =- 0. 05) were not. The number of agonistic acts was significantly correlated with that of mountings only-in early fattening (r = 0. 38). At both ages, no difference between dominance groups was observed for feeding characteristics. This was probably related to low competition between boars for access to feed. Dominant boars had a higher concentration of androstenone in fat than subordinates (P < 0. 05) but no difference was observed for plasma steroids. An active role of androstenone in controlling social behaviour but not reproductive function may explain this phenomenon...|$|R

Birds were eviscerated and carcass cuts and non-edible offal components were determined according to the procedure described by Kekeocha (1985). Dressed weight was measured after the removal of blood and feather and the dressing percentage was calculated as the proportion of dressed carcass weight to slaughter weight. Eviscerated carcass weight was determined after removing blood, feather, shank, head, kidney, lungs, pancreas, crop, proventriculus, small intestine, large intestine, caeca and urogenital tracts.

CLA have anticarcinogenic, antiatherogenic and immune modulating properties as well as the ability to decrease body fat deposition in growing pigs (1). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the total amount of CLA and the rate of assimilation of individual CLA isomers in pig tissue as a result of CLA feeding. Thirty female cross bred (Large White x Landrace) pigs (initial weight 57 kg) were randomly allocated to one of 6 dietary treatments (0, 1. 25, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10. 0 g/kg of CLA 55 which contains 55 % of CLA isomers (Natural Lipids Ltd., Hovdebygda, Norway). The main CLA isomers, tc/ct 11, 13; 10, 12; 9, 11 and 8, 10, were present at 18, 30, 25 and 14 % (w/w) of the total CLA content, respectively. Pigs were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks and samples of subcutaneous fat (SF) and muscle were collected at <b>slaughter.</b> Total <b>fat</b> was extracted and free acids were analysed using silver-ion high-performance liquid chromatography (2). Transfer efficiencies of the CLA isomers into porcine tissue were calculated as follows: [((final CLA mass – initial CLA mass) – (final CLA mass in control pigs – initial CLA mass in control pigs)) / total CLA consumed] × 100. Approximately one third of the total dietary CLA given to the pigs was incorporated into the fat (sum of intramuscular and subcutaneous fat), with the highest transfer efficiency value (39. 2 %) recorded for the group of pigs fed the intermediate level of dietary CLA 55 (5. 0 g/kg). Dietary supplementation of CLA increased the total CLA content in adipose tissue and muscle fat of pigs with the highest transfer efficiency of about 38 % (P < 0. 001) and 0. 8 % (P = 0. 007), respectively.

40|$|O {{experiment}}o teve como objetivo estudar o crescimento alométrico dos diferentes tecidos do pescoço, costela, paleta e perna em relação ao peso do corte de cordeiros e cordeiras. Foram utilizados 22 machos inteiros e 23 fêmeas da raça Texel. Desses, sete foram abatidos no início do experimento e os demais, aos pesos de 25 ou 33 kg. As ovelhas mais cordeiros foram distribuídos em três métodos de alimentação: M 1 -Silagem de milho e concentrado, apenas aos cordeiros até o desmame, aos 60 dias; M 2 - Silagem de milho e concentrado, apenas aos cordeiros até o desmame, aos 45 dias e M 3 - Silagem de milho e concentrado para ovelha mais cordeiro até o desmame com 60 dias. Após o desmame, os cordeiros receberam silagem mais concentrado. Foi utilizado um delineamento inteiramente casualizado em arranjo fatorial 3 x 2 x 2 (3 métodos, 2 sexos e 2 pesos de abate). A determinação do crescimento foi obtida através da equação log y = log. a + b log. x, utilizando-se o logaritmo do peso de osso, músculo e gordura em função do logaritmo do peso do corte. Observou-se que o osso do pescoço e da costela foram precoce (b 1) independente de sexo e método de alimentação com coeficientes de alometria variando de 1, 78 a 2, 15 (pescoço) e 1, 51 a 1, 65 (costela). Na paleta, o osso foi precoce em ambos os sexos, com coeficientes de alometria variando de 0, 76 a 0, 79 e 0, 54 a 0, 58 respectivamente para machos e fêmeas. O músculo apresentou crescimento isométrico (b= 1), independente de sexo e peso de abate. A gordura foi tardia (b> 1) independente de peso de abate e sexo, com coeficientes de alometria variando de 1, 80 a 2, 12.

The experiment {{aimed at}} studying the allometric {{growth of the}} different tissues of neck, rib, shoulder blade and leg {{in relation to the}} cutting weight of male and female lambs. Twenty-two intact Texel males and 23 Texel females were used. Seven of them were slaughtered {{at the beginning of the}} experiment and the others at the weight of 25 or 33 kg. Sheep and lambs were distributed into three methods of feeding: M 1 - Corn silage and concentrate, only to lambs until weaning at 60 days old; M 2 - Corn silage and concentrate, only to lambs until weaning at 45 days old and M 3 - Corn silage and concentrate to ewe and lamb until weaning at 60 days old. After weaning, lambs were fed with silage plus concentrate. A completely randomized design outlined in a factorial arrangement 3 x 2 x 2 (3 methods, 2 sexes and 2 slaughter weights) was used. Determination of growth was obtained through the equation log y = log. a + b log. x, by using the logarithm of bone, muscle and fat weight in function of cutting weight logarithm. It was observed that neck and rib bone was precocious (b 1), regardless of sex and feeding method with allometry coefficients varying from 1. 78 to 2. 15 (neck) and 1. 51 to 1. 65 (rib). In shoulder blade, bone was precocious in both sexes, with allometry coefficients varying from 0. 76 to 0. 79 and 0. 54 to 0. 58 for males and females, respectively. Muscle presented isometric growth (b = 1), regardless of sex and <b>slaughter</b> weight. <b>Fat</b> was late (b> 1), regardless of slaughter weight and sex, with allometry coefficients varying from 1. 80 to 2. 12.

After the carcasses were jointed into commercial cuts, the joints {{of the left}} side were dissected into lean, bone and fat. Dressing percentage was significantly higher in Bunaji carcasses (52. 5 %) than in Sokoto Gudali carcasses (50. 3 %). The lean percentage was nearly constant at 68 - 69 % at all <b>slaughter</b> weights whereas <b>fat</b> percentage increased from 10. 3 at 250 kg to 14. 5 at 350 kg. Bone percentage was inversely related to fat percentage. The relative growth coefficients of muscle and fat were 1. 28 and 1. 80, whereas that of bone was 0. 59. Sigrlificant changes in proportion of carcass parts and tissues were observed with increased slaughter weight. The propor-tion of hind decreased and that of back and belly increased, while chuck and shank remained relatively unchanged. Lean percentage was relatively unchanged by slaughter weight in all carcass parts except the chuck where it increased. The greatest increase in fat percentage was in the belly (7. 6 %) followed in decreasing order by the back (5. 4 %), shank (4. 9 %), hind (3. 0 %) and chuck (1. 8 %).

The control group (K) amounted to pigs fed with a complete mixtures, while the experimental group (D) - was fed a mixture with the participation of silage from steamed potatoes (26 % DM). The mixtures were prepared {{on the basis of their}} own cereal pellets and a concentrate. Fattening animals started at body weight of about 30 kg and continued to the average body weight of about 115 kg. The body weight of animals and the quantity of the consumed feed mixtures were recorded during the fattening period. Meatiness of carcasses was evaluated according to the current classification of the EUROP apparatus IM- 03. The analysis has been subjected to the following features: total weight gain, fattening period, average daily weight gain, slaughter age and consumption of feed during the fattening and slaughter features: warm carcass weight, <b>slaughter</b> efficiency, <b>fat</b> thickness, the depth of loin muscle and meat content in the carcass. The assessment also includes: the sales value of porker in accordance with the evaluation of their carcasses according to the EUROP and the cost of feeding porker during the whole period of fattening. It has been shown that the pigs in group K had a higher growth rate and earlier reached the slaughter weight than pigs from group D (P< 0. 01), whereas group D demonstrated a lower feed consumption. Group K was characterized by thinner backfat, higher loin muscle and higher meatiness than the carcasses of pigs from the group D (P< 0. 01). Carcasses of finishers from the group K were qualified to the most valuable classes S, E, U whereas group D to class E, U, R and O. Lower costs of porker production were shows in group D, whereas in the group K a higher value from the sale was attained.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to optimize emu oil production by manipulation of the dietary protein and energy ratios for greater fat accretion. The research was done at African Emu Ranch in Muldersdrift, Gauteng. Twenty-four, four to five months old emu birds were randomly allocated to three dietary protein treatments, namely a standard control diet containing 170 g crude protein (CP) or a 140 and 200 CP/kg diet, all with similar metabolizable energy content. Proximate analyses were done on representative samples of the diets to confirm the nutrient composition based on AOAC techniques. Water and feed were given ad libitum. The feeding trial spanned eight weeks. The birds were <b>slaughtered</b> and <b>fat</b> yield, anatomical and histological parameters, volatile fatty acid production and carcass weights were recorded. The fat was analyzed for lipid content and composition by means of gas chromatography. Growth rates and average weight gains of the birds in different treatments did not differ. The average dressed out carcass weights for 140, 170 and 200 g CP/kg groups were 16. 75, 18. 65 and 19. 11 kg respectively and differed between treatments. The 200 g CP diet yielded the heaviest carcasses and highest dressing percentage. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations did not differ between dietary treatments. Acetic acid was the most abundant volatile fatty acid in the distal and proximal intestines. The highest concentration of acetic acid was found in the distal ileum. A small volume of iso-butyric acid was detected in the distal ileum. Total average fat yields for the 140, 170 and 200 g CP groups were 4. 1, 4. 2 and 4. 4 kg respectively, but fat yields did not differ between treatments. The long-chain fatty acid composition of the fat did not differ between treatment groups and consisted of saturated fatty acids (27. 74 %), monounsaturated fatty acids (51. 80 %), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (20. 45 %). Fatty acid composition did not differ between different anatomical fat depots in the carcass. The total mean of lipid produced in the omental and subcutaneous locations were 82 % and 92. 5 % respectively. The results suggest that optimum emu oil production can be achieved by feeding diets with a low protein (optimum level of 140 g) to energy ratio. South African Emu Association (SAEA...|$|R

The animals were slaughtered as they reached the pre-defined SFT of 2. 00, 3. 00, and 4. 00 mm, evaluated by ultrasonography. Lambs slaughtered with 4. 00 mm SFT had a heavier shoulder (1. 80 kg) and leg (2. 99 kg), differing from those slaughtered with 2. 00 mm. No significant differences were observed (P > 0. 05) between the treatments for the percentages of muscle in the cuts, which averaged 48. 38 % for the neck, 58. 71 % for the shoulder, 43. 87 % for the ribs, 53. 56 % for the loin, and 64. 52 % for the leg.

In both experiments, RFI was calculated as the difference between actual DMI and predicted DMI. Results for the first objective indicated that RTU {{can be used to}} estimate cKFd, KPH weight and total internal fat (IFAT). Prediction equations developed to predict IFAT had R 2 that ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 97 (P < 0. 05).

In the present study, oral administration of hydrocortisone-acetate (HCA) was used to elevate cortisol concentrations in pregnant sows to levels also observed after psychological stress. HCA was administered during three different periods of gestation (115 days in pigs) : period 1 : 21 ¿ 50 (P 1, n = 10), period 2 : 51 ¿ 80 (P 2, n = 10) and period 3 : 81 ¿ 110 (P 3, n = 10) days after insemination. Control sows (n = 11) received vehicle from 21 ¿ 110 days after insemination. When P 1 -, P 2 - and P 3 -sows did not receive HCA, they also received vehicle. During gestation, weekly saliva samples were taken from the sows to determine salivary cortisol concentrations. Treatment effects on sow, litter and piglet characteristics were determined. In addition, two female piglets per litter were subjected to an ACTH-challenge test at 6 weeks of age to determine the adrenocortical response to ACTH. Pigs were slaughtered at 6 months of age and <b>slaughter</b> weight, back <b>fat</b> thickness and percentage of lean meat were analysed. During the period of treatment with HCA, salivary cortisol concentrations were increased in P 1 -, P 2 - and P 3 -sows compared to control sows (P 0. 30), but pooled HCA-litters had a higher percentage of live born piglets (P < 0. 05) and fewer mummies than control litters (P < 0. 05). Gestation length did not differ among treatment groups (P = 0. 21), but did affect treatment effects on birth weight. Overall, HCA-piglets weighed less at birth, and remained lighter until weaning (P < 0. 05). The salivary cortisol concentrations after i. m. injection of ACTH (2. 5 IU/kg) were lower in P 1 - and P 3 -piglets compared to control piglets. At slaughter, HCA-treatment indirectly decreased lean meat percentage and increased back fat thickness. In conclusion, elevated peripheral cortisol concentrations in pregnant sows affect both litter characteristics and piglet physiology, the latter depending on the period of gestation during which concentrations were elevated.
