5|$|Because of {{the smoke}} the commanders of the <b>second</b> <b>line</b> of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the <b>second</b> <b>line</b> did not send reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} of the <b>second</b> <b>line</b> gave limited {{support to the}} outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the <b>second</b> <b>line,</b> could have supported the forts of the first line, {{but he could not}} see what was happening in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E

5|$|A <b>second</b> <b>line,</b> {{from the}} Boeing Everett Factory to Mill Creek and Bothell via State Route 527, is in development, and is {{expected}} to open in 2019 as the Green Line. Long-range plans adopted by Community Transit include Swift trunk lines replacing its most popular corridors by 2030, feeding into future Link Light Rail stations at Lynnwood Transit Center and Everett Station.|$|E
5|$|Already {{before the}} battle Paskevich {{achieved}} devastating numerical superiority {{on the western}} front. The first Russian line facing Wola had 30,200 soldiers, 144 pieces of artillery and eight mortars; the <b>second</b> <b>line</b> was formed by 39,200 soldiers and 196 pieces of artillery. Facing them were 5,300 infantry, 65 cannons and 1,100 cavalry under Dembiński, with another 4,800 soldiers in reserve.|$|E
50|$|The third line {{is often}} called the {{checking}} line, and is generally made up of more defensively oriented forwards and grinders. This line is often played against an opponent's first or <b>second</b> <b>lines</b> {{in an effort to}} reduce their scoring, and physically wear them down. The third line adds less offense than the first or <b>second</b> <b>lines,</b> but generally more than the fourth.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the appeal}} of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury {{commissioned}} a <b>second</b> <b>line</b> of editions in an 'adult' style. These initially used black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people, but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin's locket {{on the cover of the}} final book.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 off-season, the Canucks signed {{free agent}} Loui Eriksson {{to be the}} Sedins' new linemate. As a result, Hansen started the 2016–17 season on the <b>second</b> <b>line</b> with Markus Granlund and Brandon Sutter. Hansen scored his 100th career NHL goal on 20 October 2016; against Robin Lehner in a 2–1 win over the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E

5|$|On 28 March the brigade, {{reinforced}} by the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion ICCB, tried to capture Hill 3039 south-west of Amman. The attack failed and further attempts were postponed until after nightfall. The night assault began at 02:00; two troops of the 9th Squadron {{were involved in the}} <b>second</b> <b>line</b> to protect the left flank. The attack was successful and the brigade commenced improvements to the defences in order to withstand any counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|Operation Badr {{called for}} an {{enlargement}} of the bridgeheads on October 8. To accomplish this, {{each of the five}} infantry divisions had to reorganize its forces. Mechanized infantry brigades in the second echelon of divisional lines were to advance between the two forward infantry brigades. Thus the mechanized brigade would form the first line, the two infantry brigades would form the <b>second</b> <b>line,</b> and the reserve armored brigade would constitute a third echelon.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 season saw the Canucks sign {{free agent}} Radim Vrbata, who {{replaced}} Burrows as the Sedins' primary linemate. Burrows would play {{only a handful}} of games with the Sedins; mainly {{in the latter part of}} the season. Playing mainly on the <b>second</b> <b>line,</b> Burrows tallied 18 goals and 15 assists in 70 games.|$|E

5|$|The Italian Army {{force in}} the area of Primosole Bridge came from the 213 Coastal Division {{commanded}} by General Carlo Gotti. Coastal divisions were <b>second</b> <b>line</b> divisions, usually formed from men in their forties and fifties, and were intended to perform labour or other <b>second</b> <b>line</b> duties. Recruited from the local population, their officers were mostly men who had retired but had then been called up again. Their morale was low, not least because of their second rate equipment and weapons. It had been intended to improve their armaments with equipment seized from the recently disbanded Vichy French army, but when the arms arrived in Sicily, many of them had been made unusable, and some had the wrong type of ammunition or no ammunition at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} triarii {{were reduced to}} 600 per legion, forming 10 maniples of 60 men each. The triarii still made up the third line in the legion, behind {{the front line of}} hastati and the <b>second</b> <b>line</b> of principes, but the rorarii and accensi were phased out. Leves had been {{replaced}} with velites, who had a similar role but were also attached to principes and triarii.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} of the Territorial Force battalions {{was laid}} down by War Office instructions issued in 1914 and 1915. On joining the Territorial Force men {{were asked if they}} would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called first line battalions. Home service men were placed in <b>second</b> <b>line</b> battalions. Thus there would now be a first line 5th Battalion and a <b>second</b> <b>line</b> 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the first line battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the first line battalion was on foreign service. In January 1915 these designations were simplified and the battalions called the 1/5th, 2/5th and 3/5th battalions respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914 saw {{the bulk of the}} changes put to the test; the Expeditionary Force of six divisions was quickly sent to the Continent, whilst a Territorial Force of 14 divisions and Reserves were mobilised as planned to provide a <b>second</b> <b>line.</b> The mobilisation was carried out punctually and the divisions were armed.|$|E
