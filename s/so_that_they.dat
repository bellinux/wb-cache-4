"It won't {{be easy to}} find a {{suitable}} place to camp on," [...] remarked Nigel, glancing at the bank, where the bushes grew <b>so</b> thick <b>that</b> <b>they</b> overhung the water, brushing the faces of our travellers and rendering the darkness <b>so</b> intense <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had literally to feel their way as they glided along.|$|R

5000|$|Tony Rayns of Film Comment wrote that, unlike Tsai's {{previous}} films, Stray Dogs [...] "does away {{almost completely}} with continuity editing.

5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the Sun at a semi-major axis {{greater than that of}} Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit.

5|$|Return to HorrorLand, {{a sequel}} to {{the book and the}} thirteenth book of the series Goosebumps Series 2000, was {{released}} in 1999. Lizzy, Luke, and Clay revisit HorrorLand, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can attempt to close the theme park.|$|E
5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor {{to defend against}} the same and nothing more, and a high top speed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could get away from slower but much better armored capital ships.|$|E

5|$|The hook (α) {{angle is}} a {{parameter}} {{of the material}} being cut. For steel, it is between 15 and 20° and for cast iron it is between 6 and 8°.

The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were utterly defeated.|$|E
