5000|$|On {{the second}} level of a typical breaker, coal would be roughly sorted. The fuel would move over sorting bars, with the various sizes of coal going down {{different}} chutes. Each type of roughly sorted coal would next pass over a [...] "slate-picker screen" [...] (sometimes called a [...] "mud screen"), with the generally round coal falling through the screen and the flat slate passing over the screen to fall down a chute to the culm pile. Coal passing through the slate-picker screen would then be sorted by additional screens. Some of these second screens were composed of flat iron perforated by holes of larger size toward the rear (where the coal entered) and smaller holes toward the front. These flat screens were sometimes shaken back and forth (hence the name [...] "shaking screens"), which not only removed dirt and sulphur from the coal but broke down larger lumps of coal into smaller sizes and sorted it for further cleaning and processing. Other screens were cylindrical, making 10 revolutions per minute and performing the same function as <b>shaking</b> <b>screen.</b> Flat and cylindrical screens could be single-jacketed (a single screen) or double-jacketed (two screens, the first or inner screen having larger openings while the second screen had smaller ones).|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of the}} separating system of a self–propelled peanut harvester by analyzing the relationship between a <b>shaking</b> <b>screen</b> and rotational speeds of winnowing. The <b>shaking</b> <b>screen</b> was manufactured to have rotational speeds of 370, 470, 570 rpm and winnowing was manufactured to have rotational speeds of 1, 500, 1, 760, 2, 020 rpm by adjusting the pitch circle diameter of each pulley. The sample was prepared based on the yields of an actual self–propelled peanut harvester and analyzed with Statistical Analysis Software after measuring the weight of peanuts and stems. The stem separation ratio was high as 95. 3 % when rotational speeds were 570 rpm (<b>shaking</b> <b>screen)</b> and 2, 020 rpm (winnowing). The peanut loss ratio was low as 0 % when rotational speeds were 370 rpm (<b>shaking</b> <b>screen)</b> and 1, 500 rpm (winnowing). The results indicated that the stem separation ratio was improved with high rotational speeds of <b>shaking</b> <b>screen</b> and winnowing; the peanut loss ratio was reduced with low rotational speeds of <b>shaking</b> <b>screen</b> and winnowing. However, the rotational speed of winnowing did not influence on the peanut loss ratio; as a result, separation performance was improved with low rotational speed of <b>shaking</b> <b>screen</b> and high rotational speed of winnowing.

50|$|The aim {{of barley}} {{cleaning}} {{is to remove}} foreign matter (straw, chaff, dust and thin corns) found in the incoming grain, leaving only the grain most likely to produce a good malt. Magnets are used to remove metals from the grain, in turn reducing the possibility of sparks, {{which could lead to}} a dust explosion. Rotating and shaking sieves are used to remove unwanted foreign matter either larger (straw and un-threshed ears) or smaller (sand and thin corns) than the normal barley grain. During the sieving process an aspiration system removes the dust and chaff. De-stoners or <b>shaking</b> <b>screens</b> are used to separate small stones from the barley. The stones, which are more dense than the barley, move out the top of the machine and the cleaned barley exits at the bottom. Half corn separators may be used to remove broken kernels. Half kernels need to be removed as only the one half will germinate and produce enzymes. At the end of the cleaning process the grain is weighed to determine the cleaning losses (the difference between the weight of grain received and the weight of the grain after cleaning) and it is transferred to a silo for storage.|$|R
40|$|Issue: The {{production}} processes {{used to make}} ground or crumb rubber usually produce a range of particle sizes. It is necessary to sort and classify the ground rubber for use. This is accomplished using various screening techniques. This best practice will review some of the common methods {{that are used to}} sort and separate ground rubber. Best Practice: There are many manufacturers of equipment for sorting and classifying ground rubber. They are all based on some type of rotating, vibrating, or <b>shaking</b> <b>screen.</b> The type found to be the most useful for dry screening uses an up and down shaking motion while a scrubbing motion is also occurring. The most well known manufacturer is Rotex. These machines are employed in many rubber recycle operations. In addition there are vibrating screens, rotor sifter screens, and variations of all these techniques. The rotor sifter screen is particularly effective for wet screening. The output for the screen is based on the particle size of the rubbers being screened and the surface area of the screen. The larger the surface area of the screen, the higher the yield and the larger the particle size, the higher the output. Screens are most effective when sorting 10 to 40 mesh ground rubber. A typical yield is 1000 pounds per hour. At the smaller mesh sizes the yield falls off dramatically. On the very fine particles, smaller than 100 mesh screens are ineffective. The general cost of a screening system is $ 15, 000 to $ 20, 000 (U. S.), except for the Rotex equipment. It costs $ 30, 000 to $ 40, 000 (U. S.) and for large systems $ 60, 000 to $ 80, 000 (U. S.). Implementation: To get started one must purchase a screen or contract the service. The Scrap Tire Directory lists some suppliers of screens...|$|E
50|$|The modern coal breaker can {{be traced}} to 1844. Joseph Battin, a {{supervisor}} at a coal gas manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, invented the first coal breaker—two cast iron rollers (one with teeth, one with holes to accept the teeth) through which the coal was crushed before it rolled down a chute and then through an inclined cylindrical screen. The screen had a mesh which was fine toward the front and became progressively less so toward the end. Larger chunks of coal, falling inside the cylinder as it rotated, broke up and eventually passed through the screen. Impurities, which were heavier, tended to exit the breaker {{at the end of the}} screen. The sorted coal would then be collected in bins below the screen, and transported to market. A fellow Pennsylvanian, Gideon Bast, licensed the technology from Battin, and erected the first commercial coal breaker in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, on February 28, 1844. A number of coal processing machines—such as rollers, crushers, washers, and screens—were developed in Europe and later utilized in the United States. By 1866, the coal breaker in the United States had taken the form most recognized today, with multiple stories and numerous screening processes and mechanical sorting devices. The first steam-powered <b>shaking</b> <b>screens</b> were used in the U.S. 1890, and the first steam-powered coal washers installed in 1892.|$|R

40|$|Two raven skeletons were {{excavated}} from Charlie Lake Cave, British Columbia, {{in association}} with Paleoindian occupations dated at about 10, 500 and 9500 B. P. The distribution and condition of  the bones, the association with  artifacts, the configuration and location of the site, and data from ethnographic and historic sources contribute to {{the argument that the}} two ravens were deposited deliberately by people.   Article Summary by Jonathan C. Driver, May 2015               This paper emerged from a series of personal experiences I had while working at Tse’K’wa. Fairly late in the 1991 season I was excavating a layer dating to about 9000 BC that didn’t appear to contain any humanly-made artifacts but, like many layers at the site, had a few animal bones scattered through it.   As I was digging I uncovered two bird bones lying in an “articulated” position – in other words, they were in the same relationship to each other as they would be when the bird was alive.   Leaving them in place, I began to dig carefully around them, and soon realized I was uncovering a complete bird skeleton. As I uncovered each bone I drew it onto a plan, numbered it and removed it, so {{by the end of the}} work I mapped an almost complete bird skeleton, with each bone numbered and bagged separately. The final part of the excavation was very delicate, as I uncovered and mapped the individual toe bones. In among the toe bones was a small rock, and as I removed it I realized that it was a rather unusual stone artifact known as a “microblade core”.   Made of very fine-grained stone, ancient people had carried it around so they could remove small, parallel sided flakes of stone, which could then be hafted in a variety of handles – rather like blades of utility knives that we use today. This technology is so distinctive that archaeologists make special note when it appears. The bird skeleton was lying in a small hollow, either natural or humanly made, so it appeared that someone had placed the dead bird in the hollow, with an artifact at its feet, and then covered it up so that it would not be disturbed.             As we excavated even deeper levels we uncovered a second bird skeleton, scattered across about a square metre. Although it was older by at least 1000 years, it was even better preserved. We also mapped the bones of this skeleton as they emerged, and confirmed that we had a second bird that seemed to have been buried as a complete individual.             During excavation seasons one is always concerned about getting as much done in the days available, so I didn’t spend much time trying to identify these birds. I assumed that once I was able to study the bones they would turn out to be some kind of waterfowl because remains of ducks and grebes are quite common at Tse’K’wa. Once I got back to the university at the end of the summer one of the first things I did was to check on the identification, and I quickly realized we had uncovered two raven skeletons.             For anyone living in British Columbia the connection between ravens and First Nations people is well known. Bill Reid’s massive cedar sculpture at the UBC Museum of Anthropology of Raven opening a clam shell is visited by tens of thousands of people every year, and his Jade Canoe, steered by Raven, is seen by millions at the Vancouver airport. Elementary school children all read stories about Raven the trickster.             This connection to BC’s First Nations would be reason enough to get excited, but I had a personal connection to ravens and Tse’K’wa that caused shivers to run up my spine as I made the identification of the bird skeletons in the bone lab. When we had finished our excavations in 1991 I spent a morning at the site by myself, mainly down in the bottom of the deep excavation finalizing some of the drawings, checking measurements and just thinking about the site before we started backfilling on the following day. It had been very quiet in the excavation hole, too deep to hear traffic noise from the Alaska Highway, no comments from an excavation crew, no scraping of trowels on rock, and no rattling as sediments were <b>shaken</b> through the <b>screens.</b> My companions throughout that morning were a pair of ravens who hung around the site, talking to each other and, as I liked to think, talking to me as well.   My experience with the ravens that morning filled my thoughts as soon as I had confirmed the identification of the bones.             I knew that there was a story to tell about the buried ravens, but it took me a while to sort it out, and quite a long time to get it accepted for publication. Like most scholars, archaeologists are most comfortable with the familiar. No one had found any evidence in North America for ritual behaviour this early, other than very rare human burials, and reviewers were reluctant to accept the interpretation that these two ravens were placed deliberately by people. I found this somewhat frustrating because the other region in which I work – the American Southwest – has thousands of examples dating from more recent times of “special” birds (mainly eagles, hawks, owls and parrots) found as complete skeletons. Often times these remains are {{in association with}}  buildings identified as places of ceremonial or ritual activity for ancestral Native Americans. Tse’K’wa clearly would have a been a special place on the landscape, and both caves and ravens have all kinds of spiritual importance around the world. Why was it so difficult for other scholars to accept that the combination of complete skeletons, a special place, and culturally significant birds  suggest that Tse’K’wa was a sacred location to the First Nations people who visited the site many years ago?              Eventually I was able to convince the editor of American Antiquity – arguably the best archaeology journal in North America – that there would never be agreement amongst reviewers. Some thought my manuscript was too speculative, and others thought it was worth publishing.             The published paper describes the location, configuration and age of the skeletons. It briefly describes the importance of ravens in cultures around the world. They are often seen as messengers, and are frequently connected to hunting. In some parts of North America Raven is both creator and trickster who has many human qualities.             I also noted that Tse’K’wa was likely a prominent feature of the landscape, not only because of the cave, but also because there was a very large vertical stone monolith in front of the cave that would have been much more visible than today. Caves are often entrances to the underworld, and the placing of spiritually important birds right in front of the cave mouth may suggest that they were seen as capable of communicating between the world of the living and the world of the spirits...|$|R
