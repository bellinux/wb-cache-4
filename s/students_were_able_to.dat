25|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more socially open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was {{less expensive and}} the student body more representative of society as a whole. Humbler students were aided by a system of bursaries established for the training of the clergy. In this period residence became divorced from the colleges and <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> live much more cheaply and largely unsupervised, at home, with friends or in lodgings in the university towns. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress.

25|$|Kalmanowitz is {{credited}} with securing the funds and papers to transfer the entire Mir yeshiva – consisting of 250 students, faculty members, and the yeshiva's entire library of sefarim – to Kobe, Japan in 1941 {{and from there to}} Shanghai, and providing for its upkeep for five years. Thanks to the money Kalmanowitz sent, Mir <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> board with Jewish families and eat a nourishing Shabbat meal most of the time – privileges that other refugee students in Shanghai did not enjoy. In addition to money, Kalmanowitz sent matzos and wine for Passover, and hundreds of copies of Talmudic tractates so the students could continue studying without interruption. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the U.S. declared war on Japan, the Joint was prohibited from sending money to the yeshiva students in Shanghai. But Kalmanowitz established new contacts and influenced U.S. government officials to tacitly approve the sending of funds from the U.S. to Japan via neutral Switzerland. At war's end, Kalmanowitz obtained visas and travel fare to bring all the Mir students and faculty by ship to San Francisco and by train to New York; the last Mir refugee left Shanghai in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The re-emergence of Botany in {{the medieval}} world came about during the sixteenth century. As part of the revival of {{classical}} medicine, {{one of the biggest}} areas of interest was materia medica: the study of remedial substances. “Italian humanists in the fifteenth century had recovered and translated ancient Greek botanical texts which had been unknown in the West in the Middle Ages or relatively ignored”. Soon after the rise in interest in botany, universities such as Padua and Bologna started to create programs and fields of study; some of these practices including setting up gardens so that <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> collect and examine plants. “Botany was also a field in which printing made a tremendous impact, through the development of naturalistic illustrated herbals”. During this time period, university practices were highly concerned with the philosophical matters of study in sciences and the liberal arts, “but by the sixteenth century both scholastic discussion of plants and reliance upon intermediary compendia for plant names and descriptions were increasingly abandoned in favor of direct study of the original texts of classical authors and efforts to reconcile names, descriptions, and plants in nature”. Botanist expanded their knowledge of different plant remedies, seeds, bulbs, uses of dried and living plants through continuous interchange made possible by printing. In sixteenth century medicine, botany was rapidly becoming a lively and fast-moving discipline that held wide universal appeal in the world of doctors, philosophers, and pharmacists.|$|E

The concept of affirmative action was understood by both female and male students and by instructors. Seventy-five female students received leadership and assertiveness training. These students actively participated in group work, used the café equally with male students, were successful in exams and were training new female students. Female students were trained in assertiveness, life skills and reproductive health issues. The result was increased ability to say [...] "No", campus living became easier since they could walk alone to the dining room, study areas and around campus, {{and the number of}} abortions decreased. Gender consciousness was raised and female <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> protect themselves from HIV/AIDS. Extra cash and materials were provided for needy female students preventing withdrawal for economic reasons. All new female students received an orientation program for university life and high achieving female students were given an award by the university president. Attrition rate decreased from 24% to 3.5% and the number of high achieving female students increased from 40 to 145. The future plan is to raise awareness of gender issues in staff throughout the university and to develop an anti-sexual harassment and misconduct policy.|$|E
