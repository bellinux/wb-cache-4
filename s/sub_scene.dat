40|$|The <b>sub</b> <b>scene,</b> {{an online}} {{community}} for creating and distributing subtitle files for pirated movies and TV series, is a culture wherein {{the knowledge of}} a number of contributors is pooled. I describe the cultural and social protocols that shape the <b>sub</b> <b>scene,</b> with a focus on the linguistic and social exchange that characterizes this particular networked public. Analysis of the linguistic exchange shows that the <b>sub</b> <b>scene</b> is about networked collaboration, but one under a relatively strict social code. The analysis of the social exchange is structured according to Quentin Jones's definition of a virtual settlement. There is a minimum level of interactivity, as well as a variety of communicators, on the <b>sub</b> <b>scene.</b> It can also be described as a virtual common public place where computer-mediated interaction takes place, both in the form of coordination networks and of expert/user networks. Furthermore, it has a minimum level of sustained membership. The culture of the <b>sub</b> <b>scene</b> simultaneously bears characteristics of socialized and alienated cyberculture, which should not be perceived as a contradiction. The development of Internet culture is always happening within the full complexity of society as a whole, and the interplay between unity and discord must be seen {{as the basis for the}} social integration of any group...|$|E
30|$|The DGRSA {{inherits}} all {{the advantages}} of EGRSA. It {{can also be used}} in any scene as long as divide the scene into subscenes like the Manhattan scene and use DGRSA in each <b>sub</b> <b>scene</b> separately. Besides, if vehicle density in a subscene is nonuniform, the DGRSA is still expected to perform well in the aspects of reliability and resource utilization. Because it can adjust the areas which reuse the same sub resource pool and the size of corresponding sub resource pool based on vehicle density.|$|E
40|$|As Landsat TM {{data size}} for one full scene has about 300 Mbytes, {{the data are}} memorized in three volumes of the {{computer}} compatible tape. In general, the analysis for the large scale remote sensing data forces {{the use of the}} large computer system with the magnetic tape unit on us. Therefore, the low cost and easy analysis system for the remote sensing data is now desired. In this paper, a system to analyze the large scale remote sensing data was studied and developed by the personal computer. The authors introduced the optical magneto disk drive system to the external memory of the personal computer. The transfer tests of the large scale remote sensing data were carried out through the ethernet system from the magnetic tape to the optical magneto disk. The total transfer time for the full scene of TM data needed about 9 hours, and one for the sub-scene (90 Mbytes) needed about 2 hours and 45 minutes. If we consider the advantage to be able to access the large scale remote sensing data with the personal computer, it is not so long time. Further, a software to handle the large scale remote sensing data, which was memorized in the optical magneto disk, was developed by the personal computer. The software developed consists of the main utility programs as follows : (1) Read out the TM data from the optical magneto disk. (2) Reference image display with full color for full or <b>sub</b> <b>scene</b> of TM. (3) Clipping of study area on the full or <b>sub</b> <b>scene</b> image. (4) Classification of study area with minimum distance method. The system and the software developed may offer the easy data handling for the huge remote sensing data by the personal computer...|$|E
30|$|With {{eliminating}} the boundary interference, we can divide any <b>scene</b> into several <b>sub</b> <b>scenes</b> like the Manhattan urban scene {{and use the}} EGRSA in every subscene separately. Therefore, although the EGRSA is designed and illustrated in Manhattan urban scene, {{it is able to}} be used in any scene actually. This advantage makes the EGRSA applicable in more general scenes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The MODerate {{resolution}} Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) is {{consisted of}} cross-track scan mirror and linear arrays of ten detectors. Because 1) the abnormal {{behavior of the}} response of each detector, 2) optical cross–talk and shortwave infrared thermal leak, and 3) reflectance, emissivity, or polarization of each scan mirror side are the cause of artificial strips appearing in the images. The histogram modification algorithm by Weinreb 1989 {{seemed to be the}} most promising way in correcting the strip noise. It is based on an assumption that each sensor view a statistically similar <b>sub</b> <b>scenes.</b> However, undesirable side-effect of Weinreb’s algorithm arise from the certain cases which are statistical differences sensitivity in the image data recorded by the individual detectors, and detector saturation generates stripe. In this paper, the modification of Weinreb’s algorithm was developed and implemented by acquiring image statistics from homogeneous subimages and removing saturated strip by a method based on local gray tone statistics from the facet model...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometric (AVHRR) and Special Sensor Microwave imager (SSM/I) imagery are compared {{to determine the}} areal extent of snow. A multi-spectral AVHRR algorithm, utilizing channels 1 (0. 6 um), 2 8. 76 um), 3 (3. 7 um) and 4 (11. 0 um), creates a synthetic image that classifies land, snow, water and clouds. The classified images created by this algorithm serve as a baseline for a second algorithms that examines spatially and temporally matched SSM/I imagery. The SSM/I separation algorithm uses the 85 GHz horizontally polarized channel {{as well as the}} 37 GHz horizontally and vertically polarized channels. The synthetic image created by this algorithm classifies land, snow and water. Both separation algorithms use empirically derived separation thresholds obtained from bi-spectral scatter plots. Separation is made at a given pixel location based on the radiative identity assigned to that location from various wavelength combinations. The AVHRR data provides high resolution, daytime images of the snow pack but is completely dependent on the absence of clouds to view this ground based feature. The SSM/I data gives lower resolution imagery of the snow during daylight or night time satellite passes and is not affected by the presence of non-precipitating clouds. A total of 12 <b>sub</b> <b>scenes</b> are analyzed using both data sets and general agreement of the two sets of imagery is established.
