40|$|Severe {{droughts}} strongly impact photosynthesis (GPP), {{and satellite}} imagery {{has yet to}} demonstrate its ability to detect drought effects. Especially changes in vegetation functioning when vegetation state remains unaltered (no browning or defoliation) pose a challenge to satellite-derived indicators. We evaluated the performance of different <b>satellite</b> <b>indicators</b> to detect strong drought effects on GPP in a beech forest in France (Hesse), where vegetation state remained largely unaffected while GPP decreased substantially. We compared the results with three additional sites: a Mediterranean holm oak forest (Puéchabon), a temperate beech forest (Hainich), and a semi-arid grassland (Bugacpuszta). [br/] In Hesse, a three-year reduction in GPP following drought was detected only by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) also detected this drought effect, but only after normalization for absorbed light. In Puéchabon normalized PRI outperformed the other indicators, while the short-term drought effect in Hainich was not detected by any tested indicator. [br/]In contrast, most indicators, but not PRI, captured the drought effects in Bugacpuszta. Hence, PRI improved detection of drought effects on GPP in forests and we propose that PRI normalized for absorbed light is considered in future algorithms to estimate GPP from space...|$|R
40|$|In {{research}} and development of inkjet print heads, characterizing ink drops in flight is often done using high-speed video and image analysis techniques. However, such characterization techniques have limited use in production quality control because of limitations in measurement accuracy, reproducibility and speed. Furthermore, the techniques offer no opportunity to observe the interaction of ink and media, well recognized as a determining factor in inkjet print quality. A more practical alternative for inkjet head quality control is to examine print quality using a well-designed test pattern printed on selected media. Print quality measurements typically quantify the accuracy of dot placement, the relative positions of dots projected from multiple nozzles, and dot size and shape. Also quantified are the absence of dots and the presence of <b>satellites,</b> <b>indicators</b> of faulty jetting. If implemented properly, the print quality methodology described can yield critical information not only for final product acceptance, but also for process control and continuous product improvement. Discussed here are the general design requirements for this type of test system, a design methodology for the test targets, data reduction and analysis methods, and system calibration issues. Performance results from a commercial system are also critically examined...|$|R

In this study the Atmosphere-land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model was used. The ALEXI model uses the morning surface temperature (LST) rise and provides information on the surface moisture status. In this paper correlations between yields and <b>satellite</b> <b>indicators</b> of crop water use or evapotranspiration (ET) were studied for the period 2002 - 2014. Correlations were studied for winter wheat at district scale in Vysocina, Jihomoravsky and Olomoucky regions since winter wheat {{is one of the}} traditional and most important crops grown in these regions. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) was used for these correlations as an ET-based index. Time series of Pearson correlation coefficient (r) computed between ESI and winter wheat yields at district scale were analysed. Strongest correlations are associated with districts within the Southern Moravian lowlands in Jihomoravsky and Olomoucky region, where frequency of occurrence of severe drought was highest over the period of record. Severe drought resulted in significant yield impacts, particularly in years 2003 and 2012. Correlations tend to be lower over the highlands districts of Vysocina and surroundings.

40|$|International audienceAbstractOne of the {{challenges}} of organic crop certification is the efficient targeting of the relatively small percentage of risk-sensitive fields {{that have to be}} controlled during the regulatory annual in situ inspection. A previous study carried out on wheat and maize in Germany has shown that organic and non-organic crops can be efficiently distinguished by remote sensing. That study pointed to the possibility that these techniques could be used for helping organic crop certification bodies to better target risk-sensitive fields. This study is a first adaptation of that research on organic cotton in southwestern Burkina Faso, West Africa. This study assumed that organic and non-organic cotton, primarily because of their different approaches to fertilization and pest control, would result in bio-chemico-physical differences measurable by both in situ and remote sensing indicators. This study included 100 cotton fields, of which 50 were organic, 28 conventional, and 22 genetically modified. In situ indicators were derived from chlorophyll content, canopy cover, height, and spatial heterogeneity measurements. Remote sensing spectral and spatial heterogeneity indicators were derived from two SPOT 5 satellite images. Discriminant models were then computed. The results show statistically highly significant differences between organic and non-organic cotton fields for both in situ and <b>satellite</b> <b>indicators,</b> using univariate and multivariate linear models, with up to 86  % discrimination performance. This {{is the first time that}} the efficiency of using remote sensing to discriminate between organic and non-organic crops is evaluated in a developing country, particularly for cotton, with good discrimination being achieved. Pending further validation, it therefore seems that remote sensing could be used to enhance organic cotton certification in West Africa by enabling more efficient targeting of suspect fields and consequently could contribute to a better development of this sector...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} from ongoing research on spatial variability of fire effects on soils and vegetation from the Black Mountain Two and Cooney Ridge wildfires, which burned in western Montana during the 2003 fire season. Extensive field fractional cover data were sampled to assess the efficacy of quantitative <b>satellite</b> image-derived <b>indicators</b> of burn severity. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the field burn severity measures to the digital numbers used to produce Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) maps. Canopy density was the field variable most highly correlated to BARC data derived from either SPOT Multispectral (XS) or Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Among the other field variables, old litter depth and duff depth correlated better with the satellite data than did old litter cover. Ash cover correlated most poorly. Old litter cover correlated better with the satellite data than did exposed mineral soil or rock cover, but combining the mineral soil and rock cover fractions into a single inorganic cover fraction improved the correlation to a comparable level. Most field variables, with the notable exception of ash, tended to vary more at low and moderate severity sites than at high severity sites. Semivariograms of the field variables revealed spatial autocorrelation across the spatial scales sampled (2 – 130 m), which the 20 m or 30 m resolution satellite imagery only weakly detected. Future analyses will be broadened to quantify burn severity characteristics in other forest types and to consider erosion processes, such as soil water infiltration following fire...|$|R

40|$|Novel data on {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} distribution of fishing effort and population abundance are presented for the market squid fishery (Loligo opalescens) in the Southern California Bight, 1992 − 2000. Fishing effort {{was measured by the}} detection of boat lights by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). Visual confirmation of fishing vessels by nocturnal aerial surveys indicated that lights detected by <b>satellites</b> are reliable <b>indicators</b> of fishing effort. Overall, fishing activity was concentrated off the following Channel Islands: Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Catalina. Fishing activity occurred at depths of 100 m or less. Landings, effort, and squid abundance (measured as landings per unit of effort, LPUE) markedly declined during the 1997 − 98 El Niño; landings and LPUE increased afterwards. Within a fishing season, the location of fishing activity shifted from the northern shores of Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in October, the typical starting date for squid fishing in the Bight, to the southern shores by March, the typical end of the squid season. Light detection by satellites offers a source of fine-scale spatial and temporal data on fishing effort for the market squid fishery off California, and these data can be integrated with environmental data and fishing logbook data {{in the development of a}} management plan...|$|R

On the basis of measurements taken using reference points, DGPS and GPS sys− tems, analyses of aerial photographs and <b>satellite</b> images, geomorphological <b>indicators</b> and archival data their rates of deglaciation following the “Little Ice Age ” (LIA) maximum were calculated variously on centennial, decadal and annual time scales. As most Svalbard glaciers have debris−covered snouts, a clean ice margin was measured {{in the absence of}} de− bris−free ice front. The retreat rates for both types of ice fronts were very similar. All studied glaciers have been retreating since the termination of the Little Ice Age at the end of 19 th century. The fastest retreat rate was observed {{in the case of the}} Nordenskiöldbreen tidewater glacier (mean average linear retreat rate 35 m a– 1). For land−terminating glaciers the rates were in range of 5 to 15 m a– 1. Presumably owing to climate warming, most of the glacier re− treat rates have increased several fold in recent decades. The secondary factors influencing the retreat rates have been identified as: water depth at the grounding line in the case of tide− water glaciers, surging history, altitude, shape and aspect of glacier margin, and bedrock re...|$|R

A significant challenge for satellite image data in coastal and coral reef water bodies is the mixture of both clear and turbid waters. A new approach is presented in this paper to enable production of water quality and substrate cover type maps, linked to a field based coastal ecosystem health indicator monitoring program, for use in turbid to clear coastal and coral reef waters. An optimized optical domain method was applied to map selected water quality (Secchi depth, Kd PAR, tripton, CDOM) and substrate cover type (seagrass, algae, sand) parameters. The approach is demonstrated using commercially available Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data over a coastal embayment exhibiting the range of substrate cover types and water quality conditions commonly found in sub-tropical and tropical coastal environments. Spatially extensive and quantitative maps of selected water quality and substrate cover parameters were produced for the study site. These map products were refined by interactions with management agencies to suit the information requirements of their monitoring and management programs. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Istituto Nazionale per la Fauna Selvatica) The aim of {{this paper}} is to define and {{quantify}} environmental indicators for farmland habitat in Italy. Based on OECD works and recent developments by the Joint Working Party in the area of agrienvironmental indicators, we classify agricultural habitat in three main categories: intensive, semi-natural and uncultivated (natural or man-made) habitats located within, at the border and adjacent of agricultural areas. We discuss the importance of using an appropriate index to quantify the total agricultural land area and compare habitat indicators over different periods of time. For each habitat category, we propose additional or alternative indicators that may contribute to better represent Mediterranean regions and agriecosystems. We compare the definition of semi-natural habitat to alternatives criteria (high nature value farmland habitats, low input agricultural systems, extensive agricultural production systems, etc.) and indicate which might be the most appropriate criterion to quantify indicators for agri-environmental policies evaluation. The critical issue of the minimum dimension of uncultivated (natural or man-made) habitat within farmland ecosystems is also discussed. In line with the OECD approach, we quantified each indicator for the territory of Italy at different periods (from 1970 to 1995), underscoring problems related to data constraints caused by the insufficiency of available national statistics and the use of alternatives instruments of habitats quantification (aerial photos and <b>satellite</b> images).

40|$|Coping {{with the}} issue of water {{scarcity}} and growing competition for water among different sectors requires proper water management strategies and decision processes. A pre-requisite is a clear understanding of the basin hydrological processes, manageable and unmanageable water flows, the interaction with land use and opportunities to mitigate the negative effects and increase the benefits of water depletion on society. Currently, water professionals do not have a common framework that links hydrological flows to user groups of water and their benefits. The absence of a standard hydrological and water management summary is causing confusion and wrong decisions. The non-availability of water flow data is one of the underpinning reasons for not having operational water accounting systems for river basins in place. In this paper we introduce Water Accounting Plus (WA+), which is a new framework designed to provide explicit spatial information on water depletion and net withdrawal processes in complex river basins. The influence of land use on the water cycle is described explicitly by defining land use groups with common characteristics. Analogous to financial accounting, WA+ presents four sheets including (i) a resource base sheet, (ii) a consumption sheet, (iii) a productivity sheet, and (iv) a withdrawal sheet. Every sheet encompasses a set of indicators that summarize the overall water resources situation. The impact of external (e. g. climate change) and internal influences (e. g. infrastructure building) can be estimated by studying the changes in these WA+ <b>indicators.</b> <b>Satellite</b> measurements can be used for 3 out of the 4 sheets, but is not a precondition for implementing WA+ framework.

Thispaper demonstrates the use of wetland area derived from analysis of high-resolution <b>satellite</b> imageryas an <b>indicator</b> of groundwater flow from springs in the GAB. The method developed was tested on threespring groups in South Australia, encompassing a diversity of spring forms, spatial extents, geomor-phic and hydrogeological settings. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was computedfrom QuickBird and WorldView- 2 satellite imagery captured to coincide with ground-based vegetationcover and spring discharge measurements. Significant linear relationships were established betweenimage NDVI and ground-based vegetation cover, and from these relationships NDVI thresholds weredetermined to delineate GAB-fed wetlands from surrounding dryland vegetation. There were strong lin-ear relationships between NDVI-derived wetland areas and spring flow rate measurements for selectedsprings (R 2 = 0. 92 to 0. 99). Although there were some differences in this relationship for the three sites,they were not statistically significant. This research demonstrates a relationship between surface flowrate and wetland area that is transferable to a range of GAB springs, which vary in spatial scale, outflowrates, surface form, geomorphic setting and vegetation composition. The technique provides an objective,quantitative and accurate means of documenting the distribution and extent of spring-fed wetlands: arelatively consistent NDVI threshold can be used to differentiate wetland from dryland vegetation andspring flow rates can be determined from image-derived wetland extents. This approach provides naturalresource managers with an indicator of spring wetland response {{that can be used to}} monitor the impactsof land use, groundwater extractions and climate change over time for the GAB and potentially otheraquifers worldwide.

40|$|Regional {{quantification}} {{of arctic}} CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes remains difficult {{due to high}} landscape heterogeneity coupled with a sparse measurement network. Most of the arctic coastal tundra near Barrow, Alaska {{is part of the}} thaw lake cycle, which includes current thaw lakes and a 5500 -year chronosequence of vegetated thaw lake basins. However, spatial variability in carbon fluxes from these features remains grossly understudied. Here, we present an analysis of whole-ecosystem CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes from 20 thaw lake cycle features during the 2011 growing season. We found that the thaw lake cycle was largely responsible for spatial variation in CO 2 flux, mostly due to its control on gross primary productivity (GPP). Current lakes were significant CO 2 sources that varied little. Vegetated basins showed declining GPP and CO 2 sink with age (R 2 = 67 % and 57 %, respectively). CH 4 fluxes measured from a subset of 12 vegetated basins showed no relationship with age or CO 2 flux components. Instead, higher CH 4 fluxes were related to greater landscape wetness (R 2 = 57 %) and thaw depth (additional R 2 = 28 %). Spatial variation in CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes had good <b>satellite</b> remote sensing <b>indicators,</b> and we estimated the region to be a small CO 2 sink of - 4. 9 ± 2. 4 (SE) g C m - 2 between 11 June and 25 August, which was countered by a CH 4 source of 2. 1 ± 0. 2 (SE) g C m - 2. Results from our scaling exercise showed that developing or validating regional estimates based on single tower sites can result in significant bias, on average by a factor 4 for CO 2 flux and 30 % for CH 4 flux. Although our results are specific to the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska, the degree of landscape-scale variability, large-scale controls on carbon exchange, and implications for regional estimation seen here likely have wide relevance to other arctic landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Dust is a {{critical}} component of the Earth System. The central and western Sahara (CWS) is the dustiest place on Earth during the northern hemisphere summer. Understanding patterns and causes of spatial and temporal variability of dust presence here is essential for its reliable simulation in numerical models of weather and climate. Four papers in this thesis contribute to that objective, utilising a combination of high temporal resolution satellite data and global atmospheric reanalyses for June – August 2004 – 2010 inclusive. The first paper develops an objective dust detection scheme for the CWS using data from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), which are available every 15 minutes around the clock. These data have shed valuable insight on CWS dust processes, but their subjective application has to date limited their range of applications. The SEVIRI dust flag (SDF) developed here is evaluated against other widely used surface and <b>satellite</b> derived <b>indicators</b> of dustiness and it is found to reliably detect the presence of moderate-heavy dust loadings. The distribution of dust each summer is presented, revealing a high degree of interannual variability in overall dust coverage. The second paper utilises SDF to create an objective, high spatial resolution dust source map, based on the automated tracking of individual dust plumes. The most active sources are associated predominantly with palaeo-lakes and outwash plains, typically around the Saharan mountains. There is a clear intraseasonal progression of active source areas, controlled by regional climatology. The tracking scheme describes the transport trajectory of dust events following their initiation and the spatial association with deep convection at this time, revealing a clear regional divide in the relative importance of known meteorological mechanisms that drive dust emission from the dominant sources. The third paper uses an unsupervised clustering algorithm to classify maps of daily dust presence frequency and identify patterns of intraseasonal variability in CWS dust coverage. The resulting idealised dust states vary according to frequency of dust occurrence and its location, demonstrating a clear progression in preferred dust location from June – August and preferred state transitions from one day to the next. High daily dust occurrence frequency corresponds to an advanced West African Monsoon flow and low daily dust occurrence frequency corresponds to a Harmattan-dominated CWS. The overall location of the dust is linked to the location of the Sahara Heat Low, which changes as the summer progresses. The final paper addresses interannual variability in summertime dust presence frequency by comparing the 2 years with highest (2005) and lowest (2008) dust presence. The key difference is the occurrence of 3 multi-day periods in 2005 characterised by anomalously high dust presence. Case study comparison with the 3 periods of highest dust presence in 2008 identifies the anticyclonic circulation of the midtroposphere as a key control on dust duration over the CWS, dictating whether emitted dust is efficiently transported away from the CWS or whether it remains in suspension over the region for prolonged periods of time, up to several days in the anomalously dusty periods of 2005.
