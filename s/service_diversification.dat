40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>diversification</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} solutions to hotel management because it has a direct influence on the improvement of profitability and competitiveness. This study investigated how <b>service</b> <b>diversification</b> is included in hotels in Mureş County (Romania) and analyzed factors typical of diversification through management decisions in the hotels comprised in the study. Therefore, this research focused on the following dimensions: determination of issues concerning hotel groups in Mures County related to service diversification; typological analysis of hotels in Mures County according to service diversification; analysis of correlations between factors that define <b>service</b> <b>diversification</b> in hotels and performance. The research features examination through total observation using a questionnaire and tests four hypothesis from international literature review. The results indicate that <b>service</b> <b>diversification</b> varies with the classification category of the hotels analyzed in the study. Factors related to diversification were grouped into three categories, which consisted of relaxation and leisure services, services related to business travel and subsidiary (auxiliary) services to accommodation services that complement existing business travel amenities. Also, the results show a positive correlation with performance indicators (respectively income and expenditure) with components of <b>service</b> <b>diversification.</b> The main findings offer valuable insights to both theoreticians and practitioners within the domestic and foreign hotel industry being the first study of this kind in Romania...|$|E

30|$|The {{entrepreneurial}} governance configuration {{does not}} depend on a particular degree of service commoditization. In fact, owing to the high degree of <b>service</b> <b>diversification,</b> a PSF employing this governance configuration is likely to offer services of varying degrees of commoditization. The autonomy professionals enjoy in offering new kinds of services makes it unlikely that such a PSF would offer only highly customized or highly commoditized services. With its more than 50 practice areas, Greenberg Traurig has a highly diversified range of services. Also, its services vary significantly in their degree of commoditization. Entrepreneurial governance is likely to be found in large PSFs, not least because firms following this configuration often put a strong emphasis on growth. Greenberg Traurig has grown significantly throughout its existence, with average annual growth rates between 10 and 20  %. Together, large firm size and strong <b>service</b> <b>diversification</b> point to several governance characteristics that distinguish the entrepreneurial configuration from the collegial configuration, such as a high degree of specialization, decentralization, and formalization.|$|E
30|$|A second {{limitation}} is {{the depth of}} available empirical studies, which also varies regarding the contingency factors discussed in this article. Firm size and <b>service</b> <b>diversification</b> have been studied extensively regarding PSFs and other organizations. On the contrary, how values and beliefs of professionals affect firm governance constitute a rather new research area. In addition to the more commonly proposed distinction between professional and commercial values in the PSF literature, we suggest to extend studies to explore empirically the nature and impact of entrepreneurial values.|$|E
30|$|The {{demands of}} global clients for {{integrated}} service providers, the declining profitability {{of the core}} audit services, and the competitive advantage of existing client relationships in auditing have been cited as reasons for <b>service</b> <b>diversification</b> (Aharoni 1999; Malhotra et al. 2006; Rose and Hinings 1999). Large advertising firms have also increased the scope of their services to include public relations, strategic marketing consulting, and market research (Grabher 2001; von Nordenflycht 2007). In a similar fashion, several large consulting firms have pursued the strategy of providing integrated management and IT consulting services and have expanded into IT systems integration and outsourcing services (e.g., Accenture/Andersen Consulting, see DeLong 2003). However, {{while most of the}} PSF archetype literature focuses on diversification across professional boundaries (e.g., Brock et al. 2007; Greenwood et al. 2002; Rose and Hinings 1999), and this evidently constitutes the highest degree of <b>service</b> <b>diversification,</b> we include various forms of diversification within one profession or industry in our definition of this contingency factor. As many studies have shown, <b>service</b> <b>diversification</b> increases specialization and decentralization (Mintzberg 1979 : 380 – 430; Williamson 1975 : 132 – 154). Moreover, a specialized firm that offers diversified services will find extensive collegial control at the firm level difficult. The reason is that few professionals will have the necessary knowledge, or interest, to participate efficiently in decisions covering diverse areas of expertise (Greenwood and Empson 2003). We, therefore, argue that more diversified PSFs are more likely to apply hierarchical, centralized governance structures. Furthermore, we contend that the more diversified a firm’s services are, {{the more likely it is}} that some services will be inherently more profitable than others. Sherer (2007) discusses the constraining effect lockstep remuneration has on the diversification of law firms into regions that command lower billing rates, using the US law firms Baker and McKenzie (eat-what-you-kill) and Cleary Gottlieb (lockstep) as examples. An example outside the legal profession is the declining profitability of accounting services, which was a key reason for accounting firms to expand into consulting services (Koza and Lewin 1999). Under such circumstances, a pure lockstep system is more difficult to sustain across different services.|$|E

30|$|Professional service firms (PSFs) such as {{accounting}} firms, management consultancies, or {{advertising agencies}} use very {{different forms of}} governance ranging from traditional professional partnerships to public corporations. In spite of the extensive literature, little academic {{work has been done}} to synthesize the wealth of theoretical and empirical work on PSF governance into a more comprehensive theory of PSF governance. Taking configuration theory as our theoretical approach, we identify three classes of design parameter (legal form, organizational governance structure, and the systems for managing professionals) and six contingency factors (service commoditization, <b>service</b> <b>diversification,</b> firm size, capital intensity, firm culture, and risk of litigation) that are synthesized into four configurations of PSF governance.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether {{strategic}} intent influences developing intellectual capital (IC) and if IC affects performance measured in terms of product and <b>service</b> <b>diversification</b> within small and medium enterprises over time. Design/methodology/approach – This study discusses if and how structural equation models can be located within the third stage of IC research, and subsequently presents an analysis developed using 1, 392 questionnaire responses through a temporal lens. Findings – Empirical results show how relational, human and structural capital strongly connects to support a firm’s performance measured in terms of product and <b>service</b> <b>diversification.</b> Additionally, IC and strategic intent influence each other creating a constraint effect on one side and an ambition effect on the other. Interestingly, the constraint effect is much higher than the ambition effect, and this falls in line with a contingency approach to strategic intent. Practical implications – Several practical implications are developed. First, results show that high regulation where firms can offer mandatory product/services can limit IC development. Therefore the findings contribute to the dialogue between policy makers, managers and businesses. Second, business schools should consider how strategic intent contributes to developing IC in order to design future curricula for accounting and management studies. Third, firms that operate in similar contexts should pay attention to managerial myopia due to low competition where a significant part of firms’ revenues is from mandatory product/services. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating how IC affects strategic intent and how strategic intent fosters IC development. Additionally, findings build on existing theory, helping to understand how IC affects performance measured in terms of portfolio diversification. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} of services has become an increasingly {{important component of the}} economy of industrialized economies and the revenue stream for many traditional product companies. This is especially true for companies offering information technology (IT) products, as service revenues are often several times the initial purchase or licensing fees, making the development of a successful services business both a strategic area for growth and a way to diversify revenue streams. This paper examines factors that influence the extent to which IT product companies are able to utilize services as a source of revenue. Drawing literatures from evolutionary economics, <b>service</b> <b>diversification,</b> and organizational decline, we identify architecture knowledge of IT systems, information asymmetry of service offering, and previous performance as key drivers of the percentage of revenues associated with services. ...|$|E

To achieve this, we develop a formal model and theory for service evolution that allows multiple active service versions to be created consistently and co-exist, while executing schema changes effectively...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{competitive}} {{factors associated with}} company growth in the US industrial design sector. This small but technologically advanced sector delivers critical innovation inputs to firms that produce durable goods. Evidence from a survey of 85 US design companies suggests that competitive success hinges upon service diversity. Specifically, the most commercially buoyant companies have diversified their service offerings beyond product or component design. These firms have developed strategic competencies in fields such as contract research, prototype development, product testing, technological forecasting, market analysis and even advertising. Although most US design companies are small-to-medium-sized enterprises, successful firms do not differ from their less successful counterparts in terms of employment size, occupational structure, regional location or market focus (client sectors). Instead, the key differences lie in service diversity {{and the quality of}} human capital. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of the empirical findings for future research on the dynamics of the design industry.

40|$|Part 6 : Security in Networks and WebInternational audienceThe {{administrators of}} a mission {{critical}} network usually {{have to worry}} about non-traditional threats, e. g., how to live with known, but unpatchable vulnerabilities, and how to improve the network’s resilience against potentially unknown vulnerabilities. To this end, network hardening is a well-knowfn preventive security solution that aims to improve network security by taking proactive actions, namely, hardening options. However, most existing network hardening approaches rely on a single hardening option, such as disabling unnecessary services, which becomes less effective when it comes to dealing with unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities. There lacks a heterogeneous approach that can combine different hardening options in an optimal way to deal with both unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose such an approach by unifying multiple hardening options, such as firewall rule modification, disabling services, <b>service</b> <b>diversification,</b> and access control, under the same model. We then apply security metrics designed for evaluating network resilience against unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities, and consequently derive optimal hardening solutions that maximize security under given cost constraints...|$|E

Owing to this problem, the research focuses on the strategic role of management {{with an emphasis on}} the support mechanisms for learning and the development of knowledge. The research population focuses on professional quantity surveying firms in the Western Cape region of South Africa. The aim of the research is to understand and identify key components of management‟s strategic influence on: (a) the organisation‟s culture, (b) the development of knowledge and (c) the development of related services and skills within professional quantity surveying firms. The research methodology consists of both qualitative and quantitative methods. Management members provided qualitative data by participating in interviews and staff members provided quantitative data by completing questionnaires. The data for the research comprised a criterion sample of eleven small- and medium-sized diversified firms. The core elements of the research are the organisational culture, learning, and the development of knowledge and <b>service</b> <b>diversification.</b> The research expands information on management‟s role in the organisation‟s culture and development of knowledge in professional quantity surveying firms. The research found that there are many supportive learning elements within the organisational cultures of most quantity surveying firms. Most management members discuss employee development and performance issues, and the lessons learnt from projects. Management occasionally mentors employees and regularly allows employees to undertake challenging work activities. Management members do not, however, include employees {{in the development of the}} firm‟s related services. Management primarily established related services because there was a need for these services. The development and transfer of related service knowledge and skills are restricted to management members to a large degree. Management‟s influence on the development of knowledge and skills of employees is somewhat limited and inconsistent. Organisational culture factors such as job satisfaction and the professional development of staff members have to be given appropriate attention by management, especially from a consistency and formal standpoint. Elements that require reviewing include the time allocated for internal learning activities and learning initiatives, other than on-the-job training. <b>Service</b> <b>diversification</b> factors, such as management members restriction of staff members to core quantity surveying services, also have to be reconsidered. Elements of some related services may improve the quality of core quantity surveying services.

Although the event was de-picted as a merger by the {{majority}} of stakeholders, it was in fact an acquisition or buyout of one organization. Although the negotiation processes were described in the language of efficiency, power issues were their focus. Awareness of power differentials and insight into outcome expectations provided leverage to the acquired group. Judi-cious use of ambiguity aided participants in reaching accord in the negotiations. During the last two decades, the environment within which nonprofit social service organizations operate has become more fluid and unpre-dictable than ever before (Musselwhite and Salamon, 1986; Powell and Friedkin, 1987; Salamon, 1987; Milofsky, 1988 a, 1988 b). Fiscal resources for human service organizations have become scarce because of cutbacks in funding sources. Competition for these scarce resources has become fierce. Between 1981 and 1986, social services suffered a 23. 1 percent reduction in federal support (Rosentraub, 1986; Musslewhite and Salamon, 1986).
