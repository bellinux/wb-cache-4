This study develops a generic conceptual approach to modeling the livestock sector that provides consistent rules of specification and better coverage of variables.

40|$|This study {{develops}} a generic conceptual approach to modeling the livestock sector that provides better coverage of variables {{to ensure the}} consistency in the underlying biologics of the model and also provides consistent rules of specification. This approach is applied to modeling the swine-pork sector of Japan and then {{used to analyze the}} impact of removing Japan’s gate price policy and variable levy for pork imports. The new approach departs significantly from existing models. For consistency in the biologics of the model both live animals and meat components of the sector are fully covered. The structure clearly differentiates stock and flow variables and investment and production decisions. A standard rule of specification is established that only flow variables that correspond to the actual decisions faced by producers and consumers are specified with a behavioral equation, while stock variables are derived from changes in the relevant flow variables using an accounting identity. The flow variables are expressed in rates rather than levels and specified with logistic functions to automatically impose biological-technological constraints.

Ceca (30) from 797 flocks, not subject to prior partial depopulation and reared on 211 farms, were examined individually {{for the presence of}} Campylobacter spp. The best-fitting climatic factors explained approximately 46 % of the prevalence of Campylobacter-colonized flocks at slaughter and consisted of a combination of temperature at <b>slaughter,</b> <b>number</b> of sunshine hours in placement month, and millimeters of rainfall in placement month. Positive flocks {{were more likely to be}} slaughtered between June and November than during the rest of the year and to be reared in northern Great Britain than in central or southern Great Britain. C. jejuni was identified in approximately 90 % of flocks, and C. coli was present in 10 % of flocks. The most common clonal complexes identified in 226 isolates typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were ST- 45, ST- 21, ST- 574, ST- 443, and ST- 828. Flocks slaughtered at the same time were more likely to have similar complexes, and ST- 45 had a seasonal pattern, with the highest prevalence in June, and was also more likely to be present in flocks reared in northern Great Britain...|$|E

40|$|In Chile, cow {{carcasses}} {{present the}} highest bruise prevalence {{compared with other}} cattle categories; however, {{the causes of the}} bruises are frequently unknown. In this study, 52 cull cows were transported to the slaughterhouse in three batches under identical transport conditions. A combination of direct observation and video analyses was used to determine moment, pre-slaughter stage and cause of potential bruising events during the period from loading on the farm until stunning at the slaughterhouse. After <b>slaughter,</b> <b>number</b> of bruises, location on the carcass and characteristics of the bruises were assessed. Seventy-eight bruises were observed on 37 carcasses. Fifty-two bruises were linked back to their causal event. Results showed that 46 % of these bruises were a result of interactions between animal and facility, and most of them were inflicted in the stunning box, 27 % of the bruises originated from animal–animal interactions and were mostly inflicted during lairage, another 27 % was a result of human–animal interactions and were mostly inflicted during loading and unloading of animals. The percentages of potential bruising events resulting in a bruise were 43 %, 9 % and less than 1 % for animal–facility, human–animal and animal–animal interactions, respectively. Most bruises on the back site were inflicted when the animal was in the stunning box (91. 2 %), whereas bruises on the pin site were mostly (75 %) inflicted during loading at the farm. One may conclude that in relative short journeys (= 4 h) directly from farm to the slaughterhouse and long lairage times (> 12 h), most bruises are the result of circumstances at the slaughterhouse. A substantial amount of these bruises could be avoided by proper animal handling and adequate stunning facilities...|$|E

40|$|In Aomori Prefecture {{agriculture}} {{rice and}} apples {{are the main}} produce. However, {{there is a difference}} between each zone in the prefecture. The productivity of Livestock is high in the Kennan Area, which lies on the Pacific Ocean side of the prefecture. Therefore, it is thought that the livestock industry greatly influences Aomori Prefecture agriculture. The slaughtering process is indispensable in making meat a commodity. The slaughterhouses, which process livestock, have been rapidly reorganized. “The Slaughterhouse Law” was revised to prevent food poisoning caused by contaminated meat in 1996. This revision was promoted by a case of food poisoning by E. coli O- 157. For this revision, the slaughterhouses need to achieve of a high standard in the short term. And each slaughterhouse requires a huge investment in capital. The characteristics and the management problems of the slaughterhouses in Aomori Prefecture are clarified in this paper. As a result of the research, the following two points were clarified as characteristics of slaughterhouse management in Aomori Prefecture. First, for the slaughterhouses in Aomori Prefecture, the ratio of pigs is high and the ratio of dairy cattle is high. However the most of the beef cattle is carried outside the prefecture while lived. Therefore, the ratio slaughtered at the slaughterhouses in Aomori prefecture is lower than the other livestock. Secondly, after the 90 ’s the <b>number</b> <b>slaughtered</b> decreased in Aomori prefecture. However, in some slaughterhouses, the <b>slaughtered</b> <b>number</b> decreased. In the <b>number</b> of livestock <b>slaughtered,</b> the differences among slaughterhouses are formed. This means the collecting of livestock competition is fierce among slaughterhouses. The cause of the management problems in the slaughterhouses is; that while the <b>numbers</b> <b>slaughtered</b> livestock decrease, revenue and expenditure deteriorate. And, “The Slaughterhouse Law” is revised in such a situation and, as a result, it is necessary to increase the investment capital. This too is the main management problem...|$|R

40|$|What is the {{hog cycle}}? In theory, the hog cycle is {{four years in}} length. It is the {{interaction}} of the pig inventory, hog slaughter, and hog price. As the pig inventory grows, the <b>number</b> of hogs <b>slaughtered</b> increases and the price decreases. As the profitability decreases, marketing more sows and not keeping as many replacement gilts reduces the breeding herd. This creates a further increase in <b>slaughter</b> <b>numbers.</b> The graph below provides an example using United States (U. S.) data from January 1998 to December 2001 on a quarterly basis. With the profitability in the industry in 1996 and 1997, the inventory of pigs started to increase and it peaked {{in the third quarter of}} 1998. The <b>number</b> of pigs <b>slaughtered</b> increased during 1998, peaking in the fourth quarter, resulting in the low price for the cycle. The U. S. breeding herd continued to decrease for eight quarters. Slaughter decreased on a year over year basis. Because of the decreasing slaughter and inventory, prices returned to profitable levels in 2000 and 2001. Again, <b>slaughter</b> and inventory <b>numbers</b> began to creep up in 2001. This led to another price cycle low in the fall of 2002. The various components that influence the hog market cycles are constantly changing and interacting. What about the interaction of price, inventory <b>numbers</b> and <b>slaughter</b> volume for both the United States and Canada? The graph below provides a picture of the relative percentage changes from one year to the next of these three items using the combined inventory <b>numbers</b> and <b>slaughter</b> volumes for United State...|$|R

The research area consists of the biggest part of the Northern Cape province, which can further be divided into three main production areas, namely Groblershoop, Gordonia and Hantam. The Groblershoop area includes Groblershoop and the surrounding districts. The Gordonia area includes Upington and the Kalahari.
