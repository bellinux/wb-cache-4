5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> stereoscopic vision.|$|E

25|$|Direct {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} ARAS produces pain responses in cats and educes verbal reports of pain in humans. Additionally, ascending reticular activation in cats can produce mydriasis, which can result from prolonged pain.

25|$|It {{appears the}} desire for reunion {{is linked to the}} adoptee's {{interaction}} with and acceptance within the community. Internally focused theories <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> adoptees possess ambiguities in their sense of self, impairing their ability to present a consistent identity. Reunion helps resolve the lack of self-knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The {{hormonal}} neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin play a {{key role}} in complex social behaviours in many mammals such as regulating attachment, social recognition, and aggression. Vasopressin has been implicated in male-typical social behaviors which includes aggression. Oxytocin may have a particular role in regulating female bonds with offspring and mates, including the use of protective aggression. Initial studies in humans <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> similar effects.|$|E

25|$|During the {{excavations}} {{conducted in}} the forest {{to the west of}} Allianoi, a vessel of the type known as Yortan (dating from the Early Bronze Age II) was found. On the hills of Çakmaktepe (Flint Hill) nearby, a high quantity of flintstones were found during surveys. Additionally, two stone axes were unearthed from an earth fill. These findings <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> form of prehistoric settlement at or near Allianoi.|$|E
25|$|An early example can {{be found}} in {{sections}} of the wall surrounding Wollaton Hall, which was built using Bulwell stone in the late 16th century. The sheer quantities used there - and elsewhere in the city - <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> kind of professional mining operation must already have been in operation by this time. Bulwell stone was later also used to repair the damage caused to the palaces of Westminster during the second World War.|$|E
25|$|Objective tests assume {{personality}} is consciously accessible {{and that it}} can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because {{there is no way to}} tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.|$|E

25|$|In February 1882, C. A. L. Totten (then a 1st {{lieutenant}} in the U.S. Army) wrote to both the Secretaries of State and Treasury to <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> sort of commemoration for the Great Seal, which was to have its centennial later that year, in particular including {{a version of the}} never-cut and rarely seen reverse side. The State Department demurred, but the Treasury Department (having the ability to act without express permission of Congress) decided that a commemorative medal would be appropriate and agreed to make one later that year.|$|E
25|$|The results {{uncovered}} by this study at least <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> {{issues with the}} classic mirror test; primarily, that it assumes that children will recognise the dot of rouge as abnormal and attempt to examine or remove it. The classic test may have produced false negatives, because the child's recognition of the dot {{did not lead to}} them cleaning it. In their modified test, in which the doll was cleaned first, they found a stronger relationship between cleaning the doll's face and the child cleaning its own face. The demonstration with the doll, postulated to demonstrate to the children what to do, may lead to more reliable confirmation of self-recognition.|$|E
25|$|Since {{self-regulation}} by {{all state}} and non-state actors seems hard to achieve, measures to mitigate war-related risks have mainly been {{proposed in the}} area of international cooperation. International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level. This could help coordinate efforts for arms control. International institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology (perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA) or general arms control may also be designed. One may also jointly make differential technological progress on defensive technologies, a policy that players should usually favour. The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> technical restrictions. Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for arms-control.|$|E

25|$|Cosus, a male deity, was worshipped in {{the coastal}} areas where the Celtici dwelt, from the region around Aveiro and Porto to Northern Galicia, but seldom inland, with the {{exception}} of the El Bierzo region in Leon, where this cult has been attributed to the known arrival of Galician miners, most notably from among the Celtici Supertamarici. This deity has not been recorded in the same areas as Bandua, Reue and Nabia deities occur, and El Bierzo follows the same pattern as in the coast. From a theonymical point of view, this <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> ethno-cultural differences between the coast and inland areas. With the exception of the Grovii people, Pomponius Mela stated that all the populi were Celtic and Cosus was not worshipped there. Pliny also rejected that the Grovii were Celtic, he considered them to have a Greek origin.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on local}} tissue {{concentrations}} of local anesthetics, excitatory or depressant {{effects on the}} central nervous system may occur. Initial symptoms <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> form of central nervous system excitation such as a ringing in the ears (tinnitus), a metallic taste in the mouth, or tingling or numbness of the mouth. As the concentration rises, a relatively selective depression of inhibitory neurons results in cerebral excitation, which may lead to more advanced symptoms include motor twitching in the periphery followed by grand mal seizures. A profound depression of brain functions occurs at higher concentrations which may lead to coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose. Another possibility is direct exposure of {{the central nervous system}} through the cerebrospinal fluid, i.e., overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{description of}} the species noted strong similarities between the osteology of Huabeisaurus and other Cretaceous East Asian sauropods, and in general, previous studies have pointed to some East Asian Cretaceous sauropod (like Nemegtosaurus and Phuwiangosaurus) as the sister taxon of Huabeisaurus. Since 2000, {{the year of the}} original description of Huabeisaurus, 17 new sauropod species have been erected from the Cretaceous of East Asia. Many authors have noted similarities among Cretaceous East Asian sauropods, often suggesting that several of these taxa belong to a clade grounded on a genus with well-known anatomy (like Nemegtosauridae, Opisthocoelicaudinae, and Euhelopodidae). Cladistic support was recently presented for a Euhelopodidae that consisted of exclusively Cretaceous-aged members, in contrast with traditional studies and early cladistic analyses that placed the existence of a Euhelopodidae with Jurassic forms. Both earlier and later analyses <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> degree of endemism in East Asia, though its temporal duration remains uncertain. On a broader scale, an interesting evolutionary pattern has been recognized wherein all pre-Cretaceous Jurassic Asian sauropods lie outside of Neosauropoda, whereas all Cretaceous Asian sauropods are titanosauriforms. Refining and explaining these paleobiogeographic patterns through time rests on detailed comparisons and comprehensive phylogenetic studies including East Asian sauropods, which are currently lacking.|$|E

25|$|The mtDNA haplogroups of Europeans are {{surveyed}} {{by using a}} combination of data from RFLP analysis of the coding region and sequencing of the hypervariable segment I. About 99% of European mtDNAs fall into one of ten haplogroups: H, I, J, K, M, T, U, V, W or X (Torroni et al. 1996a). Each of these is defined by certain relatively ancient and stable polymorphic sites located in the coding region (Torroni et al. 1996a)... Haplogroup H, which is defined by the absence of an AluI site at bp 7025, is the most prevalent, comprising half of all Europeans (Torroni et al. 1996a, Richards et al. 1998)... Six of the European haplogroups (H, I, J, K, T and W) are essentially confined to European populations (Torroni et al. 1994, 1996a), and probably originated after the ancestral Caucasoids became genetically separated from the ancestors of the modern Africans and Asians. Genetic studies <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> maternal gene flow to eastern Europe from eastern Asia or southern Siberia 13,000 – 6,600 years BP. Analysis of Neolithic skeletons in the Great Hungarian Plain found a high frequency of eastern Asian mtDNA haplogroups, some of which survive in modern eastern European populations. Maternal gene flow to Europe from sub-Saharan Africa began as early as 11,000 years BP, although the majority of lineages, approximately 65%, are estimated to have arrived more recently, including during the Romanization period, the Arab conquests of southern Europe, and during the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E

Denning apologised for his remarks on 21May and handed a letter to the Lord Chancellor detailing his resignation, effective as of 29September.|$|E
500|$|Carroon {{is taken}} to Briscoe's office for care, {{on the grounds that}} {{conventional}} hospitals and doctors would have no idea how to evaluate or treat the world's first returned astronaut suffering from some sort of adverse event while in space.

Briscoe also discovers a strangely disfigured place on his shoulder, and notices changes in his face which <b>suggest</b> <b>some</b> sort of mutation of the underlying bone structure. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard Inspector Lomax has undertaken investigation of the other two men's disappearance and, having surreptitiously fingerprinted Carroon as a suspect, alerts Quatermass that the prints resemble those of nothing human.|$|E
