50|$|Sayyid Said bin Sultan {{had long}} flirted {{with the idea}} of sending one of his vessels to the US. In 1839, several senior members of the New York firm Scoville and Britton arrived in Zanzibar and sought to persuade Sayyid Said to open direct trade with New York. Sayyid Said {{selected}} his private secretary Ahmad bin Na'aman on his royal ship, Al-Sultanah for the voyage to New York. The ship was navigated by an English captain, but was replaced by an American sailing master upon its return to Zanzibar. After loading some cargo in Muscat, al-Sultanah took on additional cargo in Zanzibar and set sail for America, stopping only in St. Helena. The ship was well received on its arrival in New York in early May 1840 and its officers were invited to visit the Navy Yard, take a train ride, and attend a reception for the governor of New York and vice-president of the United States. The US Navy undertook repairs to al-Sultanah, as a gesture of gratitude for al-Sultanah’s assistance to the American vessel Peacock, which had been damaged when it went aground on a coral reef off Masirah Island in 1835. The trip was primarily a commercial venture and al-Sultanah’s cargo of Persian carpets, coffee, dates, ivory tusks, gum copal, cloves, and <b>salted</b> <b>hides</b> was offloaded in New York. The proceeds were used to purchase American goods including general merchandise, personal items for Sayyid Said and his brother, and some chandeliers and mirrors for several Zanzibar merchants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{group of}} halophilic Archaea was {{discovered}} {{in the beginning of}} XX th century. They are able to live in more than 2 - 3 M of sodium chloride concentration that can be found in hypersaline natural lakes, in alkaline saline lakes, in man-made hypersaline mats, in rock salt, in very salted foods, on salted fish, on <b>salted</b> <b>hides,</b> in stromatolites, in saline soils. Their adaptations consist in resistance to high ionic contents with internal accumulation of K ions in order to face high Na ion content from the near environment. They belong to the Halobacteriaceae family. Their adaptation and their resistance to UV radiation and their resistance in oligotrophic conditions in rock salt, apparently over geological times, increase the possibility to find similar microorganisms in the Martian subsurface and in meteorites, and to support the panspermia theory. Some of the research of a working group in this field of activity and their possible uses are shortly reviewed here...|$|E

40|$|Animal hides are {{the basic}} raw {{material}} of the leather industry and they undergo rapid putrefaction unless "cured". This study investigated the role and interactive effects of three selected bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clostridium histoly ticum and Clostridium sporogenes in in-situ cattle hide degradation using a model system {{set up for the}} purpose. The system consisted of 3 cm diameter hide pieces contained in sealed jars and sterilised by ethylene oxide to remove resident microbes and inactivate autolytic tissue enzymes. The inocula were prepared either as individual cultures or as combinations of two inocula or all three inocula. Degradative changes during storage at 30 °C were measured for up to 8 days using ten different parameters. Initial trials confirmed that the selected inocula were readily isolated from raw hides and could outcompete resident populations to produce putrefactive decomposition. Growth rates and enzyme profiles of the organisms and the effects of nutrients and reductants on their relative denaturative effects were used to standardise the system. Trials on the effects of ethylene oxide indicated the suitability of the method for hide and collagen sterilisation. The findings of in-situ trials with the selected inocula confirmed previous studies of protein putrefaction in that a bacterial succession was evident involving aerobic proteolytic bacteria, micro-aerophilic proteolytic bacteria and strictly anaerobic amino acid degrading bacteria. However, this study showed that the micro-aerophilic collagenase producing C. histolyticum degraded hides at a far greater rate when inoculated on its own than when in the presence of either or both of the other two inocula. It also demonstrated a bacterial antagonism between the two clostridia in which C. sporogenes prevented degradative changes occurring for up to 4 - 6 days possibly due to cysteine production by C. sporogenes. These findings have implications for hide preservation since maintenance of aerobic conditions and suppression of spore outgrowth could be used to delay growth of collagenase producing clostridia. The use of C. sporogenes as a biocontrol agent is also postulated. The model system was also used to examine <b>salted</b> <b>hides</b> during storage and these studies indicated that Halobacteriaceae do not produce collagenase but that inadequately <b>salted</b> <b>hides</b> could possibly be subject to degradation by delsulfovibrios. ...|$|E

The strain actively transported sucrose by a sucrose-inducible, Na+-independent process. A 10. 4 -kilobase DNA fragment of V. alginolyticus DNA was cloned into Escherichia coli. The recombinant E. coli(pVS 100) could utilize sucrose as a sole carbon source. In contrast to V. alginolyticus, the recombinant E. coli produced both intra- and extracellular sucrase activities. Up to 20 % of the total sucrase activity was in the supernatant. Sucrase synthesis in E. coli(pVS 100) was inducible and was subject to glucose repression, which was relieved by cyclic AMP. Sucrose was actively transported by a sucrose-inducible, Na+-independent system in E. coli(pVS 100). Sucrose uptake was inhibited {{by the addition of}} a proton conductor. The maximum velocity and apparent Km values of sucrose uptake for the V. alginolyticus strain and E. coli(pVS 100) were 130 nmol/mg of protein per min and 50 microM and 6 nmol/mg of protein per min and 275 microM, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Leather {{industries}} are interested to avoid post-mortem alterations {{of the skin}} components, since degeneration of the dermal structures composing raw hides decreases the quality of leather. The goal {{of the present study}} is to realize a histological study of skin samples to assess the tissue alterations at different periods and under methods of conservation (salting and refrigeration) after the skinning of the animals at the slaughterhouse. The papillary region and the reticular dermis were both analyzed. The dermal components considered were the number of cell nuclei, the structure of the collagen and elastic fibers, and finally the presence of acidic polysaccharides. Results showed a progressive reduction of cellular nuclei and acid polysaccharides of the dermal layer during the passage of time in all the conditions considered. A moderate decay of collagen bundles was noted in <b>salted</b> <b>hides</b> whereas the elastic fiber networks maintained their organization over the time. No sign of accumulation of non-functional elements or other morphological alterations were observed in the dermis. These findings can be useful for the leather industry to choose the desired curing and timing conditions to employ during refrigeration or salt-based treatment of the skins...|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} {{main reasons for}} {{carrying}} out recycling operations in a tannery, viz. (a) recycling in order to utilise excess of chemicals in a process which if not recycled would have been discharged, (b) recycling to reduce the pollution load in the effluent, and (c) recycling {{as a means of}} water saving. The last aspect on its own does not generally warrant recycling because of the cost and effort involved in collecting, pumping and piping the liquor. For case (a) to apply, the chemicals in question must not be completely taken up by the leather; in fact complete utilisation of chemicals in leather manufacture is seldom achieved, although this would be the ideal. Processes such as soaking, unhairing, pickling and tanning lend themselves to recycling and in this paper some of the research projects being carried out at LIRI on recycling operations will be outlined. wing Multi-stage soaking operations lend themselves to recycling in a counter-current manner.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that lime-sulphide {{unhairing}} liquot-s can be recycled more than 20 times, perhaps indefinitely. The only treatments necessary before re-use are temperature adjustment and replenishment with lime, sulphide and water, preferably as washings from the previous unhairing. For 20 cycles the averagc consumptions based on green-hide weight were 1. 5 % lime, 2. 2 '%, sodium sulphide and 40 [...] 55 '%, water; the higher watcr usage occurrcd when solids were removed before each use, a procedure which has advantages. <b>Salted</b> <b>hides</b> can be tinhaired satisfactorily in re-used liquors if they first have an adequate soak to reduce their salt content. Recycling of lime liquors has no apparent effect on leather quality or yield even though, when compared with conventional unhairing, it results in a decrease in hide swelling and an uptake of proteins or their degradation products. This method could be developed as a no-effluent system of unhairing if liquors can be cycled indefinitely or, after a certain number of cycles, can be utilised as a source of protein. Even if the liquors are discharged after 20 uses there can be overall a 20 -fold reduction in water consumption and effluent sulphide, and a seven-fold reduction in effluent lime and protein...|$|E

40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out to isolate and {{identify}} aerobic bacteria associated with raw cattle hides and sheep skins and to examine their effect on tissue of hides and skins, in Gezira region. A total of 160 samples were collected. They were collected from slaughterhouse, warehouse and tannery. Samples collected were hides and skins treated with salt, washed and air dried. Samples taken 2 hours after slaughter and samples delivered without treatment. The bacterial damage was clear in {{raw hides and skins}} delivered without treatment. They showed signs of putrefaction, offensive odour and hair slipping. A number of bacteria were isolated. A number of bacteria were isolated also from traditional <b>salted</b> <b>hides</b> and skins and this was probably due to delay in curing and absence of bacteriocides. A number of bacteria were isolated from samples taken from washed and air dried hides and skins and samples 2 hours taken after slaughter, this probably due to poor hygiene, large number of labors and bad condition of collection room of raw hides and skins. A total of 414 organisms were isolated and consist of 379 Grampositive bacteria and 35 were Gram- negative bacteria. One hundred and thirty four bacterial strains were isolated from fresh and washed cattle hides and sheep skins in slaughterhouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Aerococcus homorri, Enterococcus casselifarus, Aerococcus viridans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gamella haemolysan, Stomococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli. Also one hundred and sixty three strains were isolated from salted and dried cattle hides and sheep skins in warehouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus faecalis, Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, Bacillus spp, Morexell bovis, Proteus vulgaris bigroup II, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli. One hundred and seventeen bacterial strains were isolated from raw hides and skins delivered without treatment to tannery these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Lactobacillus jensenii, Streptococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, Stomatococcus mucilaginous, Bacillus spp, Aerococcus viridans, Proteus vulgaris biogroupII, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp were the predominant microorganisms isolated in this study.
