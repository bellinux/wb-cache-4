NVM {{had an average of}} 28 more species and showed a strong positive correlation with Poaceae and Fabaceae, and also with geophytes and hemicryptophytes.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Controlling runoff {{and soil}} erosion are {{important}} for maintaining soil productivity and reducing off-site impairment due to sediment and nutrient enrichment. Previous {{research has shown that}} crop residue and polyacrylamide (PAM) can reduce runoff and soil erosion. We compared the combined effects of surface residue and PAM on runoff soil loss, and phosphorus loss from sprinkler irrigated soil in the laboratory. We hypothesized that surface residue would enhance the effectiveness of sprinkler-applied PAM by allowing PAM to stabilize the soil surface with less disturbance by water drops. Steel boxes (1. 5 m long, 1. 2 m wide, and 0. 2 m deep) were filled with Roza loam (fine, smectitic, mesic xerertic Haplocambids) and irrigated at 80 mm h- 1 for 15 min. Wheat straw was applied for two separate tests (70 % and 30 % <b>straw</b> <b>cover).</b> The PAM was applied at 0, 2 or 4 kg ha- 1 during the first irrigation, followed by two water-only irrigations. Applying PAM to straw-covered soil controlled runoff, erosion, and phosphorus losses equally or better than using either PAM or straw alone. The 70 % <b>straw</b> <b>cover</b> reduced cumulative runoff for the three irrigations 75 to 80 % compared to 30 to 50 % reduction with PAM alone. Polyacrylamide alone or 30 % surface cover alone produced similar results, both reducing cumulative runoff 10 to 20 % compared to untreated bare soil. Since runoff, erosion and phosphorus loss were reduced when PAM and surface residue were used individually and to a greater extent when used together, management choices should depend on overall costs and control needed to meet water quality and production goals...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{and water}} loss in {{agriculture}} {{is a major}} problem throughout the world, and especially in Mediterranean areas. Non-conservation agricultural practices have further aggravated the situation, especially in vineyards, which are affected by one of the highest rates of soil loss among cultivated lands. Therefore, it is necessary to find the right soil practices for more sustainable viticulture. In this regard, straw mulching has proven to be effective in other crop and fire affected soils, but, nonetheless, little research has been carried out in vineyards. This research tests the effect of barley straw mulching on soil erosion and surface runoff on vineyards in Eastern Spain where the soil and water losses are non-sustainable. An experiment was setup using rainfall simulation tests at 55 mm h - 1 over 1 h on forty paired plots of 0. 24 m 2 : twenty bare and twenty straw covered. <b>Straw</b> <b>cover</b> varied from 48 to 90 % with a median value of 59 % {{as a result of the}} application of 75 g of straw per m 2. The use of straw mulch resulted in delayed ponding and runoff generation and, as a consequence, the median water loss decreased from 52. 59 to 39. 27 % of the total rainfall. The <b>straw</b> <b>cover</b> reduced the median sediment concentration in runoff from 9. 8 to 3. 0 g L - 1 and the median total sediment detached from 70. 34 to 15. 62 g per experiment. The median soil erosion rate decreased from 2. 81 to 0. 63 Mg ha - 1 h - 1 due to the straw mulch protection. Straw mulch is very effective in reducing soil erodibility and surface runoff, and this benefit was achieved immediately after the application of the straw. </p...|$|E
40|$|Soil erosion {{is a key}} {{cause of}} land {{degradation}} in agriculture lands; {{and it is a}} worldwide threat that must be solved by means of nature-based strategies to be able to achieve sustainability. The use of mulches can be a solution, but {{there is a lack of}} information on long-term effects of the use of straw. Furthermore, little is known about the perception of farmers and the economic cost on the implantation of straw as a conservation measure. Eight paired plots were selected in Sierra de Enguera on an agriculture field to determine the effect of <b>straw</b> <b>cover</b> on soil erosion. Four plots were tilled three times per year (Control) and four plots were not ploughed and 0. 125 kg m − 2 y − 1 of oat <b>straw</b> <b>cover</b> was applied yearly (Straw). The plots were established in 2002, and runoff and sediment was continuously collected after each rainfall event from 2004 till 2014 when the two managements were applied. The results show an immediate effect of the straw mulches as in these plots the runoff (from 7. 7 till 5. 9 %) and soil erosion (from 47 till 26 Mg ha − 1 y − 1) was reduced already in the first year. The combined effect of the use of straw yearly and the no-tillage strategy resulted in a reduction of the sediment yield, and 11 years later soil erosion rates were two orders of magnitude lower than in the control plot. However, the perception of the farmers on the use of straw is very negative and they claim that subsidies need to be implemented, as the cost of straw mulch is 1. 9 times more expensive than traditional tillage. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} decay of initial surface roughness induced by simulated rainfall under different soil residue cover and to compare classical statistical indices with geostatistical parameters. A conventionally tilled loamy soil with low structure stability, thus prone to crusting was placed at 1 m 2 microplots. Each microplot received three successive rainfall events which bring about cumulative 25 mm, 50 mm and 75 mm at 65 mm h - 1 intensity. Five treatments without replication were tested with different corn straw quantities (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 Mg ha - 1). Soil surface microrelief was measured at the initial stage and after each simulated rainfall event. Five treatments and four surface stages were monitored, resulting in 20 data sets. Point elevation data were taken at 0. 03 m intervals using a pinmeter. Digital elevation models were generated and analysed using semivariograms. All data sets showed spatial dependence and spherical models were fitted to experimental semivariograms. A very significant relationship was found between the random roughness index, RR, and the sill of the semivariogram (C 0 +C 1). All the treatments showed a clear trend to sill value reduction with increasing precipitation. However, roughness decay was lower in treatments with higher <b>straw</b> <b>cover</b> (3 and 4 Mg ha - 1). Therefore, residue cover limited soil surface roughness decline. The control treatment, without straw, showed the lowest nugget effect (C 0), which means the lowest spatial discontinuity of all treatments in this study. The range of spatial dependence (a) also showed a trend to decrease with increased cumulative rain, which was most apparent in treatments without or with relatively low <b>straw</b> <b>cover</b> (0, 1 and 2 Mg ha - 1).
