They practiced total abstinence, and {{employed}} <b>social</b> <b>pressure</b> for temperance in Farmington. By 1847, 569 people {{were part of}} this society. This was a step forward as part of Dr. Eli Todd’s attack against alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Prostitution is {{considered}} sinful {{for both the}} prostitute and the customer; it reduces a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure, violating human dignity and harming society.

5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of <b>social</b> <b>pressure,</b> 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch {{also found that the}} effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research, {{the origins}} and functions of behavioural laterality remain largely unclear. One {{of the most striking}} unresolved issues is the fact that laterality generally occurs at the population-level. Why would the majority of the individuals of a population exhibit the same laterality, while individual-level laterality would yet provide the advantages in terms of improving behavioural efficiency? Are <b>social</b> <b>pressures</b> the key factor? Can <b>social</b> <b>pressures</b> induce alignment of laterality between the individuals of a population? Can the effect of <b>social</b> <b>pressures</b> overpass the effect of other possible determining factors (e. g. genes) ? We tested this important new hypothesis in humans, for the first time. We asked whether population-level laterality could stem from <b>social</b> <b>pressures.</b> Namely, we assessed <b>social</b> <b>pressures</b> on laterality in an interactive social behaviour: kissing on the cheek as a greeting. We performed observations in 10 cities of France. The observations took place in spots where people of the city meet and greet each other. We showed that: a) there is a population-level laterality for cheek kissing, with the majority of individuals being aligned in each city, and b) there is a variation between populations, with a laterality that depends on the city. These results were confirmed by our complementary data from questionnaires and internet surveys. These findings show that <b>social</b> <b>pressures</b> are involved in determining laterality. They demonstrate that population-level laterality can stem from <b>social</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R

5|$|Tensions in Johnson County {{remained}} high. On May 10, a Marshal named George Wellman, who {{had been}} appointed deputy U.S. Marshal by Marshall Rankin, was ambushed and killed by locals {{en route to the}} small community of Buffalo. The incident received national attention, with Wellman being the only Marshal to die in the war. His death was grieved by a large crowd, and his funeral service took place in St. Lukes Church, Buffalo. The 6th Cavalry who was sent to relieve the county of its violence, was said to be influenced by intense local political and <b>social</b> <b>pressure,</b> and they were unable to keep the peace. In one incident, a group of men set fire to the Post exchange and planted a homemade bomb in the cavalry's barracks. Noted officer Charles B. Gatewood was seriously injured by the bomb blast in the barracks; shattering his left arm and disabling him from serving in the Cavalry anymore.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} other {{microcredit}} methodologies, village banking eliminates collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving commercial bank loans) as a loan prerequisite. Instead, it relies on a system of cross-guarantees, where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of <b>social</b> <b>pressure</b> within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full. The admixture of cross-guarantees and <b>social</b> <b>pressure</b> {{makes it possible for}} even the poorest people to receive loans. This method has proven very effective for FINCA, yielding a repayment rate of over 97% in its worldwide network.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} {{reasoned}} action assumes that individuals consider a behaviour's consequences before performing the particular behaviour. As a result, intention {{is an important}} factor in determining behaviourive or negative together with the individual's impression of the way their society perceives the same behaviour. Thus, personal attitude and <b>social</b> <b>pressure</b> shape intention, which is essential to performance of a behaviour and consequently behavioural change.|$|E
40|$|Preventing {{transmission}} of H 1 N 1 and other infectious diseases can require individuals to change behaviors, but recommendations to change behavior can {{run counter to}} other powerful influences.

These behavioral conflicts are illustrated with an experience of the relative ineffectiveness of voluntary recommendations, which {{highlights the importance of}} considering these <b>social</b> <b>pressures</b> when determining what recommendations to make and how to make them.

It would have allowed employers the opportunity to terminate employment of workers under twenty-six without any reason, within their first two years of employment. Those opposed to the First Employment Contract were worried that it could compromise job security, encourage <b>social</b> <b>pressure</b> with a view to lowering wages, and impede employees in having legal recourse in cases of sexual harassment or other abuse, since this could lead to their subsequently being fired.|$|E
25|$|Camden's {{cultural}} {{history has been}} greatly affected by both its economic and social position over the years. From 1950 to 1970, industry plummeted, resulting in close to 20,000 jobs being lost for Camden residents. This mass unemployment as well as <b>social</b> <b>pressure</b> from neighboring townships caused an exodus of citizens, mostly white. This gap was filled by new African American and Latino citizens {{and led to a}} restructuring of Camden's communities. The number of White citizens who left to neighboring towns such as Collingswood or Cherry Hill left both new and old African American and Latino citizens to re-shape their community. To help in this process, numerous non-for-profit organizations such as Hopeworks or the Neighborhood Center were formed to facilitate Camden's movement into the 21st century.|$|E

In order to ascertain the usefulness of the behavioral intention model in predicting early retirement decisions, and further, to compare the attitudinal and normative components of the model with the traditional predictors favoring early retirement (poor health, adequate income), male industrial workers from six major plants in a midwestern city were interviewed.

25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect {{is the issue of}} body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the <b>social</b> <b>pressure</b> to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|E
25|$|Melisende's {{relationship}} with her son was complex. As a mother she would know her son and his capabilities, and she {{is known to have}} been particularly close to her children. As a ruler she may have been reluctant to entrust decision-making powers to an untried youth. Either way there was no political or <b>social</b> <b>pressure</b> to grant Baldwin any authority before 1152, even though Baldwin reached majority in 1145. Baldwin III and Melisende were jointly crowned as co-rulers on Christmas Day, 1143. This joint crowning was similar to Melisende's own crowning with her father in 1128, and may have reflected a growing trend to crown one's heir in the present monarch's lifetime, as demonstrated in other realms of this period.|$|E
