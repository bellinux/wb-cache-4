5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, if {{materials}} {{have failed to}} dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities {{even if it is}} not immediately visible.

In a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold remediation may be needed. Mold testing and inspections should be carried out by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to insure accurate results; free mold testing offered by remediation companies is not recommended.|$|E

2500|$|Herbert first {{encountered}} Parliament in 1934, {{when he brought}} the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons to court for selling liquor without a licence.

2500|$|A part of {{becoming}} a pirate was to meet the expectation of uprooting their living environment and spending {{most of their time}} out at sea. The men were required to live in cramped, claustrophobic quarters within close proximity of others. The discomfort could have created a more hostile environment, but it did not. While on the ship the pirates [...] "maintained a multicultural, multiracial, and multinational social order." [...] This new social order established a profound sense of community amongst the men. They consistently showed solidarity for each other and developed strong feelings of group loyalty. The communities of pirates were willing to join forces [...] "at sea and in port, even when the various crews were strangers to each other." [...] The positive communal atmosphere aboard ship created a home-like <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> were limited social and physical boundaries within the group.|$|E

[...] and [...] "The U.S. Interests Section’s diplomatic pouch is being increasingly used to bring funds and the means for the exercise of counterrevolutionary acts in Cuba to groups created and funded by the U.S. government. To sum up, we have a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> has been an increase in subversive actions, disrespect for Cuban laws, and open defiance of Cuba’s legal institutions, which all diplomatic representations should respect in their work in our country." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{computational}} geometry, this ham sandwich theorem {{leads to}} a computational problem, the ham sandwich problem. [...] In two dimensions, the problem is this: given a finite set of [...] points in the plane, each colored [...] "red" [...] or [...] "blue", find a ham sandwich cut for them. [...] First, [...] described an algorithm for the special, separated case. Here all red points are {{on one side of}} some line and all blue points are on the other side, a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> is a unique ham sandwich cut, which Megiddo could find in linear time. Later, [...] gave an algorithm for the general two-dimensional [...] case; the running time of their algorithm is , where the symbol [...] indicates the use of Big O notation. Finally, [...] found an optimal -time algorithm. This algorithm was extended to higher dimensions by [...] Given [...] sets of points in general position in -dimensional space, the algorithm computes a -dimensional hyperplane that has equal numbers of points of each of the sets in each of its half-spaces, i.e., a ham-sandwich cut for the given points.|$|E
2500|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{were unable to}} shut down the No.1 engine, which had to be doused by {{emergency}} crews for three hours after landing until flameout was achieved. The pilots considered whether to evacuate the plane immediately after landing as fuel was leaking from the left wing onto the brakes, which were extremely hot from maximum braking. The SCC pilot, David Evans, noted in an interview, [...] "We’ve got a <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> is fuel, hot brakes and an engine that we can’t shut down. And really the safest place was on board the aircraft until such time as things changed. So we had the cabin crew with an alert phase the whole time through ready to evacuate, open doors, inflate slides at any moment. As time went by, that danger abated and, thankfully, we were lucky enough to get everybody off very calmly and very methodically through one set of stairs." [...] The plane was on battery power and had to contend with only one VHF radio to coordinate emergency procedure with the local fire crew.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the things}} that have been {{happening}} lately are not merely things that one could joke about. They are themselves, truly and intrinsically, jokes. I mean that there is a sort of epigram of unreason in the situation itself, as there was in the <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>there</b> was jam yesterday and jam to-morrow but never jam to-day. Take, for instance, the extraordinary case of Sir Edward Carson. The point is not whether we regard his attitude in Belfast as the defiance of a sincere and dogmatic rebel, or as the bluff of a party hack and mountebank. The point is not whether we regard his defence of the Government at the Old Bailey as a chivalrous and reluctant duty done as an advocate or a friend, or as a mere case of a lawyer selling his soul for a fat brief. The point is that whichever of the two actions we approve, and whichever of the four explanations we adopt, Sir Edward's position is still raving nonsense. On any argument, he cannot escape from his dilemma. It may be argued that laws and customs should be obeyed whatever our private feelings; and that it is an established custom to accept a brief in such a case. But then it is a somewhat more established custom to obey an Act of Parliament and to keep the peace. It may be argued that extreme misgovernment justifies men in Ulster or elsewhere in refusing to obey the law. But then it would justify them even more in refusing to appear professionally in a law court. Etiquette cannot be at once so unimportant that Carson may shoot at the King's uniform, and yet so important that he must always be ready to put on his own. The Government cannot be so disreputable that Carson need not lay down his gun, and yet so respectable that he is bound to put on his wig. Carson cannot at once be so fierce that he can kill in what he considers a good cause, and yet so meek that he must argue in what he considers a bad cause. Obedience or disobedience, conventional or unconventional, a solicitor's letter cannot be more sacred than the King's writ; a blue bag cannot be more rational than the British flag. The thing is rubbish read anyway, and the only difficulty is to get a joke good enough to express it. It is a case for the Court Jester. The phantasy of it could only be expressed by some huge ceremonial hoax. Carson ought to be crowned with the shamrocks and emeralds and followed by green-clad minstrels of the Clan-na-Gael, playing [...] "The Wearing of the Green." ...|$|E
