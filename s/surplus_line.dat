50|$|Although <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> {{insurers}} {{are still}} {{regulated by the}} states (or countries) {{in which they are}} actually admitted, the disadvantages of obtaining insurance from a <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> insurer are that the policy will usually be written on a nonstandard form (that is, not from the Insurance Services Office), and if the insurer collapses, its insureds in states in which it is nonadmitted will not enjoy certain types of protection available to insureds in the states (or countries) in which the insurer is admitted. However, for persons trying to obtain coverage for unusual risks, the choice is usually between a <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> insurer or no coverage at all.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} {{artifact of}} the state-based insurance regulation {{system in the}} United States is the dichotomy between admitted and surplus insurers. Insurers in the U.S. may be [...] "admitted", meaning {{that they have been}} formally admitted to a state's insurance market by the state insurance commissioner, and are subject to various state laws governing organization, capitalization, policy forms, rate approvals, and claims handling. Or they may be [...] "surplus", meaning that they are nonadmitted in a particular state but are willing to write coverage there. <b>Surplus</b> <b>line</b> insurers are supposed to underwrite only very unusual or difficult-to-insure risks, to prevent them from undermining each state's ability to regulate its insurance market. Although experienced insurance brokers are well aware of what risks an admitted insurer will not accept, they must document a [...] "diligent effort" [...] at actually shopping around a risk to several admitted insurers (typically three, who will promptly reject it) before applying for coverage with a <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> insurer.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{currently}} two competing compacts or agreements: the Surplus Lines Multistate Compliance Compact (“SLIMPACT”) and the Nonadmitted Insurance Multi-State Agreement (“NIMA”).

States that have not enacted such legislation include California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas, which account for approximately 50% of <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> premium.

5000|$|To relieve {{insurers}} and brokers of that tedious and time-consuming chore, many states now maintain [...] "export lists" [...] of risks {{that the state}} insurance commissioner has already identified as having no coverage available whatsoever from any admitted insurer in the state.

40|$|Consumer’s surplus {{can be seen}} as {{a correct}} measure of the change in welfare under special {{conditions}} on the preferences of the consumer. The note addresses the question whether the intuitive appeal of the consumer’s surplus concept in the one-price change case extends into cases where several prices of inter-related goods change.

Sufficient conditions for this attribution to be exactly consistent with the geometry of the consumer’s <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> integral are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{two classes}} of nontraditional models for the (dis) {{equilibrium}} network design problem and uses these to describe research needed to advance the state-of-the art {{in the design of}} both static and dynamic networks. The static equilibrium design model emphasized herein recalls an important earlier result that allows the equilibrium network design problem to be stated as a single level mathematical program (SMP), a result which is surprisingly little known; it also introduces for the first time nonseparable elastic transportation demands and attendant difficulties in evaluating the consumers' <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> integral. The dynamic, disequilibrium network design model emphasized herein maintains the usual design objective of maximizing some measure of social welfare, but recognizes that traffic on a network is not necessarily in equilibrium and that capacity changes to the network must induce transient phenomena not captured by invocation of the static version of Wardrop's first principle (user equilibrium). It is argued that such disequilibrium models by their very nature avoid temporal versions of Braess' paradox familiar from static equilibrium design and are naturally formulated as optimal control problems. Moreover, properly formulated disequilibrium design models are shown to overcome difficulties associated with evaluating the consumers' <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> integral. Furthermore, when the associated disequilibrium dynamics are stable, these optimal control formulations are observed to be capable of computing static equilibrium network designs. ...|$|E

40|$|Essay I. Based on {{some results}} of Chipman and Moore (1990, 1991), {{we show that}} most {{frequently}} used pre- 1970 functional forms for utility or demand functions do fall into the Gorman family of preferences, especially their characterization of two special members [...] preferences generating demands homothetic to a fixed origin and parallel preferences, where welfare analyses never {{need to use the}} questionable, though conventional, Marshallian consumer surplus as an welfare change indicator if any of these functional forms is assumed in the applied work (except the Rotterdam system). We also look at the three most popular flexible forms developed after 1970 [...] the translog, the AIDS and the generalized Leontief functions [...] and find out the types of Gorman family members and the price-income restrictions under which these members are representable by these three forms. Some extensions based on these flexible forms are made and some implications are also observed. ^ Essay II. It is well known that a line integral is path independent if the domain where the line integral is conducted is a simply connected open set and the Jacobian matrix of the integrand at any point in the domain is symmetric. When a line integral is path dependent on a certain domain, our result can be used to obtain a subset (defined by the constancy of some homogeneous functions) of that domain where the line integral is path independent. This result is also applied to the Marshallian consumer <b>surplus</b> <b>line</b> integral where we show that it is always path independent on the price-income set that maintains constant marginal utility of income. This result, however, does not resolve all the issues around the use of the Marshallian consumer surplus as a welfare change indicator. ^ Essay III. We synthesize and extend Smith (1968), Lusky (1975, 1976) and others 2 ̆ 7 results allowing common property resources, waste discharge, clean-up and recycling activities as well as ordinary private commodities and economic activities to be included within a dynamic model. We compare the social optimum with the competitive result to show that environmental management through either (1) a direct control on resources extraction and waste discharges, (2) a tax/subsidy scheme on extracting, discharging and recycling activities, or (3) a marketable permit system allowing reallocation of property rights through a free market mechanism from any arbitrarily set initial assignment of property rights will help attain the social optimum. While this result is well-known for externalities in a static framework, we derive it in a dynamic framework. ^ We also show that, the pursuit of higher GNP is not a problem in a dynamic context; what constitutes a problem is a society without recognition of environmental constraints and without remedial environmental policies. ...|$|E
