6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} taking {{a glass of}} {{lemonade}} to the lady in blue sitting on the settee over there by the statue," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>carefully.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look like}} the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>carefully</b> tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a little}} surprising, you know," [...] he <b>said</b> very <b>carefully,</b> [...] "if I may say so--and {{considering}} what happened--to hear you ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That way!" [...] <b>said</b> Bruno, <b>carefully</b> {{turning her}} round {{with her face}} to the wood. [...] "Now, walk {{backwards}} walk gently--don't be frightened: oo sha'n't trip!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Knight {{finished}} carving {{himself a}} helping of beef, {{and let the}} knife fall with a clatter into the dish. Then he <b>said</b> in <b>carefully</b> chosen words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must come}} round. Slip down, and climb {{up on the}} {{opposite}} side as the sail swings over," [...] I <b>said,</b> <b>carefully</b> shoving the tiller down.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was how she}} {{had felt}} again, and her hold on him {{tightened}} with sudden joy. So well he knew what that grip meant! He did not tell {{her that he had}} not loved her fully until now. He would have liked to tell her how true love had been born in him as he saw her stealing back to him, but it was surely best for her not to know that any transformation had been needed. [...] "I don't say that I love you more now than ever before," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>carefully,</b> [...] "but one thing I do know: that I never admired you quite so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let no one imagine," [...] Lady Peggy <b>said,</b> <b>carefully</b> {{knocking}} {{the end of}} a cigarette upon the table, [...] "that I am going to try to catch the eyes of all you women, and go sailing away with my nose in the air to look at engravings in the drawing-room. You can just get up and go when you like, any or all of you. There are bridge tables laid out for you in the library, music and a hopping girl--I don't call it dancing--in the drawing-room, a pool in the billiard-room, or flirtation in the winter-garden. Coffee and liqueurs will follow you wherever you go. Take your choice, good people. For myself, the Duke is telling me stories of Cairo. J'y suis, j'y reste. I'm only thankful no one else can hear them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis assuredly the prince's signet," [...] the man <b>said,</b> after <b>carefully</b> {{examining}} it, [...] "and right gladly will I escort you to him. He is, at present, at Aberystwith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're holdin' {{a council}} o' war," [...] <b>said</b> Bounce, <b>carefully</b> {{examining}} the priming of his piece. [...] "It's as like as not they'll attack us, but they'll get a hearty and an oncommonly warm welcome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] <b>said</b> he, <b>carefully,</b> [...] "it means a fly guy that's wise to the all-night push--see? It's a hot {{sport that}} you can't bump {{to the rail}} {{anywhere}} between the Flatirons--see? I guess that's about what it means." ...|$|R
5000|$|Put out {{by finding}} himself not {{southern}} enough for this New Englander, [...] "'Lady,' Rydell <b>said</b> <b>carefully,</b> 'I think you're crazier than a sack full of assholes.' Her eyebrows shot up. 'There,' she said. 'There what?' 'Color, Mr. Rydell. Fire. The brooding verbal polychromes of an almost unthinkably advanced decay.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Supporters of inclusivism include Saint Julian of Norwich, Augustus Hopkins Strong, C. S. Lewis, John Wesley, [...] Clark Pinnock, Karl Rahner, John E. Sanders, Terrance L. Tiessen (Reformed) and Robert Brush (contributor to The Arminian Magazine). While Billy Graham {{faithfully}} preached [...] "salvation {{by faith}} in Christ alone" [...] throughout his 60-year ministry as an evangelist, he has recently made controversial comments that border on inclusivism (but {{he does not}} like to refer to it by the term, because he is concerned that many people mean universalism when they refer to inclusivism). Graham has said, “I used to play God but I can’t do that any more. I used to believe that pagans in far-off countries were lost {{and were going to}} hell—if they did not have the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them. I no longer believe that,” he <b>said</b> <b>carefully.</b> “I believe that there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God—through nature, for instance—and plenty of other opportunities, therefore, of saying ’yes’ to God.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see that," [...] <b>said</b> Clym, <b>carefully</b> concealing every clue {{to his own}} {{interrupted}} intention, {{which she}} plainly had not guessed. [...] "You might marry a professional man, or somebody of that sort, by going into the town to live and forming acquaintances there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose, Mr. Plunkett," [...] <b>said</b> Morgan, <b>carefully</b> {{seasoning}} {{an alligator}} pear, [...] "that {{you are aware}} of the fact that you will import a good deal of trouble for yourself into Kentucky if you take back the wrong man--that is, of course, if you take anybody back?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Stewart is <b>said</b> to have <b>carefully</b> {{researched}} this song; {{according to}} one account, he read [...] "forty books" [...] before writing it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The clerks,' <b>said</b> Mrs. Sparsit, <b>carefully</b> {{brushing}} an imperceptible {{crumb of}} bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, 'are trustworthy, punctual, and industrious, of course?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are sweets for Lillo and Ninna," [...] she <b>said,</b> as Romola <b>carefully</b> {{lifted up}} the light parcels in the basket, {{and placed the}} {{ornaments}} below them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, Ben, {{you are not}} so ignorant as that," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. Garth, <b>carefully</b> serious. [...] "Hark, {{there is}} a knock at the door! Run, Letty, and open it." ...|$|R
6000|$|By-and-by {{the master}} came back, {{and called him}} from his hiding-place. Something had put out his temper, for with a frown he <b>said,</b> 'Watch <b>carefully</b> our ways in the house, and beware of making any mistake, or it will go ill with you. Keep your eyes and ears open, and your mouth shut, obey without questions. Be {{grateful}} if you will, but never speak unless you are spoken to.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{familiar}} name, {{the kind}} tone, made the plain face brighten with pleasure as its owner <b>said,</b> while she <b>carefully</b> filled a pretty {{bowl with a}} golden mixture rich with fresh eggs and country milk-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{big brown}} eyes looked {{up for an}} instant, as if to learn whether the {{question}} was asked in good faith, and then their owner <b>said,</b> as he <b>carefully</b> picked apart another nut, [...] "Toby Tyler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Pale-faces may go now {{and talk}} with the braves," [...] <b>said</b> San-it-sa-rish, after <b>carefully</b> {{examining}} everything {{that was given to}} him; [...] "a council will be called soon, and we will smoke the pipe of peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you don't}} {{want to see}} it any more, or even {{remember}} you ever saw it," [...] <b>said</b> Mr. Hamlin, <b>carefully</b> tearing the note into small pieces and letting them drift from the windows like blown blossoms.|$|R
6000|$|For a {{considerable}} {{time they were}} silent, the one busily engaged writing, the other engrossed with a book. At last Mr Welton senior heaved a deep sigh, and <b>said,</b> while he <b>carefully</b> dotted an i and stroked a t-- ...|$|R
50|$|From ICS Africa’s {{work with}} communities, many {{valuable}} lessons that drive ICS Africa’s innovations today have been drawn. ICS Africa’s core thinking and approaches have evolved from charity interventions to approaches that delve {{deeper into the}} complexities of the forces that combine to deny children and their societies’ fuller and dignifying life experiences. ICS Africa is <b>said</b> to <b>carefully</b> consider how best their work with communities can vest the most respect and power in people themselves to own, shape and drive their lives.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{probably}} have a class of dirty little girls, and {{teach them how to}} sew, as I can't do anything else. They won't learn much, but steal, and break, and mess, and be a dreadful trial, and I shall get laughed at and wish I hadn't done it. Still I shall try it, and sacrifice my fancy-work to the cause of virtue," [...] <b>said</b> Ella, <b>carefully</b> putting away her satin glove-case with a fond glance at the delicate flowers she so loved to embroider.|$|R
50|$|Some Democrats also objected that Griffith {{had practiced}} law {{for four years}} as BYU's General Counsel without obtaining a Utah law license. His {{defenders}} pointed out {{that it had been}} the longstanding position of the Utah bar—as explained {{in a letter to the}} Senate Judiciary Committee by five former Utah Bar Presidents—that in-house counsel in Utah do not need to be licensed in the state, provided they associate closely with Utah bar members when giving legal advice. Griffith <b>said</b> he <b>carefully</b> followed this practice during his time at BYU.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{take care}} of them for you, if you will tell me how, and they can live in my turtle-tank just as well as not," [...] said Demi, who found them more {{interesting}} even that his beloved slow turtles. So Dan gave him directions about the wants and habits of the crabs, and Demi bore them away to introduce them to their new home and neighbors. [...] "What a good boy he is!" [...] <b>said</b> Dan, <b>carefully</b> settling the first butterfly, and remembering that Demi had given up his walk to bring it to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what Merry {{said when}} she and Molly came in on their way home. But Molly felt dreadfully, and so did Mabel. She brought me these flowers to press, for we {{are all going to}} keep some to {{remember}} dear Ed by," [...] <b>said</b> Jill, <b>carefully</b> smoothing out the little bells as she laid the lilies in her hymn-book, for she too had had a thoughtful hour while she lay alone, imagining all that went on in the church, and shedding a few tender tears over the friend who was always so kind to her.|$|R
50|$|Pike is <b>said</b> to have <b>carefully</b> {{measured}} the route {{from his house}} to Calais, and then placed these stones sometime between his purchase of the Mansion House and his death in 1882. He is also said to have used them {{as a means to}} gauge the performance of his horses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fetch me the scales; now then, doctor, hold 'em," [...] <b>said</b> the captain, <b>carefully</b> {{weighing}} out {{a portion}} of biscuit and meat which he handed {{to one of the}} men. This process was continued until all had been supplied, after which a small quantity of water and lime-juice was also measured out to each.|$|R
6000|$|... "How am I to {{help you}} out of this?" [...] <b>said</b> the surgeon, <b>carefully</b> {{examining}} his patient, as he might now be called. A little close observation showed that the man's arms were strapped by buckles into the fans, while one of his legs was caught up in some elastic coils of the mechanism.|$|R
6000|$|Without much {{attending}} to what his friend <b>said,</b> Colonel Everard <b>carefully</b> studied the warrant of Cromwell. [...] "It is bolder and more peremptory than I expected," [...] he said. [...] "The General must feel himself strong, when he opposes his own authority so directly {{to that of}} the Council of State and the Parliament." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As far as I {{can see it}} is {{perfectly}} clean now," [...] Dr. Bemish <b>said,</b> after <b>carefully</b> examining it with the glass. [...] "We will put a compress on, with a wet cloth over it, which must be damped with iced water every half-hour. When we quite get the inflammation down, Glover, which will, I hope, be {{in two or three}} days, we will bandage it tightly, and I will buy you a pair of stays on shore, and lace you up so that there shall be no chance of your performing any more pranks with it, and then I fancy {{you will be able to}} come up on deck, if you will promise to keep yourself quiet there." ...|$|R
