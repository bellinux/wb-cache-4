5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Claudius was a heretic in {{the view}} of Dungal and Jonas of Orléans, who later wrote to refute some of his teachings {{at the request of the}} emperor.

5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications that bind lead <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E

5|$|On April 8, 2014, Microsoft {{released}} the Windows 8.1 Update, which included all past updates plus new features. It was unveiled by Microsoft vice president Joe Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014, and detailed in full at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2. Belfiore {{noted that the}} update would lower the minimum system requirements for Windows, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be installed on devices with as little as 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative update is distributed through Windows Update, and must be installed {{in order to receive}} any further patches for Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ is an {{electric}} organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various {{models have been}} produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating {{an electric}} current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> drive a speaker cabinet. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} {{to have a sense}} of unpredictability <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, {{was designed to}} be simple so it would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E

5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E
5|$|There {{were rumors}} that Joseph McClure, the Chief Justice who had sworn him into office, {{intended}} to have Baxter either arrested or killed, ostensibly because Baxter had replaced W. W. Wilshire, a Minstrel, with Robert C. Newton, an ex-Confederate, {{as head of}} the state militia. U.S. Attorney General Williams contacted Baxter and suggested that he ask for federal troops for protection again. A letter from President Grant followed, offering protection. The Grant administration usually followed Powell Clayton's lead where Arkansas matters were concerned, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be concluded that the former governor was still supporting Baxter. The Republican Party of Arkansas, still controlled by the Minstrel faction, issued a statement denouncing Brooks' attempt to contest the election, which was published in the Little Rock Republican on October 8, 1873 and signed by all the major members of the party, including Clayton. However, the Minstrels would soon turn on Baxter for not following the party line.|$|E
5|$|US 113's role between Milford and Dover became {{secondary}} {{with the}} designation and extension of DE 1 {{throughout the state}} {{in conjunction with the}} proposed US 13 Relief Route, which is now the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway from Dover Air Force Base to Christiana. DE1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and concurrently with DE 14 along the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line at Fenwick Island in 1973. DE1 was co-signed with DE14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1976, when DE14 was truncated at Milford. The DE1 designation was extended north by 1988 along US113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US13 toward Christiana to connect sections of the Relief Route as they were completed. In 1991, DelDOT enacted corridor preservation measures on DE 1, including its concurrency with US 113, from Dover Air Force Base to Nassau to prevent excessive development along the corridor <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> gradually be transformed into a freeway.|$|E
