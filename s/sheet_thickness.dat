2500|$|Explanation of {{accelerated}} glacial coastward {{movement and}} iceberg calving fails to consider another causal factor: increased {{weight of the}} central highland ice sheet. As the central ice sheet thickens, which it has for at least seven decades, its greater weight causes more horizontal outward force at the bedrock. This in turn appears to have increased glacial calving at the coasts. Visual evidence for increased central highland ice <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness</b> exists in the numerous aircraft that have made forced landings on the icecap since the 1940s. They landed {{on the surface and}} later disappeared under the ice. [...] A notable example is the Lockheed P-38F Lightning World War II fighter plane Glacier Girl that was exhumed from 268 feet of ice in 1992 and restored to flying condition after being buried for over 50 years. It was recovered by members of the Greenland Expedition Society after years of searching and excavation, eventually transported to Kentucky and restored to flying condition.|$|E

With this enhancement {{it is possible to}} produce parts made of high and highest strength steel with outstanding quality, high complexity and low tool wear. Additionally laser hardening has been implemented to adjust the mechanical properties of metal parts within the process. Currently the process is limited to lower <b>sheet</b> <b>thicknesses</b> (< 2 mm) to maintain short cycle times.

40|$|For cutting {{applications}} of <b>sheet</b> <b>thicknesses</b> up to 1 mm a compact diode laser system of high brilliance has been developed. By {{the combination of}} three different wavelengths {{as well as two}} polarization states six linear polarized diode laser bars are superimposed nearly without loss in beam quality. The maximum optical output power amounts to 155 W at a beam parameter product of about 22 mm mrad. The wavelength- and polarization-multiplexing is realized with one cemented optical component consisting of edge filters, a / 4 -retardation plate and a polarization beam splitter. The linear shaped beam of the six superimposed diode laser bars is symmetrized by micro step mirror beam shaping technology. Limited by manufacturing tolerances and particularly the mounting process of the diode laser bars, the system reaches the limits of incoherent beam multiplexing of six broad area diode laser bars. Combined with beam expanding and focussing optics, cutting experiments on differen t metallic and organic materials with <b>sheet</b> <b>thicknesses</b> ranging from 0. 1 to 1 mm have been realized...|$|R

50|$|Another {{failure mode}} {{that may occur}} without any tearing is ductile {{fracture}} after plastic deformation (ductility). This may occur {{as a result of}} bending or shear deformation (inplane or through the thickness). The failure mechanism may be due to void nucleation and expansion on a microscopic level. Microcracks and subsequent macrocracks may appear when deformation of the material between the voids has exceeded the limit. Extensive research has focused in recent years on understanding and modeling ductile fracture. The approach has been to identify ductile forming limits using various small-scale tests that show different strain ratios or stress triaxialities. An effective measure of this type of forming limit is the minimum radius in roll-forming applications (half the <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness</b> for materials with good and three times the <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness</b> for materials with low formability).|$|E
50|$|As {{the metal}} draws into the die the {{thickness}} of the sheet decreases near in the lower region of the punch.

40|$|We study {{equilibrium}} {{configurations of}} non-Euclidean plates, {{in which the}} reference metric is uniaxially periodic. This work is motivated by recent experiments on thin sheets of composite thermally responsive gels [1]. Such sheets bend perpendicularly to the periodic axis in order to alleviate the metric discrepancy. For abruptly varying metrics, we identify multiple scaling regimes with different power law dependences of the elastic energy and the axial curvature κ on the <b>sheet's</b> <b>thickness</b> h. In the h→ 0 limit the equilibrium configuration tends to an isometric embedding of the reference metric, and ∼ h^ 2. Two intermediate asymptotic regimes emerge in between the buckling threshold and the h→ 0 limit, in which the energy scales either like h^ 4 / 5 or like h^ 2 / 3. We believe that this system exemplifies a much more general phenomenon, in which the <b>thickness</b> of the <b>sheet</b> induces a cutoff length scale below which finer structures of the metric cannot be observed. When the reference metric consists of several separated length scales, a decrease of the <b>sheet's</b> <b>thickness</b> results in a sequence of conformational changes, as finer properties of the reference metric are revealed.

In this study, the effects of varying honeycomb core ribbon orientation and varying face <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness’s</b> have on the flexural behavior of honeycomb sandwich structures was investigated. Honeycomb sandwich panels were constructed using Hexcel 6367 A 250 - 5 H carbon fiber face sheets and Hexcel Nomex HRH- 10 - 1 / 8 - 5 honeycomb cores. The mechanical properties of the constituent materials were discovered experimentally using ASTM standards and theoretical models using honeycomb mechanics and classical beam and plate theory are described. A failure mode map for loading under three point bending is developed from previous works by Triantafillou and Gibson 26, showing the dependence of failure mode on face <b>sheet</b> to core <b>thickness</b> and honeycomb core ribbon orientation. Beam specimens are tested {{with the effects of}} Honeycomb core ribbon orientation and unequal face <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness’s</b> examined. Experimental data sufficiently agrees with theoretical predictions. A finite element model was developed in ABAQUS/CAE to validate experimental and analytical analysis and produced agreeable results. Optimal bending stiffness and strength with respect to minimum weight was analyzed.

5000|$|Sheet {{resistance}} {{is a special}} case of resistivity for a uniform <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness.</b> Commonly, resistivity (also known as bulk resistance, specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) is in units of Ω·m, which is more completely stated in units of Ω·m2/m (Ω·area/length). When divided by the <b>sheet</b> <b>thickness</b> (m), the units are Ω·m·(m/m)/m = Ω.

All are assoicated {{with the passage}} of an interplanetary shock and the region of variable solar wind pressure behind it. The general geometry of field reversing current sheets is discussed, and this geometry is examined for the cases studied, by using the ISEE 1 and 2 coorbiting satellite data sets. A new technique is employed which removes the effects of a variable sheet normal velocity for the first time. This allows us to calculate firm upper bounds on the current <b>sheet</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> and by utilizing certain physically motivated assumptions, determine the most probable actual <b>sheet</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> and inclinations of the field lines within these sheets. Current density profiles derived with this technique show the main cross-tail current sheet to be a structure that is many thermal ion-gyroradii thick and which is sometimes imbedded in a region that is three or more times thicker and contains much smaller current densities. These profiles also exhibit a considerable amount of fine structure in the sheet which appears as narrow peaks in the current density distributions. Possible explanations for these structures, and for the overall sheet structure itself, are examined...|$|R
