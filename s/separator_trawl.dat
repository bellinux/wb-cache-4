40|$|Fishing {{trials to}} {{investigate}} the effectiveness of separator trawls in the local Nephrops fishery were carried out by two Stornoway vessels using parallel haul techniques. A two-level <b>separator</b> <b>trawl</b> towed alongside commercial dual purpose gears matched them haul for haul in landings of both Nephrops and finfish. The reduction in roundfish discards, expected from using a larger mesh size in the upper codend of the <b>separator</b> <b>trawl,</b> proved disappointing. Further trials are proposed to examine and improve the selectivity of the <b>separator</b> <b>trawl...</b>|$|E
40|$|Georges Bank haddock is a {{recently}} recovered fish {{stock in the}} New England groundfish fishery. Due to federal constraints under the Magnuson-Steven Act, however, this stock cannot be optimally exploited due to the bycatch of other critical species in the New England groundfishery such as cod and yellowtail flounder which are overfished. The Ruhle trawl and <b>Separator</b> <b>trawl</b> are examples of recent advances in gear technology that {{have been shown to}} significantly increase haddock to bycatch ratios. This study models the groundfish fishery through a mixed stock yield model which incorporates technological interactions. We also develop a socio-economic model that quantifies the amount of employment and producer surplus associated with three trawl types. Our results explore policy situations regarding the use of the new trawls. By bridging the biological and socio-economic models, we are able to view the fishery as a system that more accurately represents stakeholder views. Our model shows that each trawl, when used exclusively, produces different optimum strategies and therefore an optimum management strategy would most likely include a combination of trawl types. Our results also support the logic of using modified trawls for haddock fishing trips in which bycatch is strictly regulated as the Ruhle trawl is able to maintain 80 % of catches caught by a conventional trawl while reducing bycatch up to over 60 %. This paper is a first step towards an aid for policy makers to examine fishery gear trade-offs and the resulting biological and socio-economic consequences of different management actions within the constraints of the Magnuson-Stevens Act...|$|E
40|$|Turtle {{fishing was}} banned in India from 1977 as turtles were {{declared}} as protected animals under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (protection) Act 1972 as per the amendments {{made to the}} schedule in September 1977. Similar restrictions were observed in many other countries. In spite of these restrictions, there is illegal fishing for turtles in some countries. Apart from these illegal activities, there is considerable amount of incidental mortality of turtles due to fishing activities like trawling and gill netting. India, Australia and the USA are the major contributors to the mortality of turtles due to fishing activities, particularly the prawn fishing operations. In 1980, a unique <b>separator</b> <b>trawl</b> design called the Turtle Excluder Device (TED) {{was developed by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of USA to reduce the incidental capture of endangered sea turtles by shrimp trawls. The NMFS developed a number of TED designs to improve their functioning. From 1993 shrimp season onwards, USA implemented revised federal TED regulations which are more effective in reducing turtle mortality. India also started testing different types of imported TEDs in view of the US embargo on imports from countries not implementing TEDs. Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), Fishery Survey of India (FSI) and Central Institute of Fisheries Navigation and Engineering Training (CIFNET) conducted experiments with imported TEDs. These experiments could not impress the fishermen as there are no comparable data from the traditional trawl nets and trawl nets with TEDs simultaneously. Field trials of the CIFT-TED have been carried out off Cochin, Visakhapatnam and Paradeep. CIFT-TED is now being popularized in maritime states in collaboration with MPEDA and respective state fisheries departments. In spite of all the assurances of the government agencies in India, the USA, Australia and other shrimp trawling countries, fishermen still feel that there is considerable escapement of shrimp with TEDs attached trawl nets which is the major bottleneck affecting implementation of TEDs in India and elsewhere...|$|E
