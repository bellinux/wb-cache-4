50|$|In {{criminal}} procedures, {{the court}} assigns an accused with a defence counsel in so-called “necessary defence” cases if the accused has not already retained himself a lawyer. In practice, however, usually the court appoints the lawyer which the accused had already chosen for his mandatory representation. Necessary defence {{means that the}} accused is charged with a felony that is punishable by a minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment, is tried before a higher court, already is detained on remand or otherwise not considered able to defend himself. The entitlement of an accused to have counsel assigned to him in cases of mandatory legal representation is irrespective of indigence. The court-assigned defence lawyer is entitled to claim his fees from the state budget. Like in civil proceedings, however, the legal aid fees are lower than fees the lawyer could otherwise claim from the client. Every lawyer can be appointed by the court as a public defender scheme {{does not exist in}} Germany. If the accused loses the case, i.e. he becomes a convict, the court imposes the court fees and the costs of defence on the defendant. After conviction, the court-appointed lawyer can choose whether to execute his claim against his convicted client or against the treasury. Normally, if his client is indigent, the lawyer will seek payment from the <b>solvent</b> <b>debtor,</b> the state. If a case does not require “necessary defence”, an accused, who cannot pay a lawyer, is not entitled to be provided with counsel paid by the state but must defend himself.|$|E
40|$|The article {{views the}} current {{financial}} crisis from {{the background of}} long term structural socio-economic changes in advanced industrial societies. Central points are {{the rise of the}} middle classes {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century, the accumulation of financial wealth in the middle classes in combination with a continuing high and even increasing concentration of financial assets at the level of the top rich, and the advance of pension and investment funds as a new type of collective actors at global financial markets. These changes go parallel with an economic development which is characterized by increasing instability, declining growth rates and financial crises. The paper tries to clarify the interconnections between these phenomena in the framework of a multi-level analysis which culminates in the model of a “collective Buddenbrooks-effect”: A structural upward mobility of society will lead to an increasing imbalance at capital markets, since on the one hand the volume of financial assets searching for profitable investment will rise, whereas on the other hand the social reservoir of <b>solvent</b> <b>debtors</b> and promising investment opportunities will decline. Therefore, advanced industrial economies are characterized by a bias towards capital export and excessive financial liquidity, with the well known consequences of low economic growth rates and the danger of speculative bubbles at the global capital markets. The middle classes who originally benefitted from the post-war prosperity, are negatively affected too. The author argues that the current crisis cannot be understood sufficiently without taking account of these structural socio-economic backgrounds...|$|R

40|$|The article {{views the}} current {{financial}} crisis from {{the background of}} long term socio-economic changes in ad-vanced industrial societies. Central points are the rise of middle classes, the accumulation of financial wealth in the upper strata of middle classes in combination with an increasing concentration of financial assets {{at the level of}} the top rich, and the advance of pension and investment funds as collective actors at financial markets. The paper analyses the interconnections between these developments in the framework of a multilevel model, culminating in the thesis of a collective “Buddenbrooks”-effect: a structural upward mobility of society will lead to an increasing imbalance at capital markets because a strongly rising volume of financial assets searching profitable investment opportunities will go parallel with a decline of the social reservoir of <b>solvent</b> entrepre-neurial <b>debtors.</b> Therefore, advanced industrial economies are faced with chronic excess liquidity and export surpluses at capital markets, leading to the build-up of speculative bubbles and subsequent crashes. The author argues that the present crisis cannot be understood properly without taking account of these backgrounds. I.
