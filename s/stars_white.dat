The Continental Congress adopted the following resolution on June 14, 1777: [...] "Resolved, that {{the flag of}} the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen <b>stars,</b> <b>white,</b> on a blue field, representing a new constellation." [...] There was a delay in displaying this flag. The resolution was not signed by the secretary of the Congress until September 3, though it was previously printed in the newspapers. Massachusetts reinforcements to Fort Schuyler brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag. Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes; scarlet material was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat. A voucher shows that Congress paid Capt. Swartwout for his coat for the flag.|$|E
