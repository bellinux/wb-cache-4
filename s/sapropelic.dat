The pre-sapropelic sediments at the basal section of the cores reflect the lake stage of the Marmara Sea when it was isolated both from the Black and Mediterranean seas. First colonization of foraminifers at about 11 – 10. 4 ky BP indicate the beginning of marine conditions following the entry of Mediterranean waters through the Çanakkale Strait. <b>Sapropelic</b> sediments deposited at about 10. 3 – 6. 2 ky BP were associated with enhanced productivity of the surface waters, as inferred from the confined abundance of Globigerina bulloides in <b>sapropelic</b> zones.

So it is significant to carry out quantitative study on occluded hydrocarbon. In this paper, the occluded hydrocarbon volume of the main basins in China was calculated depending on their types, abundances and evolution stages {{by means of the}} forward method (experimental simulation) and the inversion method (geologic profile dissection). And then, occluded hydrocarbon evolution models were established for five types of source rocks (<b>sapropelic,</b> <b>sapropelic</b> prone hybrid, humic prone hybrid, humic and coal). It is shown that the hydrocarbon expulsion efficiency of <b>sapropelic</b> and <b>sapropelic</b> prone hybrid excellent source rocks is lower than 30 % at the low-maturity stage, 30 %– 60 % at the principal oil generation stage, and 50 %– 80 % at the high-maturity stage, which are all about 10 % higher than that of humic prone hybrid and humic source rocks at the corresponding stages.

We investigated the oilâoil correlation, the effects of gas washing and maturity, {{as well as the}} distinguishing parameters of humic and <b>sapropelic</b> condensates, and have come to the following conclusion. The carbon isotopic patterns of condensates and oils in the Ordovician strata of Tarim Basin are very similar, indicating they originate from the same type of source rocks. The condensates from Dawanqi oil field and Yinan 2, as well as Ti'ergen and Yitikelike gas fields, have similar carbon isotopic patterns. Thus, they probably have originated from the same terrestrial Jurassic source rock.

The experimental samples are low mature <b>sapropelic</b> shale from the Xiamaling Formation in North China; the experimental devices are high-temperature and high pressured golden tube system and normal autoclave thermal simulation; gas generation simulation experiments of original kerogen, residual kerogen and oil from the same shale are developed. It is concluded that: (1) the gas generated from kerogen directly accounts for about 20 % after the oil generation peak period. The main gas generating stage is from 422  °C to 566  °C (RO =  1. 3 %– 2. 5 %), and the amount produces 85. 5 %. (2) The value of ln (C 1 /C 2) and ln (C 2 /C 3) increase with the growth of evolution degree for both kerogen cracking gas and oil cracking gas.

40|$|Samples {{from two}} lignite seams (Lower Seam, Upper Seam) of the Lavanttal basin (Austria) and {{additional}} xylite were investigated for variations in maceral composition, petrography-based facies indicators, bulk geochemical parameters, and molecular composition of hydrocarbons. Both seams originated in a topogenous mire and evolved within a transgressive setting. The final drowning of the mire {{is indicated by}} <b>sapropelic</b> shales. Whereas the <b>sapropelic</b> shale overlying the Lower Seam was deposited in a freshwater lake, the <b>sapropelic</b> shale above the Upper Seam represents a brackish lake. Numerous relationships are found between petrography-based facies indicators and the geochemical composition of organic matter. The contents of macerals of the liptinite group are positively correlated with soluble organic matter (SOM) yields and hydrogen index (HI). Consistent with maceral composition and high HI values, enhanced proportions of short-chain n-alkanes, which are predominantly found in algae and microorganisms, are obtained from samples of the <b>sapropelic</b> shales. The final drowning of the mire is reflected by decreasing pristane/phytane ratios, due to the rise in (ground) water table {{and the establishment of}} anaerobic conditions, as well as by decreasing ratios of diasterenes/sterenes, indicating increasing pH values in the mire. The degree of gelification of plant tissue (gelification index) is governed by the microbial activity in the mire, as indicated by the hopanes concentration. The differences in floral assemblage during the formation of the Lavanttal lignite seams are reflected by major differences in tissue preservation. Preservation of plant tissue (TPI) in the Lavanttal lignite is obviously controlled by the presence/absence of decay-resistant gymnosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, and additionally influenced by the relative contribution of wood to coal formation. The results provide evidence that valuable information for coal facies characterization could be obtained by petrography-based and geochemical facies indicators. An influence of the floral assemblage (gymnosperms/angiosperms ratio) and of the contribution of algal biomass on carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter (delta C- 13 = - 24. 2 to - 28. 6 %.) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is suggested to affect the delta C- 13 values of the coal, The chemotaxonomical classification of the xylites as gymnosperm remnants, based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, is corroborated by the carbon isotopic composition of the xylites (mean delta C- 13 = - 24. 1 %) and the extracted cellulose (mean delta C- 13 = - 20. 2 %). The higher isotopic difference of about 3. 9 %. between cellulose and total organic carbon of the xylites, compared to the difference between cellulose and wood found in modem trees, is explained by the smaller effect of decomposition on delta C- 13 of cellulose.

They were accumulated in small limnic basins representing excellent geological archives for studying environmental changes. This contribution provides a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the individual mixtures of different organic matter types by organic-geochemical bulk parameters and molecular pyrolysate compositions. In total, more than 170 rock samples were studied along a 35 m section from the Göynük, and a 13 m section from the Seyitömer area, respectively. Compositional variations of the sediment input were assigned macro- and micro-petrographically and by measurement of the carbonate content. Kerogens were characterised by elemental analyses of total organic carbon, total sulphur and hydrogen indices. Then, 29 selected rock samples were investigated in detail by temperature programmed open-system pyrolysis-gas chromatography. The two sections investigated show extreme variations of organic carbon, sulphur and hydrocarbons. Organic carbon contens of 1. 5 - 66. 6 % (Göynük) and 0. 6 - 58. 6 % (Seyitömer) and hydrogen indices ranging from 63 - 941 mg HC/g TOC (Göynük) and 14 - 987 mg HC/g TOC (Seyitömer) point to differences in compositions of organic matter. According to variations of the hydrogen index versus organic carbon content, all sedimentary rocks can easily be differentiated in organic rich shales or limestones, oil shales, humic coals and <b>sapropelic</b> coals. The relative molecular abundances of the individual pyrolytic degradation products from temperature programmed pyrolysis-gas chromatography follows the classification of the relative amounts of <b>sapropelic</b> versus humic organic matter. Indvidual compound classes (aromatic hydrocarbons, n-C$_{ 6 - 32 }$ alkanes+alkenes and C$_{ 6 - 32 }$ unidentified resolved compounds normalized to 100 %) indicate marked differences of the organic matter composition, especially from ratios of alkanes+alkenes to aromatic compounds. Most characteristic are {{the differences in the}} amount of C$_{ 6 - 32 }$ n-alkanes. The variation of <b>sapropelic</b> versus humic organic matter is also expressed by the variation of the ratio of C$_{ 6 - 14 }$ n-alkanes to aromatics as well as further individual molecular ratios of the pyrolysates.

Here we investigate how organic- and calcareous-walled dinoflagellate cysts can be used for separately estimating bioproductivity and oxygen related diagenesis. This is achieved by studying the cyst content of the most recent Eastern Mediterranean sapropel S 1, that is thought to have been deposited under conditions of increased primary production in surface waters and possible anoxia in the bottom waters. Based on chemical evidence, it has been shown that the visible <b>sapropelic</b> layer represents only the residual lower part of what was initially a much thicker sapropel, as a result of post-depositional decay of organic matter related to oxygen penetration into the sediments. The effect of aerobic organic matter decay on the cyst associations is studied through the comparison of the unaffected, lower part of the initial sapropel and the 'oxidised' upper part. Comparing the unaffected <b>sapropelic</b> sediments with pre- and post-sapropelic material gives insight into the relationship between fossil cysts assemblages and palaeoproductivity. Impagidinium aculeatum, Impagidinium patulum, Operculodinium israelianum, Polysphaeridium zoharyi and probably Impagidinium spp., Impagidinium paradoxum and Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus are very resistant against aerobic decay and their accumulation rates appear to be primarily related to productivity in surface waters.

On the basis of R-mode statistical analyses we can divide the benthonic fauna into a group with preference for the homogeneous sediments, a laminite-bound group and a group with an intermediate position. The statistical analyses suggest the existence of a stagnation gradient for the depositional environments of the successive laminites. At the extreme end of this gradient the autochthonous fauna is replaced by allochthonous benthonic elements. It can be demonstrated that the degree of stagnation during each period of laminite formation differed from basin to basin and was at its maximum in relatively shallow environments. A stagnation gradient seems to be of little value for the homogeneous sediments. Here, minor faunal changes can be attributed to shallowing and the development of better nutrient conditions. From distributional, sedimen,tary and faunistic evidence it is concluded that the Pliocene periods of stagnation are best expressed in a marginal setting. Periodically increased run-off seems to provide the most likely explanation for the origin of the Pliocene laminated sediments. Low saline land-derived waters caused the termination of the vertical circulation. In addition, such waters brought nutrients into the marine realm, giving rise to enhanced production in surface waters...|$|E
40|$|In the Trbovlje region (Slovenia), {{an upper}} Oligocene coal seam up to 30 in thick {{developed}} in a topogenous mire and evolved within a transgressive setting. The lower ash-rich part of the seam (unit I) accumulated in a forest swamp strongly influenced by fluvial activity. Palynomorph spectra are dominated by Taxodiaceae-Cupressaceae pollen. Ash yields decrease in the middle (unit II) and {{upper part of the}} seam (unit III), indicating decreasing fluvial activity. An increase in CaO contents reflects increasing amounts of inflowing water from an alkaline take, which progressively controlled peat hydrology in units II and III. High sulfur contents in the nonmarine coal are a result of the carbonate-rich water. Abundant pollen and spores from Myricaceae and Polypodiaceae indicate that unit II represents a bush moor. During deposition of unit III, this environment was replaced by a reed moor. <b>Sapropelic</b> coal (unit IV) and <b>sapropelic</b> shale (unit V) accumulated in a relatively large lake, which was established by another water table rise. The interpreted environmental changes are confirmed by biomarker data. Pristane/phytane ratios reflect variations of the redox conditions within the mire and reach a minimum in the <b>sapropelic</b> unit IV. The abundances of gymnosperm- and angiosperm-derived terpenoid hydrocarbons testify the predominance of gymnosperms over angiospenns during early peat stages (unit I), and increasing proportions of angiosperms during deposition of units II and III. Highest contents of diterpenoids coincide with maxima in the preservation of plant tissue (TPI) within unit I (wet forest swamp), suggesting that TPI is partly controlled by the input of resin-rich, decay-resistant conifers. Sections of the seam characterized by advanced gelification show low steroids/hopanoids ratios. The results imply that gelification of plant tissue is related to increased microbial activity. Evidence is provided that the hopanes {{could be used as a}} measure for the activity of aerobic bacteria, whereas for the hop- 17 (21) -ene a microbial origin from anaerobic (iron-reducing) bacteria is assumed. A general influence of the floral assemblage and of varying contributions of algal biomass on carbon isotopic composition of the organic matter (delta(13) C = - 24. 0 to - 28. 1 parts per thousand) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is assumed to affect the delta(13) C values of the coal. Fossil wood collected from the seam is identified as derived from gymnosperms, based on the molecular composition of terpenoid hydrocarbons. This chemotaxonomical classification is corroborated by the mean carbon isotopic compositions of the fossil wood (delta(13) C = - 24. 0 parts per thousand) and by the delta(13) C value (- 21. 8 parts per thousand) of the extracted cellulose from one macrofossil. The low cellulose content of the sample (2. 7 %) together with the slightly higher isotopic difference of 1. 6 parts per thousand between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modem trees, can most probably be explained by the possible reversal in C- 13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood in highly degraded samples.

30|$|During {{the periods}} of peat accumulation, the (ground)water table was {{probably}} not above the peat surface. The basis for such asumption is the complete absence of algal remains and of <b>sapropelic</b> coal (Zdravkov et al. 2007). According to Zdravkov et al. (2007), the vegetation rich in decay-resistant conifers, accompanied by mesophytic broadleaf species, prevailed during these intervals. Due {{to the lack of}} samples for pollen analysis from coal beds, this assumption cannot be confirmed or rejected. The studied samples were collected from diatomitic and black clays formed in lake environments. The results of the diatom analysis (Temniskova-Topalova et al. 1996) show that during the period of accumulation of diatomaceous clays, the lake had a depth of approximatively 15.0 [*]m. This means that during high water stands in the Tundzha Basin, vast territories flooded and the marshland had been completely submerged. This explains the low participation of swamp palaeocoenoses components, which have been preserved {{on the outskirts of the}} lake complex, in conditions suitable for their ecology.|$|E
