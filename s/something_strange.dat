25|$|Rosemary senses {{something}} is wrong with the couple, which is brought to light when one of the guests at a party reports having seen <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> in the bathroom. Tommy Barban, another guest, comes loyally to the defense of the Divers. The action involves various other friends, including the Norths, where a frequent occurrence is the drunken behavior of Abe North. The story becomes complicated when Jules Peterson, a black man, is murdered and ends up in Rosemary's bed, in a situation which could destroy Rosemary's career. Dick moves the blood-soaked body to cover up any implied relationship between Rosemary and Peterson.|$|E
25|$|His most {{significant}} accomplishment of 1974 was qualifying for the 22nd Nihon Ki-in Championship, especially since this came after being beaten {{out of the}} Honinbo preliminaries by Takaho Kojima. He beat Kazuo Sometani, Masao Kato, Yoshio Ishida, and Rin Kaiho. His win against Ishida was <b>something</b> <b>strange,</b> as it came a week after Ishida achieved Meijin-Honinbo. He didn't make it past the second game in the 18th Prime Minister Cup, which again went to Kobayashi. He then took revenge on Kobayashi by beating him in the 6th Shin-Ei. He was awarded a Special Merit Prize by Kido magazine after his most impressive record thus far of 33 wins and 9 loses.|$|E
500|$|Following the wake-up call, {{the crew}} was given some time to clean up, have breakfast, and read e-mail which had been uplinked to them from flight controllers. Their work day {{included}} a lunch break at midday (UTC), and ended with a mid-afternoon planning session with flight controllers, regarding the next day's activities. Most days ended with some entertainment, with the crew watching {{all or part of}} a movie; this was thought to be good for crew bonding as well as their psychological well-being. After watching 2010, the sequel to , Shepherd commented, [...] " [...] <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> about watching a movie about a space expedition when you're actually on a space expedition".|$|E
6000|$|It {{was amazing}} what so brief an {{exchange}} had {{at this point}} done with him. His great scruple suddenly broke, giving way to <b>something</b> inordinately <b>strange,</b> <b>something</b> of a nature to become clear to him only when he had left her. [...] "You can come," [...] he said, [...] "when you like." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{sometime}} during Summer 2008. Miller wanted to style the filming {{as if the}} cameras are following the team like in a documentary. The first day was spent in the [...] "Ottawa Bravo" [...] safe house set, where Connie reveals the threat. Throughout the shoot, Gemma Jones had hip problems. Concerned, the producers set up a body double on hand. However, Jones insisted she could do everything herself, {{and in the end}} the double was not used. During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly. It's a weird thing. I'm not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody's hands <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> happens. It's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the firefighters}} {{appearing}} as extras in [...] "Subway" [...] were Baltimore firefighters. Yoshimura {{said that the}} firefighters {{who appeared to be}} running in the episode were actors, while the real firefighters walked slowly because, based on their real-life experience, they knew {{that there would be no}} need to rush in a situation involving a fatality. Although power on the railings were turned off during shooting, the crew and producers were not aware that some residual electricity continues to run through the cars even after the tracks have been shut down. At one point during the shooting, D'Onofrio felt a charge of that electricity run through him and said, [...] "I'm really feeling <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> here." [...] The crew initially believed D'Onofrio to be ad-libbing a line of dialogue in character, but eventually realized he was being electrified. When the MTA explained about the residual electricity, the crew installed rubber insulation so that D'Onofrio would not touch the metal of the train and experience any electricity. Fleder was impressed that D'Onofrio continued with the shoot, and said, [...] "Most actors I worked with would've left the set at that point." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Lex's key {{characteristics}} is his curiosity for the unexplained. Lex's primary motive for his [...] "shady" [...] actions derives from his curiosity, specifically beginning {{from the moment}} he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche. Clark always appearing when <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex's curiosity. Rosenbaum believes that Lex's only sees two options: [...] "For Lex, it's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work with his dad, or find out what's going on with this strong, strange fellow, Clark Kent." [...] Another characteristic of Smallville 's Lex Luthor—one that is being developed {{over the course of the}} series—is his evilness. Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of. In the season two premiere [...] "Vortex", Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close-up of him after he shoots Nixon, in an effort to open a window into Lex's darker side. Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience. As Beeman explains Rosenbaum's thoughts, [...] "...either Lex is horrified and appalled, or he liked it, and it felt good to him". According to Rosenbaum, when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind, and [...] "really flips out", that is the point where the [...] "world needs to hide". Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti-hero, but also, given that the audience familiar with Lex's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman's greatest enemy, make Smallvilles Lex Luthor a [...] "tragic figure [...] almost Shakespearean grandeur".|$|E

2500|$|Alebrijes (...) are {{brightly colored}} Mexican folk art sculptures of fantastical creatures. The first alebrijes, along {{with use of}} the term, {{originated}} with Pedro Linares. [...] In the 1930s, Linares fell very ill {{and while he was}} in bed, unconscious, Linares dreamt of a strange place resembling a forest. There, he saw trees, animals, rocks, clouds that suddenly turned into <b>something</b> <b>strange,</b> some kind of animals, but, unknown animals. He saw a donkey with butterfly wings, a rooster with bull horns, a lion with an eagle head, and all of them were shouting one word, [...] "Alebrijes". [...] Upon recovery, he began recreating the creatures he saw in cardboard and papier-mâché and called them Alebrijes.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{traditional}} subtitling countries, dubbing is {{generally regarded as}} <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> and unnatural and is only used for animated films and TV programs intended for pre-school children. As animated films are [...] "dubbed" [...] even in their original language and ambient noise and effects are usually recorded on a separate sound track, dubbing a low quality production into a second language produces little or no noticeable effect on the viewing experience. In dubbed live-action television or film, however, viewers are often distracted {{by the fact that}} the audio does not match the actors' lip movements. [...] Furthermore, the dubbed voices may seem detached, inappropriate for the character, or overly expressive, and some ambient sounds may not be transferred to the dubbed track, creating a less enjoyable viewing experience.|$|E
2500|$|Gonzaga {{dominated}} the art department of imperial theatres for over thirty years, surviving three monarchs: Catherine II, Paul I and Alexander I. He decorated coronations of Paul (1797), Alexander I (1801) and Nicholas I (1826) while his lifelong benefactor Yusupov administered all three events. Gonzaga became a trusted consultant to heiress and later empress Maria Fyodorovna, Golitsyn and Yusupov families and diversified into decorating palace interiors and landscape design. Fyodor Glinka described Gonzaga's three-dimensional trompe-l'œil folly in Pavlovsk Park (1815): [...] "What {{is a reality}} and what is a dream? ... Convinced at the existence of what was before me, I kept going further and further forward. But suddenly <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> began to happen to my eyes: {{it was as if}} an invisible curtain of some sort was descending upon these objects and swallowing them from sight ... At length I began to quarrel with my own eyes and my head began to spin, and I hastened to be gone from this realms of charms and magic!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Vainio {{started his}} season by {{finishing}} third at the Rotterdam Marathon {{with a personal}} record of 2:13:04. After the race he gave a doping sample in the test organized by the Finnish Athletics Association. The test did not have official status and was merely {{considered to be a}} control test to help avoid Finnish athletes getting caught at the tests performed in international championships. Therefore, only the so-called A-sample was taken and not the B-sample, which is used to ensure the test result after a positive A-sample. However, Vainio's A-sample was tested positive for anabolic steroids, and the head coach of the Finnish Athletics Federation, Antti Lanamäki, delegated Timo Vuorimaa, the head coach of long-distance runners, to inform Vainio about the test result. Vuorimaa informed Vainio only by mentioning that there was <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> in his test sample, not providing detailed information about the substance. Vainio believed that he had only been using [...] testosterone and not anabolic steroids at all. Therefore, his only action was to give up drug use a little bit earlier prior to the anticipated tests.|$|E
2500|$|Japp asks Poirot to {{join him}} at a house in Bardsley Garden Mews where a Mrs Barbara Allen shot herself the {{previous}} evening – Guy Fawkes Night – the moment of death being disguised by the noise of fireworks. Once there they find that the doctor thinks there is <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> {{about the death of}} the fine lady, a young widow. Mrs Allen was found by a housemate, Miss Jane Plenderleith, who had been away in the country the previous night. The victim was locked in her room and was shot through the head with an automatic, the weapon being found in her hand. [...] The doctor however points out that the gun is in her right hand while the wound is above the left ear – an impossible position to shoot with the right hand. It looks as if this is a murder made to look like suicide – and by an unusually incompetent murderer with a very low estimation of the intelligence of police investigators. [...] They interview Miss Plenderleith and find out that Mrs Allen was engaged to be married to Charles Laverton-West, an up-and-coming young MP but, although the pistol was the dead lady's, she cannot think of a reason why she should use it to commit suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Frey {{came up with}} a {{cinematic}} {{scenario of}} a person who, tired from driving a long distance in a desert, saw a place for a rest and pulled in for the night, but entered [...] "a weird world peopled by freaky characters", and became [...] "quickly spooked by the claustrophobic feeling of being caught in a disturbing web from which he may never escape." [...] In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Frey said that he and Henley wanted the song [...] "to open like an episode of the Twilight Zone", and added: [...] "We take this guy and make him like a character in The Magus, where every time he walks through a door there’s a new version of reality. We wanted to write a song just like it was a movie." [...] Frey described the song in an interview with NBC's Bob Costas as a cinematic montage [...] "just one shot to the next ... a picture of a guy on the highway, a picture of the hotel, the guy walks in, the door opens, strange people." [...] Frey continued: [...] "We decided to create <b>something</b> <b>strange,</b> just {{to see if we could}} do it." [...] Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey's idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.|$|E

Then, soft and low, came that drumming sound again. Whitefoot replied to it. All the time he kept feeling better. He ran a little nearer to the place from which that drumming sound had come and then once more drummed. At first he got no reply.|$|R

2500|$|On Monday morning Byrne brought {{two horses}} to be shod, but the {{blacksmith}} suspected <b>something</b> <b>strange</b> in his manner, so {{he noted the}} horse's brands (according to Kenneally, the blacksmith {{was struck by the}} quality of these so-called police horses and thus noted their brands; according also to this version, the shoeing of the horses was charged to the government of New South Wales). About 10am the Kellys, with their hostage Constable Richards, went from the barracks, closely followed on horseback by Hart and Byrne. They all went to the Royal Hotel, where Cox, the landlord, told Richards that his companions were the Kellys. Ned Kelly said they wanted rooms at the Royal, and revealed his intentions to rob the bank. Hart and Byrne rode to the back and told the groom to stable their horses, but not to give them any feed. Hart went into the kitchen of the hotel, a few yards from the back entrance to the bank. Byrne then entered the rear of the bank, when he met the accountant, Mr Living, who told him to use the front entrance. Byrne displayed his revolver and induced him to surrender. Kenneally wrote, [...] "The shock caused Living to stutter and it has been alleged that he stuttered {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] Byrne then walked him and Mackie, the junior accountant, into the bar, where Dan Kelly was on guard. Ned Kelly secured the bank manager, Mr Tarleton, who was ordered to open the safes. When this was done, he was put in with the others. All were liberated at a quarter to three.|$|E
