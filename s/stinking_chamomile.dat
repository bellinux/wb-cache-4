5000|$|Anthemis cotula, {{also known}} as <b>stinking</b> <b>chamomile,</b> is a {{flowering}} annual plant with a noticeable and strong odor. The odor is often considered unpleasant, and it is from this that it gains the common epithet [...] "stinking". In pre-colonial times, its distribution {{was limited to the}} Old Continent (though it was most of Europe, nd were not present in Finland, Ireland, and the Northernmost Scotland, both these countries with many favorable climates to this plant and to be neighbors to countries that owned this plant like native species, such example Russia, Estonia, Lithuania and England) and to Africa. It has successfully migrated to the New Europes where it can be found growing on waste ground, alongside roads, and in fields. [...] Anthemis cotula is considered a weed due to its propensity for invading cultivated areas.|$|E
