25|$|In {{contrast}} to the traditionally followed approach of metabolic modeling using coupled ordinary differential equations, flux balance analysis requires very little information {{in terms of the}} enzyme kinetic parameters and concentration of metabolites in the system. It achieves this by making two assumptions, steady state and optimality. The first assumption is that the modeled system has entered a steady state, where the metabolite concentrations no longer change, i.e. in each metabolite node the producing and consuming fluxes cancel each other out. The second assumption is that the organism has been optimized through evolution for some biological goal, such as optimal growth or conservation of resources. The steady-state assumption reduces the system to a set of linear equations, which is then solved to find a flux distribution that satisfies the <b>steady-state</b> <b>condition</b> subject to the stoichiometry constraints while maximizing the value of a pseudo-reaction (the objective function) representing the conversion of biomass precursors into biomass.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of a growing economy for cases in which the <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions</b> are not fulfilled. The first chapter, which deals with one-sector models in which the <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions</b> are not met, investigates how the economy behaves as the aggregate effective capital-labor ratio for the economy tends to zero or infinity. Similarly, Chapter 2 investigates two-sector models in which the <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions</b> are not fulfilled either because there are different rates of Harrod neutral technical progress in each, sector, or because some capital-augmenting technical progress is present in the investment sector. It is found that these non-steady-state models parallel the steady-state growth paths in that the rates of growth of the variables tend (in most cases) to constant limits. However, differences arise between the non-steady-state models and the steady-state model when factor shares and the marginal product of capital are considered. Finally, each o...|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{has adopted}} two {{approaches}} for creating critical loads:  empirical and steady-state mass balance critical loads.  Empirical critical loads are derived based on observations of ecosystem responses (such as changes in plant diversity, soil nutrient levels, or fish health) to specific deposition levels. These relationships are created using dose-response studies or by measuring ecosystem responses to increasing gradients of deposition over space or time.  Steady-state mass balance critical loads {{are derived from}} mathematical mass-balance models under assumed or modeled equilibrium conditions.  A <b>steady-state</b> <b>condition</b> may be achieved far into the future.  The models used to determine steady-state critical loads vary in complexity with regard to process representation but can include water and soil chemistry, mineral soil weathering rates, deposition data, and ecological response data.|$|E

50|$|These exciton eigenstates provide {{valuable}} insight to SBEs and SLEs, especially, when one analyses the linear semiconductor absorption spectrum or photoluminescence at <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions.</b> One simply uses the constructed eigenstates to diagonalize the homogeneous {{parts of the}} SBEs and SLEs. Under the <b>steady-state</b> <b>conditions,</b> the resulting equations can be solved analytically when one further approximates dephasing due to higher-order many-body effects. When such effects are fully included, one must resort to a numeric approach. After the exciton states are obtained, one can eventually express the linear absorption and steady-state photoluminescence analytically.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main goal}} of a dose-ranging study is to {{estimate}} the response vs. dose given, so as to analyze the efficacy and safety of the drug. Although such a response will nevertheless be available from phase III or phase IV trials, {{it is important to}} carry out dose-ranging studies in the earlier phase I or phase II stages. There are some advantages by using healthy volunteers. They are in a <b>steady-state</b> <b>condition</b> showing no different stages of disease and no variation due to disease. In addition, it is easy to recruit and select volunteers among varying age, sex, race etc. under identical conditions in which the test can be repeated. The main reasons for this is to avoid trials in the later phases using doses that are significantly different from those that will subsequently be recommended for clinical use and also to avoid the need for modification of dosing schedules at later stages where a large amount of data has already been accumulated for a different dose range.The duration of action should be determined during dose-ranging study, as it will allow definition of the dosage schedule. Because it is hard to measure reliable pharmacodynamic parameter, {{it is difficult to determine}} the duration of action during early clinical trials. Other parameters instead are suggested as a tentative dosage, such as half-lives in plasma and urine in various test species and human, receptor binding in vitro, or pharmacodynamic data in vivo in animals.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{substrate}} is biased to a negative voltage (few KV's), the resultant electric field drives electrons away from {{the substrate}} in the time scale of the inverse electron plasma frequency ωe−1 ( [...] ~ l0−9 sec). Thus an ion matrix Debye sheath which is depleted of electrons forms around it. The negatively biased substrate will accelerate the ions within a time scale of the inverse ion plasma frequency ωi−1 ( [...] ~ 10−6 sec). This ion movement lowers the ion density in the bulk, which causes the sheath-plasma boundary to expand in order to sustain the applied potential drop,in the process exposing more ions. The plasma sheath expands until either a <b>steady-state</b> <b>condition</b> is reached, which is called Child Langmuir law limit; or the high voltage is switched off {{as in the case}} of Pulsed DC biasing. Pulse biasing is preferred over DC biasing because it creates less damage during the pulse ON time and neutralization of unwanted charges accumulated on the wafer in the afterglow period (i.e. after the pulse has ended). In case of pulsed biasing the TON time of the pulse is generally kept at 20-40 µs, while the TOFF is kept at 0.5-2 ms i.e. a duty cycle of 1-8%. The power supply used is in range of 500 V to hundreds of KV and the pressure in the range of 1-100 mTorr. This is the basic principle of the operation of immersion type PIII.|$|E
