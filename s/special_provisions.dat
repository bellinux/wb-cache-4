5|$|Smith {{missed the}} first month of the season with a {{hamstring}} injury, and continued to harbor ill feelings toward La Russa that had developed after spring training ended. In a closed-door meeting in mid-May, La Russa asked Smith if he would like to be traded. Instead, Smith and his agent negotiated a compromise with Cardinals management, agreeing to a buyout of <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> in his contract in conjunction with Smith announcing his retirement. The agreement prompted a press conference at Busch Stadium on June 19, 1996, during which Smith announced he would retire from baseball at season's end.|$|E
5|$|Social {{equality}} and {{equal access to}} public areas: Article 15 of the constitution states that no person shall be discriminated {{on the basis of}} religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every person shall have equal access to public places like public parks, museums, wells, bathing ghats and temples etc. However, the State may make any special provision for women and children. <b>Special</b> <b>provisions</b> may be made for the advancements of any socially or educationally backward class or scheduled castes or scheduled tribes.|$|E

5|$|The Regency Acts {{allow for}} regencies {{in the event}} of a monarch who is a minor or who is {{physically}} or mentally incapacitated. When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. <b>Special</b> <b>provisions</b> were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that the Duke of Edinburgh (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, the {{coverage}} formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, {{most of which}} were in the Deep South. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court declared {{the coverage}} formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism. The other <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are unenforceable.|$|E
5|$|ITAK {{joined the}} UNP-led seven party {{national}} government (hath haula). ITAK was offered three cabinet {{posts in the}} national government but, as the party had pledged that none of its MPs would accept ministerial positions until federalism had been achieved, it asked that M. Tiruchelvam be appointed to the Senate and given the Home Affairs portfolio. Senanayake refused to give the Home Affairs portfolio to ITAK and instead gave Tiruchelvam the Local Government portfolio. The Tamil Language (<b>Special</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Regulation 1966, which made Tamil the language of administration in the Northern and Eastern provinces, was passed by Parliament in July 1966. The District Councils Bill, which was presented to Parliament in June 1968, met with opposition from UNP backbenchers and was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Article 15 prohibits {{discrimination}} on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the State is not precluded from making <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived {{and in need of}} special protection. Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion.|$|E
5|$|Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and {{the valley}} itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense {{fighting}} flagged {{with the onset}} of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions. The plebiscite was never held, and on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India came into force in Kashmir, but with <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> made for the state. India did not, however, secure administrative control over all of Kashmir. The northern and western portions of Kashmir came under Pakistan's control in 1947, and are today Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In the 1962 Sino-Indian War, China occupied Aksai Chin, the north-eastern region bordering Ladakh, which it continues to control and administer.|$|E
5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from £981 in 1858 to £168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from £40 to £10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a loss by 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also {{the date of the}} final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company to fill in the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill in the lock if they chose to do so.|$|E

5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the 1965 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. After the election Chelvanayakam met with UNP leader Dudley Senanayake who agreed to Chelvanayakam's conditions for supporting a UNP led government. The agreement, known as the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact (D-C Pact), was put down on paper and signed by Chelvanayakam and Senanayake on 24 March 1965. Under the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact, which was {{a modified version of the}} B-C pact, Senanayake agreed to make Tamil the language of administration and of record in the Northern and Eastern provinces (Tamil Language <b>Special</b> <b>Provisions</b> Act); amend the Languages of Courts Act to allow legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil; establish District Councils vested with powers over mutually agreed subjects; amend the Land Development Ordinance to provide allotment of land to citizens; and grant land under colonization schemes in the Northern and Eastern provinces to landless people in the district, to Tamil-speaking residents from the two provinces, and to other citizens with preference being given to Tamils from other provinces. Senanayake kept the contents of the D-C Pact a secret which allowed Sinhalese nationalists to allege that he had agreed to the division of the country. Even the leftist Lanka Sama Samaja Party and Communist Party of Ceylon joined the Sinhala nationalist SLFP in propagating this claim.|$|E
25|$|Congress reconsidered the Act in 2006 as the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> {{were due}} to expire in 2007. Civil rights {{organizations}} advocated for the renewal and strengthening of the <b>special</b> <b>provisions.</b> As a matter of principle, Democrats generally supported renewing the <b>special</b> <b>provisions.</b> However, the Republican Party controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency, and many Republicans considered the preclearance requirement an affront to states' rights and the principle of color-blindness. Furthermore, conservatives believed that the primary beneficiaries of the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> were African Americans, who overwhelmingly and increasingly voted for Democratic Party candidates. However, Republicans were receiving increasing support from some language minority groups, particularly Hispanics and Asian Americans, {{and they did not}} wish to risk losing that support by refusing to reauthorize the <b>special</b> <b>provisions.</b> Republicans also recognized that the Act often helped Republican candidates win by requiring jurisdictions to pack Democratic-leaning racial minorities into few electoral districts. In addition, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) had a strong desire to reauthorize the <b>special</b> <b>provisions,</b> and he led an early effort to pass a reauthorization bill before his chairmanship expired at the end of 2006. Thus, a consensus in favor of reauthorizing the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> emerged early in the legislative process.|$|E
25|$|Anticipating the {{expiration}} of the Act's <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> in 1970, Congress held extensive hearings {{on whether the}} Act should be amended and its <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> reauthorized. Congress noted discrimination in voting continued {{in spite of the}} Act and that the Section 5 preclearance requirement had been minimally enforced since its enactment; between 1965 and 1970, covered jurisdictions had made merely 578 preclearance submissions. Ultimately, Congress determined that although significant progress had been made in reducing racial discrimination in voting since 1965, sufficient discrimination existed to justify extending the <b>special</b> <b>provisions.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Act also {{contains}} [...] "special provisions" [...] {{that apply to}} only certain jurisdictions. A core <b>special</b> <b>provision</b> is the Section 5 preclearance requirement, which prohibits certain jurisdictions from implementing any change affecting voting without receiving preapproval from the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the change does not discriminate against protected minorities. Another <b>special</b> <b>provision</b> requires jurisdictions containing significant language minority populations to provide bilingual ballots and other election materials.|$|R

25|$|As the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> neared {{expiration}} again, Congress reconsidered the Act in 1982. Organizations in The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, {{such as the}} National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the National Education Association (NEA), {{organized to}} pressure Congress both to extend the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> and to expand the Act's general prohibition on discriminatory voting laws. Congressional opponents of the amendments had little support for their positions outside of Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{amendments}} {{extended the}} Act's <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> for seven years. Congress chose {{seven years to}} avoid having to reconsider the <b>special</b> <b>provisions</b> during the 1980s reapportionment process. Relatedly, Congress amended the bailout provision to require covered jurisdictions seeking bailout to prove that they had not used a test or device in a discriminatory manner in the 17-year period preceding their bailout request. Congress also expanded the coverage formula by adding new dates in 1972 as triggering dates, which brought more jurisdictions into coverage. Furthermore, Congress made permanent the nationwide prohibition on tests or devices.|$|E
