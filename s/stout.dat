First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra <b>Stout,</b> and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E
