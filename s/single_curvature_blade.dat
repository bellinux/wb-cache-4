30|$|The {{equivalent}} column concept can {{be generalized}} to simplify columns bent in <b>single</b> <b>curvature</b> modes with different end eccentricities combinations to pin-ended axially loaded columns. On the other hand, the equivalent column concept can be implemented for a particular case of a column bent in double curvature mode.|$|R
30|$|It can {{be noted}} that the {{equivalent}} column for the case of double curvature mode is lower than that of the <b>single</b> <b>curvature</b> mode. Hence, the slenderness effect of the <b>single</b> <b>curvature</b> mode is higher (H*/b =  30.28), which resulted in a significant decrease in the ultimate capacity as confirmed by the experimental result of such column (S- 3 - 5) where its ultimate capacity was about 33  % of the axial capacity of C- 0 - 0. On the other hand, column bent in double curvature mode has slenderness ratio of 17.02, which resulted in moderate effect on the ultimate capacity. This contact was confirmed by the experimental result where column D- 3 - 5 showed about 56  % of the ultimate capacity of axially loaded column C- 0 - 0.|$|R

30|$|The {{experimental}} work program included 15 reduced-scale columns (1 / 3 scale model) divided into 4 {{groups as well}} as a control axially loaded column. The first two groups represented columns bent in <b>single</b> <b>curvature</b> modes, while the remaining two groups represented columns bent in double curvature modes. For both curvature modes, equal and unequal end eccentricities combinations about minor axis were studied.|$|R
30|$|Providing end eccentricities {{resulted}} in decrease the axial capacity proportionally {{with respect to}} the value of the end eccentricity. For equal end eccentricities ratio of 0.5 b, the column had lost about 75  % of its axial capacity.

40|$|Present {{approximate}} second order {{methods for}} the analysis of unbraced multistorey frames may significantly underestimate moments in <b>single</b> <b>curvature</b> regions. To clarify reasons for this that may not be well understood, the mechanics of column interaction in <b>single</b> <b>curvature</b> regions are studied. Suitable tools for sidesway description are derived, including a nearly exact, explicit free-sway effective length expression, that, when high accuracy is required, eliminates the need for cumbersome, iterative solutions of exact effective lengths from the transcendental instability equation. Two reasons for the underestimation are identified. One is related to the local second order "N-delta" effects, and the other to second order effects causing changes in rotational restraint stiffness at column ends due to vertical, inter-storey column interaction. A modified approximate storey magnifier approach is proposed that accounts for these local second order effects through two separate "flexibility factors". The approach is sufficiently simple to be viable in practical analyses, and predictions are found to compare well with more accurate results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently planar cubic and Pythagorean {{hodograph}} quintic transition curves {{that are}} suitable for G 2 blending were developed. They {{are suitable for}} blending, e. g. rounding corners, or for smooth transition between two curves, e. g. two circular arcs.

The results for the cubic curve are now extended to Pythagorean hodograph quintic curves. A Pythagorean hodograph curve has the attractive properties that its arclength is a polynomial of its parameter, and its offset is rational. A quintic is the lowest degree Pythagorean hodograph curve that may have an inflection point. Pythagorean hodograph curves with no curvature extrema for an S-shaped transition, and a <b>single</b> <b>curvature</b> extremum for a C-shaped transition are suitable for the design of fair curves, e. g. in highway design, or for blending in CAD applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{describes}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation of a}} radial flow pump impeller with 2 D <b>curvature</b> <b>blade</b> geometry. Investigation {{of the behavior of}} the above impeller for a wide flow rate range and for various rotational speeds was carried out and the obtained experimental results were validated with available measurements of the same impeller within spiral casing. The flow field through the impeller was also simulated by a 2 -dimensional approach. For the numerical simulation, the viscous Navier-Stokes equations are solved with the control volume approach and the k-ε turbulence model. The flow domain is discretized with a polar, unstructured, Cartesian mesh that covers a periodically symmetric section of the impeller. Advanced numerical techniques for adaptive grid refinement and for the partially blocked cells are also implemented at the irregular boundaries of the blades. The numerical results are compared to the measurements, showing good agreement and encouraging the extension of the developed computation methodology for performance prediction and for design optimization of such impeller geometries.

40|$|Introduction: The goal of {{the present}} study was to test the fatigue {{resistance}} of nickel-titanium rotary files in a double curvature (S-shaped) artificial root canal and to compare those results with <b>single</b> <b>curvature</b> artificial root canals. Methods: Two nickel-titanium endodontic instruments consisting of identical instrument sizes (constant. 06 taper and 0. 25 tip diameter) were tested, Pro File instruments and Vortex instruments. Both instruments were tested for fatigue inside an artificial canal with a double curvature and inside a curved artificial canal with a <b>single</b> <b>curvature.</b> Ten instruments for each group were tested to fracture in continuous rotary motion at 300 rpm. Number of cycles to failure (NCF) was calculated to the nearest whole number, and the length of the fractured fragment was measured in millimeters. Data were statistically analyzed with a level of significance set at 95 % confidence level. Results: The NCF value was always statistically lower in the double curved artificial canal when compared with the single curve (P <. 05) in both the apical and coronal curvatures. Statistically significant differences (P <. 05) were noted between instruments of the same size of different brand only in the single curve; Pro File registered a mean of 633. 5 +/- 75. 1 NCF, whereas Vortex registered a mean of 548 +/- 48. 9 NCF. Conclusions: Regardless of the differences between the instruments used in the present study, the results suggest. that the more complex is the root canal, the more adverse are the effects on the cyclic fatigue resistance of the instruments.

40|$|The {{procedure}} of curling a ribbon by running {{it over a}} sharp blade is commonly used when wrapping presents. Despite its ubiquity, a quantitative explanation of this everyday phenomenon is still lacking. We address this using experiment and theory, examining the dependence of ribbon <b>curvature</b> on <b>blade</b> <b>curvature,</b> the longitudinal load imposed on the ribbon, and the speed of pulling. Experiments in which a ribbon is drawn steadily over a blade under a fixed load show that the ribbon curvature is generated over a restricted range of loads, the curvature/load relationship can be nonmonotonic, and faster pulling (under a constant imposed load) results in less tightly curled ribbons. We develop a theoretical model that captures these features, building on the concept that the ribbon under the imposed deformation undergoes differential plastic stretching across its thickness, resulting in a permanently curved shape. The model identifies factors that optimize curling and clarifies the physical mechanisms underlying the ribbon’s nonlinear response to an apparently simple deformation...|$|R

30|$|Because {{response}} surface methodology can establish the unknown function between design variables and response variables, {{it has been}} widely applied to optimization. Choon-Man Jang and Ka-Ram Choi [2] carried out the optimization of the blower impeller by using the {{response surface}} method (RSM). Heng Jiang et al. [3] carried out a dynamic and static multi-objective optimization of a vertical machining center based on response surface method. Quadratic polynomials are employed to construct response surface (RS) model, which reflects the relationship between design inputs and structural response outputs, according to the response outputs of these samples obtained by analyzing the dynamic and static characteristics of the machining centre at these samples with the software ANSYS.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of the Poincaré-invariant Einstein special relativity by a de Sitter-invariant special relativity produces concomitant changes in all relativistic theories, including general relativity.
