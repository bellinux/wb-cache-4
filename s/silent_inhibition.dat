40|$|Biophysics of {{computation}} is a {{new field}} that attempts to characterize the role in information processing of the several biophysical mechanisms in neurons, synapses, and membranes that have been uncovered in recent years. In this article, we review a synaptic mechanism, based on the interaction between excitation and <b>silent</b> <b>inhibition,</b> that implements a veto-like operation. Synapses of this type may underlie direction selectivity to direction of motion in the vertebrate retina...|$|E
40|$|Although {{shunting}} (or <b>silent)</b> <b>inhibition</b> {{was originally}} thought to modulate gain, {{based on its}} well-understood effects on subthreshold voltage, more recent studies have argued against inhibition as a cellular mechanism for gain modulation. Reductions in input resistance during inhibition, which have been demonstrated in mammalian cortex in vivo (Borg-Graham et al., 1998), are known to reduce {{the slope of the}} subthreshold voltagecurrent relationship and attenuate excitatory synaptic potentials (Coombs et al., 1955; Fatt and Katz, 1953). These multiplicative subthreshold properties have been used in models of the visual system (Carandini and Heeger, 1994; Torre and Poggio, 1978) to explain supra-threshold in vivo observations, including direction selec-tively to motion (Sillito, 1977; Wyatt and Daw, 1975) an...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} sleep {{deprivation}} on human motor cortical excitability was investigated by evaluating {{the changes in}} motor evoked potentials from the thenar eminence muscles of the right hand in seven subjects. Motor threshold, motor evoked potential amplitude, <b>silent</b> period, intracortical <b>inhibition,</b> intracortical facilitation and F wave were studied. Recordings were performed every 6 h during the day-time (from 09. 00 to 21. 00 h) and every 3 h during the night-time (from 21. 00 to 09. 00 h). Significant increases in motor threshold, intracortical <b>inhibition</b> and <b>silent</b> period were noted in the recordings during the night associated with a return to baseline values in the morning. No significant changes were observed {{in any of the}} other parameters. Enhancement of intracortical motor inhibition is suggested to explain the effect of sleep deprivation...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between {{excitatory}} and inhibitory synaptic inputs on dendrites {{determine the}} level of activity in neurons. Models based on the cable equation predict that <b>silent</b> shunting <b>inhibition</b> can strongly veto the effect of an excitatory input. The cable model assumes that ionic concentrations do not change during the electrical activity, {{which may not be}} a valid assumption, especially for small structures such as dendritic spines. We present here an analysis and computer simulations to show that for large Cl- conductance changes, the more general Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion model predicts that shunting inhibition on spines should be much less effective than that predicted by the cable model. This is a consequence of the large changes in the intracellular ionic concentration of Cl- that can occur in small structures, which would alter the reversal potential and reduce the driving force for Cl-. Shunting inhibition should therefore not be effective on spines, but it could be significantly more effective on the dendritic shaft {{at the base of the}} spine. In contrast to shunting inhibition, hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition mediated by K+ currents can be very effective in reducing the excitatory synaptic potentials on the same spine if the excitatory conductance change is less than 10 nS. We predict that if the inhibitory synapses found on cortical spines are to be effective, then they should be mediated by K+ through GABAB receptors...|$|R
40|$|Constitutive {{activation}} of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is a notable feature of a large minority of cases of malignant melanoma, an aggressive and increasingly common cancer. The identification of target genes downstream from this pathway is therefore crucial {{to our understanding of}} the disease. The POU domain transcription factor Brn- 2 has been implicated in control of proliferation and melanoma survival, and its expression is strongly upregulated in melanoma. We show here that in vivo Brn- 2 is expressed in melanocytes but not in embryonic day 11. 5 melanoblasts and that its expression is directly controlled by the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in melanoma cell lines and in transgenic mice. Moreover, <b>silent</b> interfering RNA-mediated <b>inhibition</b> of Brn- 2 expression in melanoma cells overexpressing beta-catenin results in significantly decreased proliferation. These results, together with the observation that BRAF signaling also induces Brn- 2 expression, reveal that Brn- 2 is a focus for the convergence of two key melanoma-associated signaling pathways that are linked to cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|In {{a patient}} with a {{familial}} form of paroxysmal exertion induced dyskinesia (PED), the efficacy of different stimuli and manoeuvres in triggering dystonic attacks in the arm was studied. As a new approach, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex was used to trigger motor paroxysms and to monitor cortical excitability during attacks. Motor paroxysms could be provoked by muscle vibration, passive movements, TMS, magnetic stimulation of the brachial plexus, and electrical nerve stimulation. Sham stimulation over the motor cortex and thermal and tactile cutaneous stimuli were ineffective in triggering attacks. It is concluded that dystonic attacks are triggered by proprioceptive afferents rather than cutaneous stimuli or the descending motor command itself. Outside the attacks, motor cortical excitatory and inhibitory neuronal mechanisms as assessed by TMS (response threshold and amplitudes, duration of the contralateral and ipsilateral <b>silent</b> period, corticocortical <b>inhibition,</b> and facilitation) were normal, which underlines the paroxysmal character of the disorder. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulates cortical excitability. These effects outlast the rTMS train, {{and range}} from inhibition to facilitation according to the variables used for rTMS. Several studies have demonstrated short and long-term effects on motor evoked potential (MEP) size, whereas the effects on intracortical inhibition (ICI) and facilitation (ICF) are still unclear. We investigated short- (1 – 15 min), intermediate- (16 – 30 min), and long-term (6 h) effects on intracortical excitability. Methods: Fourteen healthy subjects were stimulated with rTMS trains of 900 pulses (1 Hz, 90 % resting motor threshold (rMTh)), delivered over the primary motor cortex and the occipital area. MTh, MEP size, <b>silent</b> period, intracortical <b>inhibition</b> at short (ICI) and long inter-stimulus intervals, and ICF were tested before and after rTMS. Results: ICI was reduced 16 – 30 min after 1 Hz rTMS trains over the primary motor area, whereas the other response variables remained unchanged. The ICI reduction at 16 – 30 min was reproducible on different days in the same subjects; it was absent at 6 h and after stimulation of the occipital area. Conclusions: Subthreshold 1 Hz rTMS decreases ICI by reducing the excitability of intracortical inhibitory interneurones or by altering the electrical properties of the facilitatory chain of neurons responsible for the I waves...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{electrical}} stimulation of the C 5 -C 8 dermatomes on voluntary electromyographic activity (EMG) recorded from the ipsilateral first dorsal interosseus (FDI), abductor digiti minimi, flexor and extensor carpi, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, and orbicularis oculi muscles of healthy humans. Finger stimulation (C 6 -C 8) produced an EMG <b>inhibition</b> (<b>silent</b> period, SP), which progressively decreased in duration from distal to proximal muscles; in the biceps it induced a slight facilitation and in the orbicularis oculi muscle, it had no effect. Stimulation of the C 5 dermatome induced no response in either distal or proximal muscles. Only high-intensity stimuli evoked clear silent periods. The threshold for evoking an SP was almost double that required for sensory action potentials, 3. 25 times the sensory threshold, and decidedly above the pain threshold. An indirect estimation of the conduction velocity of SP afferent fibres placed them in the A-delta group of myelinated fibres. In double-shock experiments, used to study the recovery cycle of the SP in the FDI muscle after finger stimulation, neither low- nor high-intensity conditioning stimuli delivered 100 - 500 ms before the test stimulus changed test SPs. Experiments designed to evaluate motoneuronal excitability showed that in relaxed FDI muscle, finger stimulation markedly reduced the F wave at the 50 ms time interval, {{the time when the}} SP normally occurs. Our findings demonstrate that the activation of A-delta afferents from the fingers inhibits the C 7 -T 1 motoneurons postsynaptically, through an oligosynaptic spinal circuit. We propose that the strong inhibitory effect exerted by noxious cutaneous stimuli on all distal muscles may contribute to a defence action which is specific for the human upper limb.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Excitotoxicity is one {{pathogenic}} mechanism {{proposed in}} {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), and loss of cortical inhibitory influence may be contributory. Patients with ALS who are homozygous for the D 90 A superoxide dismutase- 1 (SOD 1) gene mutation (homD 90 A) have a unique phenotype, associated with prolonged survival compared with patients with sporadic ALS (sALS). In this study, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to explore cortical excitation and inhibition. Flumazenil binds to the benzodiazepine subunit of the GABA(A) receptor, and (11) C-flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) {{was used as a}} marker of cortical neuronal loss and/or dysfunction, which might in turn reflect changes in cortical inhibitory GABAergic mechanisms. METHODS: Cortical responses to single and paired stimulus TMS were compared in 28 patients with sALS and 11 homD 90 A patients versus 24 controls. TMS measures included resting motor threshold, central motor conduction time, <b>silent</b> period, intracortical <b>inhibition</b> (ICI), and facilitation. (11) C-flumazenil PET of the brain was performed on 20 patients with sALS and nine with homD 90 A. Statistical parametric mapping was used to directly compare PET images from the two patient groups to identify those areas of relatively reduced cortical (11) C-flumazenil binding that might explain differences in cortical excitability seen using TMS. RESULTS: Increased cortical excitability, demonstrated by reduction in ICI, was seen in the patients with sALS but not the homD 90 A patients. A relative reduction in cortical (11) C-flumazenil binding was found in the motor and motor association regions of the superior parietal cortices of the patients with sALS. CONCLUSIONS: A cortical inhibitory deficit in sALS was not demonstrable in a homogeneous genetic ALS population of similar disability, suggesting a distinct cortical vulnerability. (11) C-flumazenil PET demonstrated that neuronal loss/dysfunction in motor and motor association areas may underlie this difference. The corollary, that there may be relative preservation of neuronal function in these areas in the homD 90 A group, has implications for understanding the slower progression of disease in these patients...|$|R
