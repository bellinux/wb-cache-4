2500|$|Cleaning was {{important}} and until a formal ritual had been devised {{it was a}} dangerous operation. The vibration in a mule threw a lot of short fibres (or fly) into the air. It tended to accumulate on the carriage behind the spindles and {{in the region of}} the drafting rollers. Piking the stick meant placing the hand though the yarnsheet, and unclipping two sticks of underclearer rollers from beneath the drafting rollers, drawing them through the 1 ¼ in gap between two ends, stripping them of fly and replacing them on the next inward run. Cleaning the carriage top was far more dangerous. The minder would stop the mule on the outward run, and raise his hands above his head. The piecers would enter under the yarn sheet with a scavenger cloth on the carriage <b>spindle</b> <b>rail</b> and a brush on the roller beam, and run bent double {{the entire length of the}} mule, avoiding the rails and draw bands, and not letting themselves touch the yarn sheet. When they had finished they would run to agreed positions of safety where the minder could see both of them, and the minder would unclip the stang and start the mule. Before this ritual was devised, boys had been crushed. The mule was [...] long, the minder's eyesight might not have been good, the air in the mill was clouded with fly and another minder's boys might have been mistaken for his. The ritual became encoded in law.|$|E

40|$|As {{a part of}} the Acquisition and Guidance Unit for the Gemini {{project a}} light-weight, 50 cm flat mirror has been {{designed}} at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Mechanics in Jena as a subcontractor of the Carl Zeiss Jena company. A light-weight design of the mirror and its mount was essential since the total mass of the whole assembly including the positioning system was limited to 50 kg while interferometric quality of the mirror surface was required for arbitrary orientation. The overall surface error was below 54 nm r. m. s. while 27 nm was achieved in the central part. The mirror was fabricated from low-expansion glass ceramics to avoid thermally induced deformations. By milling pockets into its rear surface the mass of the mirror was reduced by 70 %. The mirror is mounted kinematically via six solid-state hinges to three steel levers. The levers are connected to the mount frame at their centers via ball-and-sphere joints. This arrangement determines the position of the mirror uniquely while it allows for the thermal expansion of the mount frame. The position of the mirror as well as its tilt around an axis perpendicular to the optical one may be controlled a precision of 20 µm and 3 arcsec, respectively. The tilt axis is driven directly by two high-torque motors. To avoid an excessive power consumption of the motors the torque of the mirror had to be compensated for by a counterweight mechanism. The mirror may be deployed into the optical path using <b>spindle</b> driven linear <b>rails...</b>|$|R
