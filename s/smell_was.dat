5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Nigersaurus are grouped within the subfamily Nigersaurinae {{of the family}} Rebbachisauridae, {{which is part of}} the sauropod superfamily Diplodocoidea. Nigersaurus was probably a browser, and fed with its head close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> underdeveloped, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a riparian habitat, and its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other dinosaurian megaherbivores, as well as large theropods and crocodylomorphs.|$|E

After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E

This change may have allowed these early mammals to hunt insects at night when dinosaurs were not active.|$|E
40|$|Software {{testing is}} a {{critical}} element of software quality assurance that represents the ultimate review of specifications, design and coding. In computer programming, code <b>smell</b> <b>is</b> the symptom in the source code of a programindicating a deeper problem. Code <b>smells</b> <b>are</b> usually not bugs, they are not technically incorrect and don't currently prevent the program from functioning.

25|$|One of the Nauruans' {{methods to}} reach {{self-sufficiency}} was to exploit their gardens to the fullest. They cultivated many edible plants and were soon imitated by the Japanese, {{who began to}} farm every space available. They grew eggplant, corn, pumpkin, and sweet potato. Still lacking sufficient output, they created pumpkin plantations, using half drums filled with night soil which had been collected from the population by forced Chinese workers. This method {{turned out to be}} extremely productive in Nauru's tropical weather, but as a result, dysentery spread, killing several people. Swarms of flies appeared around the plantations, and the <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> unbearable. Toddy, brewed with the sap of coconut trees, was a valuable dietary supplement and at times the only food available. All the trees used for toddy were inventoried and allocated to the population, three for each Japanese, two for a Pacific Islander, and one for a Chinese. They were used {{to such an extent that}} they were no longer able to produce coconuts. After learning that rubber tree fruit was edible, the Japanese forbade the Islanders from gathering it, and started eating it themselves.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{built to}} hold pirates, the strong room {{was just a}} few yards from the prison's sewer. It was never cleaned, had no drain, no sunlight, no fresh air—the <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> {{described}} as [...] "noisome"—and was full of rats and sometimes [...] "several barrow fulls of dung". Several prisoners told the court that it contained no bed, so that prisoners had to lie on the damp floor, possibly next to corpses awaiting burial. But a group of favoured prisoners Acton had paid to police the jail told the hearing there was indeed a bed. One of them said he often chose to lie in there himself, because the strong room was so clean; the [...] "best room on the Common side of the jail", said another. This despite the court's having heard that one prisoner's left side had mortified from lying on the wet floor, and that a rat had eaten the nose, ear, cheek and left eye of another.|$|E
500|$|Selenium (Greek σελήνη selene meaning [...] "Moon") was {{discovered}} in 1817 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Johan Gottlieb Gahn. Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm, Sweden, producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process. The pyrite from the Falun mine created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the pyrite's use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn {{wanted to use the}} pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like horseradish when burned. This <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to Alexander Marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the Falun mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the Moon.|$|E

500|$|The breeds of toy spaniel often rivalled the Pug in {{popularity}} as lapdogs for ladies. The disadvantage of the breeds of toy spaniel was that their long coats required constant grooming. By 1830, the toy spaniel had changed somewhat from the dogs of Charles II's day. William Youatt in his 1845 study, The Dog, was not enamoured of the changes: [...] "The King Charles's breed {{of the present}} day is materially altered for the worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead as ugly and prominent as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its former size, and has an expression of stupidity with which {{the character of the}} dog too accurately corresponds." [...] Youatt did concede that the breed's long ears, coat and colouring were attractive. Due to the fashion of the period, the toy spaniels were crossed with Pugs {{to reduce the size of}} their noses and then selectively bred to reduce it further. By doing this, the dog's sense of <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> impaired, and according to 19th century writers, this caused the varieties of toy spaniel to be removed from participation in field sports. Blunt-Lytton proposed that the red and white Blenheim Spaniels always had the shorter nose now seen in the modern King Charles.|$|E

The Examiner reported that Disraeli, on attending one of the committee rooms, left shortly afterwards with {{the other members of the}} committee, [...] "with a mass of papers in one hand, and with his pocket handkerchief applied to his nose" [...] because the <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> so bad. The disruption to its legislative work led to questions being raised in the House of Commons. According to Hansard, the Member of Parliament (MP) John Brady informed Manners that members were unable to use either the Committee Rooms or the Library because of the stench, and asked the minister [...] "if the noble Lord has taken any measures for mitigating the effluvium and discontinuing the nuisance". Manners replied that the Thames was not under his jurisdiction. Four days later a second MP said to Manners that [...] "By a perverse ingenuity, one of the noblest of rivers has been changed into a cesspool, and I wish to ask whether Her Majesty's Government intend to take any steps to remedy the evil?" [...] Manners pointed out [...] "that Her Majesty's Government have nothing whatever to do with the state of the Thames".

In his [...] novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was [...] "a deadly sewer... in the place of a fine, fresh river". In a letter to a friend, Dickens [...] said: [...] "I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that [...] "in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep" [...] on the Thames foreshore, and that [...] "the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged —rising to [...] in the sun.

A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a [...] "pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination", while a second wrote that [...] "the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream".

People were given a can of sardines and 1kg (2.2lb) of rice at these centers. These centers were only able to operate in daylight though {{due to a lack}} of fuel and transportation. Water was supplied in limited quantities from Cebu. Medical and sanitation teams were deployed throughout the province, with many coming from surrounding areas. Residents searched through debris for lumber to construct makeshift coffins while others stacked bodies to be picked up by wheelbarrows or trucks. Officials had difficulty determining how to best deal with mass casualties as bodies lay across the Ormoc region. Many were found in the coastal barangays of Linao, Camp Downes, and Bantigue as well as the Ormoc pier. In order to prevent the spread of disease, mass graves were dug, with 700bodies buried on November8. Dump trucks were used to transport the dead to these sites as quickly as possible. As decomposition set in, residents stated that [...] " [...] putrid <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> unbearable." [...] Even months after the storm, bodies were occasionally discovered, some found in drainage systems. By November10, four navy vessels were searching debris in the waters near Ormoc for bodies; 16 were recovered that day with more believed to be submerged in the bay. Roads surrounding the city were finally cleared by November12; however, electricity remained out. With the deployment of medical teams from Japan, hospitals in the region returned to full capacity. By November22, electricity and water had been 70percent and 60percent restored, respectively.

500|$|After he {{read the}} script, Connery {{realised}} {{the risk of the}} sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer Ken Adam build a Plexiglas partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack. Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian, [...] "We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in Thunderball was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the Disco Volante, was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The <b>smell</b> <b>was</b> horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through. He never got out of a pool faster in his life - he was walking on water." [...] When special-effects coordinator John Stears provided a supposedly dead shark to be towed around the pool, the shark, which was still alive, revived at one point. Due to the dangers on the set, stuntman Bill Cummings demanded an extra fee of £250 to double for Largo's sidekick Quist as he was dropped into the pool of sharks.|$|E
