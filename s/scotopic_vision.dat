2500|$|Daylight vision (i.e. {{photopic}} vision) is subserved by cone receptor cells {{which have}} high spatial density (in the central fovea) and allow high acuity of 6/6 or better. In low light (i.e., <b>scotopic)</b> <b>vision,</b> cones {{do not have}} sufficient sensitivity and vision is subserved by rods. Spatial resolution is then much lower. This is due to spatial summation of rods, i.e. a number of rods merge into a bipolar cell, in turn connecting to a ganglion cell, and the resulting unit for resolution is large, and acuity small. Note {{that there are no}} rods in {{the very center of the}} visual field (the foveola), and highest performance in low light is achieved in near peripheral vision ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} eye size, {{types of}} visual cell and mosaic, {{and the existence}} of retinal tapetum {{in the eyes of the}} spotted barb Puntius binotatus were determined to gain baseline information on its visual capability. The P. binotatus acquired relatively larger eye size than the other similar sized freshwater fish species with its retina being contained both cone and rod visual cells (cone ellipsoid to outer nuclei ratio = 1 : 5. 7). Three types of cone were identified (double-, central single- and corner single- cones), arranging in the square mosaic, and the retinal tapetum was determined to be existed. These results evidenced that the P. binotatus has good visual capability as it possessed both the photopic and <b>scotopic</b> <b>visions.</b> Vision can be the primary sense for the P. binotatus.

2500|$|Vitamin A is a {{group of}} {{unsaturated}} nutritional organic compounds that includes retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and several provitamin A carotenoids (most notably beta-carotene). Vitamin A has multiple functions: it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin, the light-absorbing molecule necessary for both low-light (<b>scotopic</b> <b>vision)</b> and color vision. [...] Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as retinoic acid (an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol), which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason that}} vision is poor under <b>scotopic</b> <b>vision</b> is that rods, {{which are the}} only cells active under <b>scotopic</b> <b>vision,</b> {{converge}} to {{a smaller number of}} neurons in the retina. This many-to-one ratio leads to poor spatial frequency sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Humans see {{differently}} {{at different}} light levels. This is because under high light levels typical {{during the day}} (photopic vision), the eye uses cones to process light. Under very low light levels, corresponding to moonless nights without electric lighting (<b>scotopic</b> <b>vision),</b> the eye uses rods to process light. At many night-time levels, {{a combination of both}} cones and rods supports vision. Photopic vision facilitates excellent color discrimination ability, whereas colors are indiscriminable under <b>scotopic</b> <b>vision.</b> Mesopic vision falls between these two extremes. In most night-time environments, there is enough ambient light at night to prevent true <b>scotopic</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mesopic vision {{occurs in}} {{intermediate}} lighting conditions (luminance level 10−3 to 100.5 cd/m²) and is effectively {{a combination of}} <b>scotopic</b> and photopic <b>vision.</b> This however gives inaccurate visual acuity and color discrimination.|$|R
50|$|Above {{a certain}} {{luminance}} level (about 0.03 cd/m), the cone mechanism {{is involved in}} mediating vision; photopic vision. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing <b>scotopic</b> (night) <b>vision.</b> The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the mesopic range, as {{there is not an}} abrupt transition between the two mechanism. This adaptation forms the basis of the Duplicity Theory.|$|R

50|$|<b>Scotopic</b> <b>vision</b> is {{the vision}} of the eye under low light conditions. The term comes from Greek skotos meaning {{darkness}} and -opia meaning a condition of sight.

50|$|Disc {{shedding}} is {{the process}} by which photoreceptors in the eye are renewed. The retina contains two types of photoreceptor - rod cells and cone cells. There are about 6-7 million cones that provide color vision to the eye, and they are very concentrated in a central spot in the retina, called the macula. However, the rods are much more numerous - about 120 million - and are also more sensitive than the cones. These rods are responsible for <b>scotopic</b> (night) <b>vision,</b> our most sensitive motion detection, and our peripheral vision.|$|R

40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} {{thesis is}} {{a collaboration between}} psychology and physics. Since {{there is no consensus}} in the literature about <b>scotopic</b> color <b>vision,</b> the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the threshold for color vision and investigate whether this threshold lies in the range of <b>scotopic</b> or mesopic <b>vision,</b> i. e. whether only the rod system is active or that both rods and cones mediate color vision at the threshold level. In this thesis, an introduction into color research is given and an experiment is reported with 15 Hz stimuli of di erent colors and scotopic light intensities. Subjects were asked to indicate the color of the stimulus. We found that the threshold for color vision seems to vary for di erent colors and is - 2. 12 +/- 0. 04 log phot. Td for blue, - 0. 69 +/- 0. 07 log phot. Td. for green, - 1 : 35 +/- 0. 05 log phot. Td. for orange and - 1. 59 +/- 0. 06 log phot. Td. for red. Although these values are below the cone threshold according to previous studies, our results indicate that color perception at these intensities is primarily mediated by cones, rather than rods. This implies that the threshold for color vision is within the range of mesopic vision...|$|R
5000|$|There is not {{one single}} {{luminescence}} value where photopic vision and <b>scotopic</b> <b>vision</b> meet. To the contrary, {{there is a wide}} zone of transition between them. Because it is between photopic and <b>scotopic</b> <b>vision,</b> it is usually called the zone of mesopic vision. The reason that the zone of mesopic vision exists is because the activities of neither cones nor rods is simply switched 'on' or 'off'. There are reasons to believe that the cones and the rods both operate in all luminescence conditions.|$|E
