The existing system was adapted into a larger six-person vehicle that was essentially a fiberglass box {{on top of a}} larger version of the same basic chassis, 10 feet long, 6 wide and 4½ tall. The roof section slid open along with the doors {{on the side of the}} vehicle, allowing passengers to enter standing upright. Full-scale testing of this system took place in 1968 on a test track in Bedford, while a smaller 1/20th scale model with ten vehicles and four off-line stations was used to test the guidance and scheduling systems.|$|E

In a full-scale test facility, 84 vehicles {{operated a}}t {{speeds up to}} [...] on a [...] guideway; one-second headways were achieved during tests. Another version of CVS was in public operation for six months from 1975–1976. This system had 12 <b>single-mode</b> <b>vehicles</b> and four dual-mode vehicles on a [...] track with five stations. This version carried over 800,000 passengers. CVS was cancelled when Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport declared it unsafe under existing rail safety regulations, specifically in respect of braking and headway distances.|$|R
