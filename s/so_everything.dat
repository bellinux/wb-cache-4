500|$|Energy was a {{critical}} factor for the British war effort. [...] Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply. [...] Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use. [...] There were no oil wells in Britain <b>so</b> <b>everything</b> was imported. The U.S. pumped two-thirds of the world's oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6 percent by Mexico. [...] The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would survive the German u-boats. Convoys {{and the construction of}} new tankers solved the German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all essential needs were covered.

However, he acknowledged the difficulty of fitting his story into the rest of the Halo universe was far greater for Ghosts of Onyx than the other novels as more of the story had been made public and was no longer able to be modified. Nylund mentioned in an interview with IGN that writing a Halo novel had both its positive aspects and drawbacks. [...] "It's better because I have all these great toys and characters to play with," [...] Nylund stated in an interview, [...] "It's not so good because I have to work and play well with other parts of the intellectual property <b>so</b> <b>everything</b> meshes." ...|$|E

Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret.

After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing.

He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, <b>so</b> <b>everything</b> keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E

"The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] was {{originally}} intended to have a follow-up episode during season three, but after Gene Roddenberry {{stepped back from the}} production of the show after a time-slot change and further cuts in the budget, the idea was scrapped. In 1973, Gerrold had become friends with D. C. Fontana from their time spent on the Star Trek convention circuit together. He had heard about Star Trek: The Animated Series, and offered to do an episode. Fontana responded that she wanted the tribble episode that was cut from season three. [...] This episode was entitled [...] "More Tribbles, More Troubles". The episode introduces the natural predator of the tribbles and genetically engineered tribbles which no longer reproduce but instead grow much larger. As with his other Animated Series episode [...] "", he later explained that almost nothing was cut from the original pitches for the third season of The Original Series as animation played out quicker and <b>so</b> <b>everything</b> still fit into the episode despite the reduced running time. Both of Gerrold's Animated Series episodes were novelised by Alan Dean Foster, and Gerrold later said that he thought that he did [...] "a fine job".|$|E

500|$|In 1978, Lizzy {{released}} {{their first}} live album Live and Dangerous. There is some disagreement over {{just how much}} of the album is actually recorded live – producer Tony Visconti claimed that the only parts that were not overdubbed were the drums and the audience. However Brian Robertson has disputed this, saying that he had refused Lynott's request to re-record a guitar solo, and that the only overdubs were backing vocals and some guitar parts by Gorham. He added, [...] "It's just not true. The only reason we said that it was recorded all over was obviously for tax reasons... <b>so</b> <b>everything</b> that Visconti claims is bollocks." [...] Gorham concurs, stating that he attempted to re-record a solo but could not recreate the live sound, adding, [...] "I re-did one rhythm track and a few backing vocals. But that's it." [...] The album was a huge success, reaching no. 2 in the UK, and was ranked as the best live album of all time by Classic Rock Magazine in 2004. But this success was overshadowed by the permanent departure of Robertson some time after a gig in Ibiza on 6 July 1978, the disagreements with Lynott having developed to an impossible level. Robertson soon teamed up with Jimmy Bain to front their new band, Wild Horses.|$|E
500|$|For crowd scenes, CIS {{supplemented}} the live-action extras {{with digital}} pedestrians created using motion capture. House of Moves captured {{the movements of}} five men and four women during a two-day shoot supervised by Hancock. The motion capture performers were coached to make the [...] "small, formal and refined" [...] movements that Owens said reflected the general public's conduct at the time. CIS combined the motion data with the Massive software package to generate the interactions of the digital pedestrians. The use of Massive presented a challenge {{when it came to}} blending digital pedestrians with live-action extras who had to move from the foreground into the digital crowd. Massive worked well until this stage, when the effects team had to move the digital pedestrians to avoid taking the live-action extras out of the shot. To allow close-ups of individual Massive extras, the effects team focused on their faces and walking characteristics. Hancock explained, [...] "We {{wanted to be able to}} push Massive right up to the camera and see how well it held up. In a couple of shots the characters might be 40 feet away from the camera, about 1/5 screen height. The bigger the screen is, the bigger the character. He could be 10 feet tall, <b>so</b> <b>everything,</b> even his hair, better look good!" [...] Typically, a limited number of motion performances are captured and Massive is used to create further variety, such as in height and walking speed. Because the digital extras were required to be close to the foreground, and to integrate them properly with the live action extras, House of Moves captured twice as much motion data than CIS had used on any other project. CIS created nine distinct digital characters. To eliminate inaccuracies that develop when creating a digital extra of different proportions to the motion capture performer, CIS sent nine skeleton rigs to House of Moves before work began. This gave House of Moves time to properly adapt the rigs to its performers, resulting in motion capture data that required very little editing in Massive. CIS wrote shaders for their clothing; displacement maps in the air shader were linked with the motion capture to animate wrinkles in trousers and jackets.|$|E
