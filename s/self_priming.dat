40|$|Changes in rat {{anterior}} {{pituitary gland}} LU secretion {{were correlated with}} changes in morphology of pituitary LH cells during a simulated preovulatory surge of LU in serum. In phenobarbital blocked proestrous rats, LHRH was infused i. v. at a constant rate (50 ng/h) previously shown to restore the LH surge. Rats were decapitated prior to or {{after the start of}} L 1 -IRH infusion. Pars distalis tissue was stained with anti-rat LHI 3 sera and examined by electron microscopy. The basic cell type which stained in control rats was polygonal to ovoid. Granules were, for the most part, evenly distributed throughout the cell or concentrated at 1 pole. The LHRH infused rats exhibited a cell type with a similar shape and granule size. LURI-I infusion appeared to result in LU cells becoming less irregular in shape, but our criteria for classification were probably too strict to demonstrate this quantitatively. Pituitary LH concentration and LH granule number were not decreased at 15 and 30 mm of the simulated LH surge despite a 6 -fold increase in serum LU at these times (LHRH <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> period). The serum LH then rose rapidly by 1 h of LHRH infusion during the initial part of an augmented phase of LH release, an effect attributed to prior LHRH <b>self</b> <b>priming.</b> Similarly, pituitary LH an...|$|E

40|$|Recently Burton, Bruce and Johnston (1990) have {{presented}} an interactive activation and competition model of face recognition. They {{have shown that}} this IAC model presents a parsimonious account of semantic and repetition priming effects with faces. In addition, {{a number of new}} predictions are evident from the model's structure. One such prediction is highlighted by Burton et al. themselves - that for short prime-target stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) a face should prime the recognition of a target name (or vice versa), 'self priming'. This thesis examined this prediction and found that it held for a design in which items were repeated across prime type conditions (same, associated, neutral and unrelated). Further, cross (face prime/name target) and within-domain (name prime/name target) designs were found to produce equivalent degrees of self and semantic priming (Experiments 1 and 2). Closer examination of the Burton et al. model suggested that the effect of domain equivalence for <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> should not hold for a design in which the stimulus items are not repeated across prime type conditions (i. e. subjects are presented with each item only once). This prediction was confirmed in Experiments 3, 4, 5 and 6. The time courses of self and semantic priming were investigated in two experiments where the interstimulus interval (ISI) between prime and target, and prime presentation times were varied. The results proved difficult to accommodate within the Burton et al. model, but it is argued that they did not provide a sufficient basis on which to reject the model. Finally, the <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> paradigm was applied to the study of distinctiveness effects. Faces judged to be distinctive in appearance were found to produce more facilitation than faces judged to be typical in appearance. Similarly, caricatured representation of faces were found to produce more facilitation than veridical or anticaricatured representations. The results of the distinctiveness studies are discussed in terms of the Valentine's (1991 a; 1991 b) exemplar-based coding model and Burton, Bruce and Johnston's (1990) IAC implementation. It is concluded that the results of these experiments lend support to the Burton et al. model...|$|E

Such common emotions as guilt, shame, and nostalgia only arise in relation to the self (Sedikides, Wildschut, & Baden, 2004; Tangney & Dearing, 2002). Likewise, people’s sense of self-esteem shapes their emotional reactions to success and failure (Brown & Dutton, 1995). Finally, affirming the self protects people against negative ruminations and stress (Cresswell et al., 2005; Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, & Dijksterhuis, 1999), whereas focusing on the self’s shortcomings renders people vulnerable to anxiety and depression (Higgins, 1987; Pyszczynski & Greenberg, 1987).

Enzymatic synthesis of these glycoconjugates should give {{access to these}} important molecules to evaluate their potential. The polysialyltransferases from both Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli. We have used synthetic acceptors to probe the acceptor requirement of these enzymes and to examine the basic enzymology. The minimum number of sialic acid residues (Neu 5 Ac) on the acceptor for activity in vitro was shown to be 2 for both enzymes, but a large increase in activity was seen if the acceptor had three Neu 5 Ac residues. The polysialyltransferase from N. meningitidis generated longer reaction products than the enzyme from E. coli on FCHASE acceptors. Examination of the products showed them to be a heterogeneous mixture, but products with > 50 Neu 5 Ac residues could be seen using capillary zone electrophoresis analyses.

An efficient, bidirectional, and multifunctional micropump {{is important to}} enhance the overall efficiency of any microsystem with fluid flow. Developing a bidirectional micropump with pumping and mixing capabilities will advance microsysetems technology and aid in fabricating more compact microsystems. ^ In this work, a valve-less rectification micropump based on bifurcation geometry is designed, fabricated, and tested. Three different designs were experimentally investigated. Numerical investigation based on Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) was employed prior to the experimental work to numerically measure the microfluidic diodicity in conventional and non-conventional geometries at low Reynolds numbers. Sofllithography and optical lithography were used to fabricate the micropumps. The working fluid and actuator were chosen to be ethanol and PZT, respectively. Moreover, {{the effect of the}} fabrication material on the micropump efficiency was investigated where two micropumps were fabricated from two different materials, PDMS and SU- 8, and the testing results were compared. ^ Additionally, the concept of valve-less rectification micropump based on a dynamic rectifying geometry was tested and verified. The results confirm the feasibility of the valve-less rectification micropump based on bifurcation geometry. Since streaming flow occurs in bifurcation structures when oscillatory flow in presence, the results of this work will lay the foundations for a micrcofluidic device that can perform two functions (bidirectional pumping and Mixing), generate streaming flow at zero-mean velocity, reliable, easy to fabricate, cost effective, compatible with wide range of working fluids and materials, capable of delivering particles-laden fluids, and <b>self</b> <b>priming.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} the ultrastructure and microtensile bond strengths (TBS) of self-etching (with different acidity) and conventional adhesive systems bonded to unground enamel. Materials and Methods: Resin composite (Filtek Z 250) buildups were bonded to unground enamel surfaces of third molars after adhesive application with the following materials: Clearfil SE Bond (CSE); Optibond Solo Plus Self-Etch (OP); Tyrian <b>Self</b> <b>Priming</b> Etching (TY), and the controls Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus (SBMP) and Single Bond (SB). Six teeth were assigned to each material. After storage in water for 24 h at 37 degrees C, the bonded specimens were sectioned into beams of approximately 0. 8 mm(2) and subsequently subjected to mu TBS testing at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The average values were subjected to one-way ANOVA (alpha = 0. 05). The effect of surface conditioning of each material was observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: The highest resin-enamel bond strength was observed for SBMP (22. 7 +/- 5. 2) and SB (26. 7 +/- 5. 2 MPa). The lowest mean bond strengths were 10. 9 +/- 3. 2 and 7. 8 +/- 1. 5 MPa for TY and OP, respectively. CSE showed an intermediate performance (18. 7 +/- 4. 6 MPa). An overall increase in porosity was evident along the entire enamel surface treated with the self-etching primers; however, no selective demineralization similar to that with 35 % phosphoric acid was observed. Conclusion: The highest bond strength means and the more retentive etching pattern were observed for the two-step etch-and-rinse adhesives.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} bond {{strength}} and the morphology of enamel after application of self-etching adhesive systems with different acidities. The tested hypothesis was that {{the performance of the}} self-etching adhesive systems does not vary for the studied parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Composite resin (Filtek Z 250) buildups were bonded to untreated (prophylaxis) and treated (bur-cut or SiC-paper) enamel surfaces of third molars after application of four self-etching and two etch-and-rinse adhesive systems (n= 6 /condition) : Clearfil SE Bond (CSE); OptiBond Solo Plus Self-Etch (OP); AdheSe (AD); Tyrian <b>Self</b> <b>Priming</b> Etching (TY), Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus (SBMP) and Adper Single Bond (SB). After storage in water (24 h/ 37 °C), the bonded specimens were sectioned into sticks with 0. 8 mm² cross-sectional area and the microtensile bond strength was tested at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The mean bond strength values (MPa) were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05). The etching patterns of the adhesive systems were also observed with a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: The main factor adhesive system was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). The mean bond strength values (MPa) and standard deviations were: CSE (20. 5 ± 3. 5), OP (11. 3 ± 2. 3), AD (11. 2 ± 2. 8), TY (11. 1 ± 3. 0), SBMP (21. 9 ± 4. 0) and SB (24. 9 ± 3. 0). Different etching patterns were observed for the self-etching primers depending on the enamel treatment and the pH of the adhesive system.

A 3 -day treatment of cycling rats with FSH (Metrodin(R); 10 IU/injection) lowered the spontaneous pre-ovulatory LH-surge and suppressed the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) response to GnRH. FSH also suppressed the LH response of pseudopregnant (PSP) rats on day 8 of pseudopregnancy, but not that of day- 8 PSP rats which had been ovariectomized on day 4 (OVX-PSP rats). GnRH induced <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> in cycling, PSP and OVX-PSP rats. Oestradiol strongly augmented the pituitary LH-response to GnRH injection in PSP and OVX-PSP rats, but not in cycling rats; probably because in these latter animals the LH response to GnRH was already augmented by endogenous oestradiol. FSH suppressed the LH response to GnRH in oestradiol-treated PSP and cycling rats; in these latter rats {{the suppression of the}} LH response was as strong as that in cycling rats not treated with oestradiol. FSH did not suppress the LH response of oestradiol-treated OVX-PSP rats. The effect of FSH was not associated with changes in plasma oestradiol and progesterone concentrations. Analysis of the data revealed that FSH specifically suppressed the augmentative effect of oestradiol, but did not affect the GnRH-self priming effect. It is concluded that under the influence of FSH, the ovaries produce a factor which suppresses the augmentative effect of oestradiol on the GnRH-induced LH response of the pituitary gland. It is suggested that this effect of FSH underlies the suppression of the spontaneous LH-surges of FSH-treated cycling rats. As the present putative 'oestrogen-antagonizing factor' did not suppress the GnRH-self priming effect, it is suggested that this factor is not identical to gonadotrophin surge inhibiting factor...|$|E

If the priming procedures had been more effective, perhaps self-monitoring would have played a stronger role. The mediating role of self-monitoring is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{effort by the}} Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) and Honeywell for NASA to design, fabricate, and test a preflight prototype pump {{for use in the}} Extravehicular activity (EVA) portable life support subsystem (PLSS). Major design decisions were driven by the need to reduce the pump s mass, power, and volume compared to the existing PLSS pump. In addition, the pump will accommodate a much wider range of abnormal conditions than the existing pump, including vapor/gas bubbles and increased pressure drop when employed to cool two suits simultaneously. A positive displacement, external gear type pump was selected because it offers the most compact and highest efficiency solution over the required range of flow rates and pressure drops. An additional benefit of selecting a gear pump design is that it is <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> and capable of ingesting noncondensable gas without becoming "air locked. " The chosen pump design consists of a 28 V DC, brushless, sealless, permanent magnet motor driven, external gear pump that utilizes a Honeywell development that eliminates the need for magnetic coupling. Although the planned flight unit will use a sensorless motor with custom designed controller, the preflight prototype to be provided for this project incorporates Hall effect sensors, allowing an interface with a readily available commercial motor controller. This design approach reduced the cost of this project and gives NASA more flexibility in future PLSS laboratory testing. The pump design was based on existing Honeywell designs, but incorporated features specifically for the PLSS application, including all of the key features of the flight pump. Testing at TEES will simulate the vacuum environment in which the flight pump will operate. Testing will verify that the pump meets design requirements for range of flow rates, pressure rise, power consumption, working fluid temperature, operating time, and restart capability. Pump testing is currently scheduled for March, 2009, after which the pump will be delivered to NASA for further testing...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} possible {{sex differences}} in PRL secretory patterns and regulation by E$ sb 2 $ in gonadectomized Dorset x Leicester x Suffolk sheep kept under natural photoperiod (latitude 45 $ sp circ 31 sp prime$). Patterns were assessed over 14 months in groups of 10 rams and ewes, half of which received E$ sb 2 $ replacement (Silastic implants) {{at the time of}} gonadectomy to maintain blood E$ sb 2 $ at ram breeding-season values. Mean monthly PRL level (based on two 3 -h periods of blood sampling) was consistently elevated by E$ sb 2 $ in the ram (mean 19 %), and during all but a few months {{in the spring and summer}} in the ewes (mean 90 %). Sex differences in the mean PRL were most apparent for the E$ sb 2 $-treated sheep in August (rams 280 $ pm$ 54 ng/ml vs ewes 128 $ pm$ 18 ng/ml) and for the control sheep in November (rams 19 $ pm$ 5 ng/ml vs ewes 10 $ pm$ 2 ng/ml). Episodic PRL secretion (with 5 -min sampling for 4 h) was assessed in every season. In all four groups, pulse amplitude and frequency and basal level were higher in summer than winter. E$ sb 2 $ treatment was associated with larger PRL pulses in both sexes in every season but summer, and with decreased (from 8. 2 to 4. 6 per 4 h) and increased (from 2. 2 to 6. 6 per 4 h) frequencies of pulses in rams in the spring and summer, respectively. The PRL response to TRH (two iv injections 50 ng/kg BW given 80 min apart) was also assessed in every season. Mean 40 -min increases after injection were highest in spring and summer. E$ sb 2 $ treatment produced in both sexes a 2 - 3 fold larger increment 1 in every season, and increment 2 in specific seasons. Preinjection and increment values were positively correlated within animals of each group across seasons (r = 0. 89 and 0. 65). The Incr 2 /lncr 1 ratio (mean 0. 76 $ pm$ 0. 10) was not affected by seasons or E$ sb 2 $, and did not denote a <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> effect of TRH. Diurnal patterns indicated that PRL mean levels during light and dark phases were not different from each other withi...|$|E
40|$|Mankind’s {{need for}} {{sustainable}} technology is increasing with the ever {{growing demand for}} and depletion of finite energy reserves. Research into the conversion of sustainable energy resources such as wind, hydro and solar into high quality mechanical, chemical or electrical energy is becoming more significant and of greater urgency in modern society. The research reported in this thesis continues from previous work {{carried out in the}} development of a small, low cost solar thermal water pump. The aim of the research was to take a pump previously designed at the University of Canterbury to further develop and refine the system to improve operation, performance, physical and operational design, as well as reliability and maintainability. The earlier design was a novel single acting, double diaphragm pump operating on a thermal cycle similar to a Rankine cycle, dubbed The ‘Modified’ Rankine cycle. Although it was adequate to prove the concept it was inefficient and impractical in design. In order to achieve research goals this previous design was dropped and a new double acting unit developed to give greater performance, smoother flow output, be self starting and <b>self</b> <b>priming</b> and therefore be able to operate unattended. The new design is intended to overcome the major failings of the first prototype while being significantly smaller, lighter, more robust and reliable, and be relatively maintenance free. A complex computer simulation of the collector and pump system was modified and developed for the new design to optimise pump geometry and predict pump operation for any average day at any location and for any water head. Thermodynamic analysis of the pump showed significant exergy loss with the internal energy of the working fluid not being used but was an unavoidable trade off for simplicity, cost and reliability. The new pump was optimised to pump water through a 6 metre vertical water head, operating on a 2. 9 m² flat plate sheet and tube non tracking solar collector. With n-Pentane as the working fluid operating at 56 °C a peak flow rate of 27 litres per minute was predicted with a corresponding efficiency of 0. 93 %. For a good summer’s day 10, 000 litres could be lifted through 6 metres. A suitable initial application of this solar thermal pumping unit would be in solar water heating installations for swimming pools. As a circulation pump a solar thermal unit would have distinct advantages: it would have no running cost, it would add heat to the pumped water reducing the area of water heating panel, and would only pump during daylight hours ie. fully automated and self contained operation...|$|E

40|$|In several studies, {{the authors}} examine the {{potential}} to leverage a consumer’s moral identity to enhance brand and company identification and promote goodwill through community relations. Studies 1 a and 1 b show that even when opportunity costs are equivalent (subjectively or economically), consumers who also have a highly self-important moral identity perceive the act of giving time versus money as more moral and self-expressive. The authors extend these findings to self-reported preferences and establish boundary conditions in two additional studies. Consumers with higher organizational status prefer to give money versus time, but this preference is weaker for those with a highly self-important moral identity (Study 2), and the preference for giving time versus money {{is more likely to}} emerge when the moral <b>self</b> is <b>primed</b> and the time given has a moral purpose (Study 3).

40|$|SummaryT cells causing {{autoimmunity}} must escape tolerance. We {{observed that}} CD 8 + T cells with high avidity for an antigen {{expressed in the}} pancreas, kidney, and thymic medulla were efficiently removed from a polyclonal repertoire by central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. However, both mechanisms spared low-avidity T cells from elimination. Neither the introduction of activated, self-antigen-specific CD 4 + helper T cells nor a global inflammatory stimulus were sufficient to activate the low-avidity CD 8 + T cells and did not break tolerance. In contrast, challenge with a recombinant bacterium expressing the <b>self</b> antigen <b>primed</b> the low-avidity T cells, and the animals rapidly developed autoimmune diabetes. We suggest that whereas thymic and peripheral tolerance mechanisms remove cells that can be primed by endogenous amounts of self antigen, they do not guard against tissue destruction by low-avidity effector T cells, which have been primed by higher amounts of self antigen or by crossreactive antigens...|$|R
