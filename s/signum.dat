Ecce <b>signum!</b> Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E

40|$|Goal of <b>Signum's</b> R and D {{activities}} were {{the design and}} development of functional prototypes of an industrial high-resolution RGB-linescan-camera (3 x 8000 pixels) including a control and pre-processing unit based on a VME-bus module. An important partial aspect focused on the realization of a high-level colour stability {{as well as an}} on-line calibration. A market analysis was performed {{at the beginning of the}} project to gain information on available RGB-linescan sensors. Based on their specifications and according to requirements from industrial target applications appropriate design goals could be defined. Subsequently, the detailed design as well as the functional prototypes were realized. A demonstrator system was built up to allow the evaluation of the functional prototypes, further the development of related driver and test software. In the final integration step, an application demonstrator was developed, allowing to demonstrate a colour-stable RGB-acquisition which provides the basis for a subsequent high precision colour classification.

25|$|Each legion, furthermore, had a vexillifer {{who carried}} a vexillum or <b>signum,</b> with the legion name and emblem {{depicted}} on it, {{unique to the}} legion. It was common for a legion to detach some sub-units from the main camp to strengthen other corps. In these cases, the detached subunits carried only the vexillum, and not the aquila, and were called, therefore, vexillationes. A miniature vexillum, mounted on a silver base, was sometimes awarded to officers as a recognition of their service upon retirement or reassignment.|$|E

2500|$|Diocletian's avowed {{conservatism}} {{almost certainly}} precludes a systematic design toward personal elevation as a [...] "divine monarch". Rather, he formally elaborated imperial ceremony as {{a manifestation of}} the divine order of empire and elevated emperorship as the supreme instrument of the divine will. The idea was [...] Augustan, or earlier, expressed most clearly in Stoic philosophy and the solar cult, especially under Aurelian. At the very beginning of his reign, before his Tetrarchy, Diocletian had adopted the [...] of Jovius; his co-Augustus adopted the title Herculius. During the Tetrarchy, the titles were multiplied, but with no clear reflection of implicit divine seniority: in one case, the divine <b>signum</b> of the Augustus is inferior to that of his Caesar. These divine associations may have followed a military precedent of emperors as comes to divinities (or divinities as comes to emperors). Moreover, the divine <b>signum</b> appears in the fairly narrow context of court panegyric and civil etiquette. It makes no appearance on the general coinage of the Tetrarchy: coin images and group statuary of the Tetrarchs themselves show each as an impersonal, near-homogenous abstraction of imperial might and unity.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman Emperor Constantine the Great {{converted}} to Christianity after a vision before the famous Battle of the Milvian Bridge, having seen a chi-rho in the sky, and thence the motto In Hoc Signo Vinces, {{telling him he}} would be victorious with {{the sign of the}} cross. The chi-rho was adopted on a banner, the labarum, upheld on a vexillum, which resembled a Christian cross, and in time the motto became associated with the Cross all over Europe. [...] Legend has it that St. Patrick struck the shield of Conall, son of King Niall of the Nine Hostages, with his crosier, called Bachall Isa (the staff of Jesus) inscribing thereon a sign of the cross and told him the same, and baptized him. According to the Life and Acts of Saint Patrick (chapter 138), commissioned by Sir John de Courcy and written by Jocelyn of Furness (c. 1185 AD), St. Patrick took his staff, known as the staff of Jesus, or Bacall Iosa, and struck the shield of Prince Conall, rendering a sign of the Cross on it, “et mox cum baculo suo, qui baculus Jesu dicebatur Crucis <b>signum</b> ejus scuto impressit, asserens neminem de stirpe ejus in bello vincendum qui <b>signum</b> illud”, and thus indicating that he and his offspring would henceforth be victorious in battle if they followed that sign This legend is also described several centuries later in the Lebhar Inghine i Dhomhnaill. His land became Tír Chonaill, Tyrconnell, the land of Conall.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{foundation}} charter of Chester Abbey granted by his uncle Hugh Lupus, earl of Chester, and purportedly issued in 1093, Ranulf le Meschin {{is listed as}} a witness. His attestation to this grant is written <b>Signum</b> Ranulfi nepotis comitis, [...] "signature of Ranulf nephew of the earl". However, {{the editor of the}} Chester comital charters, Geoffrey Barraclough, thought this charter was forged in the period of Earl Ranulf II. Between 1098 and 1101 (probably in 1098) Ranulf became a major English landowner in his own right when he became the third husband of Lucy, heiress of the honour of Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire. This acquisition also brought him the lordship of Appleby in Westmorland, previously held by Lucy's second husband Ivo Taillebois.|$|E
2500|$|The {{religion}} of Isis thus {{spread throughout the}} Roman Empire during the formative centuries of Christianity. Wall paintings and objects reveal her pervasive presence at Pompeii, preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE. In Rome, temples were built (such as the Temple of Isis and Serapis) and obelisks erected in her honour. In Greece, the cult of Isis was introduced to traditional centres of worship in Delos, Delphi, Eleusis and Athens, {{as well as in}} northern Greece. Harbours of Isis were to be found on the Arabian Sea and the Black Sea. Inscriptions show followers in Gaul, Spain, Pannonia, Germany, Arabia, Asia Minor, Portugal and many shrines even in Britain. Tacitus interprets a goddess among the Germanic Suebi as a form of Isis whose symbol (<b>signum)</b> was a ship. Bruce Lincoln regards the identity of this Germanic goddess as [...] "elusive".|$|E
