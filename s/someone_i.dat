5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: <b>someone</b> (<b>I</b> don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

500|$|Daniels hired Appel as {{executive}} producer and showrunner on King of the Hill in 1997, leading the show's writing process and overseeing {{all aspects of}} the show. Daniels noted: [...] "It was essential that Rich was a good writer who could deal with people, who could help manage the business in the room. But equally important was {{the fact that he was}} <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> could trust, who had a similar sense of taste and values." [...] He stayed until 2001. For his work on The Simpsons and King of the Hill, Appel won three Primetime Emmy Awards. Appel created the short-lived series A.U.S.A., which aired in 2003, which he based on his own experiences as an assistant U.S. attorney.|$|E

Sibley reported that Travers told him, [...] "I could only agree if I could do {{it on my own}} terms. I'd have to work with <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> trust." [...] Regardless, while watching the original film together—the first time Travers had seen it since the premiere—she became excited at times and thought certain aspects were excellent, while others were unappealing. The sequel never went to production, and when approached to do a stage adaptation in the 1990s, she only acquiesced on the condition that English-born writers and no one from the film production were to be directly involved with the musical's development.|$|E
500|$|Following {{her role}} in Green Lantern, news {{surfaced}} of Blake Lively leaving the show to further her acting career in Hollywood. IOL notes [...] "Despite all talk of career trajectories and fanbase, Blake insists her choices are made through far simpler criteria and when asked about playing in a comic-book film says: 'It’s not really a suitable question because the decisions I make on parts come from a more emotional place. It {{has to be a}} character I connect with or <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> can have empathy with.'" [...] New York Magazine and various media periodicals have also noted the possibility of Lively leaving the show. Serena and Georgina's dresses were designed by Jenny Packham and Marchesa, respectively. Blair wore an Alexis Mabille dress while Chuck wore a Ralph Lauren suit.|$|E
500|$|On October 5, 2015, Grant {{was signed}} by the Island Storm and would return to Canada for the 2015–16 season. He would join the Storm for {{training}} camp in early December.

[...] Grant was also praised by Salerno for his experience in the ACC in his college years. In his debut for the Storm, Grant recorded a double-double, with 24 points and 10 assists. Grant started 23 of his 34 regular season games, led the Storm in assists and assists per game with 157 and 4.6 respectively, and posted averages of 11.6 points, 1.7 rebounds and 0.8 steals per game.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Gypsy" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously worked with Shakira on the videos for songs such as [...] "No". The video stars Spanish professional tennis player Rafael Nadal, who portrays Shakira's love interest in the video. When asked about the reason for starring Nadal in the video, Shakira said she [...] "thought that maybe I needed <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> could in some way identify with. And Rafael Nadal {{is a person who}} has been totally committed to his career since he was very young, since he was 17, I believe." [...] The music videos for [...] "Gypsy" [...] and the Spanish-language version [...] "Gitana" [...] were released on 27 February 2010. The video begins with Shakira playing the harmonica, dressed in a black halter top and a long black skirt. The next scenes mainly consist of Shakira interacting with Nadal in different ways, such as dancing for him and laying together on the ground. The video ends with the duo sharing a kiss.|$|E
500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn You Inside Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn You Inside Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was one of those moments when we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> want to hang out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. We love the idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Gay's 200m {{performance}} at the 2006 IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart {{was the culmination of}} a highly successful year. He became the World Athletics Final champion with another improved personal best of 19.68s, making him the joint third-fastest 200m sprinter with Namibian Frankie Fredericks. Gay was pleased that Fredericks was on site to see his best equaled: [...] "To run that time in front of Frankie is a privilege. He's <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> admire a great deal both as an athlete and as a man." [...] Gay also won a bronze medal in the 100m, finishing behind Powell and Scott. However, Gay proved himself over 100m at the 2006 IAAF World Cup, taking gold with a 9.88s run. At the end of the season, with Gatlin banned from competition, Gay dominated the Track and Field News US 2006 list, having run six of the seven fastest 100m, with Scott in third, and four of the top six 200m times (behind Carter and Spearmon). Furthermore, he was the second fastest 100m runner in the world that year, second only to world record holder Powell. Having proven himself to be adept at both 100 and 200m, Gay reflected upon his development as a sprinter: ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|McCann {{notes that}} Grant {{typically}} played [...] "wealthy privileged characters who {{never seemed to}} have any need to work {{in order to maintain}} their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle. He became a star whose characters were good looking, quick witted, funny and athletic, a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying". Martin Stirling, commenting in the biography Cary Grant: In Name Only, thought that Grant had an acting range which was [...] "greater than any of his contemporaries, but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor. He believes that Grant was always at his [...] "physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce". Charles Champlin, commenting in Donald Deschner's The Complete Films of Cary Grant (1973) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant's screen persona, in his unusual ability to [...] "mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes". He remarks that Grant was [...] "refreshingly able to play the near-fool, the fey idiot, without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake. His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is, as a matter of fact, probably unique among superstars. Nobody else comes even close to mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it". Wansell further notes that Grant could, [...] "with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest hint of a smile, question his own image", managing to [...] "blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars have ever done, by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously, and mixing his own unique mixture of naïveté and worldliness". Stanley Donen, a director who had worked with Grant, stated that his real [...] "magic" [...] came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real, which came from [...] "enormous amounts of work" [...] rather than being God-given. Grant remarked of his career: [...] "I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing. I played at being <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be until I became that person, Or he became me". He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy, unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the [...] "well-tailored charmer" [...] of Charade.|$|E
500|$|Director and screenwriter Steve Kloves {{spent six}} months writing The Fabulous Baker Boys from the {{perspective}} of its three main characters, exploring their relationship with each other. Kloves eventually decided to write the film {{in the form of a}} character study, developing Susie into a [...] "feisty wild card looking for something more from her life." [...] Susie is portrayed by American actress Michelle Pfeiffer, who claims to have first been offered the role five years before production began, only to decline it on several occasions. Despite being one of the most sought-after actresses at the time due to her recent Academy Award-nominated performance in Dangerous Liaisons (1988), some studio executives feared that Pfeiffer was still too obscure to attract a large audience on her own. Having already known her personally, Pfeiffer became the first actor Kloves expressed interest in casting in The Fabulous Baker Boys; he eventually focused on casting real-life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Fabulous Baker Boys once establishing contact with Pfeiffer proved difficult. However, the script continued to struggle without an actress playing Susie. During this time, actress Debra Winger and singer Madonna were both considered for the role, the latter of whom turned it down because she felt the script was [...] "too mushy". Actresses Jodie Foster and Jennifer Jason Leigh had also expressed interest in the part, but Kloves was eventually able to contact Pfeiffer, maintaining that she is the only actress he himself had ever considered for the role. Although the actress enjoyed both the script and character, with whom she identified emotionally, she was hesitant to commit to another role so soon after having just recently completed several film projects in a row, initially intending to go on hiatus after filming Dangerous Liaisons due to exhaustion. Thus, Kloves spent one week visiting Pfeiffer at her home until she finally relented. Prior to The Fabulous Baker Boys, most of Pfeiffer's roles had been rather unglamorous; Pfeiffer claims that she typically avoided playing glamorous characters because she found most of them uninteresting until she discovered Susie. Pfeiffer accepted the role because she [...] "thought [...] was a great woman... <b>someone</b> <b>I</b> really wanted to be like." [...] Film critic Mike D'Angelo, writing for The Dissolve, believes that Pfeiffer decided to accept the role of Susie because she was still embarrassed by her performance in the unsuccessful musical Grease 2 (1982), and wanted to prove that she was in fact capable of playing a character who was a combination of both Sandy Olsson and Betty Rizzo from Grease (1978) at the same time.|$|E
