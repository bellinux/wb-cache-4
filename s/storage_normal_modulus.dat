40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} tests on Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) sheet bonded steel plates. The specimens were tensioned to failure after enduring a pre-set number of fatigue cycles at various load ratios (defined as the ratio of the maximum load in the fatigue test to the corresponding static strength). The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of fatigue loading on bond strength and failure modes. Both <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> (E = 240 GPa) and high modulus (E = 640 GPa) CFRP sheets were used in the tests. The experimental results were compared with those for specimens subjected to static tension alone. It was found that the failure modes of the CFRP-sheet bonded steel plates were not affected greatly by the fatigue loading except for those bonded with high modulus CFRP, where fiber fracture extended over more than one cross-section. The fatigue loads appear to have less effect on the bond strength of high modulus CFRP-sheet bonded steel plates.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that alkali aggregate reaction (AAR) causes extensive random cracking in concrete and reduces the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and to a certain extent, the compressive strength. This would undoubtedly bring {{the safety of the}} structure into question and may require extensive repairs to be carried out. In this paper RC concrete columns together with concrete cylinders containing reactive aggregate in the form of fused silica were prepared and exposed to 38 °C and 100 % humidity to accelerate the AAR damage. The damaged RC columns were confined with one and two layers of high and <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and tested under uniaxial compression. A damaged column without CFRP confinement was also prepared for comparison purposes. The results show that the mechanical property of concrete damaged by AAR does not affect the load carrying capacity of RC column. Time of CFRP application and types of CFRP modulus provides active or passive confinement effect on RC columns. Confinement with high modulus CFRP is not effective in controlling the AAR expansion in the concrete due to its low tensile strain capacity. CFRP confinement with <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> CFRP improves the mechanical characteristic of the RC concrete columns...|$|R

The behaviour of the specimens was further investigated by using nonlinear finite element analysis to predict the failure modes and load capacity.

This paper describes an experimental investigation of the efficiency of the bond between steel and <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> CFRP sheets under dynamic tensile loads of various loading speeds.

This paper focuses on the experimental determination of the tensile mechanical properties of such materials at quasi-static and intermediate strain rates. A drop-mass rig and an impact Instron testing machine were utilised to conduct impact tests of CFRP and epoxy. It was found that the tensile properties of CFRP and the two adhesives are strain rate-dependent, even though their general trends and percentages of enhancement differ.

Empirical equations in terms of strain rates are proposed to estimate the tensile properties of CFRP and both adhesives at any strain rate within the range considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} study on carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabrics in axial strengthening of hollow square sections (HSS) {{was investigated in}} this paper. CFRP was used as strips form with other parameters such {{as the number of}} layers and spacing of strips. Experimental results revealed that the external bonding of <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> CFRP strips significantly enhanced the load carrying capacity and stiffness of the hollow sections and also reduced the axial shortening of columns by providing external confinement against the elastic deformation. The increase in the CFRP strips thickness effectively delayed the local buckling of the above members and led to the inward buckling rather than outward one. Finally, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element modeling of CFRP strengthened hollow square sectionswas created by using ANSYS 12. 0 to validate the results and the numerical results such as failure modes and load deformation behaviour fairly agreed with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} tests on CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) bonded steel plate joints subjected to fatigue loading.

It was found that when the maximum applied load is less than 40 % of the ultimate static strength there is no fatigue failure in the specimens. When the maximum applied load is less than about 35 % of the ultimate static strength, the influence on the bond strength is not significant (less than 10 %). A reduction in bond slip stiffness was observed due to accumulated damage caused by the fatigue loading.

The lipid composition and density in the cytoplasmic (CP) leaflet differ from those of the extracellular (EC) leaflet. A new way of differentiating the two sides of such asymmetric membranes using the phase signal in alternate contact atomic force microscopy is presented. This method does not require molecular resolution and is applied to study the stiffness and intertrimer lipid mobility in both leaflets of the PM independently over a broad range of pH and salt concentrations. PM stiffens with increasing salt concentration according to two different regimes. At low salt concentration, the membrane Young’s <b>normal</b> <b>modulus</b> grows quickly but differentially for the EC and CP leaflets. At higher salt concentration, both leaflets behave similarly and their stiffness converges toward the native environment value.
