50|$|RAID 5E, RAID 5EE, and RAID 6E (with {{the added}} E {{standing}} for Enhanced) generally refer to variants of RAID 5 or 6 with an integrated hot-spare drive, where the <b>spare</b> <b>drive</b> {{is an active}} part of the block rotation scheme. This spreads I/O across all drives, including the spare, thus reducing the load on each drive, increasing performance. It does, however, prevent sharing the <b>spare</b> <b>drive</b> among multiple arrays, which is occasionally desirable.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Model 1 {{consists of}} the 2314 control unit, a 2312 single drive module, and two 2313 four drive modules {{for a total of}} nine disk drives bundled together with one price. The drives are mounted in individual drawers that are unlatched and pulled out to access the disk pack. Because of their appearance they acquired the nickname of [...] "Pizza Ovens". Only eight drives of the nine are available to the computer at any one time. The ninth drive is there for a spare for the user and can also be worked on [...] "offline" [...] by a Field Engineer while the other drives are in use by the customer. Each drive's system address is determined in part by a user-swappable plug, one such plug denoting a <b>spare</b> <b>drive</b> not system accessible. This permits physically changing the address of a drive by changing the plug.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{operation}} is possible {{with a single}} failed <b>drive,</b> three <b>spare</b> <b>drives</b> were available to replace failed units until they are repaired. The ECC codes permit 100% recovery of the data on any one failed disk, allowing a new copy of this data to be reconstructed and written onto the replacement disk. Once this recovery is complete, the data base {{is considered to be}} healed.|$|R

25|$|Also {{inside the}} payload bay was an Integrated Cargo Carrier-Vertical Light Deployable (ICC-VLD), {{containing}} {{a variety of}} equipment and spare components for the station.

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{utilities}} that can read the Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) information to tell how many sectors have been reallocated, and how many <b>spare</b> sectors the <b>drive</b> may still have. Because reads and writes from G-list sectors are automatically redirected (remapped) to spare sectors it slows down drive access even if data in drive is defragmented. If the G-list is filling up, it is time to replace the drive.|$|R

50|$|In 1966, {{the first}} 2314s shipped. This device had {{up to eight}} usable disk drives with an {{integral}} control unit; there were nine drives, but one was reserved as a <b>spare.</b> Each <b>drive</b> used a removable 2316 disk pack with a capacity of nearly 28 MB. The disk packs for the 2311 and 2314 were physically large by today's standards — e.g., the 1316 disk pack was about 14 in in diameter and had six platters stacked on a central spindle. The top and bottom outside platters did not store data. Data were recorded on the inner sides of {{the top and bottom}} platters and both sides of the inner platters, providing 10 recording surfaces. The 10 read/write heads moved together across the surfaces of the platters, which were formatted with 203 concentric tracks. To reduce the amount of head movement (seeking), data was written in a virtual cylinder from inside top platter down to inside bottom platter. These disks were not usually formatted with fixed-sized sectors as are today's hard drives (though this was done with CP/CMS). Rather, most System/360 I/O software could customize the length of the data record (variable-length records), {{as was the case with}} magnetic tapes.|$|R
5000|$|Tony Flansaas - The comic's {{resident}} evil overlord. Has {{made many}} attempts {{over the course}} of the comic's existence to take over the world, and has even succeeded a couple of times. Think of any technological achievement made in the past two years, and even a number that won't come around for decades yet—Tony did it 5 years ago, and made it out of bubblegum, <b>spare</b> hard <b>drive</b> parts, and a DivX player too. He's almost like a cross between MacGyver and Dr. Evil. Tony is often the fulcrum on which most of Real Life's more far-fetched story lines revolve. His character is presented in such a way so that the readers start to believe that the real life Tony might just have a BattleMech, dimension-hopping TV remote or a cloning machine lying around the house. His most recent achievement was a space station called [...] "DS-1", which stands for Death Station 1 however, this station was destroyed in late 2008. Since returning to Earth Tony has built an underground lair beneath Greg's home where he once again devotes full-time to inventions, having produced a working replica TARDIS and hopes to complete a fully functional USS Enterprise in the not-too-distant future.|$|R
50|$|Made in 1997, Cousin was Elliot’s first {{professional}} film {{funded by the}} Australian Film Commission, SBS Independent and Film Victoria. As with Uncle, Elliot chose a minimalist approach and a <b>spare</b> narration to <b>drive</b> a very simple remembrance of a childhood relationship he had with his cousin (based on his real life cousin) who has Cerebral Palsy. Like Uncle, Cousin has a greyscale palette but was shot on colour stock. This film was shot in a small storage unit in the outer suburb of Moorabin in Melbourne at a facility owned by his father. This time Elliot employed AVID digital equipment to edit the footage shot on 16mm film. Cousin has been shown at many film festivals and won Elliot his second AFI Award for Best Australian animation. Narrated again by William McInnes, the budget for Cousin was $42,000 AUD.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{mathematical}} model and an adaptive large neighborhood search to solve a two{tiered transportation problem arising {{in the distribution of}} goods in congested city cores. In the rst tier, goods are transported in city buses from a consolidation and distribution center to a set of bus stops. The main idea is to use the buses <b>spare</b> capacity to <b>drive</b> the goods in the city core. In the second tier, nal customers are distributed by a eet of near{zero emissions city freighters. This system requires transferring the goods from buses to city freighters at the bus stops. We model the corresponding optimization problem as a variant of the pickup and delivery problem with transfers and solve it with an adaptive large neighborhood search. To evaluate its results, lower bounds are calculated with a column generation approach. The algorithm is assessed on data sets derived from a eld study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{industrial}} plant <b>spare</b> parts is <b>driven,</b> {{at least in}} part, by maintenance requirements. It is therefore important to jointly optimise planned maintenance and the associated spare parts inventory using the most appropriate maintenance and replenishment policies. In this simulation-based study, we address this challenge {{in the context of}} the random failure of parts in service and the replacement of defective parts at inspections of period T. Inspections are modelled using the delay-time concept. A number of simultaneous periodic review and continuous review replenishment policies are compared. A paper making plant provides a real context for the presentation of our ideas. We survey practitioners working with such plant to collect real data that inform the values of parameters in the models. Our simulation results indicate that a periodic review policy with ordering that is twice as frequent as inspection is cost optimal {{in the context of the}} plant that we study. For the purpose of comparison, we also present and discuss the characteristics of the various policies considered...|$|R
40|$|New engines {{experience}} durability problems {{after entering}} service. The most prevalent and costly is the hot section, particularly the high-pressure turbine. The origin of durability {{problems can be}} traced back to: 1) the basic aero-mechanical design systems, assumptions, and design margins used by the engine designers, 2) the available materials systems, and 3) to a large extent, aggressive marketing in a highly competitive environment that pushes engine components beyond the demonstrated capability of the basic technology available for the hardware designs. Unfortunately the user must operate the engine in the service environment in order to learn the actual thrust loading and the time at max effort take-off conditions used in service are needed to determine the hot section life. Several hundred thousand hours of operational service will be required before the demonstrated reliability of a fleet of engines or the design deficiencies of the engine hot section parts can be determined. Also, it may take three to four engine shop visits for heavy maintenance on the gas path hardware to establish cost effective build standards. <b>Spare</b> parts <b>drive</b> the oerator's engine maintenance costs but spare parts also makes lots of money for the engine manufacturer during the service life of an engine. Unless competition prevails for follow-on engine buys, there is really no motivation for an OEM to spend internal money to improve parts durability and reduce earnings derived from a lucrative spare parts business. If the hot section life is below design goals or promised values, the OEM migh argue that the engine is being operated beyond its basic design intent. On the other hand, the airframer and the operator will continue to remind the OEM that his engine was selected based on a lot of promises to deliver spec thrust with little impact on engine service life if higher thrust is used intermittently. In the end, a standoff prevails and nothing gets fixed. This briefing will propose ways to hold competing engine manufacturers more accountable for engine hot section design margins during the entire Engine Development process as well as provide tools to assess the design temperature margins in the hot section parts of Service Engines...|$|R

50|$|Private {{operators}} and NSOP (non-scheduled operators permit) holders {{are required by}} DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) {{to set up a}} CAR 145 approved maintenance shop or work with a DGCA approved third-party MRO. Most private {{operators and}} NSOP holders prefer the outsourced model for line maintenance (on-tarmac checks) and use OEM/DGCA approved facilities for engine, heavy maintenance and modifications on their aircraft.The Indian business aviation market is complex from a maintenance perspective as it has over 60 different aircraft types operating in a total market of about 350 aircraft (business jets, turboprops and helicopters). Each individual type requires trained technical manpower, tooling, and approvals from regulator as well as the OEM to enable an MRO to offer world-class maintenance services. Creation of this infrastructure requires a level of investment (both initial and recurring) which most MROs do not find economically viable to support. Therefore, the industry is highly fragmented, with one of the largest player in the market Air Works (with approvals on over 50 different types from DGCA at 15 locations in India and OEM certification from Agusta Westland, Bell, Bombardier, Dassault, Embraer, Garmin, Gulfstream, Hawker Beechcraft, Honeywell and Rockwell Collins) commanding a 30% market share and Indamer Aviation Pvt. Ltd, (with approvals on over 28 different aircraft from DGCA at 14 locations across India)commanding 27% of the market share.A significant percentage of the business aviation fleet in India gets heavy maintenance and modifications done at OEM approved facilities in Europe, UK and the US. This trend though is gradually shifting as established players in India are upgrading their heavy maintenance capability and providing customers with an option to reduce turnaround times as well as costs of aircraft maintenance. A key inflection point for this segment of the industry will be as MRO’s in India upgrade their facilities to global certification such as EASA in addition to OEM certification as that will enable customers to access globally certified quality of maintenance services locally at their operating base.The other key challenge which is faced by the industry is non availability of spare parts in the region which leads to frequent grounding of aircraft for lack of <b>spares.</b> This is <b>driven</b> by a lack of OEM support for the Indian market (which is gradually changing with growth in the market) and the custom duty regime which discourages MROs from stocking parts on behalf of customers. If an NSOP holder imports parts for his aircraft, it is exempt from duty, whereas, if an MRO were to provide him this facility, the customer will be liable to pay customs duty as well as service tax. On the suggestions and white paper published by Ravi Menon, founding family member of Air Works, custom tariff has been amended to exempt custom duty on the Aircraft spare parts imported by Indian MROs for use on aircraft maintained by them.|$|R
