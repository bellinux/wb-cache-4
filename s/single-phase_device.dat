40|$|Conservation by Voltage Reduction (CVR) is the {{implementation}} of a distribution voltage strategy whereby all distribution voltages are lowered to the minimum allowed by the equipment manufacturer. This strategy is rooted in the fact that many loads consume less power when they are fed with a voltage lower than nominal. Electric utility companies consider CVR as a potential solution for managing power in distribution networks. However, a difficult challenge is to keep end-of-line (EOL) voltages within an acceptable range of the ANSI Standard C 84. 1. Therefore, to achieve maximum benefit from CVR, electric utilities should be able to regulate residential voltages depending on load requirements. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a local solution which can regulate residential voltage levels from the first customer on the distribution feeder until the EOL of the distribution network. Such a solution will not only provide flexibility to electric utilities for better control over residential voltages but it can also maximize the benefits from CVR. The goal of this research is to develop a Residential Static Var Compensator (RSVC) that will allow electric utility companies to develop strategies for CVR and other applications. The proposed RSVC is in fact a reactive power compensator that can regulate a residential load voltage with a fixed capacitor in shunt with a reactor controlled by two bidirectional switches. The two switches are turned on and off in a complementary manner using a pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique that allows the reactor to function as a continuously-variable inductor. The proposed RSVC has several advantages compared to a conventional thyristor-based static var compensator (SVC), such as a quasi-sinusoidal inductor current, sub-cycle reactive power controllability, lower footprint for reactive components, and its realization as a <b>single-phase</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E
50|$|Model {{circuits}} were energized {{at relatively}} low voltages {{to allow for}} safe measurement with adequate precision. The model base quantities varied by manufacturer and date of design; as amplified indicating instruments became more common, lower base quantities were feasible. Model voltages and currents started off around 200 volts and 0.5 amperes in the MIT analyzer, which still allowed directly driven (but especially sensitive) instruments {{to be used to}} measure model parameters. The later machines used as little as 50 volts and 50 mA, used with amplified indicating instruments. By use of the per-unit system, model quantities could be readily transformed into the actual system quantities of voltage, current, power or impedance. A watt measured in the model might correspond to hundreds of kilowatts or megawatts in the modeled system. One hundred volts measured on the model might correspond to one per-unit, which could represent, say, 230,000 volts on a transmission line or 11,000 volts in a distribution system. Typically, results accurate to around 2% of measurement could be obtained. Model components were <b>single-phase</b> <b>devices,</b> but using the symmetrical components method, unbalanced three-phase systems could be studied as well.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an anisotropic and mechanical strain-dependent model of magnetostriction in electrical steel sheets and its application in finite-element computations. The presented model is bidirectional {{and the data}} needed for its derivation is extracted solely from unidirectional measurements under mechanical loading. The model has six parameters that describe the magnetic and strain behavior and two parameters that describe the anisotropy. The validation of the model is carried out through measurements and computations on a <b>single-phase</b> transformer-like <b>device.</b> The comparison between computation and measurement results seems to be reasonable regardless {{of the fact that}} the magnetic behavior is modeled as single valued, isotropic, and anhysteretic. Original magnetostriction measurements are also presented and the importance of magnetostriction anisotropy in a priori isotropic electrical steel sheets is demonstrated. The model is easy to implement in existing codes and the anisotropic behavior is straightforward to modify according to a specific material...|$|R
40|$|The Biphase turbine is {{a device}} for {{effectively}} producing shaft power from two-phase (liquid and gas) pressure let-downs and for separating the resulting phases.

The {{performance of the}} Biphase turbine and its advantages over <b>single-phase,</b> energy-conversion <b>devices</b> has been demonstrated with subscale and commercial scale steam/water (geothermal wellhead) operations. Its development and application to two-phase process streams is now being pursued and {{is the subject of}} this paper. The two-phase working fluid may be a single component, two-phase stream, as in a steam/ water combination, or it may be a multicomponent, two-phase process stream which may also include foam and/or entrained solids.

40|$|An {{improved}} clocking {{scheme and}} sharper circuit design and logic selection, which have yielded a five-to-tenfold {{increased in the}} speed of standard CMOS ICs, are discussed. The clocking strategy relies on a true <b>single-phase</b> clock, <b>device</b> sizes are varied to optimize their speed, and a precharged logic style reduces capacitive loads. The tradeoff is roughly a doubling of circuit area. The high-speed CMOS technique has been demonstrated experimentally, with good results. For example, ripple counters in 3 and 2 μm CMOS processes reached input frequencies of 400 and 750 MHz, respectively, or nearly 80 and 70 % of the intrinsic speeds of these processes. Pipelined accumulators in 2 and 1. 2 μm CMOS processes operated at up to 430 and 700 MHz clock frequencies, respectively. The data rate of an error correcting encoder designed for an optical fiber communication link was measured as 1. 2 Gb/s, while the corresponding decoder was simulated at the same speed.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dc voltage {{incipient}} sensor fault isolation method for <b>single-phase</b> three-level rectifier <b>devices</b> in high-speed railway electrical traction systems. Different incipient fault modes characterizing locations and incipient fault types are parameterized nonlinearly by unknown fault parameters.

40|$|Electrostatic {{precipitators}} (ESP) or electrofilters remove flying {{ashes and}} fine particles from the flue gas in thermal power plants, before passing the gas into the chimney. Maximum allowable value of dust is 50 mg/m 3 {{and it requires}} that {{the efficiency of the}} ESPs better than 99 %, which calls for an increase of active surface of the electrodes, hence increasing the filter volume and the weight of steel used for the filter. In previous decades, electrostatic precipitators in thermal power plants were fed by thyristor controlled, <b>single-phase</b> fed <b>devices</b> having a high degree of reliability, but with a relatively low collection efficiency, hence requiring large effective surface of the collection plates and a large weight of steel construction in order to achieve the prescribed emission limits. Collection efficiency and energy efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator can be increased by applying high frequency high voltage power supply (HF HV). Electrical engineering faculty of the University of Belgrade (ETF) has developed technology and HF HV equipment for the ESP power supply. This solution was subjected to extensive experimental investigation at TE Morava from 2008. to 2010. High frequency power supply is proven to reduce emission two times in controlled conditions while increasing energy efficiency of the precipitator, compared to the conventional thyristor controlled 50 Hz supply. Two high frequency high voltage unit AR 70 / 1000 with parameters 70 kV and 1000 mA are installed at TE Morava and thoroughly testes. It was found that the HF HV power supply of the ESP at TE Morava increases collection efficiency so that emission of fine particles and flying ashes are halved, brought down to only 50 % of the emissions encountered with conventional 50 Hz thyristor driven power supplies. On the basis of this study, conclusion is drawn that the equipmentcomprising HF HV supplies are the best solution for new ESP installations, {{as well as for the}} reconstruction of existing facilities. The paper describes the topology of the HF HV power supply, power management and controls, and brings the most importantdetails of the implementation. It is found that the HF HV solution achieves several significant improvements over the conventional thyristor system. It is possible to provide more precise control ofthe ESP parameters such as the output voltages and currents. It isalso possible to make a rapid increase or decrease in voltage andto effectuate a very fast response to load changes. Due to this advantages it is possible to suppress the supply quickly in the caseof sparking, reducing the spark energy and the quantity of ionized gasses produced by the electric arc. Reduction in the spark energy is up to 10 times compared to conventional thyristors solution. This means that the erosion of the electrode system is significantly reduced, and that the quality of the collection plates is preserved for much longer periods. At the same time, lower quantity of ionized gasses produced by the spark contribute to much shorter de-ionization intervals, required to quit sparking and evacuate charged particles in order to reinstate the voltage and proceed with the operation. In addition, HF HV power supply provides a significant reduction in size and weight of the complete ESP installation, hence reducing the tons of steel that has to be built in. Therefore, the HF HV power supply may be the key instrument to reducing the cost of the de-dusting ecological equipment. Besides, size and weight reduction leads to cost savings of installation and maintenance. According to estimates, savings in steel may reach 30 %, contributing to the overall cost savings of roughly 20 %. Within this paper, inaddition to describing the AR 70 / 1000 unit topology and principlesof operation, the paper presents the results and measurements obtained during extensive experimental investigations whereinperformances of 50 Hz based thyristor units with T/R sets arecompared to HF HV power supply...|$|R
40|$|Originally, {{the power}} systems were {{designed}} to deliver the produced power from the large-scale centralized power stations to the end-users of the distribution grids. Since the centralized power plants usually use fossil fuels as primary energy sources, the growing energy demand has necessitated the use of low-carbon energy resources. Hence, most European utilities have already implemented programs to support the exploitation of renewable energy sources (RES). Due to the growing power demand and the increasing RES usage, the power systems, specifically the distribution networks, are rapidly changing. The traditional policy of installing distributed energy resources (DERs) {{is based on the}} passive “fit-and-forget” philosophy. Under this regime, the high penetration of DERs in distribution networks is expected to cause several issues related to power quality, reliability, security and stability. The high investment cost required to upgrade the current network assets has led to the transition from the passive network operation to the active distribution network management by the distribution network operators (DNOs). In terms of DNO responsibilities, voltage management is of primary concern, since voltage quality directly affects the quality of power provided to the grid customers. The concept of active network management (ANM) has mainly been implemented in the medium voltage (MV) distribution networks, while, at the LV level, voltage management was achieved by passive control devices, such as off-load tap changers and capacitor banks. This thesis evaluates the performance of the existing active voltage management technologies, when being applied in LV distribution networks. In particular, the technologies being assessed in this study are: (i) MV/LV transformers fitted with an OLTC device, (ii) distributed static synchronous compensators (D-STATCOMs), (iii) active in-line voltage regulators (IVRs) fitted with an OLTC device, (iv) DERs, and (v) battery energy storage systems (BESSs). In general, the LV networks consist of single-phase elements, either loads or generators, therefore, the growing trends of demand and generation can lead to several considerable problems, such as over-voltages, under-voltages, high voltage unbalances and grid losses rise. The main goal of this dissertation is to examine to which degree the evaluated voltage control technologies can mitigate the aforementioned issues. First, different centralized voltage control strategies are proposed, when applying each technology individually. Besides that, the focus is to evaluate to which extent the applied techniques can perform remote voltage management under high levels of DER integration and load demand. Particularly, the integration of OLTCs into MV/LV transformers is assessed considering the voltage constraints, as well as the thermal limits of the transformer and the cables. In case of radial feeders with both large number of branches and long distribution lines, the voltage control via MV/LV transformers might be infeasible. In such cases, the IVR contribution might be crucial for the voltage regulation. In this study, its performance is evaluated with respect to various power quality issues, while its optimal placement and sizing are investigated with respect to the operating voltage margin and the total grid losses. Next, different power management technologies (D-STATCOM, DERs and BESSs) are used to regulate the voltage remotely. As for the D-STATCOM, two control schemes are evaluated, the former for the regulation of the positive-sequence voltage component, and the latter for the regulation of the voltage unbalances. Moreover, the coordination of D-STATCOM’s with the OLTC is also examined. Concerning the DERs, three localized voltage control schemes for single-phase units are presented, based on reactive and active power management. Crucial parameters for the implementation of those methods are the sensitivity factors of voltage magnitude with regard to the power injections. Since the reactive power is insufficient to mitigate fully the over-voltage and under-voltage issues, two active power curtailment methods are also evaluated, following the concepts of “hierarchical” and “fair” contribution, respectively. Finally, the dissertation assesses the performance of hybrid voltage management schemes. Different coordinated schemes are examined, utilizing the centralized control through the MV/LV transformer with an OLTC mechanism and the localized power management methods through single-phase DERs. The main focus on using the coordinated schemes is to eliminate the curtailed active power, the OLTC wear and the reactive power provision. Furthermore, a novel optimization scheme to control both the voltage magnitudes and voltage unbalances is investigated, by using the MV/LV transformer with an OLTC <b>device,</b> <b>single-phase</b> DERs and single-phase BESSs. The main objective of this approach is to develop the optimal interaction between the aforementioned devices, while minimizing a set of objectives related to grid losses, OLTC wear, battery ageing and reactive power provision. status: publishe...|$|R
