An approach of transforming the open-angle section to a closed section is used with CFRP {{as a means to}} increase the flexural stiffness and strength. A total of 30 <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> sections, both CFRP-reinforced and bare <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> specimens, were tested in 4 -point bending. The slenderness ratio (b/t), different CFRP layers, and orientation of CFRP are the parameters included in this work. The failure behavior of CFRP-strengthened angle sections is closely studied for various wrapping configurations. The results indicate a significant increase in stiffness and strength of <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> sections when appropriate reinforcement pattern and adequate number of CFRP layers are used...|$|R

50|$|Imprinting {{reverses the}} {{desertification}} process by pressing V-shape imprints {{into the soil}} with <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> on a heavy roller (Figures 3 and 4). Rainwater then funnels into the troughs of the imprints, where the water infiltrates into the indentation and air exhausts from the crests (Figure 5). Seedlings are protected from wind, and organic material is concentrated {{at the base of}} the troughs to provide nutrients to the seedling. Wind protection attenuates evaporation {{at the base of the}} seedling, maximizing water availability to the plant during the rainy season. The seedbed may remain dry for some time before water infiltrates and germination occurs. In the meantime, the stable imprint protects the seed from wind erosion and desiccation from exposure to the sun.Broadcast seeders can be attached to the frame assembly or grain boxes mounted in front of the imprinting roller, so that seed is dropped in front of the roller which presses the seed into the soil. The weight of the imprinter can be adjusted to be appropriate for various soils and planting conditions by filling the roller and ballast tanks with water.|$|E

The analysis methods consisted of a load-movement matching technique to obtain the unit shaft resistance profile down the pier in conjunction with a stability plot to determine pier integrity, and an iterative method to determine the mobilized unit shaft resistance down the pier from measured strains. Iteration was required because the uplift load caused cracking in the concrete of the pier, resulting in a loss of structural compatibility between the concrete and the <b>steel</b> <b>angle.</b> The two {{methods of analysis}} resulted in unit shaft resistance profiles that were in good agreement, giving confidence in the result...|$|R

Besides, this paper’s optimization design provided a better controlled cooling method that could improve <b>angle</b> <b>steel’s</b> mechanical properties including yield strength, tensile strength, and other performance effectively, which promoted a theoretical foundation for studying other model steel’s controlled cooling. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effectiveness of}} the strengthening technique for deficient reinforced concrete columns using <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> and battens. The compressive strength of concrete was chosen as 9 MPa to represent poor concrete quality.

In this study, the effectiveness of different configurations of battens was investigated; different amounts of battens as well as different spacing while maintaining amount of steel. The results showed that both load carrying capacity and ductility of the strengthened columns could be significantly improved. While maintaining the same amount of battens, different spacing does not show significant difference in load carrying capacity but affects ductility. The experimental results showed that using <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> and battens is effective for strengthening reinforced concrete even when the compressive strength of the concrete is very low...|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} facing steel {{structures}} is corrosion {{which could lead}} to the failure during operating conditions. With regard to this issue, there is growing focus to repair or rehabilitate corroded steel structures. This study investigates the possibility of strengthening corroded <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> using Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). The focus here is on tension angle members in truss type of steel structures. The loss of sectional area due to corrosion effect was represented by creating notches of different sizes (3 mm – 12 mm) in the angles. The effects of corrosion on tensile strength of artificially corroded <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> were considered. The tensile characteristics of the CFRP strengthened-corroded <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> were experimentally studied.

The configurations tested in the laboratory include single equal angle, single unequal angle bolted at the wider leg, single unequal angle bolted at the narrow leg, double angles, and alternate <b>angles.</b> The <b>steel</b> materials used in the experiment are among those with the lowest ductility for which nominal tensile strength is permitted by cold-formed steel design codes to be fully utilized in structural design calculations. Based on a modification to the equation derived for channel braces bolted at the web, a design equation is proposed for determining the net section tension capacity of a cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> brace bolted at one leg. The proposed equation is demonstrated, through laboratory tests on 61 specimens composed of G 450 sheet steel, to be more accurate than the code equations and those existing in the literature.
