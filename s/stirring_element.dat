40|$|It is {{well known}} that fluid mixing can often be {{improved}} by the introduction of ‘baffles’ into the flow – the problem of baffle placement is examined here for chaotic fluid mixing of a highly viscous fluid. A simple model for a planetary mixer, with one <b>stirring</b> <b>element,</b> is modified by the introduction of one or more stationary baffles. Regular regions of poor mixing in the unbaffled flow are shown to be significantly reduced in size if the location of the baffles is chosen so that the flow necessarily generates ‘topological chaos’. By contrast, the positioning of baffles in superficially similar ways that do not generate such ‘topological chaos’ fails to provide a similar improvement. Michael J. Clifford, Stephen M. Co...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{different}} parameters, which influence {{the release of}} diclofenac sodium (2 -[(2, 6 -dichlorophenyl) amino]benzeneacetic acid mono sodium salt) from lipophilic matrix prolonged release tablets, were investigated. Solubility characteristics of diclofenac sodium in aqueous media with various ionic strengths, ionic compositions and pH {{in the range of}} 1 to 10 were determined. According to the obtained results different experimental conditions of the dissolution test on the drug release profiles were studied, i. e. different dissolution apparatus, various rotation speeds of the <b>stirring</b> <b>elements,</b> different buffer media with a pH in the range of 5. 8 to 10. 0 and various ionic strengths. The amount of released diclofenac sodium was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at the wavelength of maximum absorbance at 276 ± 2 nm. From the obtained results it can be concluded, that solubility of diclofenac sodium depends mainly on composition and pH of the dissolution medium and also on ionic strengths of the dissolution medium. Besides these parameters, on the release of diclofenac sodium from lipophilic matrix tablets influence also type of dissolution apparatus and particularly rotation speeds of the <b>stirring</b> <b>elements.</b> Key words: drug release, lipophilic matrix tablets, ionic strengths, diclofenac sodiu...|$|R

This finding is confirmed via numerical simulations. Anomalously slow mixing is observed when the synchronization of different <b>stirring</b> <b>elements</b> leads to the repetition of slow stretching for the same fluid particles...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{two models}} for {{stirring}} devices that operate at low Reynolds number. In each, elliptical paddles {{are used to}} stir a vat of fluid. In the first model, a single paddle stirs an infi-nite expanse of inviscid fluid; in the second, three paddles stir a highly viscous fluid. Such models are clearly a caricature of any real mixing device, but they do allow accurate simulation in a genuinely time-dependent geometry, appropriate for impeller-driven mixers. The first model is simple enough to yield an ex-act expression for the velocity field and so allow numerical par-ticle tracking {{to be carried out}} to high precision. The choice of a suitable mode of operation of the device is essentially a matter of optimising the system parameters. In our second model, we show how, by the use of more than one <b>stirring</b> <b>element,</b> a high quality of stirring can be built in, giving a design that performs well, regardless of the exact system parameters, such as paddle design or fluid rheology...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{treatment}} {{is the most}} often method used in water treatment in the Czech republic. It is based on dosage of destabilisation reagent into raw water, formation of separable aggregates and their separation by sand filtration. Waterworks optimalisation is predominantly carried out by change of the chemical parameters, typically by change of destabilisation reagent dose. Physical parameters in water treatment like {{the magnitude of the}} velocity gradient and period of its duration are undervalued commonly, although they have crucial effect on quality of the aggregates. Character of the aggregates (size, density, compactness) influence their separability. This study aims at evaluation of influence of the magnitude of the velocity gradient on quality of suspension formed. Infuence of stirring intensity was performed on the pilot plant situated in the Želivka waterworks, which is fed from Švihov reservoir. The pilot plant worked at two modes: 1) slow stirring by perforated baffles and 2) fast stirring by fluidised layer of granular material. Fast stirring was either aggregational (served only as <b>stirring</b> <b>element),</b> or separational (separation of aggregates proceed already in the fluidised layer) Infuence of the magnitude of velocity gradient was evaluated by aggregation test.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{phenomena in}} scraped heat exchanger crystallizers {{are critical for}} the process performance. Fluid flow and turbulence close to the heat exchanger (HE) surface as generated by <b>stirring</b> <b>elements</b> and scraper blades are crucial in this respect as they aim at avoiding an insulating scale layer on the HE surface. For this reason we performed largeeddy simulations of the turbulent flow (at a Reynolds number of 5 ⋅ 10 4) in a typical cooling crystallizer geometry {{with a focus on}} the bottom region where the heat exchanging surface was located. The simulations were validated with stereoscopic PIV experiments performed higher up in the crystallizer. For reasons of optical accessibility being hindered by the scrapers, the experiments could not be done near the heat exchanging surface. The flow structures as revealed by the large-eddy simulations could explain the local occurrence of scaling on an evenly cooled heat exchanger surface, and its irreproducibility caused by instantaneous cold spots...|$|R
40|$|Topological chaos {{may be used}} to {{generate}} highly effective laminar mixing in a simple batch stirring device. Boyland, Aref & Stremler (2000) have computed a material stretch rate that holds in a chaotic flow, provided it has appropriate topological properties, irrespective of the details of the flow. Their theoretical approach, while widely applicable, cannot predict the size of the region in which this stretch rate is achieved. Here, we present numerical simulations to support the observation of Boyland et al. that the region of high stretch is comparable with that through which the <b>stirring</b> <b>elements</b> move during operation of the device. We describe a fast technique for computing the velocity field for either inviscid, irrotational or highly viscous flow, which enables accurate numerical simulation of dye advection. We calculate material stretch rates, and find close agreement with those of Boyland et al., irrespective of whether the fluid is modelled as inviscid or viscous, even though there are significant differences between the flow fields generated in the two cases...|$|R

40|$|NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) {{developed}} Ultrasonic Stir Welding (USW) to join {{large pieces}} of very high-strength metals such as titanium and Inconel. USW, a solid-state weld process, improves current thermal stir welding processes by adding high-power ultrasonic (HPU) energy at 20 kHz frequency. The addition of ultrasonic energy significantly reduces axial, frictional, and shear forces; increases travel rates; and reduces wear on the stir rod, which results in extended stir rod life. The USW process decouples the heating, <b>stirring,</b> and forging <b>elements</b> found in the friction stir welding process allowing for independent control of each process element and, ultimately, greater process control and repeatability.

40|$|Eutrophication, and the {{resulting}} proliferation of phytoplankton can affect water quality. Although environmental and ecological processes that lead to phytoplankton proliferations in temperate areas have received considerable attention, scientific background regarding this topic in tropical areas, especially West Africa, are scarce. In this study, bioassays in batch cultures were carried out {{in order to identify}} factors that may be stimulating or limiting the biomass of phytoplankton at various sites in the lower Senegal River delta region. Complete factorial designs were used to test several factors both alone and combined (nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfate, EDTA and trace <b>elements,</b> <b>stirring).</b> The effects of these factors on the growth of the whole phytoplankton communities were followed by the daily measurement of in uivo fluorescence. At all but two of the sites, enrichment with certain nutrients significantly stimulated phytoplankton biomass growth, with nitrogen and/or phosphorus appearing to be the primary limiting factor(s). Nitrogen was the primary limiting factor in coastal ocean waters and in the Senegal River estuary. in the freshwater ecosystems studied, nitrogen and phosphorus acted as alternating or concomitant limiting factors. We assessed the changes in the phytoplankton composition induced by nutrient enrichments in Lake Guiers, a drinking water reservoir for the population of Dakar. Our findings lead us to define the conditions of a possible proliferation of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii mainly in response to phosphorus inputs...|$|R
40|$|Solid state welding {{processes}} {{have become the}} focus of welding process development at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Unlike fusion weld processes such as tungsten inert gas (TIG), variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA), electron beam (EB), etc., solid state {{welding processes}} do not melt the material during welding. The resultant microstructure can be characterized as a dynamically recrystallized morphology much different than the casted, dentritic structure typical of fusion weld processes. The primary benefits of solid state processes over fusion weld processes include superior mechanic properties and the elimination of thermal distortion and residual stresses. These solid state processes attributes have profoundly influenced the direction of advanced welding research and development within the NASA agency. Thermal Stir Welding (TSW) is a new solid state welding process being developed at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Unlike friction stir welding, the heating, <b>stirring</b> and forging <b>elements</b> of the weld process can be decoupled for independent control. An induction coil induces energy into a workpiece to attain a desired plastic temperature. An independently controlled stir rod, captured within non-rotating containment plates, then stirs the plasticized material followed by forging plates/rollers that work the stirred weld joint. The independent control (decoupling) of heating, stirring and forging allows, theoretically, for the precision control of microstructure morphology. The TSW process is being used to evaluate the solid state joining of Haynes 230 for ARES J- 2 X applications. It is also being developed for 500 -in (12. 5 mm) thick commercially pure grade 2 titanium for navy applications. Other interests include Inconel 718 and stainless steel.

40|$|The contour {{dynamics}} {{method is}} extended to vortex rings with vorticity varying linearly from the symmetry axis. An elliptic core model is also developed to {{explain some of}} the basic physics. Passage and collisions of two identical rings are studied focusing on core deformation, sound generation and <b>stirring</b> of fluid <b>elements.</b> With respect to core deformation, not only the strain rate but how rapidly it varies is important and accounts for greater susceptibility to vortex tearing than in two dimensions. For slow strain, as a passage interaction is completed and the strain relaxes, the cores return to their original shape while permanent deformations remain for rapidly varying strain. For collisions, if the strain changes slowly the core shapes migrate through a known family of two-dimensional steady vortex pairs up to the limiting member of the family. Thereafter energy conservation does not allow the cores to maintain a constant shape. For rapidly varying strain, core deformation is severe and a head-tail structure in good agreement with experiments is formed. With respect to sound generation, good agreement with the measured acoustic signal for colliding rings is obtained and a feature previously thought to be due to viscous effects is shown to be an effect of inviscid core deformation alone. For passage interactions, a component of high frequency is present. Evidence for the importance of this noise source in jet noise spectra is provided. Finally, processes of fluid engulfment and rejection for an unsteady vortex ring are studied using the stable and unstable manifolds. The unstable manifold shows excellent agreement with flow visualization experiments for leapfrogging rings suggesting that it may be a good tool for numerical flow visualization in other time periodic flows...|$|R
