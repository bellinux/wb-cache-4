40|$|Abstract—A {{multi-sensor}} {{system for}} 3 D localization {{was developed and}} named BodyGuard. It combines body move-ment <b>sensing</b> and a <b>guard</b> system for the tracking and re-cording {{of the status of}} persons. BodyGuard was designed to monitor and transmit the movement of a person radio-based and to transform that data into a spatial coordinate. This paper describes how the BodyGuard system works, what components the system consists of, how the individual sen-sor data is converted into 3 D motion data, with which algo-rithms the individual sensors are processed, how individual errors are compensated and how the sensor data are fused into a 3 D Model.

40|$|Excerpt] Beginning in November 1997, the Republic of Korea {{underwent}} a devastating economic crisis. Declining macroeconomic conditions brought about major labor market disruptions in 1998 : a quadrupling of unemployment, a fall of 9 % in real wages, informalization {{of the remaining}} jobs, increased job insecurity, and rising poverty and inequality. Disadvantaged groups suffered a disproportionate impact. The result was not only economic misery but also social pain: increased homelessness, rising crime, heightened school dropouts, an accelerating divorce rate, and an overwhelming sense of social malaise. 1999 marked a major turnaround for Korea. GDP grew by 10. 7 %, and real wages are growing apace. The unemployment rate is now {{less than half of}} its peak level. Women are again returning to the labor force and are finding employment. A <b>sense</b> of <b>guarded</b> optimism is returning to the Korean society. Nonetheless, important labor market problems remain (and social problems as well). The unemployment rate now is twice as high as it was before the crisis. But high unemployment is the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Income inequality is 15 % higher and poverty is twice as high as before.

This day, as on other days before and after. Great Magazines forming here; the Military chiefly at Ohlau; at Breslau the Provender part,--and this latter under noteworthy circumstances. In the Dom-Island, namely; which is definable (in a case of such necessity) as being 'outside the walls.' Especially as the Reverend Fathers have mostly glided into corners, and left the place vacant. In the Dom-Island, it certainly is; and such a stock,--all bought for money down, and spurred forward while the roads were under frost,--'such a stock as was not thought to be in all Silesia,' says exaggerative wonder. The vacant edifices in the Dom-Island are filled to the neck with meal and corn; the Prussian brigade now quartering there ('without the walls,' in a <b>sense)</b> to <b>guard</b> the same. And in the Bishop's Garden [poor Sinzendorf, far enough away and in no want of it just now] are mere hay-mows, bigger than houses: who can object,--in a case of necessity? No man, unless he politically meddle, is meddled with; politically meddling, you are at once picked up; as one or two are,--clapped into gentle arrest, or, like old Schaffgotsch, and even Sinzendorf before long, requested to leave the Country till it get settled.

60|$|To the argument, {{that we have}} a {{right to}} suppose the {{relation}} of cause and effect to contain something more than invariable succession, because, when we ourselves act as causes, or in volition, we are conscious of exerting power; Hume replies, that we know nothing of the feeling we call power except as effort or resistance; and that we have not the slightest means of knowing whether it has anything to do with the production of bodily motion or mental changes. And he points out, as Descartes and Spinoza had done before him, that when voluntary motion takes place, that which we will is not the immediate consequence of the act of volition, but something which is separated from it by a long chain of causes and effects. If the will is the cause of the movement of a limb, it can be so only in the <b>sense</b> that the <b>guard</b> who gives the order to go on, is the cause of the transport of a train from one station to another.|$|R
60|$|Such of Cecil's guests as were mothers for {{the most}} part came with their children; but Lady Tyrrell, her sister, and others, who were unattached, arrived later, and were shown to the library, where she entertained them on the {{specified}} refreshment, biscuits and coffee, and enthroned Mrs Tallboys in the large arm-chair, where she looked most beautiful and gorgeous, in a robe of some astonishing sheeny sky-blue, edged with paly gold, while on her head was a coronal of sapphire and gold, with a marvellous little plume. The cost must have been enormous, and her delicate and spirituelle beauty was shown to the greatest advantage; but as the audience was far too scanty to be worth beginning upon, Cecil, with a sigh at the folly of maternal idolatry, went to hunt up her ladies from gazing at the babyish amusements of their offspring; and Miss Moy, in spite of her remonstrance, jumped up to follow her; while Mrs. Duncombe, the only good mother in this new <b>sense,</b> remained, keeping <b>guard</b> lest curiosity, and the echo of piano music, which now began to be heard, should attract away any more of the ladies.|$|R
40|$|CHDS State/LocalThis thesis {{examines}} the Coast Guard Ports, Waterways and Coastal Security (PWCS) Outcome Measure. The first {{goal was to}} determine if the current measure accurately reflects Coast Guard mission effectiveness in achieving homeland security. The PWCS Outcome Measure provides information on risk reduction due to threat, vulnerability and consequence management by the Coast Guard with respect to 15 maritime terrorism scenarios. While the current measure provides a good <b>sense</b> of Coast <b>Guard</b> effectiveness in reducing the risk of maritime terrorism, {{there are a number of}} areas for potential improvements. This finding led to the second goal of the research, which was to provide recommendations to more accurately assess Coast Guard homeland security mission effectiveness. As a formative evaluation of the PWCS Outcome Measure, the research provides insight into recommendations for improving this measure from several experts both inside and outside the Coast Guard. In addition, it outlines considerations to implement these recommendations. It is critical to optimize the application of limited resources to the issue of maritime terrorism, and this can only occur through accurate measurement of mission effectiveness in preventing terrorism. This study is applicable to the improved assessment of terrorism risk reduction efforts, especially in the maritime environment. Commanding Officer, USCG ISC Honolulu (USCG) author...|$|R
40|$|Custody in its {{broadest}} <b>sense</b> means safe-keeping, <b>guarding</b> and containment, {{the inference}} {{being that the}} individual offender is to be protected. However, in the UK, as elsewhere, custody now has wider political and public protection connotations. In England and Wales, the focus of youth custody is on public protection through punishment and offender management. In Scotland, the focus has traditionally been on offender protection, through addressing the young person's broader welfare needs, but recent trends and drivers in youth custody rates in Scotland now paint a different picture (Barry forthcoming; McAra and McVie 2010). This article describes the different approach taken in Scotland compared with England and Wales, at least up until recently, regarding the custody and care of {{children and young people}} who offend. The article identifies four key drivers to expanding youth custody rates in Scotland: (i) the earlier criminalisation of children and young people; (ii) increasingly stringent requirements imposed on children and young people who offend; (iii) the increased use of remand; and (iv) the use of shorter prison sentences with little scope for rehabilitation. The article concludes that these drivers are themselves driven by the politicisation of youth crime in Scotland and the abandonment of traditional Scottish values of minimal intervention and the paramountcy of the child's best interests...|$|R
40|$|Meerkat (Suricata suricatta) is a {{mongoose}} {{species from}} South Africa. Insects {{are the primary}} food sources of their diet. Meerkat lives in groups of 2 ? 30 individuals with a developed social structure. The group consists of a dominant pair and a different number of helpers of both sexes, which are involved in various forms of cooperation, for example care for cubs, guard service and maintaince of burrow. Meerkats {{are at risk of}} predation by mammalian predators, avian predators and snakes. One meerkat always seems to be a sentry and stands guard to keep the gang safe. When the <b>guard</b> <b>senses</b> danger they give a warning bark and the other members run for cover into their burrow. This study was done from June to September 2011 in zoo in Jihlava on a group of meerkats, which consisted of 13 individuals. There was used the method of direct observation by a scanning behaviour (behaviour sampling). Observation was specialized on sentinel behaviour. The main aim of this work was evaluate the results of observation and then compare this results with behaviour in the wild. By monitoring was demonstrably found, that dominant individuals contributed to guarding more frequently and the longest time and the juveniles contributed at least.

40|$|In {{order to}} work out how to become a BYOD school, at least one New Zealand {{secondary}} school has developed a BYOD implementation plan in order to trial a variety of tools and technologies to discover {{what works and what}} doesn’t to suit its educational context. In a fast-changing educational digital landscape, schools increasingly grapple with what it means to learn and teach in a digital context, and the eLearning group in this school decided to experiment {{with a small group of}} staff. The subject contexts consisted of foreign languages, sciences, music, mathematics, and Art. A key aspect of the trial was working with an external researcher to support the investigation. The project was in its third year in 2015. During the third year, volunteer teachers incorporated Chromebooks or iPads and had free rein on how these devices were used with students. Experiments included Google Classroom, Edmodo, online interactive physics simulations, music Apps on iPads, or combinations of Apps and web-based tools. This presentation focuses on this third year of the project and fits with the conference theme of Rings around Practice in that it centres on a school wanting to close the gaps between the goal of BYOD and and its implementation. Key findings broadly include: greater confidence in using unfamiliar tools, greater student concentration, greater collaboration among students, and faster learning particularly in the physics classroom and music. Students expressed greater confidence in learning content when learning occurred with these technologies, and teachers felt a <b>guarded</b> <b>sense</b> of satisfaction...|$|R

Goddard said that in {{previous}} work, the band were [...] "nervous about being open or emotionally honest" [...] and would sometimes [...] "have a jokiness or <b>guarded</b> <b>sense</b> to some of the words" [...] whereas the new album is more open lyrically. In response to a description of the album as the band's most serious yet, Taylor said, [...] "there was no decision to be more or less comic. I don't feel more or less humorous in my day-to-day" [...] but stated that he could hear melancholy, of which he said was in [...] "almost everything" [...] he writes. He explained {{that he did not know}} why this was the case and said, [...] "I can't ever write a song that just sounds completely saccharin. Even if I'm singing about someone being my complete love life, I'm singing about my own inabilities to be as bright as that person." [...] Like Taylor, Doyle said he felt that there was [...] "a certain vein of disquiet and melancholy that runs through the record". Another emotion that the band felt was present in One Life Stand was love. Goddard stated that the band did not set out to write an album about love but due to them feeling [...] "quite settled and happy", he admitted that it had come through in their song writing.

Taylor felt that due to their growth as songwriters and producers the band had progressed over time, resulting in improved [...] "clarity, melodic simplicity and strength" [...] in their song writing.|$|R
40|$|Encompassing the Intolerable {{examines}} John McGahern 2 ̆ 7 s {{depiction of}} individual consciousness struggling with postcolonial Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s three dominant and interconnected institutions: nation, family, and the Catholic Church. While McGahern 2 ̆ 7 s work, especially the early fiction, is often considered unremittingly bleak, this study argues that his exposure of abuse, repression, and disillusionment within these institutions does not finally entail a pessimistic vision. Instead, through close readings emphasizing character and epiphany, I contend that his texts use the motifs of laughter, memory, and inscription {{to demonstrate how}} consciousness can accommodate intolerable realities such as violence and loss rather than becoming defined or controlled by them. Moreover, these motifs trace a progression of subjectivity from survival (laughter) to private identity (memory) to public identity (inscription). Through this process, I argue that McGahern 2 ̆ 7 s fiction uncovers a <b>guarded</b> <b>sense</b> of continuity with the above institutions and the awareness that they provide the raw materials for (re) constructing a valid worldview. Chapter 2 argues that for McGahern 2 ̆ 7 s physically or psychically wounded characters, a self-reflexive and dianoetic laugh functions as a minimum confirmation of subjectivity and prepares consciousness to encompass the intolerable. Chapter 3 examines McGahern 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of the extraordinary power of memory to revivify images, refrains, or narratives, and argues that characters who successfully encompass a traumatic past do so by relinquishing the will to power expressed by silence or dogmatic interpretations of individual or collective history. Instead, these characters construct and continually revise dissertation-ended narratives and find that meaning resides in the recounting of such narratives rather than in affixing a final and singular meaning to events. Chapter 4 looks at both the public role of the writer {{and his or her}} audience. I argue that McGahern 2 ̆ 7 s writing protagonists trace an approach to point-of-view that moves from a defensive posture of isolation and recrimination toward an dissertation posture based on community and forgiveness, and that the latter elicits new ways to encompass the intolerable...|$|R
40|$|Stomata have a {{key role}} in the {{regulation}} of gas exchange and intercellular CO 2 concentrations of leaves. <b>Guard</b> cells <b>sense</b> internal and external signals in the leaf environment and transduce these signals into osmoregulatory processes that control stomatal apertures. This research proposal addresses the characterization of the sensory transduction of the CO 2 signal in guard cells. Recent studies have shown that in Vicia leaves kept at constant light and temperature in a growth chamber, changes in ambient CO 2 concentrations cause large changes in guard cell zeaxanthin that are linear with CO 2 -dependent changes in stomatal apertures. Research proposed here will test the hypothesis that zeaxanthin function as a transducer of CO 2 signals in guard cells. Three central aspects of this hypothesis will be investigated: CO 2 sensing by the carboxylation reaction of Rubisco in the guard cell chloroplast, which would modulate zeaxanthin concentrations via changes in lumen pH; transduction of the CO 2 signal by zeaxanthin via a transducing cascade that controls guard cell osmoregulation; and blue light dependence of the CO 2 signal transduction by zeaxanthin, required for the formation of an isomeric form of zeaxanthin that is physiologically active as a transducer. The role of Rubisco in CO 2 sensing will be investigated in experiments characterizing the stomatal response to CO 2 in the Arabidopsis mutants R 100 and rca-, which have reduced rates of Rubisco-dependent carboxylation. The role of zeaxanthin as a CO 2 transducer will be studied in npq 1, a zeaxanthin-less mutant. The blue light-dependence of CO 2 sensing will be studied in experiments characterizing the stomatal response to CO 2 under red light. Arabidopsis mutants will also be used in further studies of an acclimation of the stomatal response to CO 2, and a possible role of the xanthophyll cycle of the guard cell chloroplast in acclimations of the stomatal response to CO 2. Studies on the osmoregulatory role of sucrose in the stomatal response to CO 2 will investigate downstream targets of the CO 2 response. Success in characterizing a zeaxanthin-dependent CO 2 <b>sensing</b> mechanism in <b>guard</b> cells will significantly enhance our understanding of stomatal function and CO 2 sensing in plants cells. Further characterization of guard cells acclimation to CO 2 should enrich our understanding of plant acclimations and adaptations to their environment, and of possible effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations on the vegetation...|$|R
