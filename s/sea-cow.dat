60|$|After this we {{went into}} the Store {{and with the help of}} some of the natives, or half-breeds, who had {{accompanied}} us on the <b>sea-cow</b> expedition, selected all the goods we wanted, which we sent to the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you mustn't," [...] cried Tom Brown, {{grasping}} his friend's arm; [...] "come along, I see {{the bow of}} {{the boat}} among the rushes not far ahead of us, and yonder is a hippopotamus, or <b>sea-cow</b> as they call it here, waiting to be shot." ...|$|E
60|$|The post was stowed away. A native {{in black}} {{broad-cloth}} came running and sweating, carrying an ox-blood suit-case, {{and said we}} must wait for his brother-in-law, who was a dozen yards away. Ginger Mr. Rochester sat on his driver's throne and glared in the direction whence the brother-in-law must come. His brow knitted irritably, his long, sharp nose did not promise much patience. He made the horn roar like a <b>sea-cow.</b> But no brother-in-law.|$|E
5000|$|... (Roverandom is {{connected}} to the world of Middle-earth via Elvenhome)dugongs, manatees, porpoises, right whales, <b>sea-cows</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Yeats {{claimed that}} merrows come ashore {{transformed}} into [...] "little hornless cows". One stymied investigator conjectured this {{claim to be}} an extrapolation on Kennedy's statement that <b>sea-cows</b> are attracted to pasture on the meadowland wherever the merrow resided.|$|R
60|$|But {{to return}} to our hunters. Before that day had closed, the major and his friends had made good bags. The total result of the day's hunt by both parties was, five <b>sea-cows,</b> four elephants, two buffaloes, a giraffe, {{and a number of}} birds of various kinds.|$|R
60|$|In {{the event}} of the beasts failing us, we took also ten {{of the best of}} those Strathmuir men who had {{accompanied}} us on the <b>sea-cow</b> trip, to serve as bearers when it became necessary. It cannot be said that these snuff-and-butter fellows--for most, if not all of them had some dash of white blood in their veins--were exactly willing volunteers. Indeed, if a choice had been left to them, they would, I think, have declined this adventure.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{thanks to}} the {{strength}} of my rock and to the wall, or as Hans said afterwards, to Zikali's Great Medicine, we escaped unhurt. The rush went by me; indeed, I killed one <b>sea-cow</b> so close that the powder from the rifle actually burned its hide. But it did go by, leaving us untouched. All, however, were not so fortunate, since of the village natives two were trampled to death, while a third had his leg broken.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true, Bob," [...] said Tom Brown, who, {{although}} he had prepared to fire in case of need, intended to have allowed his friend {{to take the first}} shot; [...] "'twould be a pity to lose our chance of a <b>sea-cow,</b> which is good for food, {{for the sake of a}} monster which at the best could only give us a fine specimen-head for a museum, for his entire body is too big to haul about through the country after us." ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>sea-cows</b> or the dugongs are {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific region between 10 ngitudes 32 °E and 1700 W, latitudes 35 ° and 400 N. There are five population namely, East Australian, North Australian, Andaman-Malay Peninsula, Thailand and South China, South Indian and Sri Lanka, East African, Red Sea and Persian Gulf...|$|R
60|$|We {{spent three}} more days at that place. First it was {{necessary}} to allow time to elapse before the gases which generated in their great bodies caused those of the <b>sea-cows</b> which had been killed in the water, to float. Then they must be skinned and their thick hides cut into strips and pieces to be traded for sjamboks or to make small native shields for which some of the East Coast tribes will pay heavily.|$|R
60|$|About midday {{we passed}} out of the bush-veld and reached {{the place where the}} drive was to be. Here, bordered by steep banks covered with bush, was swampy ground not more than two hundred yards wide, down the centre of which ran a narrow channel of rather deep water, {{draining}} a vast expanse of morass above. It was up this channel that the <b>sea-cows</b> travelled to the feeding ground where they loved to collect at that season of the year.|$|R
60|$|At length {{it came to}} this; {{the channel}} {{for quite a long}} way was {{literally}} full of hippopotami--I should think {{there must have been a}} hundred of them or more of all sorts and sizes, from great bulls down to little calves. Some of these were killed, not many, for the shooting of our gallant company was execrable and almost at hazard. Also for every <b>sea-cow</b> that died, of which number I think that Captain Robertson and myself accounted for most--many were only wounded.|$|E
60|$|One of the curiosities was a <b>sea-cow,</b> {{who lived}} in a tank of salt water, and came at the keeper's call to kiss him, and {{flounder}} on its flippers along the margin of the tank after a fish. It was very like a seal, only much larger, and had four fins instead of two. Its eyes were lovely, so dark and soft and liquid; but its mouth was not pretty, and I declined one of the damp kisses which it was ready to dispense at word of command.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think I minded it very much, sir. Except when I was {{bothered by}} the bears I slept a good lot. I think at first I used to talk out loud a good deal. But I soon dropped that, though I used to whistle {{sometimes}} when I was cooking the food. I don't think I should have held on so long if I had only had the <b>sea-cow</b> flesh, but the bears made a nice change, and I only wished that {{one or two more}} had managed to crawl in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Baas," [...] said Hans, [...] "I {{will look}} after 'Sad-Eyes'"--for so with their usual quickness of {{observation}} our Zulus had named Inez--"as {{though she were}} my grandmother, though what there is to fear for her, I do not know. But, Baas, I would much rather come and look after you, as your reverend father, the Predikant, {{told me to do}} always, which is my duty, not girl-herding, Baas. Also my foot is now quite well and--I want to shoot <b>sea-cows,</b> and----" [...] Here he paused.|$|R
60|$|After this I took no more note of him, {{partly because}} of the {{advancing}} <b>sea-cows,</b> and more for the reason that one of the village natives posted above me, firing wildly, put a large round bullet through the sleeve of my coat. Indeed, {{had it not been for}} the wall which I built that protected us, I am certain that both my bearer and I would have been killed, for afterwards I found it splashed over with lead from bullets which had struck the stones.|$|R
6000|$|... "Winter {{was coming}} on fast, {{and the men}} all agreed that they would rather try and make their way south {{overland}} than stay there. I {{told them that they}} were fools, but I admit that the prospect of a winter there was enough to frighten any man. I did not like it myself, but I thought it was wiser to remain there than to move. Some of the men went along the shore, or out in the boat, and managed to kill several <b>sea-cows.</b> They made a sledge, piled the meat on it, and started.|$|R
60|$|About an hour's {{ride from}} the Plaza {{there is a high}} bluff with the ocean {{breaking}} uninterruptedly along its rocky beach. There are several cottages on the sands, which look as if they had recently been cast up by a heavy sea. The cultivated patch behind each tenement is fenced in by bamboos, broken spars, and driftwood. With its few green cabbages and turnip-tops, each garden looks something like an aquarium with the water turned off. In fact you would not be surprised to meet a merman digging among the potatoes, or a mermaid milking a <b>sea-cow</b> hard by.|$|E
6000|$|Javelins.--Heavy {{poisoned}} javelins, {{hung over}} elephant and hippopotamus paths, and dropped on a catch being touched, after {{the manner of}} a springe, are used generally in Africa. They sometimes consist of a [...] "sharp little assegai, or spike, most thoroughly poisoned, and stuck firmly into the end of a heavy block of thornwood, about four feet long and five inches in diameter. This formidable affair is suspended over the centre of a <b>sea-cow</b> path, at about thirty feet from the ground, by a bark cord, which passes over a high branch of a tree, and thence, by a peg, on one side of a path beneath." [...] (Gordon Cumming.) ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{they went}} ashore, after Amyas had given strict {{commands}} against letting off firearms, {{for fear of}} alarming the Spaniards. There they washed their clothes, and stretched their legs with great joy, admiring {{the beauty of the}} place, and then began to shoot the seine which they had brought on shore with them. [...] "In which," [...] says the chronicler, [...] "we caught many strange fishes, and beside them, a <b>sea-cow</b> full seven feet long, with limpets and barnacles on her back, {{as if she had been}} a stick of drift-timber. This is a fond and foolish beast: and yet pious withal; for finding a corpse, she watches over it day and night until it decay or be buried. The Indians call her manati; who carries her young under her arm, and gives it suck like a woman; and being wounded, she lamenteth aloud with a human voice, and is said at certain seasons to sing very melodiously; which melody, perhaps, having been heard in those seas, is that which Mr. Frank reported to be the choirs of the Sirens and Tritons. The which I do not avouch for truth, neither rashly deny, having seen myself such fertility of Nature's wonders that I hold him who denieth aught merely for its strangeness to be a ribald and an ignoramus. Also one of our men brought in two great black fowls which he had shot with a crossbow, bodied and headed like a capon, but bigger than any eagle, which the Spaniards call curassos; which, with that <b>sea-cow,</b> afterwards made us good cheer, both roast and sodden, for the cow was very dainty meat, as good as a four-months' calf, and tender and fat withal." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{had been}} done once or twice in the past, though not of late, perhaps because Captain Robertson had lacked the energy to organise such a hunt. Now he wished to do so again, taking {{advantage}} of my presence, both because {{of the value of}} the hides of the <b>sea-cows</b> which were cut up to be sent to the coast and sold as sjamboks or whips, and because of the sport of the thing. Also I think he desired to show me that he was not altogether sunk in sloth and drink.|$|R
60|$|I fell in {{with the}} idea readily enough, since in all my hunting life I had never seen {{anything}} of the sort, especially as I was told that the expedition would not take more than a week and I reckoned that the sick men and Hans would not be fit to travel sooner. So great preparations were made. The riverside natives, whose share of the spoil was to be the carcases of the slain <b>sea-cows,</b> were summoned by hundreds and sent off to their appointed stations to beat the swamps at a signal given by the firing of a great pile of reeds. Also many other things were done upon which I need not enter.|$|R
60|$|It might, certainly, if {{the fact}} be true. Moreover, Mr. Joseph {{does not seem}} to be aware that the old Spanish Conquistadores had a myth that music was to be heard in this very Gulf of Paria, and that at certain seasons the Nymphs and Tritons {{assembled}} therein, and with ravishing strains sang their watery loves. The story of the music has been usually treated as a sailor's fable, and the Sirens and Tritons supposed to be mere stupid manatis, or <b>sea-cows,</b> coming in as they do still now and then to browse on mangrove shoots and turtle-grass: {110} but if the story of the music be true, the myth may have had a double root.|$|R
6000|$|... "You had best {{get out of}} this, you prayer-snuffling old humbug," [...] he said savagely, [...] "for if {{you stop}} much longer I will make you sing another tune. We have <b>sea-cow</b> whips here, too, and you shall learn what a hiding means, such a hiding that your own family won't know you, if you live {{to get back to}} them. Look here, I offered to marry your {{daughter}} on the square, and I meant what I said. I'd have got rid of all this black baggage, and she should have been the only one. Well, I'll marry her yet, only now she'll just take her place with the others. We are all one flesh and blood, black and white, ain't we? I have often heard you preach it. So what will she have to complain of?" [...] he sneered. [...] "She can go and hoe mealies like the rest." ...|$|E
60|$|Stirrups {{must be very}} roomy, {{enough to}} admit clumsily-shaped shoes, such as {{are made in the}} bush; they must be broad under the sole of the foot, and also at the place which rubs against the little toe. Unless they are heavy, {{it is not easy to}} find them with the foot; {{travellers}} in South Africa cut them out from any thick raw hide--that of giraffe, rhinoceros, or <b>sea-cow</b> does admirably. A wooden stirrup may be cut or burnt out of a block. It should have lead melted into it to give it sufficient weight. A stick and a thong, as shown in the figure, is a poor makeshift. Willow, or any other lithe wood, is easily bent into the required shape, especially if its outer edge be nicked with a knife; otherwise it would be a mere loop of wood, such as it represented in the next figure but two, in the paragraph on Rings.|$|E
60|$|Ah! I tell you, my child, the veldt {{in those}} days was {{different}} indeed from what it is now. The land itself remains the same except where white men have built towns upon it, but all else is changed. Then it was black with game when the grass was green; yes, at times I have seen it so black for miles that we could scarcely see the grass. There were all sorts of them, springbucks in myriads, blesbok and quagga and wildebeeste in thousands, sable antelope, sassaby and hartebeeste in herds, eland, giraffe and koodoo in troops; while the forests were full of elephant and the streams of <b>sea-cow.</b> They are all gone now, the beautiful wild creatures; the guns of the white men have killed them out or driven them away, and I suppose that it is as well that they are gone, for while the game is in such plenty the men will not work. Still I for one am sorry to lose the sight of them, and {{had it not been for}} their numbers we Boers should never have lasted through that long trek, for often and often we lived upon buck's flesh and little else for weeks together.|$|E
60|$|It was {{all over}} at last, for which I thanked Providence devoutly. A good many of the <b>sea-cows</b> were dead, I think twenty-one was out exact bag, but the {{majority}} of them had escaped in one way or another, many as I fear, wounded. I imagine that at the last the bulk of the herd overcame its fears and swimming through our screen, passed away down the channel. At any rate they were gone, and having ascertained that {{there was nothing to be}} done for the man who had been trampled on my side of the channel, I crossed it in the canoe with the object of returning quietly to our camp to rest.|$|R
60|$|Watching {{the still}} channel of water, I saw ripples {{on it and}} bubbles of air rising. Suddenly there {{appeared}} {{the head of a}} great bull-hippopotamus which, having caught sight of our rag barricade, either above or below water, had risen to the surface to see what it might be. I put a bullet from an eight-bore rifle through its brain, whereon it sank, as I guessed, stone dead {{to the bottom of the}} channel, thus helping to increase the barricade by the bulk of its great body. Also it had another effect. I have observed that <b>sea-cows</b> cannot bear the smell and taint of blood, which frightens them horribly, so that they will expose themselves to almost any risk, rather than get it into their nostrils.|$|R
60|$|We trekked along a kind {{of native}} road over fine veld of the same {{character}} as that on which Strathmuir stood, having the lower-lying bush-veld which ran down to the Zambesi on our right. Before nightfall {{we came to a}} ridge whereon this bush-veld turned south, fringing that tributary of the great river in the swamps of which we were to hunt for <b>sea-cows.</b> Here we camped and next morning, leaving the waggon in charge of my voorlooper and a couple of the Strathmuir natives, for the driver was to act as my gun-bearer--we marched down into the sea of bush-veld. It proved to be full of game, but at this we dared not fire for fearing of disturbing the hippopotami in the swamps beneath, whence in that event they might escape us back to the river.|$|R
6000|$|The {{resemblance}} of the walrus to {{our domestic}} land-animals has obtained for it, among sailors, {{the names of}} the sea-horse and <b>sea-cow,</b> and the records of its ferocity when attacked are numerous. Its hide is nearly an inch thick, and is put to many useful purposes by the Esquimaux, who live to a great extent on the flesh of this creature. They cut up his hide into long lines, to attach to the harpoons, with which they catch himself, the said harpoons being pointed with his own tusks. This tough hide is not the only garment the walrus wears to protect him from the cold. He also wears under-flannels of thick fat and a top-coat of close hair, so that he can take a siesta on an iceberg without the least inconvenience. Talking of siestas, by the way, the walrus is sometimes [...] "caught napping". Occasionally, when the weather is intensely cold, the hole through which he crawls upon the ice gets frozen over so solidly that, on waking, he finds it beyond even his enormous power to break it. In this extremity there is no alternative but to go to sleep again, and--die! which he does as comfortably as he can. The polar bears, however, are quick to smell him out, and assembling round his carcass for a feast, they dispose of him, body and bones, without ceremony.|$|E
6000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{appointment}} of the Joint-Commission alluded to {{at the beginning of}} this chapter, President Burgers, who was now in possession of the Special Commissioner's intentions, should he be unable to carry out reforms sufficiently drastic to satisfy the English Government, thought it best to call together the Volksraad. In the meantime, it had been announced that the [...] "rebel" [...] Secocoeni had sued for peace and signed a treaty declaring himself a subject of the Republic. I shall have to enter into the question of this treaty a little further on, so I will at present only say that it was the first business laid before the Raad, and, after some discussion, ratified. Next in order to the Secocoeni peace came the question of Confederation, as laid down in Lord Carnarvon's Permissive Bill. This proposal was laid before them in an earnest and eloquent speech by their President, who entreated them to consider the dangerous position of the Republic, and to face their difficulties like men. The question was referred to a committee, and an adverse report being brought up, was rejected without further consideration. It is just possible that intimidation had something to do with the summary treatment of so important a matter, seeing that whilst it was being argued a large mob of Boers, looking very formidable with their <b>sea-cow</b> hide whips, watched every move of their representatives through the windows of the Volksraad Hall. It was Mr. Chamberlain's caucus system in practical and visible operation.|$|E
6000|$|At Secocoeni's kraal we {{had engaged}} two boys to carry our packs {{as far as}} the fort, who, on their arrival, were so well {{satisfied}} with {{the way in which we}} treated them that they requested to be allowed to proceed with us. These young barbarians, who went respectively by the names of [...] "Nojoke" [...] and [...] "Scowl," [...] as being the nearest approach in English to their Sisutu names, were the greatest possible source of amusement to us, with their curious ways.[*] I never saw such fellows to sleep; it is a positive fact that Nojoke used frequently to take his rest coiled up like a boa constrictor in a box at the end of the waggon, in which box stood three iron pots with their sharp legs sticking up. On those legs he peacefully slumbered when the waggon was going over ground that prohibited our even stopping in it. [...] "Scowl" [...] was not a nice boy to look at, for his naked back was simply cut to pieces and covered with huge weals, of which everybody, doubtless, thought we were the cause. On inquiring how he came to get such a tremendous thrashing, it turned out that these Basutus have a custom of sending young men of a certain age[+] out in couples, each armed with a good [...] "sjambok" [...] (a whip cut from the hide of a <b>sea-cow),</b> to thrash one another till one gives in, and that it was in one of these encounters that the intelligent Scowl got so lacerated; but, as he remarked with a grin, [...] "My back is nothing, the chiefs should see that of the other boy." ...|$|E
60|$|The white {{breakers}} were {{rushing to}} the shore; the foam ran up the sand, and then ran {{back as far as}} we could see (and we imagined how much farther along the Atlantic coast, before and behind us), as regularly, to compare great things with small, as the master of a choir beats time with his white wand; and ever and anon a higher wave caused us hastily to deviate from our path, and we looked back on our tracks filled with water and foam. The breakers looked like droves of a thousand wild horses of Neptune, {{rushing to the}} shore, with their white manes streaming far behind; and when at length the sun shone for a moment, their manes were rainbow-tinted. Also, the long kelp-weed was tossed up from time to time, like the tails of <b>sea-cows</b> sporting in the brine.|$|R
60|$|When the sportsmen at last landed to {{look after}} their game, they found four fine <b>sea-cows</b> and the calf drawn up on the banks, side by side, with upwards of a hundred Caffres gazing at them longingly! Nothing could be more courteous than the {{behaviour}} of these savages when Mafuta cut off such portions as his party required; but no sooner was {{the remainder of the}} spoil handed over to them than there ensued a scene of indescribable confusion. They rushed at the carcasses like vultures, with assegais, knives, sticks, and axes, hallooing, bellowing, shoving, and fighting, in a manner that would have done credit to the wildest of the wild beasts by which they were surrounded! Yet there was a distinct sense of justice among them. It was indeed a desperate fight to obtain possession, but no one attempted to dispossess another of what he had been fortunate enough to secure. The strongest savages got at the carcasses first, and cut off large lumps, which they hurled to their friends outside the struggling circle. These caught the meat thus thrown, and ran with it, each to a separate heap, on which he deposited his piece and left it in perfect security.|$|R
6000|$|... "Doesn't it? and isn't {{it hard to}} believe? I used to go, now and then, to see how {{the little}} fellows got on, and always found them hard at it. For a long while there was only a little plant without leaves, growing slowly taller and taller; for they always build upward toward the light. By and by, the small shrub was a tree: flying-fish roosted in its branches; <b>sea-cows</b> lay under its shadow; and {{thousands}} of jolly little polypes lived and worked in its white chambers. I was glad to see them getting on so well; but still I didn't believe in the island story, and used to joke them about their ambition. They were very good-natured, and only answered me, 'Wait a little longer, Friend Right.' I had my own affairs to attend to; so, for years at a time, I forgot the coral-workers, and spent most of my life up Greenland way, for warm climates don't agree with my constitution. When I came back, after a long absence, I was astonished to see the tree grown into a large umbrella-shaped thing, rising above the water. Sea-weed had washed up and clung there; sea-birds had made nests there; land-birds and the winds had carried seeds there, which had sprung up; trunks of trees had been cast there by the sea; lizards, insects, and little animals came with the trees, and were the first inhabitants; and, behold! it was an island." ...|$|R
