5|$|Both {{lifestyle}} changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of purine-rich foods {{of animal origin}} such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and fructose (especially high fructose corn syrup). Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight. Gout may be <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks.|$|E

5|$|Casterman {{felt that}} the {{black-and-white}} volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> line, {{and that it would}} not be used for shading.|$|E
5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Film scores, {{although}} they are <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> the film, are often critically acclaimed and very popular in their own right. Among early music for Italian films from the 1930s {{was the work of}} Riccardo Zandonai with scores for the films La Principessa Tarakanova (1937) and Caravaggio (1941). Post-war examples include Goffredo Petrassi with Non c'e pace tra gli ulivi (1950) and Roman Vlad with Giulietta e Romeo (1954). Another well-known film composer was Nino Rota whose post-war career included the scores for films by Federico Fellini and, later, The Godfather series. Other prominent film score composers include Ennio Morricone, Riz Ortolani and Piero Umiliani.|$|E

5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> a number of causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles {{are present in the}} bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|If an anaphylactoid {{reaction}} occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or {{slowed and}} antihistamines and other supportive care is administered.

5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E

This incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis <b>secondary</b> <b>to</b> that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E

Interpersonal factors such as self-efficacy and empathy may support those who experience <b>secondary</b> exposure <b>to</b> trauma by reducing burnout and secondary traumatic stress, and increasing compassion satisfaction (Shakespeare-Finch, Rees, 2 ̆ 6 Armstrong, 2015; Wagaman, Geiger, Shockley, 2 ̆ 6 Segal, 2015).

This study investigated the relationships among <b>secondary</b> exposure <b>to</b> trauma, self-efficacy, empathy, and professional quality of life (i. e. burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion satisfaction) for school counselors. A correlation analysis indicated that self-efficacy and empathy were both significantly correlated with burnout and compassion satisfaction.
