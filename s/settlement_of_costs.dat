Key components of public management are introduction of {{accrual basis accounting}} and management {{on the basis of}} results which is possible to achieve with improvements of accounting systems, mainly cost accounting and financial reporting in public sector.

Costs are important element in a decision making process by determination or calculation prices and remunerations for provided services or purchased goods from budgetary users. Information about costs are relevant even then when the price of provided services or purchased goods is lower then with them related occurred costs, or when it is purely political-social question, or when the price of provided services or purchased goods is determined with certain criteria and market fluctuations.

40|$|In {{a recent}} article, Miller has {{reminded}} us that medical malpractice litigation is not simply an economic problem which inhibits medical practice and increases health care costs. She argues that it has three broader "societal objectives": reparation, emotional vindication, and deterrence. Viewed in the broader perspective of social values, the Maine data suggest that our current approach to medical malpractice does not perform well. Significant numbers of respondents {{believe that they have}} been neither vindicated nor compensated for their own or their relatives' illness, injury, or death; and that they have not had the opportunity to protect others from harm. As Miller suggests in her review of British alternatives to medical malpractice litigation, there may be more efficient and effective means of reparation. There may also be more direct and less costly means to deter incompetent practitioners and vindicate those who are harmed. We shall never discover these alternatives if we view the medical malpractice "crisis" as a simple or straightforward problem <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> premiums, <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlements,</b> and <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> judgments; numerators. Medical malpractice litigation is the expression of deep and highly complicated problems, which cannot be solved or even significantly alleviated by false solutions motivated only by concerns <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and cost containment.

The study, Buyer Beware: Home Insurance, Extreme Weather and Climate Change, offers a preliminary analysis of changes in premiums, policies, and insurability.

Agriculture is undoubtedly a specific sector of the national economy because the market conditions do not ensure a <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> production <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> agricultural commodities.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to identify and determine the main factors influencing the value of the EVA indicator in agricultural enterprises while the analysis is focused especially on four variables directly entering the calculation of economic value added. But the fact that these four variables are functions of other variables has to be also taken into account. Constructed multi-dimensional regression model corresponds with the fundamental logic of the calculation of economic value added. It has been observed that the strongest influence on the value of EVA stands on the side of operating profit. But in agricultural enterprises, the important part of this profit consists just in the agricultural production subsidies.

40|$|Background Considerable {{development}} of MRI technology in diagnostic imaging, high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> MRI technology and controversial issues concerning official charges (tariffs) {{have been the}} main motivations to define and implement this study. Objectives The present study aimed to calculate the unit-cost of MRI services using activity-based costing (ABC) as a modern cost accounting system and to fairly compare calculated unit-costs with official charges (tariffs). Materials and Methods We included both direct and indirect <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> MRI services delivered in fiscal year 2011 in Shiraz Shahid Faghihi hospital. Direct allocation method was used for distribution <b>of</b> overhead <b>costs.</b> We used micro-costing approach to calculate unit-cost of all different MRI services. Clinical cost data were retrieved from the hospital registering system. Straight-line method was used for depreciation cost estimation. To cope with uncertainty and to increase the robustness of study results, unit <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> 33 MRI services was calculated in terms of two scenarios. Results Total annual <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> MRI activity center (AC) was calculated at USD 400, 746 and USD 532, 104 based on first and second scenarios, respectively. Ten percent <b>of</b> the total <b>cost</b> was allocated from supportive departments. The annual variable <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> MRI center were calculated at USD 295, 904. Capital costs measured at USD 104, 842 and USD 236, 200 resulted from {{the first and second}} scenario, respectively. Existing tariffs {{for more than half of}} MRI services were above the calculated costs. Conclusion As a public hospital, there are considerable limitations in both financial and administrative databases of Shahid Faghihi hospital. Labor cost has the greatest share <b>of</b> total annual <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> Shahid Faghihi hospital. The gap between unit costs and tariffs implies that the claim for extra budget from health providers may not be relevant for all services delivered by the studied MRI center. With some adjustments, ABC could be implemented in MRI centers. With the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> a reliable <b>cost</b> accounting system such as ABC technique, hospitals would be able to generate robust evidences for financial management of their overhead, intermediate and final ACs...|$|R

40|$|We use {{mechanism}} {{design to}} study efficient intertemporal payment arrangements when {{the ability of}} agents to perform certain welfare-improving transactions is subject to random and unobservable shocks. Efficiency is achieved via a payment system that assigns balances to participants, adjusts them based on the histories of transactions, and periodically resets them through settlement. Our analysis has several implications {{for the design of}} actual payment systems. Efficiency requires that, in order to overcome informational frictions, agents participating in transactions that do not involve monitoring frictions subsidize those that are subject to such frictions. Optimal settlement frequency should balance liquidity costs from settlement against the need to provide intertemporal incentives. Settlement costs must be borne by agents for whom the incentives to participate in the system are highest. Finally, an increase in settlement costs implies that, in order to counter a higher exposure to default, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> must increase and, at the same time, the volume of transactions must decrease.

40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I {{examine the}} following question: {{why do some}} leaders stay in costly wars that are unlikely to end in victory while other leaders willingly capitulate to their adversary’s demands when resistance remains an option? To explain this variation, I argue, the settlement costs associated with a leader’s personal culpability for involving {{the state in the}} conflict must be recognized. Leaders who can be linked to the decision to bring the state to war (culpable leaders) will feel more pressure to secure a favorable outcome and, consequently, will be more tolerant <b>of</b> the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> war and more likely to “gamble for resurrection” if the war is going poorly. Although the extant war termination literature addresses the notion <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>costs,</b> pressures specific to individual leaders are often overlooked, obscuring the powerful effect a leader’s culpability has on his war termination calculus. The pressures associated with culpability have implications for both theory and policy because their presence creates a dysfunctional relationship between a democratic leader and his citizens in times of war. I use a multiple methods approach (analyzed an original dataset of all warring leaders from 1816 - 1990, a national survey experiment funded by Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS)) to evaluate this theory, and find broad support for my hypotheses...|$|R
