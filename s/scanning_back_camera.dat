In general, InGaAs cameras are not sensitive in the 1700 to ~ 2300  nm spectral region, which has been identified in prior studies as useful for examining paintings with copper green pigments or thick lead white paints. Prior studies using cameras with sensitivity from 1000 to 2500  nm have found in general the performance at wavelengths longer than 1700  nm degraded relative to the performance at shorter wavelengths. Thus, there is interest in a camera system having improved performance out to 2500  nm that can utilize spectral bandpass filters.|$|R

30|$|A {{variety of}} {{scanning}} IRR camera {{systems have been}} explored over the past 20  years since solid state IR detectors and detector arrays have become more widely available. We have shown that a traditional step and stare system utilizing an extended spectral range and having high sensitivity {{can be used to}} produce multi-band IRR image products of use to scientists, conservators, and art historians. The system is adaptable as improvements in IR focal plane arrays become available. Recent testing with an InSb 1280  ×  1024 pixel array with 12 -μm pixels showed the system can acquire useful IRR images at 560 dpi, thus nearly matching the resolutions of x-radiography. The cost of commercial InSb and MCT detectors are rapidly dropping and near infrared commercial lenses are becoming more widely available worldwide. The new capabilities offered by image processing on multispectral data sets and the new information which is emerging suggest IRR camera systems like the one described here will find their place among the other novel IRR camera systems such as the digital <b>scanning</b> <b>back</b> <b>cameras</b> and the single pixel raster scanners.|$|R
30|$|Digital <b>scanning</b> <b>back</b> <b>cameras</b> {{utilizing}} small IR arrays {{have been}} constructed to improve the scan efficiency and enable the camera system to be portable [10, 11]. Such examples include the novel sensor constructed at the National Gallery, London. This IRR camera consists of a custom lens with a large field of view and a small InGaAs area array. The image from the lens is ‘scanned’ with the small IR area array (256  ×  320 pixels) to create a mosaicked 5 k by 5 k pixel IRR image in ~ 20  min [10]. A commercial version of this design, the Osiris camera, utilizes a small linear photodiode InGaAs array instead of the area array [11], producing a 4 k by 4 k pixel IRR image. A small ‘live’ image is used for focusing. Spatial sampling varies {{with the size of}} the painting, assuming no mosaicking of the large frames is done. Assuming a 1  m 2 painting is imaged, the spatial sampling would be 0.25  mm (i.e. 16 samples/mm 2). Since the InGaAs line array has some light leakage between pixels, the sharpness of the images as Nyquist is approached (1 / 2 sampling frequency) can be expected to be lower than with the raster single pixel scanners or the small framing array cameras.|$|R
50|$|The early digital <b>camera</b> <b>back</b> {{market was}} {{dominated}} by scanning, rather than single-shot, models. Since {{it is much easier}} to manufacture a high-quality linear (one-dimensional) CCD array that has only a few thousand pixels than a two-dimensional CCD matrix that has millions, very high-resolution <b>scanning</b> CCD <b>camera</b> <b>backs</b> were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts. For example, <b>camera</b> <b>backs</b> with a 7,000-pixel linear resolution—capable of scanning to relatively slowly produce pictures of about 40 MP—were available in the mid-1990s.|$|R

Older IRR camera systems are being replaced with near-infrared cameras consisting of room temperature infrared detector arrays {{made out of}} indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) that operate over the spectral range of ~ 900 to 1700  nm.

They do require a mechanical system for moving the camera or the artwork and post-capture image mosaicking. <b>Scanning</b> <b>back</b> <b>cameras</b> eliminate or reduce the amount of mosaicking and movement of the camera, however the need to minimize light exposure to the artwork requires short integration times, and thus limits the use of spectral bandpass filters. In general, InGaAs cameras are not sensitive in the 1700 to ~ 2300  nm spectral region, which has been identified in prior studies as useful for examining paintings with copper green pigments or thick lead white paints. Prior studies using cameras with sensitivity from 1000 to 2500  nm have found in general the performance at wavelengths longer than 1700  nm degraded relative to the performance at shorter wavelengths. Thus, there is interest in a camera system having improved performance out to 2500  nm that can utilize spectral bandpass filters. Methods Design requirements for such an improved IRR camera system were determined by first re-examining the optimal spectral window for detecting underdrawing. Thus the wavelength dependence of the clarity of carbon black underdrawings on a chalk ground covered by various paint swatches was measured from 750 to 2500  nm. Second, analysis of the loss of light transmission (1000 – 2500  nm) and the impact of thermal radiation (3000 – 5000  nm) on the performance of IR arrays sensitive to the 1000 – 5000  nm region was analyzed. From the results of these studies, a high sensitivity, near-infrared (1000 – 2450  nm) indium antimonide (InSb) staring array camera with a cold filter that blocked light > 2450  nm was constructed with a color-corrected macro lens capable of holding interference filters. The camera system was characterized in three spectral bands (1100 – 1400, 1500 – 1800, and 2100 – 2400  nm) using test targets and art objects. Results The experimental results of the contrast difference between the model underdrawing on the chalk ground showed the optimal spectral window for a given pigment varied over the range from 700 to 2300  nm. The contrast in all cases was found to be low from 2300 to 2600  nm and even lower from 2600 to 5000  nm. This is attributable in part to broad absorption by the drying oil paint binder. Performance testing of the IRR camera found high signal-to-noise was observed in all three spectral bands due to the optimized macro lens having high transmission from 1000 to 2600  nm, a 100 % efficiency cold stop, and a cold filter that blocks light > 2450  nm. The camera was found to have high light sensitivity, requiring only ~ 30 to 50  lx from incandescent lamps having a color temperature of ~ 2060  K. The images produced in each spectral band were sharp, and the modulation at Nyquist (1 / 2 the sampling frequency) was 20 %. IRR images of Old Master paintings, works on paper, and a warped panel painting were collected to test the practical utility of the camera system. Conclusions The IR camera system presented here was found to produce a variety of high-resolution image products. The ability to extend image collection over the 1700 – 2450  nm spectral range was found in some examples to provide improved visibility of underdrawing. The ability to register the resulting multi-band IRR images with the color image offers opportunities to produce new image products such as false-color images and principal component images. These image products were found to give new insights into the construction of works of art. A collection scheme based on a ‘Z-stack’ method was found {{to solve the problem of}} producing high-resolution IRR images of highly warped panel paintings...|$|R
