Many studies have been devoted to the case m = 1 [10 – 13]. The case m = 1, a(x) = 1, q 1 = 0, s 1 ≥ 1 and m = 1, a(x) = 1, q 1, s 1 > 1 were studied by <b>Souple</b> [10, 11]. <b>Souple</b> [10] demonstrated that the positive solution blows up in finite time if the initial value v 0 is large enough. In the case a(x) = 1, q 1 = 0, and s 1 > 1, <b>Souple</b> [11] showed that the solution v(x, τ) blows up globally and the blow-up rate is precisely determined.

40|$|This {{article is}} about a complex {{construction}} in French with an infinitive clause {{that seems to be}} an adverbial complement of a structure No être Adj with a human subject, for instance : Paul a été honnête d'intervenir. The properties of this construction are studied and contrasted with those of a construction with a closely related meaning but with a sentential subject : Que Paul soit intervenu est honnête de sa part. The human-subject construction is shown to be a feature of a class of adjectives which are independently characterized by the distribution of their subject. This construction defines them as adjectives of psychological qualities, as opposed to adjectives qualifying a physical behaviour or a look (gracieux, <b>souple),</b> a mood (mélancolique) or a feeling (triste).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the problem of {{computing}} and analyzing the static equilibrium of a nonrigid water tank. Specifically, we fix {{the amount of water}} contained in the tank, modelled as a membrane. In addition, there are rigid obstacles that constrain the deformation. This amounts to a nonconvex variational problem. We derive the optimality system and its interpretation in terms of equilibrium of forces. A second-order sensitivity analysis, allowing to compute derivatives of solutions and a second-order Taylor expansion of the cost function, is performed, {{in spite of the fact}} that the cost function is not twice differentiable. We also study the finite elements discretization, introduce a decomposition algorithm for the numerical computation of the solution, and display numerical results. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.
