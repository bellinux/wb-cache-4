40|$|The {{well-defined}} pore {{systems of}} crystalline microporous SiO 2 modifications (porosils) {{can be used}} as templates for the ordered arrangement of inorganic guest species like iodine or the mercury halides. The systematic variation of the host structures, including pore systems from zero- to three-dimensional, allows interactions between the guest molecules in various directions to be controlled. Moreover, the periodic cage system of one of the porosils used, deca-dodecasil 3 R, is well-suited as a crystalline matrix for the isolation of <b>sulphur</b> <b>rings.</b> The unique properties of these novel host-guest compounds are probed using spectroscopic techniques, including X-ray absorption, UV/Vis and Raman spectroscopy...|$|E

40|$|Gas-phase electron-diffraction (GED) data {{together}} with results from ab initio molecular orbital calculations {{have been used}} to determine the structure of propylene sulphide. Values found for the main structural parameters for the molecule are consistent with those obtained from microwave studies and are compared here with those found for similar <b>sulphur</b> containing <b>rings</b> of general formula S(CH 2) n (n = 2 – 5). A high ring strain enthalpy was calculated for propylene sulphide which is consistent with the small C–S–C angle (48. 2 (6) degrees) and the relatively long C–S bond lengths (ra = 1. 831 (2) Å). This is thought to account for the ease of ring opening in propylene sulphide observed in MOCVD reactions and the ready polymerisation of the molecule...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis was to synthesise a sugar having the ring oxygen replaced by sulphur. 5 -Deoxy- 5 -thio-D-xylopyranose {{and a number of}} its derivatives were successfully synthesised. This led {{to the study of the}} reactivity of these compounds and their oxygen analogues in some typical carbohydrate reactions. The results of these experiments provided further evidence concerning the mechanisms of certain carbohydrate reactions. Part I : A discussion of the physical and chemical properties of analogous oxygen and sulphur compounds. This discussion was of interest in connection with the comparison of the reactivity of sulphur sugars and their oxygen analogues, and particularly, because a comprehensive survey of this type is not available in the literature. Part II : 5 -Deoxy- 5 -thio-D-xylopyranose and its derivatives. Section I of this part described the preparation and properties of 5 -heoxy- 5 -thio-D xylopyranose. Evidence, based on UV and IR spectroscopy, N. M. R. studies, chemical reactions, and mutarotation studies, is presented as proof of the existence of the <b>sulphur</b> <b>ring.</b> The mutarotation reaction of 5 -deoxy- 5 -thio-D-xylopyranose and its oxygen analogue was carried out in two buffered solutions of different pH and the results compared. The production of 2 -thiophenaldehyde and 2 -furfuraldehyde from 5 -deoxy- 5 -thio-Dxylopyranose and its oxygen analogue respectively was studied. Section II describes the preparation, reactions, and methanolysis of 2, 3, 4 -tri- 0 -acetyl- 5 -deoxy- 5 -thio-α-Dxylopyranosyl 1 -bromide. The reactions included the Koenigs- Knorr reaction and the reaction of the acetobromide with silver acetate. The results of the methanolysis of the sulphur sugar acetohalide and its oxygen analogue were in agreement with the accepted unimolecular mechanism, and the fact that the oxygen-ring sugar reacts forty times faster than its sulphur analogue is satisfactorarily explained. Section III describes the preparation and hydrolysis of methyl 5 -deoxy- 5 -thio-α- and β-D-xylopyranosides. The kinetic results of the hydrolyses of these methyl glycosides and of methyl β-D-xylopyranoside enabled us to lend support to one of two proposed mechanisms for the acid hydrolysis of glycosides...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} polymerization of sulphur is {{investigated by}} a combination of density func-tional (DF) computations for gas-phase molecules and Monte Carlo simulations for the reacting liquid phase. The DF calculations provide {{a detailed description of the}} elementary processes leading to polymerization, and the results for the cohesive energy, structural and vibrational properties of <b>sulphur</b> chains and <b>rings</b> provide input parameters for a semi-empirical atomistic model. Monte Carlo simulations account for many-atom effects and for thermal averaging. The results allow us to estimate the zero-pressure polymerization temperature of sulphur at Tf = 450 20 K, in good agreement with experiment (T expf = 432 K). The simulation results reproduce qualitative changes in the experimental radial distribution function, and the estimates for thermodynamic properties agree well with experimental data. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} polarized and depolarized Raman {{optical activity}} in ring deformations of R-(+) -methyloxirane, R-(+) -methylthiirane and (2 s, 3 s) -(-) (2, 3) -dimethyloxirane. The observations {{are consistent with}} recent assignments of vibrations containing significant contributions from symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of C-O and C-S stretches and with the absolute stereochemical configurations. A detailed analysis is presented of how {{the ratio of the}} polarized to the depolarized Raman optical activity varies with the ratio of the magnetic dipole to electric quadrupole contributions. Effects in the oxirane and the thiirane are similar, but the dimethyloxirane shows dramatically different behaviour associated with a dominant electric quadrupole mechanism in the antisymmetric band. It is shown how this might be explained in terms of the selection rules on the first two Rydberg electronic transitions in the dimethyloxirane in conjunction with the C 2 symmetry of the molecule. Our results also indicate that the bond polarizability theory is not realistic for vibrations involving oxygen or <b>sulphur</b> heteroatoms in <b>ring</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. (Chemistry) The aim of {{this study}} was the {{development}} of stereoselective routes for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral precursors of I 1 -deoxy- 1 l-thiaprostaglandins and albomysin di, using carbohydrates as chiral building blocks. A brief overview of known stereocontrolled routes for the synthesis of sulphur-containing monosaccharides and heterocyclic prostaglandin analogues is presented. Approaches to the stereocontrolled synthesis of I 1 -deoxy- 11 -thiaprostaglandins from Larabinose are described. Special topics {{in this part of the}} study include approaches to the preparation of chiral tetrahydrothiophenes. The 1, 4 -diol 5 - 0 -benzoyl- 3 -deoxy- 3 -C-(carboxymethyl- 2, 3 -y-lactone) -L-lyxitol (146 a), was identified as a possible chiral building block for the proposed route towards 11 -thiaprostaglandins. New groups for the activation of the hydroxyl functions of the 1, 4 -diol in order to introduce the <b>ring</b> <b>sulphur</b> atom via a 1 thiobenzyl ether, were investigated. The l, 4 -diol was subsequently transformed into a 1, 4 dimesylate and this compound proved to be the most suitable for the generation of the tetrahydrothiophene unit. This investigation resulted in an efficient synthesis of 11 thiaprostaglandin precursors using glucose as a chiral building block. In the second part of the investigation, approaches to the stereoselective synthesis of a potential precursor for the synthesis of albomysin dr are described. An investigation of the selective acylation of acyclic pentoses are also presented. The {{aim of this}} study was the regioselective introduction of a leaving group, for example a tosylate, in acyclic derivatives of pentose without protecting any of the secondary hydroxyl groups. This strategy would make intramolecular cyclisations possible with a suitable nycleophile present on C-l. Some of the compounds in the pentose series investigated, furnished dibutyltin complexes which were regioselectively acylated in an efficient manner. Starting from L-arabinose an alternative strategy for the synthesis of a precursor for the synthesis of aIbomysin di is also given. The synthesis involved the preparation of 1 - 0 -acetyl 2, 3, 5 -tri-O-benzoyl- 4 -thio-xylofuranose, followed by conversion to the required nucleoside...|$|R
