5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that <b>surely</b> <b>she</b> knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E

I do not think my Child is entirely free from Faults. I know nothing human that is so; but <b>surely</b> <b>she</b> doth not deserve the Rancour with which she hath been treated by the Public.|$|E
500|$|In 1962 {{he married}} {{for the third}} time, to Irina Supinskaya. In a letter to Glikman, he wrote [...] "her only defect {{is that she is}} 27 years old. In all other respects she is splendid: clever, cheerful, {{straightforward}} and very likeable." [...] According to Galina Vishnevskaya, who knew the Shostakoviches well, this marriage was a very happy one: [...] "It was with her that Dmitri Dmitriyevich finally came to know domestic peace... <b>Surely,</b> <b>she</b> prolonged his life by several years." [...] In November he made his only venture into conducting, conducting a couple of his own works in Gorky; otherwise he declined to conduct, citing nerves and ill health as his reasons.|$|E
50|$|In Pet's Revenge, Edgar has to plot solo when Ellen {{suddenly}} {{turns into}} a model of proper behavior. She (voluntarily) takes a bath and even accepts {{an invitation to a}} slumber party. <b>Surely</b> <b>she's</b> got a scheme up her (unusually clean) sleeve. Or has a hairy traitor managed to break up the devious duo...|$|R
6000|$|All {{the evening}} Melbury {{had been coming}} to his door, saying, [...] "I wonder {{where in the world}} that girl is! Never in all my born days did I know her bide out like this! <b>She</b> <b>surely</b> said <b>she</b> was going into the garden to get some parsley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, <b>surely,</b> Deerslayer, <b>she</b> {{cannot be}} a woman, {{and not feel}} concern when she thinks the man she loves is in danger!" ...|$|R
500|$|English statesmen William Cecil and the Earl of Leicester {{had worked}} to obtain Darnley's licence {{to travel to}} Scotland {{from his home in}} England. Although her advisors had thus brought the couple together, Elizabeth felt {{threatened}} by the marriage, because as descendants of her aunt, both Mary and Darnley were claimants to the English throne and their children, if any, would inherit an even stronger, combined claim. However, Mary's insistence on the marriage seems to have stemmed from passion rather than calculation. The English ambassador Nicholas Throckmorton stated [...] "the saying is that <b>surely</b> <b>she</b> [...] is bewitched", adding that the marriage could only be averted [...] "by violence". The union infuriated Elizabeth, who felt the marriage should not have gone ahead without her permission, as Darnley was both her cousin and an English subject.|$|E
2500|$|Haruna Nagashima {{gave her}} all to {{softball}} in middle school, {{now that she}} has made her high school debut, she has decided to give her all for a new goal: getting a boyfriend and falling in love. However, she has one small problem—since she never {{paid any attention to}} fashion or trends in middle school, she has no idea how to go about attracting her yet-to-be-found love. But a chance encounter with the popular Yoh Komiyama provides her with the opportunity she needs. If he coaches her in how to become attractive, <b>surely</b> <b>she</b> can find herself a boyfriend.|$|E

5000|$|Why is it, everybody, {{from the}} fucking fish and chip shop to a {{magazine}} ends up selling itself, getting the millions and retiring. Why don't people keep going with it, why can't they change {{it so that}} it keeps being important to them. Why didn't Anita Roddick keep going with Body Shop, why did it get so alien to her that she had to sell it, why? <b>Surely</b> <b>she's</b> making so many millions she can get the right people that she loves to keep going with the ethos; there's something dangerous there. Garry Cobain on people becoming successful only to quit.|$|R
60|$|No, <b>surely</b> <b>she</b> {{could not}} care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her part with that icy unconcern.|$|E

60|$|Her words struck {{home more}} <b>surely</b> than <b>she</b> imagined, for {{in my heart}} had lain dormant for months the fear {{of what was to}} come, the shadow which was already {{creeping}} over our lives. Nevertheless, I answered her lightly.|$|R
60|$|GODLEIGH. [Cocking his eye, {{and not at}} all abashed] <b>Surely,</b> m'm. But <b>she</b> will come. Go away, my dear.|$|R
60|$|But even so, her cold-blooded callousness was <b>surely</b> abnormal! <b>She</b> {{had married}} him, {{lived with him}} for nearly a year. To the Jetsons she had given the {{impression}} of being a woman deeply {{in love with her}} husband. It could not have been mere acting kept up day after day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see how," [...] Barnes {{declared}} sullenly. [...] "If {{this young}} lady is my sister-in-law, <b>surely</b> <b>she</b> and I can settle up our own affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She ain't a child, ma'am. She's {{twenty-five years}} old, and <b>surely</b> <b>she</b> {{can come to}} Exeter by herself, with a {{railroad}} {{all the way from}} Lessboro'." ...|$|E

6000|$|... - [...] "Her look is but her story: {{construe}} not its symbols keenly: [...] In her wonderworks yea <b>surely</b> has <b>she</b> wounded {{where she}} loves.

6000|$|She {{turned her}} eyes through the window. “I don’t think you’re really surprised, though {{possibly}} {{you try to}} be. I don’t like her at any rate, and I can’t fancy why my son should. She’s very pretty and appears very clever; but I don’t trust her. I don’t know what has taken possession of him; it’s not usual in his family to marry people like that. <b>Surely</b> <b>she’s</b> of no breeding. The person I should propose would be so very different—perhaps {{you can see what}} I mean. There’s something in her history we don’t understand. My son understands it no better than I. If you could throw any light on it, that might be a help. If I treat you with such confidence the first time I see you it’s because I don’t know where to turn. I’m exceedingly anxious.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must <b>surely</b> understand," [...] <b>she</b> went on, [...] "that we don't {{want another}} person's child, {{now we have}} a little darling of our own?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Native American studies ethnographer David Shorter wrote, [...] "Andrea Smith <b>surely</b> thinks <b>she</b> is Cherokee; or she did at some point.

6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Jefferson agreed. [...] "Jacinta's {{touch is}} <b>surely</b> light; <b>she</b> can pull {{three or four}} wires at once, without your knowing how she's occupied.

5000|$|At {{about this}} time, on being {{presented}} to the queen {{he said he would}} prefer to be sovereign of a molehill than the subject of the greatest king in Christendom and that he had a presentiment he would be a prince before he died.

6000|$|... "No, they can't--because {{you take}} first choice, {{it seems to}} me. Supposing your wife--or Lilly's wife--asks for {{security}} and for provision, as Sir William says. <b>Surely</b> <b>she</b> {{has a right to}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes?" [...] commented Elaine dryly {{and with}} an {{apparent}} {{lack of interest in}} his exchequer statement. <b>Surely,</b> <b>she</b> was thinking hurriedly to herself, he could not be foolish enough to broach the matter of another loan.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, writing [...] "... Musically she couldn't have picked a more certain path. [...] "I make {{mistakes}} that I learn from/ 'Cause I'm young," [...] she calls over a well-trodden mix of pulsing beats helmed by her former beau and bandmate, before a chorus of glorious strobing trance ensues. Its timing might initially seem suspicious, but by the song's final chorus, we honestly couldn't care less." [...] Daily Stars John Earls referred to the song as [...] "quality rave" [...] and wrote, [...] "it's more universal than N-Dubz but still sharp enough for her young crew." [...] Amy Dawson of Metro wrote, [...] "‘Forgive me for what I have done, ’cause I’m young,’ belts out the former N-Dubz, X Factor judge on her debut solo single, a brain-witheringly generic serving of Ibiza trance-pop. We forgive her that; but <b>surely</b> <b>she’s</b> old enough to know better than this?".|$|R
60|$|As to Theodora, she was talking, laughing, dancing, and {{appearing}} {{so full of}} spirits, that Violet {{could not}} help venturing a remark, that <b>she</b> <b>surely</b> liked it better than she expected.|$|R
50|$|<b>Surely</b> enough, <b>she</b> lands Leno {{the coveted}} job as Tonight Show host and the producer's {{position}} for herself, {{on the condition}} that no public announcement will be made. Letterman continues to believe he is still in contention for the position. Another reason NBC's executives prefer Leno is that they will own the show, whereas Letterman stipulates that he will maintain ownership rights to his.|$|R
