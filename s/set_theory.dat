5|$|When {{interpreted}} as a proof within a first-order <b>set</b> <b>theory,</b> such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of <b>set</b> <b>theory</b> has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b> In the standard model of <b>set</b> <b>theory,</b> this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of <b>set</b> <b>theory,</b> {{it may be a}} nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his <b>set</b> <b>theory,</b> when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's <b>set</b> <b>theory,</b> the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his <b>set</b> <b>theory</b> is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E

5|$|Peano {{arithmetic}} is equiconsistent {{with several}} weak systems of <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b> One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general <b>set</b> <b>theory</b> (extensionality, {{existence of the}} empty set, and the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.|$|E
5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel <b>set</b> <b>theory,</b> the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Continuum hypothesis, {{introduced}} by Cantor, was presented by David Hilbert {{as the first}} of his twenty-three open problems in his address at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert's celebrated encomium. The US philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce praised Cantor's <b>set</b> <b>theory,</b> and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Zurich in 1897, Hurwitz and Hadamard also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator Philip Jourdain on the history of <b>set</b> <b>theory</b> and on Cantor's religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works.|$|E
5|$|The Peano axioms can be {{augmented}} {{with the}} operations of addition and multiplication and the usual total (linear) ordering on N.

5|$|The axiomatization of mathematics, on {{the model}} of Euclid's Elements, had reached new levels of rigour and breadth {{at the end of the}} 19th century, {{particularly}} in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive <b>set</b> <b>theory</b> suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of <b>set</b> <b>theory</b> was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel <b>set</b> <b>theory</b> provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.|$|E

5|$|A {{far-reaching}} {{generalization of}} addition of natural numbers is {{the addition of}} ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b> These give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative. Addition of cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to the}} disjoint union operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Cantor {{published}} his correspondence with several philosophers on the philosophical implications of his <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b> In an extensive attempt to persuade other Christian thinkers and authorities to adopt his views, Cantor had corresponded with Christian philosophers such as Tilman Pesch and Joseph Hontheim, {{as well as}} theologians such as Cardinal Johannes Franzelin, who once replied by equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism. Cantor even sent one letter directly to Pope Leo XIII himself, and addressed several pamphlets to him.|$|E

5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b> At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only {{if they could be}} constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b> He had two motivations {{for developing the}} axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the well-ordering theorem. Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the axiom of choice, but his proof was criticized {{for a variety of}} reasons. His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E
5|$|Some {{approaches}} explicitly define real {{numbers to}} be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b> The natural numbers – 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on – begin with 0 and continue upwards, so that every number has a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number {{can be compared to}} another and found to be less than, greater than, or equal to another number.|$|E

5|$|The axiom of {{foundation}} {{proposed that}} every set {{can be constructed}} {{from the bottom up}} in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the method of inner models, which later became an essential instrument in <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann was {{the first}} to {{establish}} a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac–von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. After having completed the axiomatization of <b>set</b> <b>theory,</b> he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on <b>set</b> <b>theory.</b> The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E
