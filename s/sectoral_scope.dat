What remained on forestry was [...] "Afforestation and Reforestation", <b>sectoral</b> <b>scope</b> 14 of the CDM. Under this <b>sectoral</b> <b>scope</b> areas of land that had no forest cover since 1990 could be replanted with commercial or indigenous tree species. In its first eight years of operation 52 projects had been registered under the [...] "Afforestation and Reforestation" [...] scope of the CDM. The cumbersome administrative procedures and corresponding high transaction costs are often blamed for this slow uptake. Beyond the CDM, all developed countries that were parties to the Kyoto Protocol also committed to measuring and reporting on efforts to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from forests. The United States also measures and reports on the net greenhouse gas sequestration in its forests.|$|E

40|$|We {{measure the}} effect of R&D spillovers on plant {{productivity}} by taking account of (i) the national origin of the spillovers, (ii) the mechanism through which spillovers may flow (FDI and/or imports), (iii) the <b>sectoral</b> <b>scope</b> of spillovers, as well as (iv) their geographic scope, in a single analytical framework. Our analysis {{is based on an}} exhaustive database on Irish manufacturing plants covering the period 1986 - 1994. The results show that while domestic plants benefit from local R&D spillovers, these spillovers are spatially bounded. Domestic plants are also able to tap into the global R&D pool, but only via the presence of multinational plants located near them. In contrast, {{there is no evidence that}} foreign affiliates located in Ireland are recipients of local R&D spillovers. Foreign affiliates do, however, gain from the size of the R&D stock in their origin country. ...|$|E
40|$|Devolution in the UK forms {{part of a}} wider {{process of}} spatial {{rescaling}} across Europe. Little {{work has been done}} on its effect on interest articulation. The literature on policy communities treats them as <b>sectoral</b> in <b>scope.</b> We propose the concept of ‘territorial policy communities' to designate territorially bounded constellations of actors within and across policy sectors, emerging in response to the rescaling of government. Devolution may leave existing systems of interest articulation unchanged, leaving ‘regions without regionalism'; it may confine some groups within territorial boundaries while allowing others the freedom to choose' between levels of government; or it might promote a general territorialization of interest representation and the emergence of territorial policy communities. The UK's four models of devolution help test the effects of stronger and weaker forms of devolution on the territorialization of groups...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM, transgenic) {{crops are}} often invoked in debates about poverty, hunger, and agricultural development. The framing of GM crops as a 'pro-poor' and environmentally sustainable technology was partly {{a creation of}} the biotechnology industry, but cannot be explained as merely a cynical exercise in public relations. Storylines about poverty alleviation and sustainable development actually helped to drive and shape the technical and commercial strategies of the leading transnational agribusiness company, Monsanto, during the 1970 s, 80 s and 90 s. However, while those storylines emerged alongside the GM crop technologies that were being developed in the company's laboratories and greenhouses, they failed to influence their design or technological content. Nevertheless, the pro-poor and sustainability rhetoric contributed directly to a transformation of Monsanto's <b>sectoral</b> and geographical <b>scope,</b> to include a new focus on markets in developing countries. In principle, serving farmers in these markets could lead the company to develop new products and technologies {{that are designed to}} address the needs of resource-poor smallholders, but the evidence of such a change occurring is scan...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the network relationships {{of a set of}} large retail multinational enterprises (MNEs). We analyze under what conditions a flagship-network strategy (characterized by a network of five partners – the MNE, key suppliers, key partners, selected competitors and key organisations in the non-business infrastructure) explains the internationalisation of three retailers whose geographic <b>scope,</b> <b>sectoral</b> conditions and competitive strategies differ substantially. We explore why and when retailers will adopt a flagship strategy. The three firms are two U. K. -based multinational retailers (Tesco and The Body Shop) and a French-based global retailer (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton). We find evidence of strong network relationships for all three retailers, although each embraces network strategies for different reasons. Their flagship relationships depend on each retailer's strategic use of firm-specific-advantages (FSAs) and country-specific advantages (CSAs). We find that a flagship strategy can succeed in overcoming internal and/or environmental constraints to cross-border resource transfers, which are barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI). We provide recommendations on why and when to use a flagship-based strategy and which type of network partners to prioritize in order to succeed internationally...|$|R
40|$|For {{political}} and practical reasons, environmental regulations sometimes treat point-source polluters, such as power plants, differently from mobile-source polluters, such as vehicles. This paper measures {{the extent of}} this regulatory asymmetry {{in the case of}} nitrogen oxides (NOx), the most recalcitrant criteria air pollutant in the United States. We find significant differences in marginal abatement costs across source types: the marginal cost of reducing NOx from cars is less than half the marginal cost of reducing NOx from power plants. Our results measure the possible efficiency gains and distributional implications associated with increasing the <b>sectoral</b> <b>scope</b> of environmental regulations. JEL: Keywords: A basic tenet in microeconomics holds that, if production has been efficiently allocated, marginal costs should be equalized across producers. Past empirical work has demonstrated that this equivalence does not always hold in practice. For instance, in the presence of market power (S. Borenstein, J. B. Bushnell and F. A. Wolak 2002), trad...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we use distance-based methods, {{specifically}} {{a slight}} variation of Ripley’s K function and a bivariate generalisation of this function, {{to explore the}} detailed location pattern of the Spanish manufacturing industry, the scope of localisation and the tendency towards colocalisation between horizontally and vertically linked industries. To do so, we use micro-geographic data, considering a narrowly defined industry classification. Our results show heterogeneous location patterns, but with a significant tendency towards localisation. The <b>sectoral</b> <b>scope</b> is very sensitive {{to the degree of}} homogeneity of the activities in each sector. The more homogeneous the activities in a specific sector are, the more similarities we find in the spatial location patterns among its industries. Finally, although the patterns of colocalisation detected are sensitive to the counterfactuals used, between 20 and 48 % of the pairs of industries with strong input–output linkages considered in this study show a significant tendency to colocalisation, and among them 74 % are vertically linked industries.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse discursive struggles {{over what is}} {{referred}} to as legal and illegal user practices in the internet as an outcome of regulatory uncertainty. The latter, in turn, is examined {{in the context of a}} multi-layered transnational copyright regime characterised by three features: the absence of an universally recognized single authority in charge of law-making, fragmented and partially contradicting forms of regulation of global, national and <b>sectoral</b> <b>scope,</b> and considerable indeterminacy of rule interpretation and application arising from the variety and distinctiveness of local usage contexts. We argue that notions of legality and illegality are used strategically by different actors to resolve perceived misalignments between regulation, business models and user practices. The results indicate that the meaning of legality and illegality, while often presented as well-defined distinction, in the case of internet user practices is often far from clear-cut and generally accepted. In fact, copyright industry, intermediaries, users and regulators are involved in what Black (2002) refers to as “regulatory conversations”. Analysing these regulatory conversations offers a revealing entry point to study how under conditions of transnational regime complexity and diffusion of new technology solutions to regulatory uncertainty are negotiated in a multiplicity of social contexts...|$|E
40|$|In a usual {{country level}} MARKAL, {{the role of}} the demand has been {{neglected}} for a long time. Over decades, it remained inelastic (Abilock et al. 1979), then piecewise constant (Loulou & Lavigne 1996), until it was connected to rest of the economy (A. Manne, MARKAL-MACRO 1992). The optimal configuration consisted of competing technologies, and technologies only. Demand-side management measures were modelled through sets of measures described as technologies that were with zero or low cost and therefore always used to their full potential. Putting bounds on their penetration was subjective and depended upon the modeller and his good sense. Another important disadvantage of this approach was that the model could become remote-controlled through bounds on demand-side management.

On a city level, typically there will be not much energy extraction or transformation but principally demand devices. Our approach uses sociological surveys to produce technical coefficient equivalents used in virtual process technologies (information campaigns in favour of energy savings and of technology switch) that can be put into direct competition with tangible technologies (such as residential lighting or space heating). An information campaign has usual technology attributes such as investment cost, duration, efficiency (yield). This information campaign may be selected in the optimal solution depending on its competitiveness. Indeed, actual information campaigns can trigger behavioural change (Fragnière et al. 2010). It is thus important to include this element of behavioural change into long-term energy model. To build these social parameters, we rely on sociological surveys. The results of the surveys are transformed to be included into demand side of the long-term energy planning models. In this paper, we show how we transform the results, especially ordinal and nominal data from quantitative surveys into parameters that are adapted to a long-term energy modelling tool such as MARKAL or TIMES. To illustrate this contribution, we will present the results of surveys that have been conducted in Romania...|$|E
