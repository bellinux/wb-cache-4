50|$|In Australia, <b>side</b> <b>letters</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly common due to the changes in federal labor law the WorkChoices Act created. WorkChoices limits the collective bargaining agreements that parties can register for eligibility for workplace tribunals enforcement, and also requires CBAs be strictly limited to work-related issues. The inclusion of even minor non-workplace-related clauses (such as dues check-off) can render a CBA unenforceable. In response, many unions and employers are using <b>side</b> <b>letters</b> to reach agreement on non-workplace-related matters, and not registering these side-letters with the federal government—relying on common law to enforce the <b>side</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The sugar <b>side</b> <b>letter</b> {{was added}} to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in last minute {{negotiations}} between the Clinton Administration and the Mexican Government before the Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 103-182). It altered NAFTA’s initial sugar provisions by adding one additional factor to the formula to be used to determine how much sugar Mexico could export to the United States through 2008. Mexican access to the U.S. market was initially set to be equal to the amount of its net sugar surplus (sugar production minus sugar consumption), subject to a maximum of 25000 t over the 1995-2001 period and a maximum of 250,000 metric tons in 2001-2008. The <b>side</b> <b>letter</b> changed this definition to add Mexican consumption of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to the [...] "net production surplus" [...] definition. This change effectively lowers the amount of sugar that Mexico can sell to the U.S. market.|$|E

50|$|The {{range of}} issues side letters covers is wide. In some cases, side letters have driven {{national}} labor law policy.

She has been a democratic state, standing for freedom in self-defence[...] [...] and largely on our <b>side.</b> <b>letter</b> to Foreign Secretary Anthony Edenin 1944 From 1943 Switzerland stopped American and British aircraft, mainly bombers, overflying Switzerland during the Second World War. On numerous occasions during the war, Allied aircraft trespassed on Swiss airspace; mostly damaged Allied bombers returning from raids over Italy and Germany whose crews preferred internment by the Swiss to becoming prisoners of war. Over a hundred Allied aircraft crews were interned and placed in ski resorts which were left abandoned {{due to the lack of}} tourists after the outbreak of war. They were to be held in there until the war had ended. At least 940 American airmen attempted to escape into France after the invasion of Normandy, but Swiss authorities intercepted 183 internees. Over 160 of these airmen were incarcerated in a Swiss prison camp known as Wauwilermoos, which was located near Lucerne and commanded by André Béguin, a pro-Nazi Swiss officer. The American internees remained in Wauwilermoos until November 1944 when the U.S. State Department lodged protests against the Swiss government and eventually secured their release.Switzerland was surrounded by Axis-controlled territory, this meant that they also suffered from Allied bombings during the war - an example of this would be when Schaffhausen was accidentally bombed by American planes on April 1, 1944, the town was mistaken for Ludwigshafen am Rhein, a German town 284 kilometres away.|$|E
40|$|A side {{agreement}} to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) enables Mexico to ship more duty-free sugar to the United States than under the pre- 1994 restrictive country-specific, tariff-rate quota (TRQ) policy. But U. S. and Mexican negotiators disagree {{over the issue}} of exactly how much sugar Mexico can actually export to the U. S. under the NAFTA {{side agreement}}. Disagreement focuses on which version of the NAFTA side agreement governs this issue. The U. S. argues that a 1993 <b>side</b> <b>letter</b> limits Mexican sugar exports to the U. S. to 250, 000 MT. In contrast, Mexico insists it is entitled to ship all of its surplus sugar, currently 600, 000 MT, to U. S. Consequently, Mexico has asked for a dispute-settlement panel to resolve the question under NAFTA. Three TRQ liberalization scenarios were simulated to show the possible policy implications. The simulation results report that, due to the sugar TRQ liberalization with Mexico, the net U. S. social welfare increases but U. S. producers lose. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
