40|$|Special Paperpg. 109 The {{symmetrical}} seal {{offers a}} significant advancement in <b>seal</b> design <b>to</b> pump manufacturers and users {{it is the}} first alternative design <b>to</b> complex <b>seal</b> arrangements which are required to fit a stuffing box designed for packing. Today, with more demands being made on tighter leakage control and simplified installation, the transition is being made from a conventional stuffing box to a self-contained package seal. The concept of a package seal is not new and dates back to {{the early days of the}} pipeline industry when they were <b>supplied</b> <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> split case pumps. What is new is the bolt-on feature of the symmetrical seal, freeing the seal design from the space required for packing. This freedom allows the <b>seal</b> manufacturers <b>to</b> include such <b>sealing</b> features like upstream pumping, when required...|$|R

A seal layer is formed along an edge of a porous gas distribution plate by impregnating the pores in the layer with a material adapted <b>to</b> provide a <b>seal</b> which is operative dry or when wetted by an electrolyte of a fuel cell.

50|$|The {{concept of}} TRAC {{was to put}} teams of drivers, {{particularly}} 8-12 two-driver teams, in identically prepared cars that {{were said to be}} similar to the muscle cars produced by Detroit. Some of the cars that were scheduled to compete included the Chevrolet Corvette, the Dodge Viper, and the Ford Mustang. All entries were to be equipped with Riley & Scott-designed chassis and fuel-injected V8 engines <b>supplied</b> and <b>sealed</b> (<b>to</b> prevent tampering) by a designated vendor. The race tracks planned were primarily ovals with capacities of at least 50,000 people.|$|R
50|$|When the {{solenoid valve}} is {{energized}} {{the air in}} front of the bolt vents, allowing the bias <b>supplied</b> <b>to</b> the rear of the bolt to move it forward. When the bolt has moved forward enough <b>to</b> <b>seal</b> the breech, the pin unseals from the powertube it rides in, and air is vented through the bolt to the ball, firing it. When the solenoid valve is de-energized, air is again <b>supplied</b> <b>to</b> the front of the bolt to return it.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{is presented to}} predict the oil film thickness in an axial sealing contact based on grease properties and operating conditions. It is assumed that {{a small amount of}} grease will form an oil reservoir on the rotating part and slowly <b>supply</b> oil <b>to</b> the <b>sealing</b> contact. The oil bleed model from a previous study is implemented and oil loss due to centrifugal forces and the seal pumping action are taken into account. The results show that, depending on the operating conditions, an oil film is present in the sealing contact for a certain period of time. The oil film thickness decreases in time due to the decreasing oil supply from the grease reservoir and oil loss from the contact due <b>to</b> centrifugal forces. <b>Seal</b> pumping has only a small effect and the seal material and geometry are therefore not important for the predicted time until the mixed lubrication regime is reached. This time depends on the oil viscosity, rotational speed, and seal contact radius and scales with the η /(n 2 ·ds) parameter. The volumetric size of the grease reservoir also has a large impact on maintaining the film thickness in time...|$|R
50|$|THE KING'S OWN WHISKY, {{distilled}} expressly {{for the use}} of his Majesty at Fraser's Royal Brackla Distillery, Inverness, {{is perhaps}} the only malt spirit which proves alike congenial to the palate and constitution of connaisseurs of every country. It is peat-flavoured, but far from rank - strong, but not fiery, and produces the most exquisite Punch or Toddy. As consignees, we offer the KING'S OWN WHISKY to the Trade at the mere commission of the invoice price; and to enable private families to detect spurious fabrication, which may be imposed upon them, we undertake on all occasions to draw this fine spirit from the original Highland puncheons, at 20s per imperial gallon; to bottle it at 44s per dozen, bottles inclusive, or (for more general accommodation) <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> single <b>sealed</b> bottles at 3s 9d each. Orders by post or otherwise, will meet immediate attention from HENRY BRETT and CO., Wine and Brandy Merchants, No 139. Holborn-bars.|$|R

40|$|Turbine blade {{components}} in an engine are typically designed with gaps between parts due to manufacturing, assembly, and operational considerations. Coolant is provided to these gaps {{to limit the}} ingestion of hot combustion gases. The interaction of the gaps, their leakage flows, and the complex vortical flow at the endwall of a turbine blade can significantly impact endwall heat transfer coefficients {{and the effectiveness of}} the leakage flow in providing localized cooling. In particular, a platform gap through the passage, representing the mating interface between adjacent blades in a wheel, has been shown to have a significant effect. Other important turbine blade features present in the engine environment are non-axisymmetric contouring of the endwall, and an upstream rim seal with a gaspath cavity, which can reduce and increase endwall vortical flow, respectively. To understand the platform gap leakage effect in this environment, measurements of endwall heat transfer and film cooling effectiveness were performed in a scaled blade cascade with a non-axisymmetric contour in the passage. A rim seal with a cavity, representing the overlap interface between a stator and rotor, was included upstream of the blades and a nominal purge flowrate of 0. 75 % of the mainstream was <b>supplied</b> <b>to</b> the rim <b>seal.</b> Results indicated that endwall heat transfer coefficients increased as platform gap net leakage increased from 0 % to 0. 6 % of the mainstream flowrate, but net heat flux to the endwall was reduced due to high cooling effectiveness of the leakage flow...|$|R
