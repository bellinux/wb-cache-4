The circuit approach {{is based on an}} equivalent representation of the FSSs with series or <b>shunt</b> <b>connections</b> of inductances and capacitances. Dense non-resonant periodic surfaces (i. e. : grid or patch arrays) can be analyzed analytically by computing the values of inductors or capacitors via the homogenization theory. As the lattice period increases with respect to the operating wavelength or the element shape becomes resonant, a fully analytical circuital approach fails, in particular, in the presence of thin substrates. However, simple circuit approaches can still be employed by deriving lumped parameters values via a quick pre-processing and then generalizing them. The results are accurate up to the resonant frequency region of the element. By including an additional lumped element it is possible, taking into account the effect of the first high order Floquet harmonic. The multi-mode formulation is also able to catch the highly non-linear response of FSS screens in the grating lobe region provided that the current profile of the element does not change significantly...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{use of an}} {{intraoperative}} shunt is {{an established}} technique used to reduce the ischemic time after acute arterial obstruction or {{in the prevention of}} hypoperfusion due to complex open vascular or endovascular operative procedures. To date, described methods of temporary extremity blood perfusion have required open surgical techniques. MethodsAn endovascular shunt (ES) was formed by connecting two introducer sheaths to each other, one positioned proximal and one distal to an arterial obstruction. The ES method was used in patients considered to be at high risk for prolonged lower limb ischemia in conjunction with a vascular procedure and where shunt creation by open surgical technique was not considered to be a practical alternative. The flow capacity of the ES was defined in a desktop model. ResultsThe ES method was used clinically in 15 vascular interventions including eight complex endovascular aortic procedures, three open aortic operations, and four procedures for acute limb ischemia. The shunts were functional in all patients and there were no shunt occlusions. Postoperatively, there were no evident clinical reperfusion injuries. Flow analysis revealed that the ES had a flow capacity of 73 % flow capacity compared to a Pruitt-Inahara shunt.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{assessment}} of voltage drop in radial feeders {{is an important}} element in the process of network design and planning. This task is however not straight forward as the operation of modern power systems is highly influenced by a variety of uncertain and random variables such as stochasticity in load demand and power generation from renewable energy resources. Classic deterministic methods which model load demand and generation with fixed mean values consequently turn out to be inadequate and inaccurate tools for the analysis of power flow in the uncertainty-filled system. Statistically based methods become more suitable for such a task as they account for input variable uncertainties in their calculation of load flow. In the South African context, the Herman Beta algorithm, a probabilistic load flow tool developed by Herman et al. was adopted as the method for voltage assessment in Low Voltage (LV) network. The method was shown to have significant advantages compared with many other probabilistic methods for LV feeders, as investigated by Sellick and Gaunt. Its performance with regards to speed and accuracy is superior to deterministic, numeric probabilistic and other analytical probabilistic methods. The evolving connections of smaller generators, referred to as Distributed Generators (DGs), to the utility grid inspired the extension of the HB algorithm to active LV distribution networks. The HB algorithm was however formulated specifically for LV feeders. The assumptions of purely resistive feeders and unity power factor loads make it unsuitable for the Medium Voltage (MV) distribution network. In South Africa, deterministic methods are still being used for network design in MV distribution networks. This means that the drawbacks of such methods, for example inaccuracy and computational burden with large systems, are characteristic of the quality of network design in MV feeders. The performance of the HB algorithm together with the advantages and superiority of load modelling using the Beta probability density function (Beta pdf) suggested that modifying the input parameters could allow the HB algorithm to be used for voltage calculations on MV networks. This work therefore involves the adaptation of the way the HB algorithm is used, to make it suitable for voltage calculations on MV feeders. The HB algorithm for LV feeders is firstly analysed, coded into MATLAB, tested and then validated. Following this, the input parameters for feeder impedance and load current are modified to include the effects of reactance and non-unity power factor loads, using approximate modelling techniques. For reactance, the modulus or absolute value of the complex impedance is used in place of the resistance, to compensate for the line reactance. The load current is adjusted by inflating it by the power factor. The results of calculations with the HB algorithm are tested against a Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) solution of the feeder with an accurate model (full representation of feeder impedance and load power factor). The approach is extended to include <b>shunt</b> capacitor <b>connections</b> and DG in voltage calculations using the HB algorithm and testing the results with MCS. The outcomes of this research are that the approach of adjusting the input parameters of line resistance and load current significantly improves the accuracy of calculations using the HB algorithm for MV feeders. Comparison with the results of MC simulations indicates that the error of voltage calculations on MV feeders will be less than 2 % of the 'accurate probabilistic value'. However, {{it is not possible to}} predict the error for a particular application...|$|R

The magnetic arm-switching technique ensures equivalent series or <b>shunt</b> <b>connection</b> between the inverters. In normal grid mode (stabiliser mode), the series inverter is used for series voltage correction and the shunt one for current correction.

The operation of the inverters in parallel is ensured by the magnetic arm-switching technique. This study also includes modelling of the magnetic circuit. A graphical technique called bond graph is used to model the system. In this model, the magnetic circuit is represented in terms of gyrator-capacitors.
