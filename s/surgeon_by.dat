He coached David Nepomuceno—the country's first Olympian in 1928—and was the Filipino head of delegation for the 1936 Berlin Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, in A los pies de Venus, {{writes that}} the then Bishop of Santa María had Borgia {{expelled}} from the church because his own father had died after being imprisoned under Alexander VI. It was held for many years that the bones were lost, although in fact local tradition continued to mark their place quite accurately and folklore sprung up around Borgia's death and ghost. The bones were in fact dug up twice and reburied once by historians (both local and international—the first dig in 1886 involved the French historian Charles Yriarte, who also published works on the Borgias) seeking the resting place of the infamous Cesare Borgia. After Borgia was unearthed {{for the second time}} in 1945 his bones were taken for a rather lengthy forensic examination by Victoriano Juaristi, a <b>surgeon</b> <b>by</b> trade and Borgia aficionado, and the tests concurred with the preliminary ones carried out in the 19th century. There was evidence that the bones belonged to Borgia.|$|E

Photographs of him as a surgeon and soldier (prisoner of war) are held in the University of Manchester Library Image Collections. After he retired, he devoted his time to researching early cricket history and {{travelled}} all over England to visit local libraries. He collected a mass of cricket historiana from old newspapers and dutifully noted every reference he could find relating to 18th century cricket. His researches were consolidated in his two classic books: Fresh Light on Eighteenth Century Cricket (1935) and Fresh Light on Pre-Victorian Cricket (1937).|$|E

25|$|Finding {{his youth}} limited his influence, and {{dissatisfied}} with urban life, Reed joined the U.S. Army Medical Corps. This allowed him both professional opportunities and modest financial security {{to establish and}} support a family. After Reed passed a grueling thirty-hour examination in 1875, the army medical corps enlisted him as an assistant <b>surgeon.</b> <b>By</b> this time, two of his brothers were working in Kansas, and Walter soon was assigned postings in the American West. Over the next sixteen years, the Army assigned the career officer to different outposts, where he was responsible not only for American military and their dependents, but also various aboriginal American tribes, at one point looking after several hundred Apaches, including Geronimo. Reed noticed the devastation epidemics could wreak and maintained his concerns about sanitary conditions. During {{one of his last}} tours, he completed advanced coursework in pathology and bacteriology in the Johns Hopkins University Hospital Pathology Laboratory.|$|E

The Edinburgh Review, in an article professing to examine the statements both of Cooper's work and of The History of the English Navy, written by Mr. James, a <b>surgeon</b> <b>by</b> profession, made a violent attack upon the American historian. Unfortunately, it took James's narrative as its sole guide, and followed it implicitly. Cooper replied in the Democratic Review for January, 1840, and by a masterly analysis of his statements, convicting James of self-contradiction in almost every particular in which he differed from himself, refuted both James and the reviewer. It was a refutation which admitted of no rejoinder.|$|E
6000|$|... 10. I {{have been}} visiting Lady Worsley and Mrs. Barton today, and dined soberly {{with my friend}} Lewis. The Dauphin is dead of an apoplexy; I wish he had lived till the {{finishing}} of this letter, {{that it might be}} news to you. Duncombe,(5) the rich alderman, died to-day, and I hear has left the Duke of Argyle, who married his niece, two hundred thousand pounds; I hope it is true, for I love that Duke mightily. I writ this evening to the Archbishop of Dublin, about what I told you; and then went to take leave of poor Mrs. St. John, who gave me strict charge {{to take care of the}} Secretary in her absence; said she had none to trust but me; and the poor creature's tears came fresh in her eyes. Before we took leave, I was drawn in by the other ladies and Sir John Stanley to raffle for a fan, with a pox; it was four guineas, and we put in seven shillings apiece, several raffling for absent people; but I lost, and so missed an opportunity of showing my gallantry to Mrs. St. John, whom I designed to have presented it to if I had won. Is Dilly(6) gone to the Bath? His face will whizz in the water; I suppose he will write to us from thence, and will take London in his way back.--The rabble will say, [...] "There goes a drunken parson"; and, which is worse, they will say true. Oh, but you must know I carried Ford to dine with Mr. St. John last Sunday, that he may brag, when he goes back, of dining with a Secretary of State. The Secretary and I went away early, and left him drinking with the rest, and he told me that two or three of them were drunk. They talk of great promotions to be made; that Mr. Harley is to be Lord Treasurer, and Lord Poulett(7) Master of the Horse, etc., but they are only conjecture. The Speaker is to make Mr. Harley a compliment the first time he comes into the House, which I hope will be in a week. He has had an ill <b>surgeon,</b> <b>by</b> the caprice of that puppy Dr. Radcliffe, which has kept him back so long; and yesterday he got a cold, but is better to-day.--What! I think I am stark mad, to write so much in one day to little saucy MD; here is a deal of stuff, indeed! can't you bid those little dear rogues good-night, and let them go sleep, Mr. Presto? When your tongue runs there's no ho with you, pray.|$|E
