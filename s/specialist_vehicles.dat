2500|$|For {{several weeks}} after 15 September, the Germans were puzzled about the new weapon, being unable to {{distinguish}} between accurate reports of their shape and size and the more fanciful accounts. The existence {{of male and female}} tanks apparently led Germans to believe that there were a mass of <b>specialist</b> <b>vehicles</b> and sight of a knocked-out tank north of Flers, caused an officer to conclude that it had a single, wide caterpillar track, which caused much confusion to military intelligence. On 28 September, an intelligence officer included the report along with an accurate description and that much was still uncertain about how the vehicles were built, how many types there were or how big. Bavarian gunners taken prisoner reported that the tanks were a surprise and that the [...] "Spitzgeschoss mit Kern" [...] ( [...] S.m.K. pointed projectile with core) bullets issued earlier had not been intended for anti-tank fire. The tanks that did confront German and Bavarian troops caused panic and prisoners said that it was not war but butchery. Later in the month, a German intelligence officer wrote that only time would tell if the new weapon was of any value.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{following}} successful trials by the Australian Defence Force of the TD5 Landrover, the British MOD {{purchased a}} small fleet of TD5 Landrover Defender 110s for its [...] "Green Fleet" [...] between 2000 and 2002. These were specially converted for the MOD by Landrover <b>Specialist</b> <b>Vehicles.</b> They were plated with UK military registration plates and painted IRR green. Most of these vehicles were {{deployed in the}} Falklands as troop carriers and communications vehicles {{for use by the}} Royal Marines and UK Special Forces. A small number of TD5 Defender 110s were also ordered for the Royal Navy. These were painted navy blue and deployed to the Falklands. Of these Royal Navy vehicles a few were later re-painted IRR green and reassigned to Royal Marines and SBS use. The more powerful TD5 engine, which was capable of being re-mapped up to around 200 Bhp was ideally suited to the rugged terrain of the Falklands and for towing trailers. The majority of these Falkland vehicles were sold off to Military Motors Ltd by the MOD in 2013. The troop carriers had eight passenger seats in the rear and two rear side windows each side for extra visibility. Visually, these UK military troop carrier TD5 Defenders looked similar to the ones used by the Australian Defence Force except that the UK ones were plain IRR green.|$|E
