50|$|In May 2017, the Ministry of Culture {{proposed}} two scenarios on {{what the}} terrestrial television infrastructure in Denmark could look like after 3 April 2020 when Boxer's gatekeeper rights expire, and the 700 Mhz band switches from TV to mobile broadband.In scenario A, all 5 UHF multiplexes and the single VHF multiplex would {{be given to the}} gatekeeper, with the condition of broadcasting free-to-air channels from DR and TV 2.In <b>scenario</b> <b>B,</b> a single UHF multiplex would be given to Digi-TV (the joint-venture between DR and TV 2) to be used for free-to-air broadcasting.

50|$|In {{the first}} {{situation}} (Scenario A), the jump is formed {{right at the}} apron, as it would {{if there was no}} downstream control. However, in the next scenario (<b>Scenario</b> <b>B),</b> the downstream tailwater depth has some control imposed on it such that it is less than the conjugate to y1. In this case, the jump travels downstream and initiates at a point where the upstream flow depth (y1’) has risen to the conjugate of the new downstream tailwater depth (yd). This rise from y1 to y1’ is caused by frictional resistance in the channel; and velocity decrease, the depth increase. In this image, y1’ and y2’ represent the conjugate depths of the hydraulic jump where y2’ assumes the depth of yd. In contrast, in the third setup (Scenario C), there is a downstream control that forces the tailwater elevation to a depth above the original conjugate depth. Here, yd is greater than the required depth so the jump is pushed upstream. In this scenario, the sluice gate inhibits the movement of the jump upstream so that the upstream conjugate cannot be attained. This leads to a situation known as a submerged or drowned hydraulic jump. These scenarios demonstrate how influential the role of tailwater is to jump formation and location.|$|E
40|$|Thinning {{scenarios}} {{were developed}} for Gmelina arborea plantations in south-western Nigeria using density management diagram. Data {{were collected from}} even-aged plantations of 5 to 25 years. The youngest stand had well-developed crown canopies, indicating that canopy closure occurred at a younger age. Density (number of trees ha- 1) decreased with increase in tree size. Density management diagram, with upper and lower growing stock lines, was developed. With references to these lines, three thinning <b>scenarios</b> A (no-thinning), <b>B</b> (moderate thinning) and C (heavy thinning) were developed. At the end of 20 years rotation, volume production under <b>scenarios</b> A, <b>B</b> and C would be 1050. 3, 784. 2 and 751. 7 m 3 ha- 1, respectively while mean diameter would be 29. 8, 49. 6 and 47. 0 cm, respectively. This result indicates that Gmelina would react strongly to thinning by way of diameter increase, which only applies if thinning commences at early ages.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to compare runoff and soil loss amounts observed in an experimental watershed with those values simulated by RUSLE and WEPP models. The watershed has sandy-clay-loam soil covered with pasture. Runoff and soil loss measured were very low, due to high infiltration rate and vegetable covering conditions. In WEPP simulations two values were used for the hydraulic conductivity (K 0) : a measured in field (scenario A) and another calculated using WEPP internal procedures (<b>scenario</b> <b>B).</b> The runoff calculated by WEPP in scenario A was very close to measured value. In <b>scenario</b> <b>B</b> the annual runoff amount was over-predicted. RUSLE model simulated a very low value of soil loss and, therefore, close to the field observed. WEPP, in <b>scenario</b> <b>B,</b> also simulated a small soil loss, although greater than that one simulated by RUSLE. In scenario A, WEPP simulated soil loss equal to zero, that is close to the observed value. Both models satisfactorily estimated soil loss for the analyzed conditions, although RUSLE performed better. In WEPP, the water loss was simulated better using measured K 0, suggesting that WEPP internal procedures should be carefully used for Brazilian conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{proposed}} to introduce general messenger-matter interactions in the deflected anomaly mediated SUSY breaking scenario {{to explain the}} g_μ- 2 anomaly. Scenarios with complete or incomplete GUT multiplet messengers are discussed, respectively. The introduction of incomplete GUT mulitiplets can be advantageous in various aspects. We found that the g_μ- 2 anomaly can be solved in both scenarios under current constraints including the gluino mass bounds, while the scenarios with incomplete GUT representation messengers are more favored by the g_μ- 2 data. We {{also found that the}} gluino is upper bounded by about 2. 5 TeV (2. 0 TeV) in Scenario A and 3. 0 TeV (2. 7 TeV) in <b>Scenario</b> <b>B</b> if the generalized deflected AMSB scenarios are used to fully account for the g_μ- 2 anomaly at 3 σ (2 σ) level.
