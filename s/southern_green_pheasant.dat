50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> (P. versicolor) is very similar, and {{hybridization}} {{often makes}} {{the identity of}} individual birds difficult to determine. <b>Green</b> <b>pheasant</b> males on average have a shorter tail than the common pheasant and have darker plumage that is uniformly bottle-green on the breast and belly; they always lack a neck ring. <b>Green</b> <b>pheasant</b> females are darker, with many black dots on the breast and belly.|$|R
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Phasianus versicolor), {{also known}} as Japanese <b>green</b> <b>pheasant,</b> is native to the Japanese archipelago, {{to which it is}} endemic. It was {{formerly}} considered to be a subspecies of the common pheasant. It is the national bird of Japan.|$|R

50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> (P. versicolor) of Japan is {{sometimes}} considered a subspecies {{of the common}} pheasant. Though the species produce fertile hybrids wherever they coexist, this is simply a typical feature among fowl (Galloanseres), in which postzygotic isolating mechanisms are slight compared to most other birds. The species apparently have somewhat different ecological requirements and at least in its typical habitat, the <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> outcompetes the common pheasant. The introduction of the latter to Japan has therefore largely failed.|$|R

50|$|The three {{subspecies}} on the Japanese {{islands are}} usually {{treated as a}} distinct species, the <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> (P. versicolor), but some consider the Japanese birds {{to be part of}} the common pheasant complex, making thirty-three subspecies in total.|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} common and {{widespread}} throughout its native range. It often frequents farmlands and human settlements. The introduced populations on Hawaii are stable. Populations in Western Europe have perhaps bred with the Common Pheasants {{for a number}} of years and no pure <b>Green</b> <b>Pheasants</b> exist there any longer. This species has been crossed with the Common Pheasants on some game farms in North America and released.|$|R
50|$|Before 28 May 2008, {{the modern}} emblem {{was preceded by}} a coat of arms, {{generally}} consisting of a white cow, a <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Himalayan monal), two Gurkha soldiers (one carrying a kukri and a bow, {{and the other a}} rifle), peaks of the Himalayas, two crossed Nepalese flags and kukris, the footprints of Gorakhnath (the guardian deity of the Gurkhas) and the royal headress.

5000|$|Over 600 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Japan and more than 250 of these breed. A number of birds are endemic including the Japanese woodpecker (Picus awokera), copper pheasant (Syrmaticus soemmerringii) and Japan's national bird, the <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Phasianus versicolor). Several species are unique to the smaller islands including the Okinawa rail (Gallirallus okinawae), Izu thrush (Turdus celaenops) and Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron familiare [...] ). Most of the non-endemic birds are shared with China but a few originate in Siberia or south-east Asia.|$|R

The 夜 within the 鵺 character is phonetic component and thus does not carry a meaning with it. The character 鵼 (kou or kuu) is determined {{to be a kind}} of strange bird. Due to the use of Man'yōgana, the historical spelling is known to have been nuye. At this early time, although, it had a different semantic meaning. It referred to a bird known as White's thrush.|$|R

40|$|Since the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident, {{monitoring}} of tissues from hunted game animals ensures {{compliance with the}} standard food limits for radionuclides in Japan. We quantified the transfer of 137 Cs from contaminated land to game animals using the Aggregated transfer factor (Tag = activity concentration in meat [Bq kg– 1 fw]/amount in soil [Bq m– 2]) of 137 Cs for Asian black bear, wild boar, sika deer, <b>green</b> <b>pheasant,</b> copper pheasant and wild duck, collected between 2011 and 2015. Open data sources were used from Fukushima, Miyagi, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures. Our initially compiled data showed that the maximum reported 137 Cs activity concentration in wild boar after the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident were lower than those reported after the Chernobyl accident. The geometric mean Tag values (m 2 kg– 1 fw) of 137 Cs in 2015 for Asian black bear, wild boar, sika deer and copper pheasant were similar (1. 9 – 5. 1) × 10 – 3 while those for <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> and wild duck were about 1 order of magnitude lower at (1. 0 – 2. 2) × 10 – 4. Effective half-lives were 1. 2 – 6. 9 y except for sika deer and copper pheasant where no decreases were found. In contrast to the Chernobyl accident, no seasonal change occurred in the meat 137 Cs activity concentrations of the wild animals during the study period...|$|R
50|$|Migratory and oceanic {{species that}} breed {{on the islands}} include such as Laysan albatross, Black-winged stilt, tuna, {{skipjack}} tuna, Japanese Spanish mackerel, marlin, manta rays, Japanese spiny lobster, sea turtles, dolphins and Humpback whales. Among Ryukyu Islands, <b>green</b> <b>pheasant</b> is only present on Daitō Islands followed by corals and coral fish that are rare {{in the rest of}} the archipelago most notably Chaetodon auripes which is occasionally regarded as endemic to the islands and Hemitaurichthys thompsoni was only previously recorded in Bonin Islands. Black Jacks and knifejaws that have become rarer in Japanese waters still occur as well.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} colour {{forms of the}} male common pheasant, ranging in colour from nearly white to almost black in some melanistic examples. These are due to captive {{breeding}} and hybridization between subspecies and with the <b>green</b> <b>pheasant,</b> reinforced by continual releases of stock from varying sources to the wild. For example, the [...] "ring-necked pheasants" [...] common in Europe, North America and Australia do not pertain to any specific taxon, they rather represent a stereotyped hybrid swarm. Body weight can range from 0.5 to 3 kg, with males averaging 1.2 kg and females averaging 0.9 kg.|$|R
50|$|Nezara viridula, {{commonly}} known as the <b>southern</b> <b>green</b> stink bug (USA), <b>Southern</b> <b>green</b> shield bug (UK) or green vegetable bug (Australia and New Zealand), is a plant-feeding stink bug.
