5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 5 (L5) or sacral <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve,</b> is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} main plexuses {{formed by the}} ventral rami:the {{cervical}} plexus contains ventral rami from <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> C1-C4. Branches of thecervical plexus, which include the phrenic nerve, innervate muscles of the neck, the diaphragm, and theskin of the neck and upper chest.The brachial plexus contains ventral rami from <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> C5-T1. This plexus innervatesthe pectoral girdle and upper limb.The lumbar plexus contains ventral rami from <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> L1-L4. The sacral plexus contains ventralrami from <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves</b> L4-S4. The lumbar and sacral plexuses innervate the pelvic girdle and lowerlimbs.|$|R

40|$|The {{sources of}} {{innervation}} of neuromuscular spindles in sternomastoid and trapezius {{have been investigated}} in rats and mice, by degeneration experiments. The entire motor supply, both extrafusal and intrafusal, to both muscles, was from the <b>spinal</b> accessory <b>nerve.</b> The sensory supply to the spindles in sternomastoid and rostral trapezius was from cervical <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves,</b> and {{to those in the}} caudal trapezius was from thoracic <b>spinal</b> <b>nerves...</b>|$|R
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E

25|$|Epidural {{anesthesia}} is an LA {{injected into}} the epidural space, where it acts primarily on the <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> roots; depending {{on the site of}} injection and the volume injected, the anesthetized area varies from limited areas of the abdomen or chest to large regions of the body.|$|E
25|$|Cancer of {{the kidneys}} and spleen {{produces}} less pain than that caused by liver tumor– kidney tumors eliciting pain only once the organ {{has been almost}} totally destroyed and the cancer has invaded the surrounding tissue or adjacent pelvis. Pressure on the kidney or ureter from a tumor outside the kidney can cause extreme flank pain. Local recurrence of cancer after the removal of a kidney can cause pain in the lumbar back, or L1 or L2 <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> pain in the groin or upper thigh, accompanied by weakness and numbness of the iliopsoas muscle, exacerbated by activity.|$|E
25|$|MPS IV, Morquio syndrome, is {{estimated}} to occur in 1 in 700,000 births. Its two subtypes result from the missing or deficient enzymes N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) (Type A) or beta-galactosidase (Type B) needed {{to break down the}} keratan sulfate sugar chain. Clinical features are similar in both types but appear milder in Morquio Type B. Onset is between ages 1 and 3. Neurological complications include <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> and nerve root compression resulting from extreme, progressive skeletal changes, particularly in the ribs and chest; conductive and/or neurosensitive loss of hearing and clouded corneas. Intelligence is normal unless hydrocephalus develops and is not treated.|$|E

25|$|About {{three percent}} of cancer {{patients}} experience spinal cord compression, usually from expansion of the vertebral body or pedicle (fig. 1) due to metastasis, sometimes involving collapse of the vertebral body. Occasionally compression is caused by nonvertebral metastasis adjacent to the spinal cord. Compression of the long tracts of the cord itself produces funicular pain and compression of a <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> root (fig. 5) produces radicular pain. Seventy percent of cases involve the thoracic, 20 percent the lumbar, and 10 percent the cervical spine; and about 20 percent of cases involve multiple sites of compression. The nature of the pain depends on {{the location of the}} compression.|$|E
25|$|The {{arterial}} blood {{supply of the}} breast has medial and lateral vascular components; it is supplied with blood by the internal mammary artery (from the medial aspect), the lateral thoracic artery (from the lateral aspect), and the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th intercostal perforating arteries. Drainage of venous blood from the breast is by the superficial vein system under the dermis, and by the deep vein system parallel to the artery system. The primary lymph drainage system is the retromammary lymph plexus in the pectoral fascia. Sensation in the breast is established by the peripheral nervous system innervation of the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the 4th, 5th, and 6th intercostal nerves, and thoracic <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 4 (T4 nerve) innervates and supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
25|$|The {{breasts are}} apocrine glands that produce milk for the feeding of infant children; each breast has a nipple within an areola (nipple-areola complex, NAC), the skin color of which varies from pink to dark brown, and has sebaceous glands. Within the mammary gland, the lactiferous ducts produce breast milk, and are {{distributed}} throughout the breast, with two-thirds of the tissue within 30mm of {{the base of the}} nipple. In each breast, 4–18 lactiferous ducts drain to the nipple; the glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in lactating women, and to 1:1 in non-lactating women; besides milk glands, the breast is composed of connective tissue (collagen, elastin), adipose tissue (white fat), and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. The peripheral nervous system innervation of the breast is by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth, fifth, and sixth intercostal nerves, while the thoracic <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 4 (T4) innervating the dermatomic area supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E

25|$|The breast is an {{apocrine gland}} that {{produces}} the milk used to feed an infant. The nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout {{the body of the}} breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (collagen, elastin), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal nerves. The T-4 nerve (Thoracic <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> 4), which innervates the dermatomic area, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
500|$|Clare Louise Burzynski {{was born}} in Newcastle, New South Wales, on 11 August 1986, the {{daughter}} of Eddie and Barbara Burzynski. She has an older sister, Lauren.

500|$|The {{outer layer}} of the sheath {{surrounding}} the spinal cord is called the dura mater. Between this and the surrounding vertebrae is the epidural space filled with connective tissue, fat and blood vessels and crossed by the <b>spinal</b> <b>nerve</b> roots. A long-term epidural catheter may be inserted into this space for three to six months, to deliver anesthetics or analgesics. The line carrying the drug may be threaded under the skin to emerge {{at the front of}} the person, a process called [...] "tunneling", recommended with long-term use to reduce the chance of any infection at the exit site reaching the epidural space.|$|E
