5|$|The team flew to Miami for the season's {{penultimate}} series. Despite Hamels' quality {{start in}} game one, the Phillies were shut out 2–0.

5|$|The team's strong stretch did not continue, however, as the Phillies {{entered the}} second period of interleague play with five {{consecutive}} series against the American League East.

The team showed promise in the first game of their World Series rematch <b>series</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Tampa Bay Rays, winning 10–1, but were defeated in the last two games of the series and lost a fourth straight game to Toronto on June 26. However, the Phillies were able to exact a modicum of revenge for both their 1993 World Series defeat and the first series sweep by the Jays by winning the last two games. Happ played the role of stopper by pitching his first career complete game shutout, and Moyer followed by earning his 252nd victory in the following game. To close the month, the Phillies lost the opener of their next <b>series</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Braves to finish the month with a 10–16 record.|$|E
