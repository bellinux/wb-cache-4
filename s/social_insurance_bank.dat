40|$|The {{drug use}} on Curacao was {{evaluated}} {{with the help}} of the prescription forms of twelve community pharmacies at Curacao over a period of three months, The emphasis of the study was on three therapeutic groups: the systemic antibiotics, the psycholeptics and the anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs. Within the group of systemic antibiotics broad-spectrum antibiotics were very frequently prescribed compared with the small-spectrum penicillins. The consumption of psycholeptics, particularly benzodiazepines, on Curacao is remarkably low in comparison with drug utilization data of Denmark and the Netherlands. In contrast, the number of defined daily doses per 1, 000 persons per day of antirheumatic drugs is higher compared with data from these two countries. Within the analysed groups, large differences occur between the two most important kinds of insurance, i. c., the poor people (PP) and <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>bank</b> (SVB) insurance. The PP-insured patients consume in the case of antibiotics and antirheumatic drugs almost twice as many and in the case of psycholeptics even five times as many as the SVB-insured patients do.

40|$|Third-country {{nationals}} can use regulation 1231 / 10 {{to invoke}} regulation 883 / 04, However, the territorial limitation imposed by regulation 1231 / 10 still limits third-country nationals. The main {{issue is that}} regulation 1231 / 10 is restricted to EU territory. Outside of the EU, any requirement regarding equal treatment in accordance with regulation 1231 / 10 is not applicable. Decision 3 / 80, the European Convention on Social Security, the Dutch-Turkish social security treaty and ILO Treaty 118 also consider facts outside of the EU, as demonstrated by figures of the Employee Insurance Agency and <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Bank.</b> Relevant facts outside of the EU include for example the periods of time third-country nationals {{lived and worked in}} third countries and the export of benefits to these countries. My proposal to conclude new treaties with third countries on the EU level was discussed {{in the context of the}} four analysed coordination schemes. In the discussion, I have researched what possibilities exist to include the techniques of the involved schemes in treaties with third countries, to address those exact issues faced by third country nationals as a result of the limited territorial scope of regulation 1231 / 10. In addition to facing possible issues because the territorial scope is limited to the EU, third-country nationals also face issues from regulation 1231 / 10 resulting from the requirement that a third-country national must be in a situation which is not confined in all respects within a single EU Member State. We have seen that the analysed coordination schemes do not require the cross-border movement between at least two EU Member States before involved persons can call upon the concerned coordination schemes. With respect to these coordination schemes, it suffices that the involved persons move from one treaty country to another. This is therefore not limited to just EU Member States. There are no relevant objections for cancelling the requirement that third-country nationals as a result of regulation 1231 / 10 must be in a situation which is not confined within a single EU Member State. I have discussed the possible conditions for considering facts outside the EU. These conditions are the following: the nature and level of the benefit, the enforcement of national legislation rules, the demand for reciprocity and preventing a disruption in the labour market. These possible conditions for considering facts outside the EU were inventoried out of the coordination developments with regard to third-country nationals on both a national and EU level. The assessment of my proposal to conclude new treaties to include third countries against the relevant conditions has shown that when it comes to the coordination of social security for third-country nationals, it is possible to create a coordination scheme that is more effective than regulation 1231 / 10. The EU Member States can overcome the few disadvantageous consequences that were discussed in my proposal by establishing further measures. If EU Member States proceed with my proposed expansion, this will therefore not lead to a heavier load on financing their social security systems, and therefore would not have any significant disadvantages for EU Member States...|$|E

30|$|In L County’s {{coal mining}} industry, {{mandatory}} <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> is absent, except for work-related injury insurance. Both the {{employers and employees}} are highly concerned with the latter because work-related injuries are commonplace in the coal mining industry. <b>Social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums are replaced with revenues of the coal mine and wages of the employees. In other words, employees’ wages include <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums that should actually be used for purchasing <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> Based on the income levels in the coal mining industry, each employee should pay 200 – 300 yuan each month for <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> Instead, coal mines save these <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums. The average income of coal mine workers in L County is 3000 – 4000 yuan, and thus, coal mines should pay 500 – 800 yuan each month for each employee’s <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> For employees {{who are in their}} twenties or thirties, in-pocket wages are more valuable than a <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> policy that may only prove valuable in the future. Hence, for both the employers and employees, it is worth circumventing mandatory <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> regulations and breaking the law.

40|$|We examine optimal {{taxation}} and <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> with adverse selection in competitive insurance markets. In a previous literature, {{it has been}} shown that, with perfect <b>insurance</b> markets, <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> improves welfare since it is able to redistribute without creating distortions. This result has been taken as robust to the introduction of adverse selection as this would only provide additional justifications for <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> We show, however, that adverse selection can weaken the case for <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> compared to a situation with perfect markets. Whenever <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> mitigates private underinsurance, it also causes welfare-reducing effects by decreasing precautionary labor supply and hence tax revenue. In addition, adverse selection may reduce the redistributive potential of <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> We illustrate our general results using different equilibrium concepts for the insurance market. Notably, we derive conditions under which a complete renunciation of <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> is optimal and the government only relies on income taxation to achieve its redistributive objectives...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{political}} economy of <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> in a world where individuals differ in both income and risk. <b>Social</b> <b>insurance</b> is financed through distortionary taxation and redistributes across income and risk. Individuals vote on <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> that they can complement with insurance bought on the private market. Private insurance is actuarially fair but suffers from adverse selection, which results in a screening equilibrium with partial coverage. The equilibrium <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> is the result of an electoral competition game where parties maximize the utility of their members. We calculate the equilibrium <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> offered by the two parties as well as their equilibrium membership, and study how the equilibrium outcome is affected by electoral uncertainty, distortions from taxation, risk aversion and the distribution of risk and income.
