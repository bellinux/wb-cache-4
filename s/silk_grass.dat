60|$|The women wore similar robes, though shorter, not {{reaching}} {{below the}} waist; besides which, {{they had a}} kind of petticoat, or fringe, reaching from the waist to the knee, formed of the fibres of cedar bark, broken into strands, or a tissue of <b>silk</b> <b>grass</b> twisted and knotted at the ends. This was the usual dress of the women in summer; should the weather be inclement, they added a vest of skins, similar to the robe.|$|E
60|$|In the evening, {{when all}} were {{gathered}} under {{the roof and}} I had eaten again, I took up the instrument once more, furtively watched by all those half-closed animal eyes, and swept the strings loudly, and sang aloud. I sang an old simple Spanish melody, to which I had put words in their own language--a language with no words not in everyday use, {{in which it is}} so difficult to express feelings out of and above the common. What I had been constructing and practicing all the afternoon sotto voce was a kind of ballad, an extremely simple tale of a poor Indian living alone with his young family in a season of dearth; how day after day he ranged the voiceless woods, to return each evening with nothing but a few withered sour berries in his hand, to find his lean, large-eyed wife still nursing the fire that cooked nothing, and his children crying for food, showing their bones more plainly through their skins every day; and how, without anything miraculous, anything wonderful, happening, that barrenness passed from earth, and the garden once more yielded them pumpkin and maize, and manioc, the wild fruits ripened, and the birds returned, filling the forest with their cries; and so their long hunger was satisfied, and the children grew sleek, and played and laughed in the sunshine; and the wife, no longer brooding over the empty pot, wove a hammock of <b>silk</b> <b>grass,</b> decorated with blue-and-scarlet feathers of the macaw; and in that new hammock the Indian rested long from his labours, smoking endless cigars.|$|E
50|$|Other {{practices}} persisted {{through the}} nineteenth century, including the women making baskets of rushes and <b>silk</b> <b>grass.</b> They decorated them with woven-in life motifs.|$|E

50|$|The grass bagworm (Eurukuttarus confederata) is {{a species}} of bagworm that only eats grass. These bagworms make cases less than two cm in length from <b>silk</b> and <b>grass,</b> {{starting}} out with a green color, but turning brown as the grass ages.|$|R
50|$|Neyraudia reynaudiana, {{commonly}} known as Burma reed, <b>silk</b> reed, cane <b>grass,</b> or false reed, is a tall, perennial, large-plumed grass native to subtropical Asia, but invasive in southern Florida in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to grow tobacco, there was a glut on the market.The directors tried to encourage the planters to grow crops such as <b>silk</b> <b>grass,</b> cotton, sugar cane, pomegranates, figs or juniper berries. However, despite a collapse in prices in 1634, the planters persisted in growing tobacco.Labor on Providence island was originally undertaken by indentured servants from England, although Bell brought some black slaves from Bermuda. Around 1634-1635 the four-year terms of the indentured servants expired, and planters demanded {{the right to use}} slaves in their place. One colonist spoke out against this practice, saying that Christians should not hold slaves. Bell silenced this man on instructions from the Company, so he could not stir up the slaves against their masters.|$|E
5000|$|The pupal stage {{lasts for}} about two weeks, from the {{beginning}} of June onwards, until late July. It is formed inside a loose [...] "nest" [...] of <b>silk</b> and <b>grass</b> that is spun deep inside a tussock of tor grass. Imago begin to emerge in the early middle of July and finish emerging in the middle of September. Typically, they will live for five to ten days—the normal lifespan for a non-hibernating butterfly of the Lulworth's seasonal stage. They fly only in strong sunshine and tend to form discrete colonies, with the largest containing up to 100,000 individuals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} wall {{covering}} for residential use and generally the most economical is prepasted vinyl coated paper, commonly called [...] "strippable" [...] {{which can be}} misleading. Cloth backed vinyl is fairly common and durable. Lighter vinyls are easier to handle and hang. Paper backed vinyls are generally more expensive, significantly more difficult to hang, {{and can be found}} in wider untrimmed widths. Foil wallpaper generally has paper backing and can (exceptionally) be up to 36 inches wide, and be very difficult to handle and hang. Textile wallpapers include <b>silks,</b> linens, <b>grass</b> cloths, strings, rattan, and actual impressed leaves. There are acoustical wall carpets to reduce sound. Customized wallcoverings are available at high prices and most often have minimum roll orders.|$|R
50|$|The Etruscans likely founded Perugia in the 6th century B.C.. The Umbra and Tiber Valleys {{are located}} in the {{province}}. The eastern part of the province is a hilly region while the rest was covered by forests. The province lies in the basin of the river Tiber and its tributaries Chiaseio, Nestore, Naja and Chiana. The southern regions are less hilly. <b>Silk,</b> corn and <b>grass</b> {{are some of the most}} important agricultural products of the province. The 1840 version of the Penny Cyclopaedia records that Perugia supplied almost half of the butcher's meat required in the city of Rome. The large number of cattle was fed on grass growing on the plain areas irrigated by the water of Tiber and its tributaries. After the province of Rome, Viterbo and Spoleto e Rieti the Perugian province was the fourth most important of the Papal States. The largest lake in central Italy, Lake Trasimeno is located in the Province of Perugia. The lake has three islands - Polvese, Maggiore and Minore. The lake has a circumference of about 30 miles but is relatively shallow. It is fed by springs in the nearby hills.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} difference between Providence Island and the Massachusetts Bay colony {{was that the}} Massachusetts settlement was led by resident gentry, who allowed the colony to evolve towards self-sufficiency, while Providence Island was ruled by absentee grandees who kept the settlers totally dependent on them.The colonists were only tenants, with half their profits going to the investors in the company.With a limited stake in the colony, the colonists were unimaginative about ways to improve it.There was a glut of tobacco on the market. The Chesapeake, Barbados and St. Kitts colonies were producing far more tobacco and of better quality.The directors tried to encourage the planters to grow other crops such as <b>silk</b> <b>grass,</b> cotton, sugar cane, pomegranates, figs or juniper berries. However, despite a collapse in prices in 1634, the planters still persisted in growing tobacco.|$|E
