The purpose of this experiment, carried out during two years in a commercial organic orchard, was to assess the combined effect of removing leaves from the alleys and ploughing in leaves within the row on <b>scab</b> primary inoculum and therefore on <b>scab</b> epidemics. <b>Scab</b> lesions were monitored on leaves and fruits by assessing <b>scab</b> incidence and <b>scab</b> severity. In 2003, <b>scab</b> severity was monitored at different distances from the unremoved leaf area, in order to estimate ascospore spreading. At fruit harvest, during two years with low (2003) and high (2004) levels of <b>scab</b> development, the leaf litter ploughing in / removal method reduced fruit <b>scab</b> incidence by 82 % and 54 % respectively, and fruit <b>scab</b> severity by 74 % and 68 %.

Logit models {{were used to}} compare <b>scab</b> incidence in all harvested tubers (n = 622) {{and the type of}} <b>scab</b> in the symptomatic tubers (n = 382), whereas the tuber surface areas covered with <b>scab</b> lesions were compared using ANOVA. A 10 g increase in tuber weight increased the odds of <b>scab</b> incidence by 11. 3 %. <b>Scab</b> incidence was lowest in Sabina and highest in Matilda. Raised <b>scab</b> and superficial <b>scab</b> were common in all cultivars, but pitted <b>scab</b> developed only in a few tubers of Sabina and Matilda. Among the scabby tubers, the incidence of raised <b>scab</b> was highest in Sabina and lowest in Saturna. The mean surface area covered with <b>scab</b> was 32. 8 % in Matilda, 11. 7 % in Saturna and 7. 5 % in Sabina.

40|$|Benefits {{attributed}} to wound <b>scabs</b> include prevention of blood loss and protection against infection. However, when {{formation of a}} wound <b>scab</b> is prevented, the risk of infection is reduced. Moreover, {{in the absence of}} a wound <b>scab,</b> wounds heal faster and scar formation is reduced. The question arises why we develop a wound <b>scab.</b> Here we show that wound <b>scabs</b> inhibit transmission of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). We compared the UVR transmittance of human wound <b>scabs</b> to sunscreen by measuring the sun protection factor (SPF) with diffuse transmittance spectroscopy. Three wound <b>scabs</b> showed SPFs of 70, 84, and 300, which is more effective than the most protective commercially available sun block.

40|$|Abstract Potato common <b>scab</b> (Streptomyces scabies (Thaxt.)

For identification {{of the most common}} scab-tolerant material, and for developing molecular markers for common <b>scab</b> tolerance, more information is needed on the genetic basis of common <b>scab</b> tolerance. Phenotyping common <b>scab</b> susceptibility is difficult be-cause of the large variability in disease symptoms among tubers from a single plant, ranging from no common <b>scab</b> to severe pits. Two years of field data were collected for <b>scab</b> reaction on a segregating tetraploid population (MSL 603, 160 individuals).

60|$|But {{there is}} more to the {{question}} than has yet been discussed. The labor scab is no more detestable to his brother laborers than is the capitalist scab to his brother capitalists. A capitalist may get most for least in dealing with his laborers, and in so far be a non-scab; but at the same time, in his dealings with his fellow-capitalists, he may give most for least and be the very worst kind of scab. The most heinous crime an employer of labor can commit is to scab on his fellow-employers of labor. Just as the individual laborers have organized into groups to protect themselves from the peril of the scab laborer, so have the employers organized into groups to protect themselves from the peril of the scab employer. The employers' federations, associations, and trusts are nothing more nor less than unions. They are organized to destroy <b>scabbing</b> amongst themselves and to encourage <b>scabbing</b> amongst others. For this reason they pool interests, determine prices, and present an unbroken and aggressive front to the labor group.|$|E

60|$|No scab {{capitalist}} {{strives to}} give more for less for any other reason than that he hopes, by undercutting a competitor and driving that competitor out of the market, to get that market and its profits for himself.

This, for example, has been the history of Mr. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Company. Through all the sordid villanies of scabdom he has passed, until today he is a most regal non-scab. However, to continue in this enviable position, he must be prepared at a moment's notice to go <b>scabbing</b> again. And he is prepared.

40|$|Background: <b>SCAB</b> 1 {{is a novel}} plant-specific actin-bundling protein. Results: <b>SCAB</b> 1 {{consists}} of an actin-binding domain, two coiled-coil dimerization domains, and a fused immunoglobulin and pleckstrin homology domain with an atypical binding site for inositol phosphates. Conclusion: <b>SCAB</b> 1 is a dimeric actin cross-linker and may be regulated by inositol signaling. Significance: This work provides a structural framework to understand the function of <b>SCAB</b> 1. <b>SCAB</b> 1 is a novel plant-specific actin-binding protein that binds, bundles, and stabilizes actin filaments and regulates stomatal movement. Here, we dissected the structure and function of <b>SCAB</b> 1 by structural and biochemical approaches. We show that <b>SCAB</b> 1 is composed of an actin-binding domain, two coiled-coil (CC) domains, and a fused immunoglobulin and pleckstrin homology (Ig-PH) domain.
