The projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his face and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over with filth. When I was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a compliment I could well have excused. His employment, from his first coming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to its original food, by separating the several parts, removing the tincture which it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and <b>scumming</b> off the saliva. He had a weekly allowance, from the society, of a vessel filled with human ordure, about the bigness of a Bristol barrel.|$|E

50|$|Ink {{and water}} balance is an {{extremely}} important part of offset printing. If ink and water are not properly balanced, the press operator may end up with many different problems affecting {{the quality of the}} finished product, such as emulsification (the water overpowering and mixing with the ink). This leads to <b>scumming,</b> catchup, trapping problems, ink density issues and in extreme cases the ink not properly drying on the paper; resulting in the job being unfit for delivery to the client. With the proper balance, the job will have the correct ink density and should need little further adjustment except for minor ones. An example would be when the press heats up during normal operation, thus evaporating water at a faster rate. In this case the machinist will gradually increase the water as the press heats up to compensate for the increased evaporation of water. Printing machinists generally try to use as little water as possible to avoid these problems.|$|E
40|$|Oxygen microelectrodes {{were used}} to monitor oxygen {{concentration}} and rates of gross photosynthetic activity in Microcystis sp. <b>scums</b> which were formed and incubated under laboratory conditions. The depth of the photic layer, rate of photosynthesis, oxygen concentration {{and the location of}} the transition to anoxia in the <b>scum</b> depended on irradiance levels and colony size. Gross photosynthetic activity never extended below 2. 5 mm depth in the <b>scum.</b> At high irradiance levels oxygen concentration in the upper 1. 5 mm of the <b>scum</b> decreased and the oxygen concentration peak shifted to greater depth. Oxygen concentrations in <b>scums</b> composed of small colonies (300 -mu-m) but small colonies showed stronger indications of photoinhibition. In a natural <b>scum</b> small colonies are presumably shielded from inhibitory intensities by larger colonies which will dominate the upper layers. Accumulation of low-light adapted, smaller colonies in deeper layers likely yielded a second peak in photosynthetic activity. In order to systematically discuss <b>scums</b> and <b>scum</b> formation a distinction is made in three different <b>scum</b> types...|$|R

40|$|Activated sludge sewage {{treatment}} plants that {{were affected by}} biological foams attributed {{to the presence of}} actinomycetes were surveyed in Queensland, Australia. Nocardia amarae and Nocardia pinensis were the predominant organisms found to accumulate selectively in the foam phase. Foaming was shown to be a significant problem in Queensland with 92 % of surveyed plants being affected. A total of 60 % of these plants suffered from bulking, however, no correlation between these two problems was noted. No operational, design, influent or weather feature was found to be consistent in all foaming plants. Apart {{from the fact that the}} plants were all variations of the activated sludge process, the only other aspect shared by them was that large numbers of filamentous bacteria were present in the foam. Field scale trials that evaluated control strategies against actinomycete foaming or <b>scumming</b> in activated sludge plants are described. The effects were assessed of: altering the rate of return activated sludge recycle, dosing of the aeration tank with anaerobic digester products, the addition of a commerical product specifically designed to control foaming, altering sludge age, varying levels of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and altering other operational features. These strategies did not efficaciously control <b>scumming</b> in activated sludge, however, some operational features were highlighted as exacerbating the problem...|$|E
40|$|Grass ’ {{formation}} {{is the very}} common defects for via etch process when using a BCl 3 /Cl 2 as basic gases in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system. Presence of grass can potentially degrade device performance due to poor metallization coverage. In this study we found that grass formation strongly depends on GaAs surface condition prior to etch. Any surface contaminants, such as photo resist residues and/or <b>scumming</b> can contribute to grass formation. We found that applying suitable chemical clean and O 2 plasma descum prior to via etch process would prevent the grass formation. To avoid changes to via profile and/or etch rate, etch parameters were not altered in this study...|$|E
40|$|Interior surface {{temperatures}} {{at the edges}} of sealed double- glazing units are lower than those of many conventional double window arrangements, and the building humidities that can be carried without excessive condensation on these surfaces are correspondingly lower. They must be sealed initially with dry air between the panes, and in spite of the stresses imposed by service conditions must retain the seal over their required service life. Units can fail by either breakage or condensation and the <b>scumming</b> that results from excessive moisture gain. On the other hand, sealed glazing units have advantages in the elimination of storm sash, reduction of surfaces that need cleaning to two, and prevention of condensation between panes. These may often outweigh the potential problems in their use. Aussi disponible en fran 7 ais : Fen 0 doubles-vitres scell 9 es 0 l'usinePeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|This work mainly {{focuses on}} the post-etch {{treatment}} (PET) in dielectric etch processes from contact etch, trench etch to all-in-one etch. PET step is optimized not only to efficiently remove the byproducts formed on the sidewall/bottom of contact/via hole during etch proceses but also to eliminate the surface corrosion of the etched metal comprising feature. Besides, we also leveraged PET to repair low-k damage and prevent the formation of mositure on film surface by modifing film from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, especially for low-k/ultra low-k dielectric processes. Results show the actual effect of PET in terms of reliability performance highly relies on the specific etch recipe, wet clean condition and substrate material in back end of line (BEOL). We also addressed the pre-etch treatment to effectively reduce the impact of photo-resist <b>scumming</b> in contact etch. In brief, plasma-based etch treatment is imperative to extend the tightened process window margin...|$|E
40|$|The {{high shear}} rate {{environment}} of gravure requires very low viscosity, fluid inks. The {{problems associated with}} low viscosity such as spilling, crawling, <b>scumming</b> and crazing, have hindered the development of UV-curable gravure inks. This led the researcher to study UV-curable gravure ink formulation. The effects of oligomer-to-monomer ratio and pigment dispersion loading on white ultraviolet (UV) -curable gravure ink film properties (surface cure efficiency, abrasion resistance, substrate adhesion, and ink film flexibility) were investigated. In this study, molecules normally used as monomers, in UV-curable systems, were selected as oligomers relative to the selected monomer, Glycerol Propoxylate Triacrylate (GPTA). The selected oligomers were, Trimethylolpropane Triacrylate (TMPTA), Trimethylolpropane Ethoxylate Triacrylate (ETMPTA), and a commercially available oligomer, Commerical Product A, used in flexographic ink applications. The outcome of this research created {{a starting point for}} white UV-curable gravure ink formulation, which will be used in the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s family printing business.

40|$|A {{family of}} dye-filled developer-soluble bottom {{anti-reflective}} coatings (BARCs) {{has been developed}} for use in 193 -nm microlithography. This new dye-filled chemical platform easily provides products covering {{a wide range of}} optical properties. The light-sensitive and positive-working BARCs use a transparent polymeric binder and a polymeric dye in a thermally crosslinking formulation, with the cured products then being photochemically decrosslinked prior to development. The cured BARC films are imaged and removed with developer in the same steps as the covering photoresist. Two dye-filled BARCs with differing optical properties were developed via a series of DOEs and then used as a dual-layer BARC stack. Lithography with this BARC stack, using a 193 -nm resist, gave 150 -nm L/S (1 : 1). A 193 -nm dual-layer BARC stack (gradient optical properties) from the well-established dye-attached family of light-sensitive BARCs also gave 150 -nm L/S (1 : 1) with the same resist. However, the latter provided much improved line shape with no <b>scumming.</b> The targeted application for light-sensitive dual-layer BARCs is high–numerical aperture (NA) immersion lithography where a single-layer BARC will not afford the requisite reflection control...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies and}} {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} to test the new Toray plate. The studies revealed that the new plate eliminated {{many of the problems}} that used to hinder the progress and development of the driographic plate system. The two major problems with this plate were short run lengths and toning in the non-image areas. This study investigates toning problems in negative working Toray plates. Toning is a term that refers to the non-image areas of the driographic plate that are accepting ink. Previous studies have shown that ink tack and flow do not affect toning in any way. However, printing speed, nip pressure, printing density and ink temperature were found to have some effect on toning. To investigate the effect that different percentages of oil in the ink has on toning in the non-image areas of Toray negative working plates, this study uses five ink samples, each containing a different percentage of oil, and measures with a densitometer the density of toning in the non-image areas. The hypothesis tested in this study states that the amount of toning in the non-image areas of negative Toray plates increases as the amount of oil contained in the ink increases. Upon analyzing the data collected, it was found that when using the special driographic ink no <b>scumming</b> occured. However, the hypothesis proved to stand true because it was found that a strong positive relationship exists between the amount of oil contained in the driographic ink and the amount of toning in the non-image areas of negative Toray plates...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Surland 2 ̆ 7 s Emulsification Method, and is {{intended}} to demonstrate the effect of change in emulsification rate curve with different types of fountain solution whose surface tension was varied. The surface tension of a fountain solution can be changed {{by the addition of}} isopropyl alcohol. Two inks were modified to produce the same tack reading but a different emulsification capacity. Using the Surland method the two inks and two fountain solutions generate four different emulsification rate curves and these four curves are tested for their effect on printed quality. The printing performance of an ink is judged by the ease with which an ink can obtain ink-water balance as well as the degree of freedom from printing problems such as 2 ̆ 2 catching up 2 ̆ 2 and plate <b>scumming.</b> The printed sheets are sampled and the data is analyzed statistically using solid ink density and dot gain as response variables. The RIT Symmetrical Scale was included in the printing form design to facilitate solid ink density measurement and dot gain calculation. Solid ink density and dot gain variations are calculated within each printing run. The addition of isopropul alcohol to a dampening solution not only reduces its surface tension and increase its wettability but it also suppresses an ink 2 ̆ 7 s continuous emulsification tendency. Ink and water balance is easily controlled when a printing ink is able to reach a state of equilibrim with dampening solution. On the basis of observation during the on press printing run it was found that a high percentage of isopropyl alcohol in a dampening solution can dissolve the blue toner from the black ink and requires an increase of ink feed to obtain the desired optical density. This study indicates the tendency of plate 2 ̆ 2 catching up 2 ̆ 2 can be associated with emulsification rate curves. The Pb type of emulsification rate curve can be so modified that press run will encounter fewer problems. Density variation within a press run is then more easily controlled...|$|E

On the basis of these screening results, one nocardioform actinomycetes/Acinetobacter spp. -dominated WWTP 1 and one M. parvicella-dominated WWTP 2 were selected for detailed investigations. In actinomycetes/Acinetobacter-dominated WWTP 1 both lipophilic substances in the EPS and hydrophobic cell surfaces stabilized the <b>scum</b> layer. In M. parvicella- dominated WWTP 2 the hydrophobic cell surfaces of these organisms were responsible for the hydrophobic sludge properties and sludge floating.
