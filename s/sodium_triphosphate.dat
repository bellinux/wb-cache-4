40|$|AbstractExtracellular {{adenosine}} is a neuromodulator in {{the central}} nervous system. Astrocytes mainly participate in adenosine production, and extracellular adenosine accumulates under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Inhibition of intracellular adenosine metabolism and reduction of the external Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]e) participate in adenosine accumulation, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying extracellular adenosine accumulation in cultured rat spinal astrocytes. The combination of adenosine kinase and deaminase (ADK/ADA) inhibition and a reduced [Ca 2 +]e increased the extracellular adenosine level. ADK/ADA inhibitors increased the level of extracellular adenosine but not of adenine nucleotides, which was suppressed by inhibition of equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) 2.

(Nanoscience) Ochratoxin A and Aflatoxin B 1 are {{important}} food contaminates {{as they are}} known to be mutagenic, genotoxic, nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, immunosuppressive and teratogenic to both animals and humans. These mycotoxins are associated with the contamination of food stuff such as grapes, maize, red pepper, meat, milk, beans and processed products from contaminated raw material. Current physical, biological and chemical methods employed to improve the safety of food often compromise the nutritional value and result in huge losses. The alternative to these treatments are addition of supplements with protective properties to reduce the toxicity of mycotoxins or prevent their formation. The work presented in this dissertation reports an attempt to develop such materials to prevent damage caused by ochratoxin A and aflatoxin B 1. This was done through the synthesis; characterisation and cytotoxicity study of chitosan nanoparticles with methanolic plant extracts (L. leonurus, M. longifolia and A. montanus). Inhibition of cellular damage due to mycotoxins for possible application in prevention of cellular damage by mycotoxins also presented. Chitosan nanoparticles were synthesised using an ionic gelation method with <b>sodium</b> <b>triphosphate</b> as the cross linker. The methanolic medicinal plants extracts were incorporated into the chitosan solution before synthesising nanoparticles, and nanoparticle synthesis initiated by the addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>triphosphate</b> solution. The synthesised products were characterised using zetasizer, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The extracts’ antioxidant ability was evaluated before incorporation into chitosan using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazy (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. This assay was performed using UVvis spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity of the synthesised nanoparticles was assessed using a Vero cell line and by evaluating the cell viability with an MTS assay. The nanoparticles were successfully synthesised and showed the presence of different functional groups as expected. Plain chitosan nanoparticles were roughly spherical shaped and had smooth surfaces, nanoparticles containing extracts similarly were spherical in shape as well but had rougher surfaces when visualised under TEM. All nanoparticles had positive zeta potentials between 26 – 28 mV. The average particle sizes ranged between 31 – 65 nm as measured using TEM and average particle sizes obtained using zetasiser was 78 – 190 nm.

40|$|A 30 wt% calcium {{caseinate}} dispersion {{can be transformed}} in an anisotropic and fibrous structure by applying well-defined flow and enzymatic gelation. The formation of an anisotropic structure {{is thought to be}} due to the micellar structure of the caseinate and the mild adhesion between the micelles caused by the divalent calcium ions. Both micellar structure and interaction can be influenced by the presence of salt in the solution. This paper therefore describes the effect of salt addition on the structure formation. It turned out that the presence of sodium chloride (NaCl) facilitated the structure formation and led to clear development of fibres. Addition of a low concentration of the sequestrant <b>sodium</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (pentabasic; STP) had a similar effect on fibrousness, but reduced the fibre strength. A higher concentration of STP led to homogeneous gel formation and inhibited the formation of a fibrous structure. Rheological measurements were used to explain the results. Dispersions containing NaCl and low concentrations of STP showed non-linear behaviour just as the dispersion to which no salt was added. This rheological behaviour suggested a rearrangement of the internal structure in the protein mixture. The higher STP concentrations resulted in a slightly shear-thinning behaviour of the material, suggesting that the material became less susceptible to structure changes due to shear flow...|$|E

A total of eight different hydrogels were prepared by dissolving the humic acids with sodium hydroxide and <b>sodium</b> <b>triphosphate.</b> For the purpose of precipitation and cross linking, hydrochloric acid and chlorides of magnesium, calcium and iron were used during a modified preparation of gels. Different gel-forming interactions were achieved by modifying the preparation of hydrogel systems. The aim of the thesis was to assess the effect of gel preparation procedure on the transport properties of the gels. Therefore, diffusion coeficients were determined for all samples. Two different methods - constant-source diffusion and instantaneous planar source diffusion - were used to assign the diffusion coefficients. Methods differ in source concentrations of cupric ions and are suitable for assessing the impact of the concentration on the diffusion coefficient. Both these methods were based on monitoring temporal evolution of diffusion profiles of cupric ions and on assigning the overall diffusion flow. Copper ions were elected as diffusing medium because of their high affinity and strong binding to humic acids. Measurements show that gels prepared using polyphosphate allow slightly faster diffusion of cupric ions and that the constant-source method provides higher diffusion coefficients in comparison to instantaneous planar source method...|$|E
40|$|Oligoanions such as <b>sodium</b> <b>triphosphate</b> or GTP prevent and/or reverse vinblastine-induced {{polymerization}} of tubulin. We now {{show that}} the anions of glutamate-rich extreme C termini of tubulin are similarly involved in the regulation of the vinblastine effect. Cleavage of the C termini by limited proteolysis with subtilisin enhances vinblastine-induced tubulin polymerization and abolishes the anion effect. Only the β-tubulin C terminus needs to be removed to achieve these changes and the later cleavage of the α-tubulin C terminus has little additional effect. In fact, vinblastine concentrations > 20 μM block cleavage of the α-tubulin C terminus in the polymer, whereas cleavage of the β-tubulin C terminus proceeds unimpeded over the time used. The vinblastine effect on tubulin polymerization is also highly pH-dependent between pH 6. 5 and 7. 5; this is less marked, but not absent, after subtilisin treatment. A working model is proposed wherein an anionic domain proximal to the extreme C terminus must interact with a cationic domain to permit vinblastine to promote polymerization. Both exogenous and extreme C-terminal anions compete for the cationic domain with the proximal anionic domain to prevent vinblastine-induced polymerization. We conclude that the electrostatic regulation of tubulin polymerization induced by vinblastine resides primarily in the β-tubulin C terminus but that additional regulation proximal in the tubulin molecule also plays a role...|$|E
