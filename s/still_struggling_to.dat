5|$|Despite {{improvements}} made {{to other}} parts of the network, the Underground railways were <b>still</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> make a profit. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} half of Letcher's term, the state was <b>still</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> recover from the {{financial}} Panic of 1837. Consistent with his Whig views, Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States. To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically cut spending, including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's deficit and improved its credit. In each of Letcher's years in office, the state showed a small but growing budget surplus.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October, Maruyama's forces {{struggled}} {{through the jungle}} to reach the American lines. Kawaguchi—on his own initiative—began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area. Maruyama—through one of his staff officers—ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan. When he refused, Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel Toshinari Shōji, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment. That evening, after learning that {{the left and right}} wing forces were <b>still</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained completely unaware of the approach of Maruyama's forces.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealanders {{continued}} {{their efforts to}} encircle Bapaume on 26 August, their flanks protected by the neighbouring 63rd and 5th Divisions. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade took over the attack in the north from the 2nd Infantry Brigade, while 1st Infantry Brigade was to carry on with its advance in to the south. Should the two brigades successfully link up {{to the east of}} Bapaume, they would attack into the town from there. However, little progress was made in the south. The 63rd Division was <b>still</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> capture Thilloy while the advance of the 2nd Wellington Battalion, the leading unit of the 1st Infantry Brigade, was checked by gunfire from Bapaume on its right and from its left.

5|$|Carus's death, amid a {{successful}} war with Persia and in mysterious circumstances – he was believed (perhaps {{as a result}} of later Diocletianic propaganda) to have been struck by lightning – left his sons Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from his post in Gaul as imperial commissioner and arrived there by January 284, becoming legitimate Emperor in the West. Numerian lingered in the East. The Roman withdrawal from Persia was orderly and unopposed. The Sassanid king Bahram II could not field an army against them as he was <b>still</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> establish his authority. By March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa (Homs) in Syria; by November, only Asia Minor. In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health: he issued the only extant rescript in his name there, but after he left the city, his staff, including the prefect (Numerian's father-in-law, and as such the dominant influence in the Emperor's entourage) Aper, reported that he suffered from an inflammation of the eyes. He traveled in a closed coach from then on. When the army reached Bithynia, some of the soldiers smelled an odor emanating from the coach. They opened its curtains and inside they found Numerian dead. Both Eutropius and Aurelius Victor describe Numerian's death as an assassination.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1761 Prussia could muster only 100,000 troops, many of them raw recruits, and its {{situation}} was desperate.

The Russian army slowly advanced through Brandenburg, <b>still</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> supply its men by wagon train from magazines in Poland. Deprived of men, the Prussian defenders resorted to harassing convoys to delay the enemy advance, executing a number of successful raids. Meanwhile, Laudon's Austrians gradually occupied more of Silesia, storming the fortress at Schweidnitz on 1 October.|$|E

25|$|The CPC (ML) {{developed}} from a progression of student-based organizations during the 1960s.

The CPC (ML) was not created from a split from the Communist Party of Canada (CPC). The party emerged during a period of growing student and youth activism.

In January 1958 Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army. He was upset {{about the possibility of}} it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed. Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.|$|E
