At {{the northern end of}} the railway, {{the need to}} pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, <b>steeply</b> <b>inclined</b> tunnels were required {{to the west of the}} station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.|$|E

500|$|The Gresley 3-cylinder drive {{arrangement}} continued {{to bring a}} number of practical problems, the root of which was probably {{the need for the}} inside cylinder to be <b>steeply</b> <b>inclined</b> in order to give space for the inside connecting rod to clear the leading coupled axle; at the same time, the inside valve spindle had to be parallel with the outside ones from which it derived its motion. This problem had been overcome by what Holcroft called a [...] "twist in the ports" [...] (the passages that carried steam {{in and out of the}} cylinders). A consequence was that the length of these passages was greater than that generally recommended, increasing [...] "dead space", and this was combined with a shorter exhaust passage. The net result would be rather different working conditions in the middle cylinder from those on the outside. A contributing problem was that any elongation of the outside valve spindles was multiplied by the conjugated valve gear. Although this had been anticipated at the design stage, the overall consequence was that the inside cylinder had a tendency to give more power than the other two as speed increased, leading to the overloading of the inside connecting rod bearings, especially the big-end which was liable to overheat and fail. Various experiments were tried over the years to cure this chronic ailment, and it was only towards the end of the steam era that a real solution was found in Great Western methods of lubrication and manufacture for the big-end bearing. Other problems persisted, such as a stiff, insensitive regulator and overall design flaws that hampered maintenance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the key principles necessary for an understanding of Speleogenesis, including selected speleogenetic models. The most popular of these models at the moment is the four-state model, which attributes the depth of a karst system principally to the depth and spatial distribution of the geological-tectonic bedding planes. According to this model, thick or <b>steeply</b> <b>inclining</b> planes lead to deep phreatic loops, while shallower and more interconnected planes lead to horizontal karst systems more heavily influenced by the water table. The key to understanding the initial karstification is the particular dissolution kinetics of limestone dissolution. While the dissolution of limestone by limestone-aggressive water leads to a first order dissolution kinetic, this changes to a higher order dissolution kinetic as full saturation is approached. Because of this phenomenon, full saturation and loss of aggressiveness do not occur, and the widening of initial fissures is possible even without the constant addition of fresh carbon dioxide to the system. In numerical models these processes can be simulated with significant simplifications and using various key parameters. The paper summarizes the current development status of these models. The main part of the paper presents the synthesis of the results of numerical modeling and the author's own hydro-geological/speleological research. The author has developed speleogenetic models for complex karst systems in the Steinernes Meer (Austria), the Sierra el Abra and Sierra Juarez (both in Mexico) and the Rheinische Schiefergebirge (Germany). The paper discusses the key hydro-speleological parameters and the influence of regional groundwater flow-systems during the initial karstification and the resulting template for the future development of the karst system. Guidelines {{for the duration of the}} initial karstification can be derived from the numerical models. These correspond with the geological/speleological findings. Especially in a very early phase of the initial karstification lasting over a million years, the almost saturated water leads to an ongoing widening of the initial fissures. The groundwater flow obeys the laws of groundwater flow in a porous and homogeneous medium (Hubbert 1940). As a result, deep phreatic flow paths form even at a very early stage of speleogenesis. These then have a developmental headstart during the breakthrough phase so that karst systems develop with deep phreatic tubes. The actual distribution of the bedding planes, which the four-state model considers decisive, plays only a minor role...|$|R

The new technique allowed quantitation of the relative contributions of partial natural remanent magnetization (NRM) components as well as numerical extraction of thermal and coercive force (alternating field, AF) unblocking data. Two major components were identified, one stable which is carried by hematite-ilmenite, and one less stable carried by multidomain (MD) magnetite. The age of the hematite-ilmenite component is circa 930 Ma, and it has steep negative inclination, coercivities in excess of 150 mT, and unblocking temperatures between 540 degrees C and 640 degrees C. Two corresponding poles are reported (1) paleolatitude/paleolongitude (plat/plong) (218 degrees/- 24. 3) with Dp/Dm (9. 4 degrees/ 9. 9 degrees) (paleopole) and (2) plat/plong (203 degrees/- 51 degrees) with D-p/D-m (4. 4 degrees/ 5. 6 degrees) (VGP).

Our new analysis method was successful in showing that retrograde amphibole formation strongly decreases the importance of the hematite-ilmenite component on behalf of the MD magnetite. It has a diminishing effect on a negative aeromagnetic anomaly in the area. The 930 Ma components constitute 80 - 0 % of the vector difference sums depending on rock composition.

40|$|Abstract: Ocean {{scattering}} can {{be driven}} by acoustic interactions with the seafloor. Far from being smooth and perfectly rigid, the ocean floor is a key component {{in the analysis of}} sound scattering. At frequencies of order of 10 kHz to hundreds of kHz, hence for those wavelengths, the roughness of a seabed is considered at different scales and this feature has {{to be taken into account}} in the analysis of the roughness sound scattering. The first-order Small Slope Approximation (SSA) is considered to predict the roughness scattering. The Small Slope Approximation is a unifying method able to reconcile the Small Perturbation Method and the Kirchhoff Approximation without needing to split the spectrum of the rough surface into large and small scales. Another important component is to consider the type of rough surface used to describe the ocean floor. The seafloor is usually chosen as isotropic and this choice gives the opportunity to simplify the implementation of the scattering model. Nevertheless the seafloor has been chosen to be anisotropic in order to cope with surfaces having special features. One of the simplest case of anisotropic rough surface has got a Gaussian distribution and different correlation lengths in the x and y directions. Results show that SSA can predict roughness scattering for this type of surface. Another case, close to a real situation, is a surface having the shape of sandy ripples, thus a surface with small hills and slopes in a particular direction. Scattering predictions are presented for different anisotropic surfaces without forgetting the major problem of the method. The slope of the rough surface should not <b>incline</b> <b>steeply</b> to avoid shadow effects. Thus, depending on the sound source and the receiver configurations, SSA is analysed with the maximum dimensions of the surface where SSA still works...|$|R
5000|$|The Vine-Matthews {{hypothesis}} correlates the symmetric magnetic patterns seen on {{the seafloor}} with geomagnetic field reversals. At mid-ocean ridges, new crust is created by the injection, extrusion, and solidification of magma. After the magma has cooled through the Curie point, ferromagnetism becomes possible and the magnetic minerals in the newly formed crust orient themselves with the current background geomagnetic field. Lithospheric creation at the ridge is considered continuous and symmetrical as the new crust pushes the old crust laterally and equally {{on either side of}} the ridge. Therefore, as geomagnetic reversal occur, the crust {{on either side of the}} ridge will contain a record of remnant magnetizations of normal or reversed magnetizations in comparison to the current geomagnetic field. The ridge crest is analogous to “twin-headed tape recorder”, recording the Earth’s magnetic history.The intensity of the remnant magnetization is greater than the induced magnetization. The shape of the magnetic anomaly is controlled by the combination of the orientation of its total magnetization, the summation of the induced magnetization and remnant magnetization. Consequently, the shape of the magnetic anomaly is controlled predominately by the primary remnant vector. Blocks of crust at high latitudes have magnetic vectors that dip steeply downward in a normal magnetic field. However, close to the magnetic south pole, the magnetic vectors dip steeply downward in a reversed magnetic field and <b>inclined</b> <b>steeply</b> upwards in a normal magnetic field. There are positive magnetic anomalies over normally magnetized blocks and negative anomalies over reversed blocks. Local anomalies with a short period also exist, but are considered to be correlated with bathymetry. [...] In low latitudes, the vectors are shallowly dipping and dipolar. This confuses the positive and negative anomalies. At the magnetic equator, the magnetic field is horizontal; negative anomalies are related to normally magnetized blocks and positive anomalies with reversed. The amplitude of the anomaly, magnetic field strength, and the magnitude of the remanence all decrease from the poles to the equator.The orientation of the ridge affects the anomaly shape and amplitude. The component of the vector that effects the anomaly is at a maximum when the ridge is east-west and the magnetic profile is north-south. The anomalies are most apparent at high magnetic latitudes, north-south trending ridges at all latitudes, and east-west trending ridges at the magnetic equator.|$|R
40|$|Permafrost is {{a common}} and {{important}} thermal phenomenon in the subsurface of high mountains. Its degradation due to climate change may lead to adverse effects, such as decreasing stability of infrastructure or an increase in rock falls from permafrost slopes. Research intensively deals with assessing and modeling mountain permafrost conditions, since they are not directly visible and extrapolation of measurements is difficult in steep and inhomogeneous terrain. So far, focus of mountain permafrost modeling studies was typically on the thermal conditions of the near-surface. The objective of this thesis is to describe and analyze mountain permafrost in greater depths (i. e., below the active layer), with a main focus on its three-dimensional distribution and transient effects from past and possible future climate variations. We design a modeling procedure that includes the processes in the atmosphere, at the surface, and in the subsurface, and {{which is based on}} the combination of existing approaches. To calculate subsurface temperature fields we determine ground surface temperatures with a distributed surface energy balance model based on climate time series. The result is used as upper boundary condition in a heat conduction scheme. For the simulation of scenarios of future permafrost conditions, we use climate time series constructed from Regional Climate Model results. The modeling procedure is tested in a number of validation steps, namely sensitivity studies and comparisons with field data. Due to the complex situation in nature, we first apply the modeling procedure to a number of idealized test cases with simplified topography, typical surface and subsurface characteristics, and different climate scenarios. The subsequent application to real topography includes the characterization of permafrost conditions at borehole sites and rock fall starting zones. The results indicate a three-dimensional distribution pattern of mountain permafrost, which is mainly influenced by topography and spatially and temporally variable surface temperatures. Isotherms <b>incline</b> <b>steeply</b> and strong lateral heat fluxes exist, which minimizes the influence of the geothermal heat flux. Transient signals from past climate variations in current permafrost temperatures derive mainly from the last glacial period and the major fluctuations during the past millennium. Temperature depressions in high mountains are smaller than in flat terrain, because multi-lateral warming in steep topography accelerates the pace of a surface temperature signal intruding into the subsurface. Simulations of future conditions point to subsurface temperature fields that substantially deviate from stationary conditions and are characterized by deep-reaching and long-term perturbations, generally rising temperatures, and an increase in both volume and vertical extent of warm permafrost zones. In the European Alps, near-surface permafrost on steep south-exposed slopes will have disappeared even in the highest peaks within the next two centuries, but substantial permafrost volumes will remain at depth for centuries to millennia. Three-dimensional and transient modeling tools are important for the comprehensive analysis of mountain permafrost conditions, since in complex mountain topography nearsurface conditions do not provide sufficient information. For future research the influence of variable surface and subsurface characteristics on the subsurface thermal field, the interpretation of temperatures recorded in boreholes in mountain topography, and the re-analysis of past rock fall events from permafrost slopes are important topics...|$|R
