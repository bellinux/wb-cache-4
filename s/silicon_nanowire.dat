Various techniques have also been reported in fabricating the <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires.</b> But most of the techniques reported, grow vertical <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires.</b> In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuits are designed and fabricated in a horizontal architecture i. e. the device layout is flat compared to the substrate. When vertical <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires</b> are introduced in the semiconductor industry, a whole new architecture is needed to fabricate an electronic device. If the <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires</b> can be grown horizontally, {{it will be much}} easier to incorporate these nanowires in the current architecture. In this thesis, horizontal <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires</b> were grown on top of a silicon substrate in a bottom up approach. A thin layer of pure aluminum was used as a catalyst to grow the <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires.</b> In this process, silicon from the substrate itself acts as a source to grow the nanowires. A device cannot be fabricated if the <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires</b> are in full contact with the underlying silicon substrate.

50|$|The {{operation}} of the hybrid plasmonic waveguides can be explained using the concept of mode coupling. The most commonly used hybrid plasmonic waveguide consists of a <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowire</b> placed very near a metal surface and separated by a low index region. The silicon waveguide supports dielectric waveguide mode, which is mostly confined in silicon. The metal surface supports surface plasmon, which is confined near the metal surface. When these two structures are brought close to each other, the dielectric waveguide mode supported by the <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowire</b> couples to the surface plasmon mode supported by the metal surface. As {{a result of this}} mode coupling, light becomes highly confined in the region between the metal and the high index region (<b>silicon</b> <b>nanowire).</b>|$|E

Here, we have performed atomic force microscope (AFM)-based nanoindentation experiments of <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires</b> in order to investigate the mechanical properties of <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires.</b> It is shown that stiffness of nanowires is well described by Hertz theory and that elastic modulus of <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires</b> with various diameters from ~ 100 to ~ 600 nm is close to that of bulk silicon. This implies that the elastic modulus of <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowires</b> is independent of their diameters if the diameter is larger than 100 nm.

5000|$|The MSGF {{method is}} a {{relatively}} new GF technique for mathematical modeling of nanomaterials. Mathematical models are used for calculating the response of materials to an applied force in order to simulate their mechanical properties. The MSGF technique links different length scales in modeling of nanomaterials. [...] Nanomaterials are of atomistic dimensions and need to be modeled at the length scales of nanometers. For example, a <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowire,</b> whose width is about five nanometers, contains just 10 - 12 atoms across its width. Another example is graphene and many new two-dimensional (2D) solids. These new materials are ultimate in thinness because they are just one or two atoms thick. Multiscale modeling is needed for such materials because their properties are determined by the discreteness of their atomistic arrangements as well as their overall dimensions.|$|E

5000|$|Junctionless {{nanowire}} transistor (JNT), {{developed at}} Tyndall National Institute in Ireland, is a nanowire-based transistor {{that has no}} gate junction. (Even MOSFET has a gate junction, although its gate is electrically insulated from the controlled region.) Junctions are difficult to fabricate, and, because they are {{a significant source of}} current leakage, they waste significant power and heat. Eliminating them held the promise of cheaper and denser microchips. The JNT uses a simple nanowire of silicon surrounded by an electrically isolated [...] "wedding ring" [...] that acts to gate the flow of electrons through the wire. This method has been described as akin to squeezing a garden hose to gate the flow of water through the hose. The nanowire is heavily n-doped, making it an excellent conductor. Crucially the gate, comprising silicon, is heavily p-doped; and its presence depletes the underlying <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowire</b> thereby preventing carrier flow past the gate.|$|E

The reflectance of the cells with L[*]=[*] 0.10 and 0.23  μm is higher than other cells in the short wavelength region. Compared to the EQE and the reflectance of the <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowire</b> coated with PEDOT:PSS, We postulate that this might be {{due to the fact that}} PEDOT:PSS layer acts as an antireflective coating and then substantially reduces the reflectance of light. This antireflective effect may be stronger than the light-trapping effect arising from the increase of the <b>silicon</b> <b>nanowire</b> arrays, which can also be deduced from the EQE spectra—the EQE in the hybrid solar cell with shorter nanowire arrays is higher than the cell with longer nanowire arrays in the short wavelength region.|$|E
