2500|$|Unlike {{other women}} of her time, Elisabeth used little {{cosmetics}} or perfume, as {{she wished to}} showcase her natural beauty, but she tested countless beauty products prepared in the court pharmacy, or prepared by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments, to preserve it. Although one favorite, [...] "Crème Céleste", was compounded from white wax, spermaceti, <b>sweet</b> <b>almond</b> oil, and rosewater; she attached far less importance to creams and emollients, and experimented {{with a wide variety}} of facial tonics and waters, from which she apparently expected more results. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal bedstead, all the better to retain her upright posture, with either raw veal or crushed strawberries lining her nightly leather facial mask. She was heavily massaged and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist, and her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water. To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive oil bath in the evening.|$|E
60|$|One fact, however, {{is opposed}} to this conclusion. A hybrid, raised by Knight from the <b>sweet</b> <b>almond</b> by the pollen of the peach, {{produced}} flowers {{with little or no}} pollen, yet bore fruit, having been apparently fertilised by a neighbouring nectarine. Another hybrid, from a <b>sweet</b> <b>almond</b> by the pollen of a nectarine, produced during the first three years imperfect blossoms, but afterwards perfect flowers with an abundance of pollen. If this slight degree of sterility cannot be accounted for by the youth of the trees (and this often causes lessened fertility), or by the monstrous state of the flowers, or by the conditions to which the trees were exposed, these two cases would afford a good argument against the peach being the descendant of the almond.|$|E

60|$|Andrew Knight (10/23. 'Transactions of Hort. Soc.' volume 3 page 1 {{and volume}} 4 page 396 and note to page 370. A {{coloured}} drawing is given of this hybrid.), from finding that a seedling-tree, raised from a <b>sweet</b> <b>almond</b> fertilised by the pollen of a peach, yielded fruit quite {{like that of}} a peach, suspected that the peach-tree is a modified almond; and in this he has been followed by various authors. (10/24. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1856 page 532. A writer, it may be presumed Dr. Lindley, remarks on the perfect series which may be formed between the almond and the peach. Another high authority, Mr. Rivers, who has had such wide experience, strongly suspects ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1863 page 27) that peaches, if left to a state of nature, would in the course of time retrograde into thick-fleshed almonds.) A first-rate peach, almost globular in shape, formed of soft and sweet pulp, surrounding a hard, much furrowed, and slightly flattened stone, certainly differs greatly from an almond, with its soft, slightly furrowed, much flattened, and elongated stone, protected by a tough, greenish layer of bitter flesh. Mr. Bentham (10/25. 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 9 page 168.) has particularly called attention to the stone of the almond being so much more flattened than that of the peach. But in the several varieties of the almond, the stone differs greatly in the degree to which it is compressed, in size, shape, strength, and in the depth of the furrows, as may be seen in figure 42 (Nos. 4 to 8) of such kinds as I have been able to collect. With peach-stones also (Nos. 1 to 3) the degree of compression and elongation is seen to vary; so that the stone of the Chinese Honey-peach (No. 3) is much more elongated and compressed than that of the (No. 8) Smyrna almond. Mr. Rivers, of Sawbridgeworth, to whom I am indebted for some of the specimens above figured, and who has had such great horticultural experience, has called my attention to several varieties which connect the almond and the peach. In France there is a variety called the Peach-Almond, which Mr. Rivers formerly cultivated, and which is correctly described in a French catalogue as being oval and swollen, with the aspect of a peach, including a hard stone surrounded by a fleshy covering, which is sometimes eatable. (10/26. Whether this is the same variety as one lately mentioned ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154) by M. Carriere under the name of persica intermedia, I know not; this variety is said to be intermediate in nearly all its characters between the almond and peach; it produces during successive years very different kinds of fruit.) A remarkable statement by M. Luizet has recently appeared in the 'Revue Horticole' (10/27. Quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1866 page 800.), namely, that a Peach-almond, grafted on a peach, bore, during 1863 and 1864 almonds alone, but in 1865 bore six peaches and no almonds. M. Carriere, in commenting on this fact, cites the case of a double-flowered almond which, after producing during several years almonds, suddenly bore for two years in succession spherical fleshy peach-like fruits, but in 1865 reverted to its former state and produced large almonds.|$|E

5000|$|In the Hebrew Bible, the almond was {{a symbol}} of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering. In the Bible the almond is {{mentioned}} ten times, beginning with Book of Genesis 43:11, where it is described as [...] "among the best of fruits". In Numbers 17 Levi is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by Aaron's rod, which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore <b>sweet</b> <b>almonds</b> on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the <b>sweet</b> <b>almonds</b> would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the menorah which stood in the Holy Temple, [...] "Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers" [...] (Exodus 25:33-34; 37:19-20).|$|R

5000|$|In Numbers 17, Korah's {{rebellion}} against Moses' proclamation {{of the tribe}} of Levi as the priesthood has been quashed and the entire congregation's ensuing rebellion {{has resulted in a}} plague, ended only by the intercession of Moses and Aaron. In order to [...] "stop the complaints" [...] of the Israelites, God commands that each of the Twelve Tribes provide a rod; and only that of the tribe chosen to become priests will miraculously sprout overnight. Aaron provides his rod to represent the tribe of Levi, and [...] "it put forth buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds" [...] (Numbers 17:8), as an evidence of the exclusive right to the priesthood of the tribe of Levi. In commemoration of this decision it was commanded that the rod be put again [...] "before the testimony" [...] (Numbers 17:10). According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore <b>sweet</b> <b>almonds</b> on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the <b>sweet</b> <b>almonds</b> would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. A later book of the Bible seems to assert (Hebrews 9:4) that the rod was kept in the Ark of the Covenant. The main fact, however, is thus confirmed, that a rod was preserved in the Tabernacle as a relic of the institution of the Aaronic priesthood.|$|R

5000|$|... ==Varieties== Almond is a {{fruit crop}} {{classified}} under two types, Amygdalus communis (<b>sweet</b> <b>almonds)</b> and Amygdalus amara (bitter almonds). Under this broad classification, in Afghanistan the almond varieties grown are under two major classes: soft-shell almonds, {{known locally as}} badam-e kaghaz (literally, [...] "paper almond"), which can be easily broken by hand; and hard/medium-shell almonds with the local name of badam-e-sangi (literally, [...] "stone almond"). These have many sub-types and multiple varieties, such as Sattarbai, which is of the soft-shell class. Sattarbai has other varieties such as Sattarbai Sufi, SattarbaiGuldar, and SattarbaiMamakhail.

500|$|Surviving medieval recipes {{frequently}} {{call for}} flavoring {{with a number}} of sour, tart liquids. Wine, verjuice (the juice of unripe grapes or fruits) vinegar and the juices of various fruits, especially those with tart flavors, were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking. In combination with sweeteners and spices, it produced a distinctive [...] "pungeant, fruity" [...] flavor. Equally common, and used to complement the tanginess of these ingredients, were (<b>sweet)</b> <b>almonds.</b> They were used in a variety of ways: whole, shelled or unshelled, slivered, ground and, most importantly, processed into almond milk.

50|$|The {{bitter almond}} is {{slightly}} broader and {{shorter than the}} <b>sweet</b> <b>almond</b> and contains about 50% of the fixed oil that occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme emulsin which, {{in the presence of}} water, acts on soluble glucosides, amygdalin, and prunasin, yielding glucose, cyanide and the essential oil of bitter almonds, which is nearly pure benzaldehyde, the chemical causing the bitter flavor. Bitter almonds may yield from 4-9 mg of hydrogen cyanide per almond and contain 42 times higher amounts of cyanide than the trace levels found in sweet almonds. The origin of cyanide content in bitter almonds is via the enzymatic hydrolysis of amygdalin.|$|E
