We show that such series of bursts are naturally explained in the model of a <b>spreading</b> <b>layer</b> of accreting matter over the neutron star surface {{in the case of a}} sufficiently high (Ṁ≥ 1 × 10 ^- 9 M_ yr^- 1) accretion rate (corresponding to a mean luminosity L_ tot≥ 1 × 10 ^ 37 erg s^- 1).

40|$|Thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts, {{observed}} from {{neutron star}} (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB), provide constraints on NS masses and radii and consequently {{the equation of}} state of NS cores. In such analyses various assumptions are made without knowing if they are justified. We have analyzed X-ray burst spectra from the LMXB 4 U 1608 - 52, {{with the aim of}} studying how the different persistent emission components react to the bursts. During some bursts in the soft spectral state we find that there are two variable components; one corresponding to the burst blackbody component and another optically thick Comptonized component. We interpret the latter as the <b>spreading</b> <b>layer</b> between the NS surface and the accretion disc, which is not present during the hard state bursts. We propose that the spectral changes during the soft state bursts are driven by the <b>spreading</b> <b>layer</b> that could cover almost the entire NS in the brightest phases due to the enhanced radiation pressure support provided by the burst, and that the layer subsequently returns to its original state during the burst decay. When deriving the NS mass and radius using the soft state bursts two assumptions are therefore not met: the NS is not entirely visible and the burst emission is reprocessed in the <b>spreading</b> <b>layer,</b> causing distortions of the emitted spectrum. For these reasons the NS mass and radius constraints using the soft state bursts are different compared to the ones derived using the hard state bursts.

40|$|When a {{white dwarf}} (WD) is weakly {{magnetized}} and its accretion disk is thin, accreted material first reaches the WD’s surface at its equator. This matter slows its orbit {{as it comes}} into co-rotation with the WD, dissipating kinetic energy into thermal energy and creating a hot band of freshly accreted material around the equator. Radiating in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-rays, this material moves toward the pole as new material piles behind it, eventually {{becoming part of the}} WD once it has a temperature and rotational velocity comparable with the surface. We present a set of solutions which describe the properties of this “spreading layer ” in the steady state limit based on the conservation equations derived by Inogamov & Sunyaev (1999) for accreting neutron stars. Our analysis and subsequent solutions show that the case of WDs is qualitatively different. We investigate example solutions of the <b>spreading</b> <b>layer</b> for a WD of mass M = 0. 6 M ⊙ and radius R = 9 × 10 8 cm.

At low accretion rates, ˙M � 10 18 g s − 1, the amount of spreading is negligible and most of the dissipated energy is radiated back into the accretion disk.

40|$|Much {{study has}} been {{performed}} on the mixing properties of submerged, turbulent buoyant jets. It {{is safe to say}} that the problem of estimating dilution rates in vertical buoyant jets spreading in an `infinitely deep' ambient water has been more than adequately resolved by previous researchers. However, the majority of environmental applications involve discharges into ambient waters of finite depths in which a bounding surface serves to re-direct the impinging buoyant jet horizontally into a radial <b>spreading</b> <b>layer.</b> Previous research indicates that this impinging jet undergoes additional mixing before buoyancy stabilizes vertical mixing and confines the <b>spreading</b> <b>layer</b> to the vicinity of the bounding surface. Unfortunately, the conceptualization and subsequent mathematical modeling of this additional mixing phenomenon is surrounded by considerable amount of disagreement between researchers. The purpose of this study is to provide, by means of velocity and concentration profile measurements, independent experimental evidence for the existence of a critical flow state immediately downstream of the active mixing zone in the horizontally flowing, radial flow that forms after impingement. It is further shown that this critical flow state must be expressed in terms of a composite Froude Number that takes into account the possibility of a non-zero exchange layer flow. Finally, the influence of the presence of a sill-like topographic downstream control on the criticality of the radial flow immediately downstream of the active mixing zone is also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we study}} the surface dilational {{properties}} of <b>spread</b> and adsorbed <b>layers</b> of whey protein isolate (WPI) and hydrophobin HFBII at air/water interface using Langmuir trough and relate them to foam ability and stability. In spread and adsorbed systems, a gradual increase in modulus with {{the fraction of}} HFBII on the surface or in the bulk is observed and we can identify distinct regimes of WPI-dominated and HFBII-dominated behaviour. The dominance of HFBII is further substantiated by visual observation of microscopic wrinkles appearing {{on the surface of}} the trough. When comparing spread to adsorbed systems, it was found that a higher HFBII fraction is needed to obtain HFBII dominant behaviour in <b>spread</b> <b>layers</b> than in case of adsorbing layers (f(HFBII) = 0. 6 and 0. 2 respectively). Furthermore, our results indicate that the HFBII-contribution to the interfacial behaviour becomes more pronounced upon sequential large scale compression/expansion cycles. In order to explain this non-trivial behaviour, we propose that there is multi-layer formation at the interface, having a top layer enriched in HFBII and bottom layer enriched in WPI. It is also concluded that coarsening stability in foams corresponds more closely to the surface dilational properties measured in adsorbing layers than those in <b>spread</b> <b>layers.</b> Finally, it was observed that in mixed systems of HFBII and WPI, the coarsening process levels off, which corresponds to the increased dominance of HFBII in mixed WPI:HFBII-layers upon large surface deformation that is occurring at the surface of shrinking bubbles.

40|$|Spectra of the {{spreading}} layers on the neutron star surface are calculated {{on the basis}} of the Inogamov-Sunyaev model taking into account general relativity correction to the surface gravity and considering various chemical composition of the accreting matter. Local (at a given latitude) spectra are similar to the X-ray burst spectra and are described by a diluted black body. Total <b>spreading</b> <b>layer</b> spectra are integrated accounting for the light bending, gravitational redshift, and the relativistic Doppler effect and aberration. They depend slightly on the inclination angle and on the luminosity. These spectra also can be fitted by a diluted black body with the color temperature depending mainly on a neutron star compactness.

30|$|To summarize, the PNP-AlGaN {{junction}} for DUV LEDs are explored and demonstrated. Assisted by {{the proposed}} PNP-AlGaN junctions, the current spreading {{effect can be}} improved. The improved current spreading effect is well attributed to increased the vertical resistance and the enhanced horizontal current flow. Moreover, we have also conducted the parametric study to reveal different PNP-junctions on the current spreading effect, the EQE and the WPE. We find that by properly increasing the thickness, the doping concentration, the AlN composition for the n-AlGaN insertion layer, and the number for the PNP-AlGaN junction, the current spreading effect can be improved. On the other hand, we also find that the current spreading effect can indeed enhance the EQE. However, the forward voltage may be increased if the PNP-AlGaN junction is not fully optimized, the cost {{of which is the}} reduced WPE. It is also worthy pointing out that the current spreading feature is the cooperative function of the thickness, the doping concentration, the AlN composition for the n-AlGaN insertion layer, and the number for the PNP-AlGaN junction. As a result, there is no unique answer for the best design of the PNP-AlGaN current <b>spreading</b> <b>layer</b> for DUV LEDs.
