5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a <b>software</b> <b>patent</b> owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the positions of}} Danish software companies on <b>software</b> <b>patents</b> from an empirical perspective. <b>Software</b> <b>patents</b> in Denmark have been debated intensively within the last five years, and is still a controversial issue characterized {{by a lack of}} empirical evidence on the link between <b>software</b> <b>patents</b> and innovation, and a great disagreement within the software sector on the issue. The thesis {{examines the}} positions of the software sector on <b>software</b> <b>patents,</b> based both on a questionnaire submitted to a sample of enterprises from the two largest IT trade organizations in Denmark, and a case study of six selected enterprises from the mentioned sample. The questionnaire focuses on the impacts on positions from three unique descriptive characteristics of the software sector: development behaviour, company size and business sector. The case study focuses on the normative arguments behind the positions of the enterprises. The results of the study shows that the software sector is far from convinced on the matter of <b>software</b> <b>patents.</b> Generally the enterprises slightly favour the concept of <b>software</b> <b>patents,</b> while they do not make use of patents in practice. Moreover the study shows that the software sector has a cumulative development behaviour and that correlations between positions and company size and business sector are not highly evident. However, the majority of micro enterprises are sceptical towards <b>software</b> <b>patents,</b> while the small enterprises surprisingly are the most supportive ones. Finally results from the questionnaire showed, that the enterprises expect a rise in legal expenses if <b>patents</b> on <b>software</b> 'as such' would be introduced, while the case study at the same time showed, that the majority of enterprises did not expect any rise in innovation due to <b>software</b> <b>patents.</b> The conclusion is that the positions of Danish software enterprises on <b>software</b> <b>patents</b> only are influenced very little by company size and even less by business sector. Furthermore it is concluded, that the position of Danish software companies on <b>software</b> <b>patents</b> are unsettled - they are positive in principle, but skeptical in practice...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the value creation or destruction {{associated with the}} introduction of <b>software</b> <b>patents</b> in the United States in two ways.

Ex post, a greater number of firms in all ICT sectors invested in these patents, and these firms had slightly higher market values than those with no <b>software</b> <b>patents.</b> However, while we obtain clear evidence that the technological importance or quality of patented innovation mattered for the market value of hardware firms {{both before and after the}} legal changes, it is less clear that the marginal patent right per se was associated with increases in market value, and there are no significant valuation effects associated with <b>patents</b> for pure <b>software</b> firms after the change. <b>Software</b> <b>patents</b> Intellectual property rights Patent value...|$|R
