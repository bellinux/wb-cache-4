40|$|The {{current study}} investigates the {{relationship}} between aspects of gender role and differences in depression between men and women. Aspects of gender role investigated are instrumentality/expressivity, <b>silencing</b> <b>the</b> self, and private self-consciousness. It was hypothesized that these aspects of gender role orientation will significantly predict vulnerability/invulnerability to depression on a measure of depressive symptomatology. Specifically, {{it was hypothesized that}} individuals adopting a more expressive gender role are likely to show higher scores on private self-consciousness, <b>silencing</b> <b>the</b> self, and depression than individuals socialized into a more instrumental gender role. Additionally, <b>the</b> relationship between <b>silencing</b> <b>the</b> self behaviours and private self-consciousness was examined, as this relationship has not been investigated to date. Results supported a negative relationship between instrumentality and depression for men only. This relationship became nonsignificant when self-esteem was controlled. There was a negative relationship between instrumentality and <b>silencing</b> <b>the</b> self even after controlling for sex, suggesting that higher instrumentality is related to less self-silencing in either sex. Analysis of covariance reveals that <b>silencing</b> <b>the</b> self and private self-consciousness have a significant relation to depression when sex differences are analyzed for the influence of gender role characteristics. Further regression analyses indicate that <b>silencing</b> <b>the</b> self serves as a reliable predictor of depressive symptomatology. It is suggested that private self-consciousness may moderate sex differences in depression and have a link to <b>silencing</b> <b>the</b> self through the influence of self-reflectiveness.

5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company {{to move through the}} wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and <b>silence</b> <b>the</b> gun.|$|E

During this period, she escorted an Indian troop convoy to Bahrain in mid-October; the convoy had departed India on 16 October, and Ocean met the convoy at sea three days later to take over escort duties. After the convoy arrived on 3 November, Ocean began making preparations for the attack on Basra. Numerous small craft were armed to enter the Shatt al-Arab, the river leading to Basra. The first objective was to <b>silence</b> <b>the</b> old fortress at Al-Faw. On 5 November, Britain declared war on the Ottoman Empire, and the next morning, Ocean began the bombardment of Al-Faw.

5|$|Holmes {{spent the}} next five years {{gathering}} supporters for his grassroots movement, traveling at his own expense to gather petition signatures from across the state. On January 14, 1855, Holmes went to the state capital of Lansing to lobby the legislature for an agricultural college. He {{spent the next}} four weeks championing the bill he wrote and cementing support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Though many legislators supported the basic concept of a state-funded agricultural college, there was strong opposition from University of Michigan president Henry Tappan, who wanted the agriculture program to be part of his school. Nevertheless, Holmes prevailed. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed Act 130, establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the school that would become Michigan State University. The final draft of the bill held only two significant differences from the one that Holmes presented: that the purchase price not exceed US $15 per acre, rather than the $25 Holmes desired; and that the site must be within ten miles (16km) of Lansing, a provision added to <b>silence</b> <b>the</b> various factions that wanted the new college built in their own backyards.|$|E
5|$|The {{crews of}} the {{schooner}} {{and of the}} two batteries guarding the harbour had seen Emerald but Maitland still made plans to attack Apropos. He soon discovered {{it was not possible}} to place Emerald so as to engage both enemy batteries simultaneously, and instead sent landing parties to <b>silence</b> <b>the</b> guns, which had been firing on his ship since 17:30. The first landing party, led by Lieutenant Bertram and accompanied by two marine lieutenants and two master mates, stormed the outer fort. Maitland then positioned Emerald close to the second battery while a boat under the command of his third lieutenant, Smith, landed about a mile along the shore. This second landing party encountered Spanish soldiers, but drove them off and pursued them inland. By the time Smith's party returned to the beach, Emerald had already silenced the battery. In the darkness, Smith subsequently failed to locate the fort.|$|E

Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E

5|$|Warwick's army heavily outnumbered Edward's, {{although}} sources {{differ on}} exact numbers. Lancastrian strength ranges from 10,000–30,000 men, with 7,000–15,000 on the Yorkist side. Facing this disadvantage, Edward hurried {{to meet the}} Lancastrians with a surprise attack. He brought Henry VI along to prevent the Lancastrians from retaking their king. Edward reached Barnet in the evening, and without knowing the precise location of his foes, prepared the battle line. The Yorkist king deployed Hastings {{on the left and}} entrusted Gloucester to lead the right flank. Clarence would fight alongside Edward in the centre, although this was not due to faith in his ability—it was easier for the Yorkists {{to keep an eye on}} their twice-defected prince there. A contingent of reserves was kept at the rear, ready to deploy at Edward's call. As night fell, Edward put his plan for surprise morning attack in motion. Under a strict order of <b>silence,</b> <b>the</b> Yorkist army crept closer to the Lancastrians. During the night, neither commander spotted the opposing army, an event that proved crucial in the battle the next day.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much-diminished city of Tikal, as {{evidenced}} by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan K'awiil II in 869. This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into <b>silence.</b> <b>The</b> former satellites of Tikal, such as Jimbal and Uaxactun, did not last much longer, erecting their final monuments in 889. By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal's population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city's ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities, far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for jade and the easier-to-find tombs were looted. After 950, Tikal was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of Tikal's population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Seeing this inauspicious development, Wrede {{sent his}} cavalry, {{no less than}} 7,000 men, to charge Drouot's grand battery. The steady French {{canister}} fire was devastating and many Coalition squadrons turned back to safety. Some of them did manage {{to get to the}} French guns and crossed the battery, with the Guard cavalry immediately countercharging and driving them off. With the gun line now out of danger, Nansouty, with the aid of Sebastiani's cuirassiers launched a pursuit of the repulsed enemy horse, encountering and breaking an Austrian cuirassier regiment, the Knesevich Dragoon regiment and two Bavarian chevaulegers regiments, all under the personal command of Field Marshal-Lieutenant Franz Splény de Miháldy. Then, with a manoeuvre resembling that of Kellermann at Marengo, Nansouty wheeled his men left and rushed onto the enemy infantry, breaking them. The Grenadiers-à-Cheval were {{in the thick of the}} fighting and, with an offensive comeback of the Bavarian cavalry, they were momentarily in a dangerous situation, but were duly rescued by the Gardes d'Honneur regiment. Nansouty then took his entire cavalry and broke the remaining enemy squares and cavalry, pushing some of these men into the Kinzig river. Meanwhile, Nansouty's action left Sebastiani free to <b>silence</b> <b>the</b> Bavarian grand battery, skilfully using Saint-Germain's cuirassier division and Exelmans's light division of his Corps. Nansouty received a light wound during this battle, but his role at Hanau is compared by a Russian author to that of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz at the Battle of Zorndorf.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois {{spoke with}} its {{president}} about {{the creation of}} a new encyclopedia of the African diaspora, the Encyclopedia Africana. In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited Du Bois to come to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana. While it is sometimes stated that he renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he did state his intention to do so, Du Bois never actually did. His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana, and he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital of Accra at the age of 95. Du Bois was buried in Accra near his home, which is now the Du Bois Memorial Centre. A day after his death, at the March on Washington, speaker Roy Wilkins asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor Du Bois with a moment of <b>silence.</b> <b>The</b> Civil Rights Act of 1964, embodying many of the reforms Du Bois had campaigned for his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.|$|E
