5000|$|The {{quick return}} {{mechanism}} was {{modeled after the}} crank and <b>slider</b> (<b>arm),</b> and this is present in its appearance and function; however, the crank is usually hand powered and the arm has the same rate throughout an entire revolution, whereas {{the arm of a}} quick return mechanism returns at a faster rate. The [...] "quick return" [...] allows for the arm to function with less energy during the cut than the initial cycle of the disc.|$|E
50|$|The {{retracted}} {{position of the}} slider is determined by further graphical evaluation. Now that the crank path is found, draw the crank <b>slider</b> <b>arm</b> in the position that places it {{as far away as}} possible from the slider. Once drawn, the crank arm should be coincident with the ground level axis that was initially drawn. Next, from the free point on the crank arm, draw the follower link using its measured or given length. Draw this length coincident with the ground level axis but in the direction toward the slider. The unhinged end of the follower will now be at the fully {{retracted position}} of the slider. Next, the extended position of the slider needs to be determined. From the pivot point of the crank arm, draw a new crank arm coincident with the ground level axis but in a position closest to the slider. This position should put the new crank arm at an angle of 180 degrees away from the retracted crank arm. Then draw the follower link with its given length {{in the same manner as}} previously mentioned. The unhinged point of the new follower will now be at the fully extended position of the slider.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Airflows between {{centrally}} clamped, rotating, rigid disks are investigated {{with respect}} to the type of flow pattern, the parameters that influence nonuniform flow, and the effects of various flow patterns on disk stability. The experimental method uses a waterflow modeling technique for the airflow. The observed flow patterns are highly unsteady. The configuration and position of the shroud and <b>slider</b> <b>arm</b> are found to be the major parameters that influence flow characteristics. A reduction of disk flutter by a factor of 12 can be achieved when the unsteady flow pattern is changed to a steady flow pattern...|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of new technologies in the field of hard drives we can witness a significant increase of surface density and transfer rate of interfaces which, as a result, enables greater performance and reliability of hard disks. The reason for this are increasing needs for higher capacities and data transfer rate to or from the hard disk. This thesis presents the structure of hard drives, features, performance and reliability of hard drives and alternative data storage technologies. Particular emphasis is to develop technologies that contribute significantly to the reduction of magnetic domains on the plates, thereby increasing the surface density. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the development of hard disks over the years and the basic principles of their operation are examined. A detailed description of the structure of hard drives with all the components follows. The longitudinal magnetic recording, which was used in the past, and perpendicular magnetic recording, which is used today, are presented. Furthermore, the recording media - platters with their layer structure, read-write heads, <b>sliders,</b> <b>arms</b> and actuator, technology of parking read-write heads on or off the platters, spindle motor, hard disk controller, cache on the disk, the standard form factors of hard drives and different interfacesn are presented. Next the characteristics of hard disks are described, including the areal density and the record format on the hard disk. When talking about performance of hard drives, the emphasis is on the speed of data transmission, the average access time and the impact of cache on the hard disk performance. Followed by a chapter on the reliability of hard drives in anticipation of the possibility of errors on hard disks. The final chapter describes the alternative data storage technologies, including Hybrid hard drives, Heat-assisted magnetic recording, Self-Ordered Magnetic Arrays technology and Pixie Dust. ...|$|R
5000|$|Another Mesopotamian tactic {{involved}} small, well-disciplined (for the time) spearman formations. Armed with javelins, {{they were}} the first effective missile troops, as shown during their war against the Hittites in around 2000 BC. These missile units were later idealized in the famous epic poem [...] "The Sie." [...] The Mesopotamian battle formation consisted of the shield wall and short-sword <b>armed</b> <b>sliders</b> in front, and the missile troops behind, with charioteers on the flanks. These formations served the Mesopotamians well for many years, but were eventually outclassed by slingers and archers.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} factors that limit the {{performance}} of the servo system in current magnetic disk drives and prevent significant increases in track density. It is common in present hard disk drives that there exist some vibration modes between 2 kHz and 10 kHz, which involve coupled vibrations of <b>slider,</b> suspension, <b>arm</b> and bearing assembly. These modes are particularly troublesome for the servo system. So, a thorough understanding of the dynamic behavior of the head actuator is essential to control the vibration in future high-performance disk drives. The finite element model of a full head actuator is included. From the contributions of each mode and the DC gains, a system model can be established for control design. Experimental techniques are also proposed to evaluate the dynamic properties of VCM actuator-arm-suspension–slider–air-bearing systems. Through the comparison and correlation of the experimental and FEM results, it has been established that the FE modeling method is quite accurate for drive systems...|$|R
40|$|Power window {{regulator}} is {{a mechanism for}} raising and lowering door glass. It consists {{of a set of}} gear, electric motor and door sash channels. For this project, power window design of the Proton Gen- 2 was selected, where the improvement had been made at main <b>arm</b> and <b>slider.</b> The main <b>arm</b> and <b>slider</b> was designed using CAD software. Then, the design was analyzed using FMEA method and FEA (ALGOR) software. These analyses were done to find the best design that can optimize the operation for the stress analysis. There is one design for main arm and two designs for slider had been done. The analysis showed that both of the new designs are better compared to current design. For the both designs, the result showed that when force are applied, the displacement of improvement design that occur is lowest than current design. In conclusion, this improvement can reduce the cost of repairing because the improvement made can hopefully reduce the failure occurrence for that specific power window mechanism...|$|R
