In this study, the feeding woodchips, <b>stack</b> <b>flue</b> gases and the ashes in different units of a woodchip-fuelled boiler are sampled to investigate their PCDD/F characteristics. The PCDD/F contents in the bottom residues and fly ashes ranged from 18. 9 to 66. 3 ng I-TEQ/kg, which are below the Taiwanese PCDD/F regulation for reutilization of bottom residues, but still higher than PCDD/F limitations on soils for agricultural use (10 ng I-TEQ/kg), which are adopted by several countries. From the PCDD/F output/input ratios, we found that combustion of woodchips in the boiler system is more favourable for the formations of PCDFs by de novo syntheses, especially for lower chlorinated PCDF congeners. Although about half of the input PCDD/Fs mass are destroyed in the combustion, the output PCDD/Fs toxicity are 6. 9 times higher than the inputs. Fly ashes exhibited the highest PCDD/F distributions among the woodchip-fuelled boiler. Still 21. 4 % of total PCDD/F mass and 18. 0 % of total PCDD/F toxicity were emitted from the <b>stack</b> <b>flue</b> gases due to the lack of control devices for gaseous phase PCDD/Fs.

Elevated PCDD/F (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and furan) emissions during start-up stages are caused by combustion of waste with high chlorine contents, incomplete combustion, and so called "memory effects". Even though the duration of cold start-up is short compared with the hours of continuous steady operation in a waste incinerator, its negative effects with regard to PCDD/F emissions on both {{human health and the}} environment cannot be neglected. A full-scale laboratory-waste incinerator which is operated for 10 days in each run and has 15 to 20 runs annually was investigated in this study. Eleven PCDD/F samples of <b>stack</b> <b>flue</b> gas were collected during the cold start-up periods (for 60. 5 hrs).

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{incinerators}} (MSWIs) {{have been shown}} to be important sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). The emission of PCDD/Fs by MSWIs is a controversial subject in human health risk assessment. In this study the effect of a MSWI on a residential area was assessed before and after the installation of an additional treatment system for flue gas. This additional treatment system resulted in a dramatic decrease in PCDD/F concentrations in <b>stack</b> <b>flue</b> gas samples by 99. 98 %, while the concentrations in air decreased by approximately 50 % (36, 500 and 0. 75 pg I-TEQ m- 3 for air in 1999; 3. 5 and 0. 38 pg I-TEQ m- 3 in 2002; 1. 6 and 0. 076 pg I-TEQ m- 3 in 2005 for stack gas and air, respectively). Considering the congener distributions of PCDD/Fs between <b>stack</b> <b>flue</b> gas and air samples, the study area seemed to have been contaminated by other urban sources as well as the MSWI. ISC 3 model results support the conclusion that this incinerator became only a minor contributor to the study area after installation of the supplementary systems. This resulted from both proper MSWI operation using modern technology and additional sources of contaminants in this region. Finally, PCDD/F uptake by humans through inhalation of contaminated air was estimated. Assuming that inhalation exposure contributes 10 % of total exposure, total exposure was lower than WHO guidelines. These results confirm that proper operation and maintenance of the incinerator led to a reduction in emissions and potential health impacts of PCDD/Fs. close 262...|$|E

With the concentration of pollutant, it gives access {{to the amount of}} pollutant released in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, flow rate measurement has not been well-framed and can be poorly controlled, leading to large uncertainties. The recent launch of the European Standard EN 16 911 has enlighten the lack of expertise concerning the flow rate assessment in the industry. That is why RECORD, the project sponsor, conscious of the possible lack of expertise and the possible unreliability of the measurement is willing to understand the requirements; theoretical, technical and regulatory; for a reliable pollutant emissions measurement in accordance with the EU regulation in the field of waste treatment and incineration. Thus, this study offers the theoretical, operational and regulatory keys to realize a reliable flow rate measurement. 9 methods are identified for <b>stack</b> <b>flue</b> gases flow rate measurement. For each of these methods an ID-card, based on bibliographical researches, supplier’s interviews and representatives of the industry’s feedbacks, has been built containing information required for a reliable measurement.

In this program CONSOL is determining mercury speciation and removal at 10 coal-fired facilities. The objectives are (1) to evaluate the effect of SCR on mercury capture in the ESP-FGD and SDA-FF combinations at coal-fired power plants, (2) evaluate the effect of catalyst degradation on mercury capture; (3) evaluate the effect of low load operation on mercury capture in an SCR-FGD system, and (4) collect data that could provide the basis for fundamental scientific insights into the nature of mercury chemistry in flue gas, the catalytic effect of SCR systems on mercury speciation and the efficacy of different FGD technologies for mercury capture. This document, the seventh in a series of topical reports, describes the results and analysis of mercury sampling performed on a 1, 300 MW unit burning a bituminous coal containing three percent sulfur. The unit was equipped with an ESP and a limestone-based wet FGD to control particulate and SO 2 emissions, respectively. At the time of sampling an SCR was not installed on this unit. Four sampling tests were performed in September 2003. Flue gas mercury speciation and concentrations were determined at the ESP outlet (FGD inlet), and at the stack (FGD outlet) using the Ontario Hydro method. Process stream samples for a mercury balance were collected to coincide with the flue gas measurements. The results show that the FGD inlet flue gas oxidized:elemental mercury ratio was roughly 2 : 1, with 66 % oxidized mercury and 34 % elemental mercury. Mercury removal, on a coal-to-stack basis, was 53 %. The average Hg concentration in the <b>stack</b> <b>flue</b> gas was 4. 09 {micro}g/m{sup 3 }. The average stack mercury emission was 3. 47 Ib/TBtu. The mercury material balance closures ranged from 87 % to 108 %, with an average of 97 %. A sampling program similar to this one was performed on a similar unit (at the same plant) that was equipped with an SCR for NOx control. Comparison of the results from the two units show that the SCR increases the percentage of mercury that is in the oxidized form, which, in turn, lends to more of the total mercury being removed in the wet scrubber. The principal purpose of this work is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} potential mercury removal ''co-benefits'' achieved by NOx, and SO{sub 2 } control technologies. It is expected that this data will provide the basis for fundamental scientific insights into the nature of mercury chemistry in flue gas, the catalytic effect of SCR systems on mercury speciation and the efficacy of different FGD technologies for mercury capture.

Some material is incorporated by reference from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test method: Method 1. 1. 0 Scope and Application 1. 1 Measured Parameters. The purpose of the method is to provide guidance for the selection of sampling ports and traverse points at which sampling for air pollutants will be performed pursuant to regulations set forth in this part. 1. 2 Applicability. The applicability and principle of this method are identical to Method 1, except its applicability is limited to stacks or ducts. This method is applicable to flowing gas streams in ducts, <b>stacks,</b> and <b>flues</b> of less than about 0. 30 meter (12 in.) in diameter, or 0. 071 m 2 (113 in. 2) in cross-sectional area, but {{equal to or greater}} than about 0. 10 meter (4 in.) in diameter, or 0. 0081 m 2 (12. 57 in. 2) in cross-sectional area. This method cannot be used when the flow is cyclonic or swirling. 1. 3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance th...|$|R
40|$|To {{aid in the}} {{representative}} measurement of pollutant emissions and/or total volumetric flow rate from a stationary source, a measurement site where the effluent stream is flowing in a known direction is selected, and the cross-section of the stack is divided {{into a number of}} equal areas. A traverse point is then located within each of these equal areas. 1. 2 Applicability This method is applicable to flowing gas streams in ducts, <b>stacks,</b> and <b>flues.</b> The method cannot be used when: (1) flow is cyclonic or swirling (see Section 2. 4); (2) a stack is smaller than about 0. 30 meter (12 in.) in diameter or 0. 071 m 2 (113 in. 2) in cross-sectional area; or (3) the measurement site is less than two stack or duct diameters downstream or less than a half diameter upstream from a flow disturbance. The requirements of this method must be considered before construction of a new facility from which emissions will be measured; failure to do so may require subsequent alterations to the stack or deviation from the standard procedure. Cases involving variants are subject to approval by the Executive Officer. Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shall be considered a major modification subject to the approval of the Executive Officer. The term Executive Officer as used in this document shall mean the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board (ARB), or his or her authorized representative...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the <b>flue</b> <b>stack</b> and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|R
40|$|DE 19719004 A UPAB: 20030402 The {{sheet metal}} {{composite}} can be cold-formed. It is especially {{intended as a}} material for use in environmental- and chemical process engineering. It comprises a metallic supporting substrate (4) and a covering (5). Either or both carry a bonding layer (6). In the cross-linked state, the layer has viscoelastic properties. Also claimed is use of materials cross-linking to elastomers, especially moisture cross-linked polyurethane adhesives or -sealing masses, to make sheet, cold-deformable composite as described, with the carbon steel substrate and corrosion-resistant metallic covering. Also claimed is use of the composite metallic sheet in plants old and new for environmental- and chemical process technology. It is used especially in channels and <b>stacks</b> used in <b>flue</b> gas desulphurisation. Preferably, it also forms vessels used in old and new chemical plants. USE - Sheet steel composite material with structural uses, having highly corrosion-resistant side, for long operational life in hostile environments.
