5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the <b>salami</b> <b>tactics</b> to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians {{cooperated with the}} left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss {{the idea of a}} party merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E

5000|$|Founded on 12 October 1930, the {{original}} party won {{an overwhelming majority}} in the first elections after the Second World War, resulting in its leader, Zoltán Tildy, becoming prime minister. In the relatively free elections in November 1945, the Smallholders' polled 57% of votes against the Communists' 17%. The Communist response was to intensify terror and to sponsor the coalition of [...] "democratic" [...] parties against the [...] "reactionary" [...] smallholders. The Smallholders-dominated parliament established a republic in 1946 with Tildy as president. He was succeeded as prime minister by Ferenc Nagy. However, the Soviet occupation of the country, the Hungarian Communist Party's <b>salami</b> <b>tactic</b> to break up opponent parties and widespread election fraud in 1947 elections led to a communist government.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Salami</b> <b>tactics,</b> {{also known}} as the salami-slice strategy, is a divide and conquer process of threats and alliances used to {{overcome}} opposition. With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated [...] "slice by slice" [...] until one realizes (too late) that it is gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the 'sliced' sides to protest. <b>Salami</b> <b>tactics</b> are most likely to succeed when the perpetrators keep their true long-term motives hidden and maintain a posture of cooperativeness and helpfulness while engaged in the intended gradual subversion.|$|E
5000|$|Lukács's {{personal}} {{aesthetic and}} political position on culture was always that Socialist culture would eventually triumph {{in terms of}} quality. He thought it should play out in terms of competing cultures, not by [...] "administrative" [...] measures. In 1948-49 Lukács's position for cultural tolerance was smashed in a [...] "Lukács purge," [...] when Mátyás Rákosi turned his famous <b>salami</b> <b>tactics</b> on the Hungarian Communist Party.|$|E
5000|$|Parliamentary elections, {{which later}} became infamously the [...] "blue-ballot" [...] elections, {{were held in}} Hungary on 31 August 1947. The Hungarian Communist Party, which had lost the {{previous}} election, consolidated its power in the interim using <b>salami</b> <b>tactics.</b> This fact, combined with the weakening of the opposition and a revised electoral law, led to further Communist gains. It was Hungary's last remotely competitive election before 1990.|$|E
5000|$|After 1945, the {{political}} life of Hungary {{was dominated by}} the Soviets. The Hungarian Communist Party first made a coalition with all other parties in the National Assembly, but eventually the Communist Party's leader, Mátyás Rákosi implemented a strategy of pressing the non-Communist parties to gradually push out their anti-Soviet elements as [...] "fascists", a strategy he later called <b>salami</b> <b>tactics.</b> Within three years, every party had either vanished or been rendered impotent.|$|E
50|$|In the National Assembly Drozdy {{belongs to}} {{the right wing of}} the Smallholders Party, which meant that he {{strongly}} opposed the initiatives of the Hungarian Communist Party. In his speech in July 1946 he voices warnings and strong opposition of the Communistic One-party state. No wonder that he is the first victim of the <b>Salami</b> <b>tactics</b> of the Hungarian Communist Party, and is among the first politicians forced out of his own party on March 10. 1946.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II, the Soviet Army {{occupied}} Hungary, {{with the}} country coming under the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. Immediately after World War II, Hungary was a multiparty democracy, and elections in 1945 produced a coalition government under Prime Minister Zoltán Tildy. However, the Hungarian Communist Party, a Marxist-Leninist group who shared the Soviet government's ideological beliefs, constantly wrested small concessions in a process named <b>salami</b> <b>tactics,</b> which sliced away the elected government's influence, {{despite the fact that}} it had received only 17% of the vote.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>Salami</b> <b>tactics</b> (szalámitaktika) {{was coined}} {{in the late}} 1940s by the {{orthodox}} communist leader Mátyás Rákosi to describe {{the actions of the}} Hungarian Communist Party. Rakosi claimed he destroyed the non-Communist parties by [...] "cutting them off like slices of salami." [...] By portraying his opponents as fascists (or at the very least fascist sympathizers), he was able to get the opposition to slice off its right wing, then its centrists, then the more courageous left wingers, until only those fellow travelers willing to collaborate with the Communists remained in power.|$|E
5000|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} Hungary on 4 November 1945. They came at a turbulent moment in the country's history: World War II had had a devastating impact; the Soviet Union was occupying it, with the Hungarian Communist Party growing in numbers; a land reform that March had radically altered the property structure; and inflation was rampant. The Independent Smallholders Party won a sweeping victory, but its gains were gradually whittled away by Communist <b>salami</b> <b>tactics,</b> fulfilling the prediction of their leader Mátyás Rákosi that the defeat would [...] "not {{play an important role}} in Communist plans".|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{rapid growth}} in {{membership}} immediately following the war, the party refounded under the name MKP received 17 percent in the elections, equal to the Hungarian Social Democratic Party. But the appointment of party secretary László Rajk as Minister of the Interior, coupled {{with the presence of}} the Red Army in the country and strong support for the MKP within other parties, allowed the Hungarian Communists time to whittle away their political opponents. Party leader Mátyás Rákosi implemented a strategy of pressuring the non-Communist parties to gradually push out their more courageous elements as [...] "fascists," [...] a strategy he later called <b>salami</b> <b>tactics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Hungarian Working People's Party (Magyar Dolgozók Pártja, MDP) was {{the ruling}} {{communist}} party of Hungary from 1948 to 1956. It {{was formed by}} a merger of the Hungarian Communist Party (MKP) and the Hungarian Social Democratic Party. [...] Ostensibly a union of equals, the merger had actually occurred {{as a result of}} massive pressure brought to bear on the Social Democrats by both the Hungarian Communists, as well as the Soviet Union. The few independent-minded Social Democrats who had not been sidelined by Communist <b>salami</b> <b>tactics</b> were pushed out in short order after the merger, leaving the party as essentially the MKP under a new name.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP) won a {{sweeping}} victory in the November 1945 parliamentary election, the party was forced to enter a coalition with the left-wing parties, including Mátyás Rákosi's Hungarian Communist Party (MKP), which was the only kind of government acceptable to the Soviet-dominated Allied Control Commission (SZEB) led by Marshal Klement Voroshilov. The FKGP's gains were gradually whittled away by the Communist Rákosi's <b>salami</b> <b>tactics.</b> At first the right-wing branch of the FKGP became the first victims of the Communist pressure. Dezső Sulyok and his supporters were forced out of their party on 10 March 1946. Fifteen expelled party members founded a new party called the Hungarian Freedom Party on 15 March 1946. The Allied Control Commission has taken note and allowed the foundation on 24 July 1946.|$|E
5000|$|The party {{supported}} the Polish resistance during World War II as the underground Polish Socialist Party - Freedom, Equality, Independence (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna - Wolność, Równość, Niepodległość). In 1948 it suffered a fatal split, as the communists applied the <b>salami</b> <b>tactics</b> to dismember any opposition. One faction, which included Edward Osóbka-Morawski {{wanted to join}} forces with the Polish Peasant Party and form a united front against the Communists. Another faction, led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, argued that the Socialists should support the Communists in carrying through a socialist program, while opposing the imposition of one-party rule. Pre-war political hostilities continued to influence events, and Stanisław Mikołajczyk, leader of the Peasant Party, would not agree to form a united front with the Socialists. The Communists played on these divisions by dismissing Osóbka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister.|$|E
5000|$|Rákosi's {{leadership}} {{consisted of}} Mihály Farkas the Minister of Defence. Kádár and Béla Kovács noted with puzzlement the leadership's {{total lack of}} interest in the domestic Communist's experience and outlook. As head of cadres, Kádár supervised membership appointments to the party. This position gave him contacts, some of whom would become very important to him in his later life. After failing to secure a majority in Parliament after the 1945 election, the Communist leadership started the divide and conquer strategy known as <b>salami</b> <b>tactics.</b> Kádár became a prominent figure during the period between the 1945 and the 1947 Hungarian parliamentary elections. Kádár had evolved a sense of rivalry with the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, claiming the party was [...] "thrashing" [...] them in government, and that they made it impossible for the Communists to negotiate policy with the Hungarian trade unions.|$|E
50|$|However, the Smallholders' {{left wing}} thwarted a {{coalition}} initiative {{from the two}} main opposition parties, and the old coalition remained. The manageable Smallholder Lajos Dinnyés remained as Prime Minister, and dutiful fellow travelers from the other parties were named to the cabinet {{for the sake of}} preserving the parliamentary facade. Even {{this turned out to be}} completely redundant very soon thereafter, with the gradualist approach abandoned and <b>salami</b> <b>tactics</b> accelerated. The Cominform came into being just days after the new Dinnyés government was formed. In December, Dinnyés himself was replaced by the leader of the Smallholders' left wing, the openly pro-Communist István Dobi. Intimidation, targeting of the increasingly submissive democratic parties (and absorption of the Social Democrats), nationalisation, collectivisation and other measures soon rendered the period 1945-47 a short democratic interlude, and the coalition became a mere memory a year and a half later, with the Communists wielding exclusive power.|$|E
5000|$|The term is {{also known}} as a [...] "piecemeal strategy", as used by the Nazi Party (which used the term Gleichschaltung) to achieve {{absolute}} power in Germany in the early months of 1933. First, there was the Reichstag fire of February 27, 1933, which rattled the German population and led to the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended many civil liberties and outlawed the Communist Party and the Social Democrats. An estimated 10,000 people were arrested in two weeks, soon followed by the Enabling Act on March 24, 1933, which gave Hitler plenary power, allowing him to bypass the Reichstag and further consolidate power. Hitler and the Nazis continued to systematically establish totalitarian control by eliminating potential opponents, such as trade unions and rival political parties. They also established organizations with mandatory membership, such as the Hitler Youth, Bund Deutscher Mädel and Arbeitsdienst. The Enabling Act was renewed in 1937 and 1941. Finally, on April 26, 1942, the Reichstag passed a law making Hitler the oberster Gerichtsherr, the supreme judge of the land, giving him power of life and death over every citizen and effectively extending the Enabling Act {{for the rest of the}} war. This gradual process of amassing power is today lumped in as Salamitaktik (<b>salami</b> <b>tactics).</b>|$|E
40|$|The Chinese Communist Party’s {{legitimacy}} is crumbling within China. The government’s {{approach to}} policy making, ethnic minorities, corruption, {{and the environment}} has not satisfied citizens. Rather, as the CCP fails to address each of these domestic concerns the population grows increasingly skeptical, even critical {{of their ability to}} lead. In order to counter and distract from this dissatisfaction, the CCP is driven towards an increasingly active foreign policy. The CCP has curated a Chinese brand of nationalism founded in the “Century of Humiliation. ” By providing constant reminders of the atrocities suffered at the hands of foreign invaders, the government’s intent is to establish an “us versus them” mentality that unites Chinese citizens not against the CCP, but against other countries. In the East China Sea, China has managed to incite tensions over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands without aggressive military action; rather, a government-established history and well-placed propaganda has mobilized Chinese citizens against Japan. In the South China Sea, the CCP has been able to justify its military buildup by claiming historical and legal right to the area. By pointing out the multilateral institutions that have come together in the interest of combating China’s supposed “peaceful rise,” the CCP is able to justify its <b>salami</b> <b>tactics</b> in the region as self-defense. By finding enemies in Japan and South China Sea countries, the CCP is able to act as the righteous defender of China abroad, solidifying its approval and legitimacy with citizens...|$|E
