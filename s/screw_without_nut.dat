There is a need for the removal of <b>screws</b> <b>without</b> special instruments. We describe a method for removing tulip-head polyaxial pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>without</b> special instruments.

Thus, iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4) nanoparticles {{were incorporated into}} a biodegradable polymer (poly-L-lactic acid, PLLA) to fabricate a composite bone screw. This multifunctional, 3 D printable bone screw was detectable on X-ray examination. In this study, mechanical tests including three-point bending and ultimate tensile strength were conducted to evaluate the optimal ratio of iron oxide nanoparticles in the PLLA composite. Both injection molding and 3 D printing techniques were used to fabricate the PLLA bone <b>screws</b> with and <b>without</b> the iron oxide nanoparticles. The fabricated screws were implanted into the femoral condyles of New Zealand White rabbits. Bone blocks containing the PLLA screws were resected 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. Histologic examination of the surrounding bone and the radiopacity of the iron-oxide-containing PLLA screws were evaluated. Our results indicated that addition of iron oxide nanoparticles at 30 % significantly decreased the ultimate tensile stress properties of the PLLA screws. The screws with 20 % iron oxide exhibited strong radiopacity compared to the <b>screws</b> fabricated <b>without</b> the iron oxide nanoparticles. Four weeks after surgery, the average bone volume of the iron oxide PLLA composite screws was significantly {{greater than that of}} PLLA <b>screws</b> <b>without</b> iron oxide. These findings suggested that biodegradable and X-ray detectable PLLA bone screws can be produced by incorporation of 20 % iron oxide nanoparticles.

40|$|Objective— To compare acute {{fixation}} {{stability and}} insertion effort of cortex bone <b>screws</b> with and <b>without</b> a shaft inserted in lag fashion in equine metacarpal (metatarsal, MC(T) III) bone. Methods— Screw types with independent variables of screw diameter (4. 5 or 5. 5 mm) and shaft type (without shaft, with 20 -mm shaft, or with 25 -mm shaft) were studied. Bone specimens cut from distal equine MC(T) III condyles were used. After screw insertion in lag fashion into 2 bone blocks with an instrumented device, shear {{tests were conducted}} in a mechanical testing machine. Outcome variables of peak insertion torque, insertion energy, stiffness, yield strength, and displacement at 3 kN of load were compared. Results— The effects of screw design were substantial. Screws with shaft were 30 % to 40 % stiffer and 60 % to 70 % stronger than <b>screws</b> <b>without</b> shaft. <b>Screws</b> with shaft could tolerate 80 to 95 kg more force than <b>screws</b> <b>without</b> shaft before yielding. At 3 kN load, the displacement with screws with shaft was 55 % to 60 % of that with <b>screws</b> <b>without</b> shaft. <b>Screws</b> with a long shaft tended to perform better than those with a short shaft. There {{was no difference in}} the shear stiffness, shear yield strength, or shear displacement between the 2 screw diameters. Although larger diameter screws required more insertion effort, and screws with a short shaft required the most insertion energy, these differences were small. Conclusions— Cortex screws with a long shaft of 4. 5 - or 5. 5 -mm diameter provide better stability in equine MC(T) III condyle bone with less insertion effort compared with those with a short shaft or no shaft. Clinical Significance— Cortex bone screws with a shaft inserted in lag fashion should be considered for the fixation of equine MC(T) III condylar fractures...|$|R

40|$|Expansive pedicle screws {{significantly}} improve fixation {{strength in}} osteoporotic spines. However, the previous literature does not adequately address {{the effects of}} the number of lengthwise slits and the extent of screw expansion on the strength of the bone/screw inter-face when expansive screws are used with or without cement augmentation. Herein, four designs for expansive pedicle screws with different numbers of lengthwise slits and different screw expansion levels were evaluated. Synthetic bones simulating severe osteoporosis were used to provide a comparative platform for each screw design. The prepared speci-mens were then tested for axial pullout failure. Regardless of screw design, screws with cement augmentation demonstrated significantly higher pullout strength than pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>without</b> cement augmentation (p 0. 05). Taken together, our results show that pedicle screws combined with cement augmentation may greatly increase screw fixation regardless of <b>screws</b> with or <b>without</b> expansion.

Cement augmentation is the most influential factor for improving screw pullout strength...|$|R
