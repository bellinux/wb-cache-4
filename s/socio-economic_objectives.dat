Based on the review, the policies and regulation procurement practices in the sector could be classified into pre- and post- 1994.

40|$|Partnerships {{for rural}} {{development}} are often presented as powerful ways of promoting 'integration'. This paper examines {{the reality of}} this claim, first by analysing what 'integration' means and then presenting {{a case study of}} a Dutch rural partnership that shows how 'integration' was diluted by the 'politics of sectoring'. In this case study, 'integration' was taken to mean harmonizing sectoral policies for the physical environment and to imply the integration of competing land-use claims. Representatives of different policy sectors sought to safeguard and advance their sectoral objectives through a number of strategies, including expanding conflicts to other playing fields and containing conflicts through private settlement. The interplay of these interests created a paradoxical outcome. The existing sectoral policies were maintained and 'integration' was achieved through the spatial separation of the most conflicting land uses, those of intensive husbandry farming and protecting nature. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture sees such partnerships as a good example of 'integrated rural policy' but the example shows that the integration of existing sectoral policies for the physical environment {{has little to do with}} the achievement of wider <b>socio-economic</b> <b>objective...</b>|$|R

On the other side, handling the procurement process, there is a contracting authority that spends public money while trying to fulfill a particular <b>socio-economic</b> <b>objective.</b> This paper will take the contracting authority’s (auctioneer’s) point of view which is in charge of devising and implementing the awarding criteria, as well as choosing the best bidder.

The ESF constitutes a set of mathematical expressions that transform the economic bids submitted by the bidders into scores, so that, eventually, the bidders can be ranked and the best one selected.

We aim to contribute to this aspect of GE research by looking at selected country experiences of renewable energy deployment with respect to the socio-economic goals of job creation or energy access. Across the cases examined, we find the following implications of relevance for the GE framework: First, we confirm the important role of governmental action for GE, with the specific need to state objectives clearly and build monitoring capacity. Second, consistent with the “strong” green growth variant of GE, some of the cases suggest that while renewable deployment may indeed lead to short-term socio-economic benefits, these benefits may not last. Third, we underline the urgent need for new methodologies to analyze and better understand multiple-objective policies, which {{are at the heart of}} the GE paradigm...|$|E

The DFIs are specialized financial institutions established by the government to achieve the <b>socio-economic</b> development <b>objectives</b> of the country through developing and promoting the key strategic sectors of the economy. In this study, we employed most commonly used financial ratio tools on a sample of two (2) development financial institutions to evaluate their performances so as to indicate how well they are prepared to meet the <b>socio-economic</b> development <b>objectives</b> of the country. To the best of our knowledge, related study assessing the performance of DFIs in Malaysia is scant.

40|$|Because of high {{population}} density in Europe agriculture cannot define its aims on its own but has {{to take account of}} quite a number of demands from different actors. For instance, agriculture is expected to produce food {{and at the same time}} to contribute to the protection of cultural landscapes and the maintenance of ecological services. However, land use concepts are often formulated ecology-oriented neglectingsocio-economic objectives and potential production responses of farmers. The present paper is aimed to illustrate how multi-criteria analysis can be used to transform a primarily ecology-oriented land use concept for an ecologically very sensitive region into a more integrative and comprehensive one that makes due allowance for <b>socio-economic</b> <b>objectives</b> and farmers' response. The results of our study show that production responses of farmers decisively influence the utility society obtains from land use. Multi-criteria analysis helps to assess the trade-off between 'ecology' and 'economy' and shows how the integration of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>objectives</b> can contribute to the maintenance of incomes and employment without overly harming the attainment of ecological objectives. Our results clearly suggest which farmer production responses should be supported by private organisations and government bodies. Consequently the results can serve as a basis for a local policy programme and can thereby contribute to a regionalisation of agri-environmental measures. multi-criteria analysis, multifunctionality of agriculture, regional land-use concepts, Land Economics/Use, Q 21, Q 51, Q 59, R 0,...|$|E

40|$|The Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregional Assessment, {{designed}} by The Nature Conservancy, is a marine spatial planning process which strives for an integrated management approach to marine conservation design. As ecosystem based management gains momentum, non-governmental organizations {{and federal agencies}} have realized the need to consider <b>socio-economic</b> <b>objectives</b> for and impacts of management plans and conservation strategies on coastal and marine-related communities. 	This report reviews the application of three methods for the integration of socio-economics in marine conservation planning: market and non-market economic valuation and social impact assessment. Market and non-market economic valuation {{can be used by}} marine managers to make informed decisions on conservation alternatives while social impact assessments evaluate the social consequences of specific conservation or management actions. Each of these methods can be represented in a geographic information system (GIS) and integrated with biophysical data in marine spatial planning processes. This report shows how market and non-market economic values and local ecological knowledge can be mapped both onshore and offshore and be used in designing marine conservation strategies. 	The findings presented here demonstrate that although there are defined methods for socio-economic analysis and some techniques for integrating socio-economics into marine spatial planning process, marine conservation planners are not applying them when making management decisions.

40|$|Especially in {{environmentally}} sensitive agricultural landscapes, agriculture cannot define its aims by itself - {{it has to}} account {{for a number of}} demands of different groups of society. For example, agriculture is expected to produce food {{and at the same time}} contribute to the protection of cultural landscapes and to further ecological services. Land use concepts for ecologically particularly sensitive agricultural landscapes are often focussed on the attainment of specific environmental objectives in specific areas, neglecting both socioeconomic effects, in particular income effects, and the farmers' income-driven production responses outside these areas. The paper illustrates, on the basis of an empirical study, (1) that the farmers' objectives and production responses need to be integrated in land use concepts for agricultural landscapes because of their potentially counterproductive effects on the attainment of environmental objectives, and (2) how multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be used to transform a primarily ecology-oriented concept for an ecologically very sensitive agricultural landscape into a more comprehensive one that makes due allowance for the farmers’ responses and society's <b>socio-economic</b> <b>objectives.</b> The authors show that the integration of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>objectives</b> can contribute to the maintenance of incomes and employment without overly harming the attainment of ecological goals. Finally, the paper discusses policy implications resulting from the implementation of land use concepts for agricultural landscapes, in particular in the field of agri-environmental policy, and raises some practical issues that come up if policy makers apply MCDA more widely in the design of such concepts. agricultural landscapes, land-use concepts, multi-criteria decision analysis, Land Economics/Use, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E
