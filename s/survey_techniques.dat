2500|$|Over 99% of the {{commercial}} kangaroo harvest occurs in the arid grazing rangelands. [...] The populations of kangaroos in these areas are estimated every year in each State by well-developed aerial <b>survey</b> <b>techniques.</b> [...] These are sparsely timbered, [...] type ecosystems; hence, {{it is possible to}} fly over them and count the large animals, such as kangaroos, seen. [...] Using either low-flying fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters, flying at heights of two to 300 meters, the National Parks authorities count the numbers of kangaroos seen over fixed transects. [...] Thirty years of such monitoring have allowed them to develop sophisticated and accurate techniques of extrapolating out to total population numbers. [...] Kangaroos are one of only a very few species (including humans) which have an annual census of their populations.|$|E
2500|$|Bronfenbrenner is {{a highly}} {{regarded}} expert on labor union organizing and collective bargaining strategies. [...] She introduced rigorous statistical methodology and <b>survey</b> <b>techniques</b> to a field which had been dominated by case studies. Her most notable contribution in this regard were two papers. [...] The first was the 1994 paper 'The Promise of Union Organizing in the Public and Private Sectors,' co-authored with Tom Juravich. In 1995, Bronfenbrenner and Juravich co-wrote a second work, 'Union Tactics Matter: The Impact of Union Tactics on Certification Elections, First Contracts, and Membership Rates.' Based on Bronfenbrenner's doctoral dissertation, the two papers were widely distributed throughout the labor movement and {{had a significant impact}} in promoting union organizing as a key issue in the 1995 AFL-CIO presidential race. Both papers have been combined, updated and published, in various journals and books, a number of times since then.|$|E
50|$|Psychic {{archaeology}} {{is the use}} of {{extrasensory perception}} to locate sites for archaeological digs, or describe context of artifacts. Psychic archaeology is alluring for several reasons, respective to the type of psychic archaeology employed. For instance, <b>surveying</b> <b>techniques</b> such as dowsing are less costly in terms of time and equipment than conventional noninvasive <b>surveying</b> <b>techniques</b> such as Ground Penetrating Radar or magnetometery <b>surveys.</b> <b>Techniques</b> for locating sites and test pits such as automatic writing and various scrying techniques are easy to perform. Psychic archaeologists claim that many of their techniques address lives of the past directly. Whereas accepted archaeologists make inferences about lives of the past based on material culture, some psychic archaeologists say they have visions of non-material aspects of the lives they study.|$|R

40|$|Context. An {{understanding}} of population size and status {{is necessary for}} the implementation of appropriate conservation measures to recover threatened taxa. Mark–recapture studies at large spatial scales are impractical and expensive and a rapid <b>survey</b> <b>technique</b> is an attractive option to provide a measure of relative abundance for cryptic species, using indicators of activity. Aims. The aim of our study was to use conventional methods for population estimation to calibrate a rapid <b>survey</b> <b>technique</b> for the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) in the southern forests of Western Australia, with a view to providing quantitative outcomes from this widely adopted monitoring approach. Methods. Weevaluated the accuracy of relative abundances obtained from the rapid <b>survey</b> <b>technique</b> by comparing them with abundance estimates obtained through established methods for the estimation of populations, including web-based mark–recapture and transect-based counts of activity indicators and sightings. Key results. The rapid <b>survey</b> <b>technique</b> was effective at determining presence of quokkas but resulted in an over-estimation of population size because of inaccurate assumptions about occupancy and relative abundance of animals. An alternative survey method based on counts of fresh faecal-pellet groups was found to provide a more reliable and practical estimation of population abundance (R 2 = 0. 97) ...|$|R

40|$|Since GPS {{technology}} {{which is}} intensively used in surveying application today, can not directly {{be employed to}} measure some details such as building boundaries, {{it is still a}} necessity to establish control points on the ground and coordinate them by GPS and then measure the details by a total station set up on these control points. Establishment of control points on the ground and their compulsory use increase the cost and course of a detail surveying project. In this research, GPSSIT technique is transferred into a motorized <b>surveying</b> <b>technique</b> adapted on a pickup by a low cost mechanism that enables GPS and laser total station integration. So that, this technique makes possible to measure details in a remote distance without establishing any control point on the ground and carrying out all measurement processes on a pickup not on the ground.
