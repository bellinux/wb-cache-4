Anhydrous hydrogen chloride is a poor solvent, only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as nitrosyl chloride and phenol, or salts with very low lattice energies such as tetraalkylammonium halides.

2500|$|Silane {{pyrolysis}} gives polymeric {{species and}} finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially {{produced by the}} pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C–H or C–C bond {{and the formation of}} radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating silenes :SiH2 or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210kJ/mol) is much less than the Si–Si and Si–H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in methanol, controlled <b>solvolysis</b> results in the products SiH2(OMe)2, SiH(OMe)3, and Si(OMe)4. The Si–H bond also adds to alkenes, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450°C, silane participates in an addition reaction with acetone, as well as a ring-opening reaction with ethylene oxide. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at −80°C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate hydrogen halide with an Al2X6 catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid silver halide in a heated flow reactor: ...|$|E

50|$|Ammonolysis {{refers to}} <b>solvolysis</b> by ammonia {{but can also}} {{describe}} nucleophilic attack by ammonia more generally. Ammonia boils at −33°C and so it rarely used as a solvent in its pure form, it is however readily miscible with water and is commonly used {{in the form of}} a saturated aqueous solution. For this reason ammonolysis may be considered a special case of <b>solvolysis,</b> as the ammonia is itself dissolved in a solvent. Despite this the reactions are usually highly selective, due to the greater nucleophilicity of ammonia compared to water.|$|E

50|$|Degradation {{can also}} {{occur as a}} result of the formation, and then {{breakage}} of double bonds, such as <b>solvolysis</b> in PVC(Peacock). <b>Solvolysis</b> occurs when a Carbon-X bond, with X representing a halogen, is broken. This occurs in PVC in the presence of an acid species. Active Hydrogen atoms will remove a Chlorine atom from the polymer molecule, forming Hydrochloric acid (HCl). The HCl produced may then cause dechlorination of adjacent Carbon atoms. The dechlorinated Carbon atoms then tend to form double bonds, which can be attacked and broken by ozone, just like the degradation of rubbers described above.|$|E
5000|$|... 2) In {{reactions}} {{where the}} leaving group {{is also a}} good nucleophile-bromide for instance, the leaving group can perform an SN2 reaction on a substrate molecule. If the substrate is chiral, this inverts the configuration of the substrate before <b>solvolysis,</b> leading to a racemized product-the product that would be expected from an SN1 mechanism. In the case of a bromide leaving group in alcoholic solvent Cowdrey et al. have shown that bromide can have an SN2 rate constant 100-250 times higher than the rate constant for ethanol. Thus, after only a few percent <b>solvolysis</b> of an enantiospecific substrate, it becomes racemic.|$|E

50|$|The {{final step}} occurs by {{nucleophilic}} acyl substitution and <b>solvolysis,</b> where the amino or hydroxyl group attacks the acid chloride forming the corresponding heterocycle. The end product is a carboxylic acid derivative (primarily lactones and amides).|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} this {{formation}} route is the reaction that led Winstein and Trifan to propose the delocalized structure of the 2-norbornyl cation. 2-norbornyl tosylates and brosylates form the 2-norbornyl cation through this route as an intermediate towards <b>solvolysis.</b>|$|E
50|$|For certain nucleophiles {{there are}} {{specific}} terms {{for the type}} of <b>solvolysis</b> reaction: e.g. for water, the term is hydrolysis; for alcohols, it is alcoholysis; for ammonia, it is ammonolysis; for glycols, it is glycolysis; for amines, it is aminolysis etc.|$|E
50|$|An SN1 {{reaction}} {{occurs when}} a molecule separates into a positively charged component and a negatively charged component. This generally occurs in highly polar solvents through a process called <b>solvolysis.</b> The positively charged component then reacts with a nucleophile forming a new compound.|$|E
50|$|The π orbitals of an alkene can {{stabilize}} {{a transition}} state {{by helping to}} delocalize the positive charge of the carbocation. For instance the unsaturated tosylate will react more quickly (1011 times faster for aqueous <b>solvolysis)</b> with a nucleophile than the saturated tosylate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solvolysis</b> of a chiral {{reactant}} {{results in}} the racemate (as expected in SN1) but is often accompanied by Walden inversion. This is explained by postulating an intimate ion pair whereby the leaving anion is still in proximity to the carbocation and effectively shielding it from an attack by the nucleophile.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a <b>solvolysis</b> {{reaction}} is the reaction of a triglyceride with a simple alcohol such as methanol or ethanol to give the methyl or ethyl esters of the fatty acid, as well as glycerol.

50|$|Several of his twelve monographs are collaborations with Nobel Laureates J.A. Pople, H.C. Brown and G.A. Olah.

5000|$|... 1) Many {{reactions}} studied are <b>solvolysis</b> reactions where {{a solvent}} molecule-often an alcohol, is the nucleophile. While still a second order reaction mechanistically, {{the reaction is}} kinetically first order as the concentration of the nucleophile-the solvent molecule, is effectively constant during the reaction. This type of reaction is often called a pseudo first order reaction.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a series}} of {{acetolysis}} experiments, Winstein et al. observed that the <b>solvolysis</b> reaction occurred empirically faster when the tosyl leaving group was in the equatorial position. The group ascribed this difference in reaction rates to the anchimeric assistance invoked by the [...] "cis" [...] isomer. This result thus supported a non-classical structure for the cation.|$|E
50|$|While <b>solvolysis</b> often {{refers to}} an organic {{chemistry}} context, hydrolysis is very common in inorganic chemistry, where aqua complexes of metal ions react with solvent molecules due to the Lewis acidity of the metal center. For example, aqueous solutions of aluminium chloride are acidic due to the aqua-aluminium complex losing protons to water molecules, giving hydronium ions which lowers the pH.|$|E
50|$|Because an SN1 {{reaction}} proceeds {{with the}} Substitution of a leaving {{group with a}} Nucleophile, the SN designation is used. Because the initial <b>solvolysis</b> step in this reaction involves a single molecule dissociating from its leaving group, the initial stage {{of this process is}} considered a uni-molecular reaction. The involvement of only 1 species in the initial phase of the reaction enhances the mechanistic designation to SN1.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} stage of this {{reaction}} (<b>solvolysis),</b> the C-L bond breaks and both electrons from that bond join L (the leaving group) to form L− and R3C+ ions. This is represented by the curved arrow pointing away from the C-L bond and towards L. The nucleophile Nu−, being attracted to the R3C+, then donates a pair of electrons forming a new C-Nu bond.|$|E
50|$|Generating Vinyl CationsVinyl cations {{have been}} {{observed}} as reactive intermediates during <b>solvolysis</b> reactions. Consistent with SN1 chemistry, these reactions follow first order kinetics. Generally, vinylic halides are unreactive in solution: silver nitrate does not precipitate silver halides {{in the presence of}} vinyl halides, and this fact was historically used to dispute the existence of the vinyl cation species. The introduction of “super” leaving groups in the 1970s first allowed for the generation of vinyl cation reactive intermediates with appreciable lifetimes. These excellent leaving groups, such as triflate (trifluoromethanesulfonate) and nonaflate (nonafluorobutanesulfonate), are highly prone to SN1 reactivity. Utilization of these super leaving groups allowed researchers {{for the first time to}} move beyond speculation about the existence of such vinyl cations. Other leaving groups, such as hypervalent iodine moities (which are 1 million fold better leaving groups than the classic triflates), have been utilized to such end as well. Hinkle and coworkers synthesized a number of alkenyl(aryl)iodonium triflates from hypervalent phenyliodo precursors. In the scheme shown, the (E)- and (Z)- vinyl triflates form after heterolytic carbon-iodine bond cleavage and subsequent trapping of the cation by triflate. The presence of both (E)- and (Z)- vinyl triflate products offers support for the formation of a primary vinyl cation reactive intermediate; through SN2 chemistry, both only one isomer would form.Recently, vinyl cation reactive intermediates have been generated in photochemical <b>solvolysis</b> reactions. The figure to the right depicts photochemical <b>solvolysis</b> of vinyl iodonium salt, through heterolytic carbon-iodine bond cleavage, to generate a vinyl carbocation and iodobenzene. The reactive intermediate is prone to either nucleophilic attack by the solvent to yield (E)- and (Z)- enol ether isomers, or beta hydrogen elimination.|$|E
50|$|Initially it was {{believed}} that the existence of vinyl cations was questionable because of the large energy difference between it and its vinyl precursor. Once it was established that stable vinyl cation intermediates can be attained through the <b>solvolysis</b> of vinyl compounds with good leaving groups like triflate and nonaflate and stabilized by electron-donating groups, a significant amount of progress as taken place and produced a field of stable vinyl cations.|$|E
