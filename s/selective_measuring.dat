Then favorable oceanographic conditions and high nutrient levels in the Yellow Sea could support the floating U. prolifera to grow and aggregate and form a green tide. We thus deduced {{that there may be}} a close relationship between photosynthetic activities and capacities and the rapid accumulation of vast green algal biomass. The chlorophyll excitation energy dissipated by fluorescence has an inverse relationship with photosynthetic carbon assimilation (Schreiber 2004). Several <b>selective</b> <b>measuring</b> techniques have been developed to determine the photosynthetic rates, like PAM fluorometry and 77  K chlorophyll fluorescence. In recent years, many case studies of Ulva species (Chlorophyceae) have utilised these techniques for measuring the influences of environmental stress on PSII performance (Figueroa et al. 2003; Xia et al. 2004; Bischof et al. 2006; Choi et al. 2010; Luo and Liu 2011; Wang et al. 2012). Although there were differences between Ulva species, growth performance and PSII activity in the researched species were generally sensitive to stress conditions.|$|E

In this framework, we show entangle production examples for systems of two fermions (or bosons) when the operator Mm has two-particle events that are not mutually exclusive.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{have studied the}} use of both {{quantitative}} and qualitative <b>selective</b> <b>measures,</b> {{as an instrument of}} archaeological heritage management in Dutch municipal archaeological policies. These measures are used in the process of valuing archaeological remains, in order {{to determine whether or not}} they are considered to be worthy of preservation. Currently, they are increasingly the topic of debate, as their effects can be both positive and negative, depending on the view of the beholder. First, I have made an overview of the presence of municipal archaeological policy in general. In total, 254 out of the 430 Dutch municipal administrations have or are developing an archaeological policy and 292 an archaeological map. Of these, 186 use the quantitative <b>selective</b> <b>measure</b> of limits which exempt certain areas of the requirement to archaeologically research them before disturbances beforehand. Qualitative <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> are much rarer and are used by only 22 municipal administrations. Their use is a relatively recent development, but growing in number. Secondly, I have studied the <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> in more detail. I started with listing the limits of exemption currently in use and showed that they are very diverse. This is mainly caused by a lack of knowledge on their effects on the archaeological heritage, although this effect might theoretically be both big and negative. Instead, the use of limits of exemption is mainly motivated by non-archaeological interests, like reducing the amount of archaeological research which is needed and its costs. Therefore, although for archaeologists the use of these limits might be a cause for concern, it might be beneficial for other stakeholders. Next, I have studied the qualitative measures and their effects. This showed that a bias exists in the composition of the final selection which are made. Certain periods and research themes are prioritised, while others are neglected. Again, this might be a cause of concern, mainly for archaeologists, as this threatens the representativeness of the archaeological heritage, both in situ and by record. My study has also shown that there are several methods of making a selection and measures which are used in implementing these, which are heavily influenced by the author of the selective policy. Although municipal administrations can formulate their own policy, they may also hire a commercial archaeological consultant agency to do this for them. I have noticed that most of the selective policies were written by one of these agencies, Past 2 Present. This gives them a large influence, as these policies are based on their views, their methods and the judgements of their archaeologists, used in the method of composing a selection, even though the municipal council still has to agree by officially confirming the policy. Past 2 Present is a main proponent of using <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> and indeed all of their policies contain these. Next, I have studied the aims for using qualitative <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> and the general and specific motivations behind them. I have concluded that these are mainly non-archaeological. The main aim is to reduce the amount of archaeological research which is needed, although <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> may also aim to structure the gathering of knowledge, gain more local knowledge, strengthen the local identity or make the process of valuation and selection more transparent. The main motivations behind this are practical and economical and based on local interests. In general, I consider these motivations to be insufficient, as in my opinion they do not motivate strongly enough why certain archaeological remains should not be preserved, especially not from an archaeological point of view. Thirdly, I have mapped the stakeholders which are involved, their interests, which may conflict, and their influence. Currently, archaeologists still have most the most influence over the process, but the balance of power seems to be shifting. For example, the main aims and motivations for using <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> already reflect mainly non-archaeological interests. They are mainly practical and economical and are not focused on gathering as much knowledge of the past as possible. In addition, both quantitatively and quantitatively selecting might have a negative effect on the amount and representativeness of the archaeological heritage and the knowledge it potentially contains. Again, this is especially a cause for concern for archaeologists. On the other hand, for example, spatial developers may benefit, as less archaeological research is needed and for them costs are lowered. In conclusion, I have identified several developments and practices, which, for me as an archaeologist, are causes for concern. Therefore, it is important that the debate on the subject of using <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> as an instrument of archaeological heritage management in Dutch municipal archaeological policies continues. With my thesis I hope to add facts and figures on the current situation, which were lacking before. Hopefully this will result in better arguments to be presented in favour of adjusting the current measures, which I consider to have a negative effect on the archaeological heritage...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the imposition of trade restriction and promotion policies in a variety of frameworks. The first chapter provides an introduction. The second chapter is theoretical in nature and uses a general equilibrium model to compare the welfare effects of global trade restrictive measures to those of <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> applied against particular countries. It is the thesis of Chapter 2 that on the grounds of economic efficiency, there is no blanket theoretical support for the MFN application of safeguards. Whether or not a safeguard action undertaken on an MFN basis is better for {{the world as a whole}} than that undertaken on a selective basis depends on two overriding factors: the notion of equivalence between the MFN and the <b>selective</b> trade <b>measures,</b> and the distribution of the rents produced by the trade measures.;Chapter 3 tackles the MFN vs. selectivity issue in an empirical framework. Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this chapter {{examines the}} effects on world welfare of the conversion to their global counterparts of <b>selective</b> trade <b>measures</b> which were present in the United States (US) and European Community (EC) in the textiles and clothing, steel, and auto industries in 1986. The effects of the presence of labour adjustment costs on the results are also considered, but they do not appear to dominate the model. This analysis suggests that the simultaneous conversion of all existing safeguards from <b>selective</b> <b>measures</b> to their global counterparts would yield non-negative world welfare changes. However, the conversion of only some to their global counterparts, while others remain as <b>selective</b> <b>measures,</b> may produce negative welfare changes.;Chapter 4 uses a simple three-good, two-country general equilibrium framework to analyze the effects of trade policy on welfare and firm profits when multiproduct firms may be present in one or both countries. Various cases are examined in which both goods are produced by multi- or single product firms at home and/or abroad, and it can be shown that the presence of joint production can have definite effects on the trade policies advocated by home and foreign producers. In particular, domestic firms may not want tariffs on all imports when multiproduct firms are located in the foreign country...|$|R

Transgenic barley expressing the metchnikowin gene in its 52 -amino acid pre-pro-peptide form {{under the control}} of the inducible mannopine synthase (mas) gene promoter from the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens displayed enhanced resistance to powdery mildew as well as Fusarium head blight and root rot.

Five cross-sectional surveys of cohort studies in southern Germany were pooled, resulting in data of 6757 individuals (31 – 96 years old). Self-reported information on health care utilisation was used to estimate direct health care costs for the year 2011. The relationship between measured BMI and annual costs was analysed using generalised additive models, and the cost fraction attributable to obesity was calculated. We found a non-linear association of BMI and health care costs with a continuously increasing slope for increasing BMI without any clear threshold. Under the consideration of the non-linear BMI-cost relationship, {{a shift in the}} BMI distribution so that the BMI of each individual is lowered by one point is associated with a 2. 1 % reduction of mean direct costs in the population.
