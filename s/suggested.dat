5|$|A recent {{published}} observation {{during the}} 1997 solar eclipse by Wang et al. <b>suggested</b> a possible gravitational shielding effect, which generated debate.

50|$|Bizarreness {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of bizarre material to be better remembered than common material. The scientific evidence for its existence is contended. Some research <b>suggests</b> it does exist, some <b>suggests</b> it doesn't exist and some <b>suggests</b> it leads to worse remembering.|$|R

5|$|Adolf Seilacher has <b>suggested</b> the Ediacaran sees animals usurping giant protists as the {{dominant}} life form. The modern xenophyophores are giant single-celled protozoans found throughout the world's oceans, largely on the abyssal plain. A recent genetic study <b>suggested</b> that the xenophyophores are a specialised group of Foraminifera. There are approximately 42 recognised species in 13 genera and 2 orders; one of which, Syringammina fragilissima, is among the largest known protozoans at up to 20 centimetres in diameter.|$|E
50|$|The orbital {{parameters}} <b>suggest</b> {{that it may}} {{belong to the same}} dynamic cluster as Caliban, <b>suggesting</b> common origin.|$|R
50|$|Examination of the {{mitochondrial}} DNA <b>suggests</b> {{that the}} Taxidiinae diverged first, {{followed by the}} Melinae. The position of the Helictidinae is unclear because the mitochondrial evidence <b>suggests</b> the subfamily {{is related to the}} Lutrinae-Mustelinae clade, while the intron data <b>suggest</b> a relationship to the Martinae.|$|R
50|$|The unique {{traits of}} Phosphatherium teeth <b>suggest</b> {{them to be}} intraspecific. Some {{features}} of Phosphatherium escuilliei teeth and jaw structures also show noticeable variation, which is related to sexual dimorphism. This <b>suggests</b> there were physiological differences between male and females, which ultimately <b>suggests</b> behavioral differences.|$|R
5|$|After {{intercontinental}} compatibility tests, Petersen and Bermudes <b>suggested</b> that bioluminescence and compatibility were independent since bioluminescence {{seemed to}} be geographically restricted. This <b>suggested</b> that the ability or potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of P.stypticus into geographically isolated areas.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively some 20th century {{scholars}} have <b>suggested</b> different years, such as 568 or 569.|$|E
5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members <b>suggested</b> possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account <b>suggested.</b>|$|E

25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 <b>suggest</b> no information is available; scores of 1 <b>suggest</b> the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 <b>suggest</b> the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 <b>suggest</b> the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 <b>suggest</b> the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 <b>suggest</b> the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 <b>suggest</b> the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was <b>suggested</b> {{in the history}} The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This <b>suggested</b> that in March 1943 {{there was an explosion}} on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have <b>suggested</b> the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been <b>suggested</b> as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

50|$|In {{sentence}} a, {{the first}} criterion (agreement) {{and the second}} criterion (position occupied) <b>suggest</b> that there is the subject, whereas the third criterion (semantic role) <b>suggests</b> rather that problems is the subject. In sentence b, in contrast, agreement and semantic role <b>suggest</b> that problems is the subject, whereas position occupied <b>suggests</b> that there is the subject. In such cases then, one can take the first criterion as the most telling; the subject should agree with the finite verb.|$|R
5000|$|The Multimark {{was made}} up of a triangle, <b>suggesting</b> motion or direction. In contrast, a circle <b>suggests</b> global {{activities}} and a square <b>suggests</b> stability.

5|$|Benjamin Hudson <b>suggested</b> that it {{was only}} the {{vigorous}} campaigning by Niall Glúndub in Ulster and Connacht from 913 to 915, along with Óengus's fortuitous death, that led to Niall being named Flann's heir. Alex Woolf <b>suggested</b> that Flann had not only attempted to monopolise the succession within his family, but had come close to instituting a national kingship in Ireland comparable to that created by his contemporaries Alfred the Great and Edward the Elder in England from their Kingdom of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have <b>suggested</b> that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have <b>suggested</b> ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
