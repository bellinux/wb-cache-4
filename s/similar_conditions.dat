40|$|This studv exaimined {{the effect}} of {{semantic}} category relations {{on the amount of}} interference in picture-word Stroop interference task. It was hypothesized that the amounts of interference increased as the similarity of semantic category relations between targets and distractors increased. The one factor within-subject experimental design was used. Six experimental conditions which manipulated the similarities of semantic category relations between targets and distractors were used in this experiment. They were the identical condition, the same categorical <b>condition,</b> the high <b>similar</b> <b>condition,</b> the middle <b>similar</b> <b>condition,</b> the low <b>similar</b> <b>condition</b> and the control condition. Subjects were 24 college students. The experiment was conducted individually. The preselitations of stimulus, other all time factors and records of responses were all controlled by a Macintosh Performa 5320 computer with a Super-Mind Lab. Version 1. 4 program. The subjects were given picture-word Stroop interference task and the stimulus were embedded words (distracting words: hiragana letters) inside line drawings (target pictures). They were required to name the target pictures, ignoring distracting words. The main results were as follows: In comparison with the control condition, the largest interferenee occured in the same categorical condition and the amount of interference was large in the high <b>similar</b> <b>condition,</b> middle <b>similar</b> <b>condition</b> and low <b>similar</b> <b>condition</b> in order as a function of similarity of semantic category relation between targets and abstractors. These results were discussed on the basis of Glaser and Glascr (1989) 's model and some methodlogical problems were suggested...|$|R

No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994. Immediately before post time, the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder.

5|$|Among the company's {{other goals}} {{was that of}} helping finance road {{projects}} on Øygarden. The most pressing issue was the section from Kolltveit on Store Sotra to the bridge, part of National Road 555. In 1976, the company issued NOK5 million in an interest-free loan to the project, which was repaid in 1982 and 1983. <b>Similar</b> <b>conditions</b> were imposed for NOK2 million for National Road 561 to Nordra Straumsundet and NOK1.2 million {{for the establishment of}} the Solsvik–Rong Ferry in 1974. The rest of the subsidies were given as grants. The main project was National Road 561, which ran from Kollveit northwards through Øygarden, for which the company paid NOK28.6 million. It paid a further NOK9.3 million for other projects in Sotra and Øygarden, including connections to Turøy and Misje.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} a vast {{floodplain}} along the western shore of the interior seaway. Large rivers watered the land, occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment. When water was plentiful, the region could support {{a great deal of}} plant and animal life, but periodic droughts also struck the region, resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments, including the Daspletosaurus bonebed. <b>Similar</b> <b>conditions</b> exist today in East Africa. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash, also resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, coastal wetlands, deltas and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations.|$|E

5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (marbling) and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in <b>similar</b> <b>conditions.</b> Marbling, together with tenderness and flavour, {{has been associated with}} eating quality in some countries, and attracts a higher quality grading with associated premiums, although the link between marbling and palatability is not universally supported. In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat is considered to be of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed conversion efficiency and yield associated with higher marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different and conflicting production demands.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under <b>similar</b> <b>conditions.</b> The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

On 12 August, under an Act of Parliament of 1833, Elliot began a Court of Criminal and Admiralty Jurisdiction on board the Fort William in Hong Kong harbour, with himself as judge and a group of merchants as the jury. Two men were found guilty of rioting, fined £15 each, and sentenced to three months hard labour to be served in England while a further three men were found guilty of assault and rioting, fined £25 each, and sentenced to six months imprisonment in <b>similar</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, the Act was under review and after arriving in England, they were set free {{on the grounds that the}} trial held no jurisdiction. Elliot invited Lin to send observers to the trial, but none came. Without the handover of a man to the Chinese, Lin was not satisfied with the proceedings. He viewed the extraterritorial court as an infringement of China's sovereignty.|$|E

5|$|<b>Similar</b> <b>conditions</b> {{occurred}} {{in parts of}} the other eastern islands. Along the southern shore of Sal, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in Santa Maria. Pier restoration was incomplete as of May2017, about 2.5years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy. Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym, which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100citizens. Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in Palmeira, and caused minor structural damage to Sal International Airport. At the height of the hurricane, flooding forced nearly 130people living in the impoverished outskirts of Terra Boa and Espargos to relocate to shelters. Fred destroyed 80percent of the Loggerhead sea turtle nests on the beaches of Sal, a crucial nesting site for this species. Overall, Sal suffered CVE$30million ($300,000) in damage from the hurricane. The storm's outer bands dropped heavy rain on the islands of Santiago and Fogo, peaking at 13in (330mm) over the mountains of Santiago and causing widespread damage to roads, sidewalks, and walls. In São Miguel, flood waters and fallen trees led to major traffic obstructions. Conversely, the rains replenished water reserves and filled a large dam in São Salvador do Mundo to maximum capacity, irrigating adjacent arable lands. Structural damage across Santiago, largely in flooded urban areas, reached CVE$87million ($860,000).|$|E
