40|$|Abstract. Automobile body sheets mainly resist {{impact and}} pressure. However, the fatigue {{property}} {{is one of}} the main factors with regard to properties of <b>sheet</b> <b>steels.</b> Continuous vibration happens all over the <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> (especially chassis) while the vehicle is in motion. And the fatigue property becomes particularly important in the condition above. Fatigue tests are conducted to four kinds of thin <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> for automobile in this paper. The fatigue lives of samples from <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> are obtained according to the various stresses. The inferior limits of fatigue life and the inferior limits of fatigue strength under the higher stresses are acquired by the computation of fatigue data. Furthermore, the test results show that there is a certain relationship among the tensile strength, yielding strength and inferior limit of fatigue strength for these <b>sheet</b> <b>steels.</b> This paper is of certain reference significance for other similar test...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} a new method for online {{analysis}} of the zinc coating of galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is presented. The coating is characterized {{with a series of}} single laser bursts irradiated on the traversing <b>sheet</b> <b>steel,</b> each on a different <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> position. To achieve an ablation depth in the range of the coating thickness of about 10 µm a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double pulse mode was used. The depth information is obtained by control of the ablation depth by adjusting the burst energy using an external electro-optical attenuator. Concepts for the determination of the coating thickness and the chemical composition are presented. The achieved thickness resolution is estimated to about 400 nm for coating thicknesses of electrolytic galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> in the range of 3. 2 to 11. 2 µm. In the case of hot-dip galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> information about the depth profile of aluminium can be gained by the new method...|$|R
40|$|During the {{production}} of galvanised <b>sheet</b> <b>steel,</b> key monitoring parameters are the thickness and chemical composition of the zinc coating. For this purpose a new method was developed for the online characterisation of galvanised <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and a transportable measuring unit was set up. Concepts for {{the determination of the}} coating thickness and the aluminium depth profile of hot-dip galvanised coatings were developed. To simulate the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> velocity in the plant of up to 2 m/s LIBS measurements are performed on rotating <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> discs mounted on a rotary stage. The depth resolution is determined by using well characterised industrially coated <b>sheet</b> <b>steels</b> with different coating thicknesses (4. 1 to 11. 2 µm) and aluminium depth profiles as reference samples. A thickness resolution of better than 150 nm is achieved. For a measuring system designed for an online application the measurement time for an aluminium depth profile will be 10 seconds and for the determination of the coating thickness 200 ms. The impact of the LIBS craters on the <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> quality is minimised by using burst energies below 3 mJ. The influence of LIBS craters on the <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> quality was investigated by corrosion tests.

40|$|Recently, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} total construction and transportation cost and difficulties associated with handling massive structural components or assemblies, there has been increasing financial pressure to reduce structural weight. Furthermore, advances in material technology coupled with continuing advances in design tools and techniques have encouraged engineers to vary and combine materials, offering new opportunities to reduce the weight of mechanical structures. These new lower mass systems, however, {{are more susceptible to}} inherent imbalances, a weakness that can result in higher shock and harmonic resonances which leads to poor structural dynamic performances. The objective of this thesis is the modeling of layered <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> elements, to accurately predict dynamic performance. During the development of the layered <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> model, the numerical modeling approach, the Finite Element Analysis and the Experimental Modal Analysis are applied in building a modal model of the layered <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> elements. Furthermore, in view of getting {{a better understanding of the}} dynamic behavior of layered <b>sheet</b> <b>steel,</b> several binding methods have been studied to understand and demonstrate how a binding method affects the dynamic behavior of layered <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> elements when compared to single homogeneous steel plate. Based on the developed layered <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> model, the dynamic behavior of a lightweight wheel structure to be used as the structure for the stator of an outer rotor Direct-Drive Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator designed for high-power wind turbines is studied...|$|R

The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 °C. Pre-1990 annealing lines used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common.|$|R
