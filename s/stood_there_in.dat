It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.|$|E

We couldn't believe it. The heart was perfect. There were no problems with it. It was just this huge engine." [...] Later, Swerczek also performed a necropsy on Sham, who died in 1993. Swerczek did weigh Sham's heart, and it was [...] Based on Sham's measurement, and having necropsied both horses, he estimated Secretariat's heart probably weighed , or about 2.5 {{times that of the}} average horse (...)

500|$|After {{spending}} {{two weeks}} with his family, Speer came to Coesfeld to visit Wolters in October 1966. [...] Shortly before Speer's visit, Annemarie Kempf had visited Wolters in Coesfeld {{to ask him}} not to allow his differences with Speer to affect their first meeting. Wolters responded that he and Speer were [...] "too far apart". [...] The visit was quickly marred by Speer's insistence on inviting industrialist [...] to Wolters' home instead of allowing a one-on-one reunion. [...] According to Wolters' son Fritz, his father was furious and hurt by the perceived slight. [...] While the actual meeting was casual and cordial (in addition to the long-promised ham and wine, Wolters turned over all of the accumulated papers from Speer, the censored copy of the Chronik and the remaining balance of DM25,000 in the School Fund Account), Wolters later wrote, [...] "I knew that day of that first still merry reunion that the Spandau friendship was over. [...] As he <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> person, I saw him suddenly quite differently than I had previously." ...|$|E

500|$|Next was {{the gate}} known in Turkish as Değirmen Kapı ("Mill Gate"), whose Byzantine name is unknown. Close by {{and to its}} north stood the great Tower of Mangana, which was {{intended}} to hold the {{one end of the}} chain, planned (but probably never actually installed) by Manuel I Komnenos to close off the Bosphorus, the other end being at a tower erected on the island of the modern Maiden's Tower (Kız Kulesi) off Chrysopolis (modern Üsküdar), known as Damalis (Δάμαλις) or Arkla (...) in Byzantine times. The next gate is now known as the Demirkapı ("Iron Gate"), and is an Ottoman-era structure. A Greek name is not known, and it is not known whether a gate <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> Byzantine times. Behind these two gates extended the quarter of the Mangana (Μάγγανα, [...] "Arsenal"), with its numerous monasteries, the most famous of which were those of St. George of Mangana, the Church of Christ Philanthropos, and of the Theotokos Hodegetria, and the Palace of Mangana. Four small posterns, in two pairs of two, stand at the southern edge of the Mangana quarter, and probably serviced the numerous churches. The names, but not the identity, of two of them have been recorded, the Postern of St. Lazarus ( [...] , pylis tou hagiou Lazarou), and the Small Gate of the Hodegetria ( [...] , mikra pylē tēs Hodēgētrias), both named after the respective monasteries located near them. It is also probable that one of them is to be identified with the Postern of Michael the Protovestiarios ( [...] , parapylis tou Michaēl tou prōtovestiariou).|$|E

[...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As we <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away. [...] I felt as if the sea was going to break {{over the edge of the}} bowl and come puring down upon us.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good-morning, Emil Sachs," [...] he said. [...] "I am {{glad that}} you have shown discretion. <b>Stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the light, please, and fold your arms. Thanks. Do not think that I am afraid of you, but I like to talk comfortably." ...|$|R

60|$|He <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the raiment of a king, and {{the gates}} of the jewelled shrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed {{monstrance}} shone a marvellous and mystical light. He <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> a king's raiment, and the Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches seemed to move. In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and the organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their trumpets, and the singing boys sang.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, {{and if you}} <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{the glow}} of the fire they can creep up under cover of the shadows to one side or the other, and shoot you down. We've done all we can here, Sue, and the {{remainder}} of our fight must be made from the house." ...|$|R

50|$|On {{the plot}} is proved to <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> 1555 a house owned by a tailor, Wawrzyniec Klẹk.

60|$|But I {{think what}} Jeff liked {{best of it}} all {{was the sort of}} public {{recognition}} that it meant.

6000|$|So Sir Tristram wist {{not what}} to do, but <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> doubt looking down upon Sir Blamor. Then Sir Blamor said, again: [...] "Strike, Sir Knight, {{and have done}} with it." ...|$|E
