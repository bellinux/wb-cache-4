40|$|Experiments {{using two}} scale–models were {{conducted}} to study non–isothermal airflow similarity in a ceiling slot–ventilated agricultural enclosure. The main criteria used for determining similarity were airflow pattern similarity, occupied zone airspeed, and temperature similarity. For agricultural ventilation issues, these were projected to be paramount to a successful scale–model study. The current study, based on past agricultural ventilation studies, focused attention on the Archimedes number (Ar) and Momentum ratio (Rm) as the <b>similitude</b> <b>criteria</b> for non–isothermal airflow. Results indicated that Ar is the appropriate <b>similitude</b> <b>criteria</b> for non–isothermal airflow patterns under strong buoyancy–affected conditions where Ar 3 ̆e 0. 015.

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} a block on a coarse {{granular}} soil corresponding to rockfall events is investigated using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The soil is considered as a noncohesive granular medium and the DEM impact model is calibrated compared to results from half-scale experiments. The effects of scale changes are also explored by comparing real-scale simulations using the DEM impact model and the half-scale experimental results. This comparison shows that using simple <b>similitude</b> <b>criteria</b> limits scale changes effects. Finally, the DEM model is used to perform a numerical analysis of the bouncing phenomenon. Different impacting particle and medium characteristics are considered. An impacting particle bouncing occurrence diagram is defined for various impacting particle radius Rb*/Rm, sample heights H*/Rm, and incident kinematic parameters. The bouncing occurrence diagram brings out three impact regimes. For a small impacting particle (Rb*/Rm < Rcrit*/Rm), the impact is mainly determined by the first interaction between the impacting particle and the soil, whereas for an intermediate-sized impacting particle (Rcrit*/Rm ≤ Rb*/Rm < Rmin*/Rm), the compression wave propagation through the sample is the leading phenomenon. For large impacting particles (Rb*/Rm ≥ Rmin*/Rm), bouncing {{is associated with the}} formation of a compact layer below the impacting particle...|$|E

Many criteria have been proposed to simulate the behavior of airflow between scale-model and prototype. Because of the inconsistent results of past proposed similarity criteria, more validation work is needed to clarify the conflicts;Dimensional analysis using both the Buckingham Pi method and manipulating the governing differential equations was used to theoretically establish similarity parameters. Only partial similarity was reached since conflicts exist between proposed similarity parameters;Experiments of two scale models were conducted to study airflow similarity in ceiling slot-ventilated agricultural enclosures using different similarity criteria.

40|$|Commercial office {{buildings}} predominantly {{are designed to}} be ventilated and cooled using mechanical systems. In temperate climates, passive ventilation and cooling techniques can be utilized to reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort using natural ventilation. However, current modeling techniques have limitations and assumptions that reduce their effectiveness in predicting internal building performance. There are few tools to predict the thermal performance of and resulting airflow patterns in naturally ventilated {{office buildings}} accurately. This thesis presents three significant contributions for the evaluation of natural ventilation in buildings: * A methodology for assessing the performance of naturally ventilated buildings through a reduced-scale air model was developed based on dimensional analysis and <b>similitude</b> <b>criteria.</b> Buoyancy, wind, and combined ventilation strategies for a multi-zoned commercial office building with an open floor plan layout were evaluated using the reduced-scale model. * Guidelines were established for monitoring natural ventilated buildings as a means to evaluate their operation, based on field measurements of a prototype building were established. * A framework for evaluating current techniques for modeling airflow patterns in naturally ventilated buildings was developed, including guidelines for model development and analysis. Data from the reduced-scale model were compared to the data obtained from monitoring a prototype building and then used in creating numerical simulations. (cont.) Certain building characteristics, such as atrium stack vents and railings, influenced the resulting simulation predictions and simple analytical model results. Lack of detailed temperature stratification and surface temperature data in the prototype building prohibited the exact comparison of the methodology for more complex design characteristics, such as thermal mass. by Christine E.

Physics of the atmospheric boundary layer are presented in the context of laboratory applications. The governing equations of fluid and/or particle motion are discussed and analyzed for applications in laboratory testing. The most important similitude parameters, as applied to wind-tunnel requirements for conservation of mass, momentum, energy, and the boundary conditions are presented and discussed. Key findings and results are that: i) in general, flow around a dune or multiple dunes with saltation present cannot be accurately simulated in wind tunnels; ii) flow field around all or part of a full-scale dune can be simulated marginally in a wind tunnel, provided “large ” model scales and “reasonably high ” wind-tunnel speeds are used (the conditions of “large ” model scales and “reasonably high ” speeds are specified within the text); and, iii) it is possible to accurately replicate the process of saltation in wind tunnels provided appropriate <b>similitude</b> and independence <b>criteria</b> of Reynolds and Froude numbers are observed.

The damage of tanks {{can vary from}} local yielding or buckling of the tank wall, to loss of contents, or to collapse which leads to an unrepairable tank. Considerable work {{has been carried out}} on this problem with varying degree of success. However, the results are largely directed toward response rather than failure prediction. The information on failure mechanisms is very limited. The present work consists of scale model testing, correlation with existing analysis and failure prediction with laboratory verification. The scale model testing incorporates dynamic similarity of the fluid/structure interaction problem. The model study shows that small plastic models can be useful in studying the dynamics and buckling of liquid-filled tanks under ground excitation even though the model does not display complete <b>similitude,</b> The buckling <b>criterion</b> proposed in this study is based upon static considerations and the complex stress field in the shell wall is supplanted by a simple field for which analytical/ experimental results are available. Harmonic buckling tests demonstrate that the static buckling criterion is satisfactory even though the prebuckling stress field is time dependent, The harmonic buckling tests, when correlated with the stresses from a response analysis, also indicate that the buckling is largely dependent upon the n= 1 response, Transient buckling tests are also carried out and the results show that the linear analysis together with the static buckling criterion gives a good prediction of the failure of a full fluid-filled tank. The test parameters in these buckling tests include water depth, title angle, thickness of tank wall, top end condition, ground excitation pattern, etc. In addition, buckling tests of unanchored tanks are conducted to study the influence of changing the anchorage of the tank base. An analytical model is suggested to predict the response of an unanchored tank due to overturning moment. The current design criterion of an unanchored tank is also. assessed in this study.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The main text of the thesis consists of seven chapters. Following the literature survey, the work in Chapter 2 focuses {{on the study of}} the whole process of pressure die casting. The necessity of reclassification against the traditional 'three-stage' description is introduced in order to build a new basic tenet in constructing theoretical and practical investigations, which leads to the creation of fluid dynamic mathematical models of the process. On the basis of Chapter 2, Chapter 3 concentrates on dealing with the computer simulation of filling flow patterns occurring in the third stage that play the most important role in the process. The Simplified Marker And Cell (SMAC) method is used to obtain the computational results of the filling patterns of pressure die casting processes. On the basis of the computational analysis of typical examples, the viscosity, gravitational force and velocity effects on the overall filling pattern are examined, that lead to a validation of the important hypothesis that an ideal liquid can be used in numerical simulation of filling patterns and this enables one to achieve a more effective computer program for a complex cavity by quasi- 3 D or 3 D models. Chapter 4 treats a specific problem of the residual flow that exists in the final (fifth) stage of the process. Mathematical models of residual flow are derived. Chapter 5 mainly consists of two parts. The first part deals with the application of similitude laws for simulating flows in pressure die casting processes. Detailed analyses and criteria on different relationships between model and prototype are given in order to correct previously offered formulae by Eckert (1989). The results of numerical simulation presented in Chapter 3 are also extended to validate the <b>similitude</b> <b>criteria.</b> The second part of Chapter 5 presents the use of a charge coupled device(CCD) for studying the diversity of fluid motion including the filling pattern, residual flow, thermals and air entrapment during cavity-fill and post cavity-fill within a one single shot cavity filling in water analogue experiments.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between snow avalanches and structures represents {{a topic of}} interest both from a scientific point of view, since different study domains and knowledge are involved (structural mechanics, fluid dynamics…), and due to its applicability in practice for a correct design of structures located in avalanche risk areas. In this thesis the {{interaction between}} the snow avalanches and structures is investigated together with the avalanche dynamics. Chapter 1 deals with {{the state of the art}} of the avalanche dynamics and interaction between snow in movement and structures. The snow avalanches are classified, giving the basics concepts. Secondly the different approaches to study the interaction between avalanches and structures are analysed. The observations of the damages caused on structures by real events are not sufficient to understand all the complex processes inner the dynamics itself and the impact strictly. Furthermore experiments are carried in order to analyse deeper velocity profiles, to which pressure ones are linked, entrainment of snow, from which the volumes involved depended as well as the pressure behaviour. In fact pressure values evolve in time and in space and change with the obstacle shape. Experimental studies are made at real scale avalanches, in the test sites, or at reduced scale, in laboratory chutes. To translate the results from the small scale to the real one <b>similitude</b> <b>criteria</b> have to be satisfied. Hence the dimensional analysis is proposed. Another approach to study the problem in object is to use analytical and numerical models. For this reason a summary of the state of art of dynamics models is proposed, focusing the attention on those taking into account the erosion and the interaction with obstacles. From both experimental and theoretical analysis recommendations are born in order to help the expert to correctly design the structures in avalanche areas. In Chapter 2 a new model is described, able to provide the pressure and the velocity in all the points of the avalanche, without impose a proportional relationship between them. The model describe the evolution of the avalanche shape thanks to the level set method, suitable for free-boundary problems, and the Navier-Stokes equations, since the avalanche is considered a fluid. A first validation on experimental data of a laboratory chute is given. Afterwards the attention is set at the avalanche bottom. In particular the boundary condition of the slip velocity is analysed, giving an analytical justification. The slip condition, coupled with a non-newtonian fluid, is able to correctly describe the velocity profile. Finally a new model for the erosion is proposed, starting from general continuum mechanics hypothesis. In particular both the avalanche and the snow at rest are considered as the same fluid having a viscosity depending from the shear rate. It is shown as the model is in agreement with other theories in the literature and takes into account the influence of snow and avalanche properties, the avalanche depth, the slope angle, and the position in the avalanche (front or tail). Chapter 3 focuses the attention on the definition of a model to describe the impact of an avalanche with obstacles. Different approaches can be pursued: a stationary and a transient ones, as well as a two-dimensional analysis in the avalanche depth plane, in the slope plane and a three-dimensional one. Some preliminary simulations are shown and qualitatively compared with the state of the art concerning the impact pressure. For instance the pressure profile along the avalanche depth, the influence on the obstacle shape and dimension, and the dependence on the relative position obstacle-avalanche (directly or not directly exposed) are investigated. In Chapter 4 the new Italian P. ta Seehore test site is described. Its peculiarity is to study the small-medium avalanches that occurred with high frequency, since artificially triggered for safe reasons. The attention is focused on the design of an obstacle, located in the avalanche track, to study the interaction between snow in movement and structure. The static and dynamic test carried to characterise it are shown as well as its instrumentation. Finally an overview of the surveys is proposed focusing the attention on the measurements carried in some events. Chapter 5 deals with the analysis of the measurement data concerning experiments in the P. ta Seehore test site from different point of view. Firstly, the erosion and deposition processes are analysed, using laser scan data, analytical and numerical methods and presenting a new cheap test to detect the net erosion and deposition. Secondly, a commercial dynamics model is applied to obtain the flow density and velocity at the obstacle, data not experimentally recorded. Thirdly, our dynamics model is used for instance to simulate the creation of a dihedral shape upward the obstacle, experimentally measured and to give information on the pressure. Finally analytical approaches are used to describe the pressure, applying for instance the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, to simulate the pressure in the avalanche tail. Concepts reported in the available recommendations, as for instance the compressibility of the snow during the impact are used too. In Chapter 6 applications concerning the impact against houses destroyed in 15 th of December 2008 are reported. In particular both the transient and stationary models (in their two and three-dimensional versions) are applied and compared with a back-analysis of damages. General laws for the influence of the impact angle on the pressure are respected as well as the areas of positive and negative pressure. In addition, the protection role played by a house on the structures downstream, especially in term of reduced pressures, is analysed. The Conclusions and outlooks finalize the wor...|$|E
