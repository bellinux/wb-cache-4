40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} value of adding axial {{traction}} to direct MR arthrography of the shoulder, in terms of subacromial and glenohumeral joint <b>space</b> <b>widths,</b> and coverage of the superior labrum-biceps tendon complex and articular cartilage by contrast material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients investigated by direct MR arthrography of the shoulder were prospectively included. Studies were performed with a 3 Tesla (T) unit and included a three-dimensional isotropic fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted gradient-recalled echo sequence, without and with axial traction (4 kg). Two radiologists independently measured {{the width of the}} subacromial, superior, and inferior glenohumeral joint spaces. They subsequently rated the amount of contrast material around the superior labrum-biceps tendon complex and between glenohumeral cartilage surfaces, using a three-point scale: 0 = no, 1 = partial, 2 = full. RESULTS: Under traction, the subacromial (Δ = 2. 0 mm, P = 0. 0003), superior (Δ = 0. 7 mm, P = 0. 0001) and inferior (Δ = 1. 4 mm, P = 0. 0006) glenohumeral joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> were all significantly increased, and both readers noted significantly more contrast material around the superior labrum-biceps tendon complex (P = 0. 014), and between the superior (P = 0. 001) and inferior (P = 0. 025) glenohumeral cartilage surfaces. CONCLUSION: Direct MR arthrography of the shoulder under axial traction increases subacromial and glenohumeral joint <b>space</b> <b>widths,</b> and prompts better coverage of the superior labrum-biceps tendon complex and articular cartilage by contrast material.

50|$|In a {{follow-up}} study in 2008, 572 patients from the GAIT trial continued their supplementation for 2 years. After 2 years of supplementation with glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, {{alone or in}} combination, there was no benefit in slowing the loss of cartilage, in terms of joint <b>space</b> <b>width,</b> when compared to a placebo or celecoxib. As in the original GAIT study, this follow-up study was confounded by unexpected results that made if difficult to conclude anything definitive {{about the effect of}} glucosamine on slowing the progression of OA. Despite the fact that the glucosamine group showed less than one-tenth the joint narrowing (0.013 mm) as the placebo group (0.166 mm), none of the groups experienced joint space narrowing to the degree the researchers expected (0.4 mm) over the two-year period based on earlier studies of OA disease progression. Thus, while the researchers rightly concluded that no treatment in this study was found to produce a ″a clinically important reduction″ in joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> loss none of the participants experienced clinically important progression of their disease during the study period either. In another 2-year follow-up study involving 662 patients from the GAIT trial, published in 2010, there was neither significant pain reduction nor improved function when comparing glucosamine and/or chondroitin to a placebo although the positive control also failed to perform significantly better that the placebo in this study.|$|E

The primary outcome was a 20% reduction in pain over 24 months as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes included an Outcome Measures in Rheumatology/Osteoarthritis Research Society International response and change from baseline in WOMAC pain and function.

5000|$|In mid 1971, William [...] "Bill" [...] Crouse {{invented a}} new bar code called Delta C.It {{achieved}} {{four times the}} characters per inch as Delta B. Delta B compared bar widths to <b>space</b> <b>width</b> to code bits. This was extremely sensitive to ink spread where too much ink or pressure would cause both edges of a bar to spread outward and too little to cause them to shrink. To make it worse as bars spread spaces shrink and vice versa. Delta C achieved its higher performance by only using leading to leading or trailing to trailing edges which was unaffected by uniform ink spread. The code provided best performance when it had a defined character set with a fixed reference distance that spanned most or preferably all the character. In August, 1971, Crouse joined the scanner effort. After several months they had made no progress. They {{were aware of the}} RCA bull’s eye label that could be scanned with a simple straight line laser scanner, but a readable label was far too large. Although Litton Industries proposed a bull’s eye symbol cut in half to reduce the area, it was still too large and presented the same ink smear printing problems as the RCA symbol. The redundancy and checking ability were removed completely. They were also aware of the many proposals from around the world, none of which were feasible.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the biochemical markers of arthritis and the radiographic grading of osteoarthritis (OA) in knees. Seventy-one women aged 49 - 85 years with knee OA were studied. Anterior-posterior knee radiographs and hand radiographs were taken in all patients. The radiographic grading of OA in the knee was performed by using the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria and the joint <b>space</b> <b>width.</b> The 71 patients with knee OA were divided into two groups: 37 patients exhibiting generalized osteoarthritis (GOA) and 34 non-GOA patients, according to the grading of their hand radiograph. C-reactive protein (CRP), urinary pyridinoline, YKL- 40, plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3, MMP- 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) - 1 were measured as the biochemical markers of arthritis. The radiographic grading with the Kellgren-Lawrence scale revealed a significant relationship to the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (P = 0. 003) : the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> decreased with increasing Kellgren-Lawrence grade. All biochemical markers had negative correlations with the joint <b>space</b> <b>width,</b> but only urinary pyridinoline had a significant correlation (P = 0. 039).

PURPOSE: To determine what factors affected joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> and narrowing in patients after removal of isolated degenerative medial meniscus tears. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 62 patients (15 women and 47 men) with all ligaments intact, no previous surgery to either knee, and an isolated degenerative medial meniscus tear removed in 1 knee were examined. The mean age at examination was 58. 2 years at a mean follow-up of 9. 4 years (range, 4 - 20 years). Subjective results were obtained with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee survey. Radiographs were taken using 45 ° weightbearing posteroanterior views. Midpoint and perceived minimum joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> of the medial and lateral compartments of both knees were measured to the nearest 0. 1 mm by 2 observers at different times, and they were blinded as to the previous measurements (Pearson intra- and interclass correlations, > 0. 93).
