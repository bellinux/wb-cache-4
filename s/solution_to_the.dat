5|$|For proper {{protection}} of the wood turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the wood turtle to pass under the road, a solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the wood turtle as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the wood turtle's survival.|$|E
