5000|$|Contamination control {{products}} {{have been used}} by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the commercial nuclear industry for decades to minimize contamination on radioactive equipment and surfaces and fix contamination in place. “Contamination control products” is a broad term that includes fixatives, <b>strippable</b> coatings, and decontamination gels. A fixative product functions as a permanent coating to stabilize residual loose/transferable radioactive contamination by fixing it in place; this aids in preventing the spread of contamination and reduces the possibility of the contamination becoming airborne, reducing workforce exposure and facilitating future deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) activities. <b>Strippable</b> coating products are loosely adhered paint-like films and are used for their decontamination abilities. They are applied to surfaces with loose/transferable radioactive contamination and then, once dried, are peeled off, which removes the loose/transferable contamination along with the product. The residual radioactive contamination on the surface is significantly reduced once the <b>strippable</b> coating is removed. Modern <b>strippable</b> coatings show high decontamination efficiency and can rival traditional mechanical and chemical decontamination methods. Decontamination gels work {{in much the same way}} as other <b>strippable</b> coatings. The results obtained through the use of contamination control products is variable and depends on the type of substrate, the selected contamination control product, the contaminants, and the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/library/Contamination%20Control%20Fixatives%20List.pdf ...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>strippable</b> coatings is an innovative technology for decontamination of nuclear plants and for any decontamination project aiming at removing surface contamination. An adhesive plastic coating is applied on the contaminated surface. The <b>strippable</b> coating {{is allowed to}} cure for up to 24 h, after which it can be easily peeled. The coating traps the contaminants in the polymer matrix. <b>Strippable</b> coatings are non-toxic and do not contain volatile compounds or heavy metals. Since the coating constitutes a solid waste, disposal is easier than treating contaminated liquid wastes, produced by the baseline technology: steam vacuum cleaning, based upon superheated pressurized water in order to remove contaminants from floors and walls. A life cycle assessment (LCA) {{has been carried out}} with the purpose of comparing the <b>strippable</b> coating with the steam vacuum technology. The functional unit of the study is represented by a surface of 1 m(2) to be decontaminated. The results of LCA achieved using Sima Pro 5. 0 (A (R)) software confirm the good environmental performances of <b>strippable</b> coatings. Taking into account both LCA and environmental costs for liquid wastes, the advantages of <b>strippable</b> coatings will be more and more evident...|$|E
40|$|<b>Strippable</b> or {{temporary}} coatings {{were developed}} {{to assist in the}} decontamination of the Three Mile Island (TMI- 2) reactor. These coatings have become a viable option during the decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) of both US Department of Energy (DOE) and commercial nuclear facilities to remove or fix loose contamination on both vertical and horizontal surfaces. A variety of <b>strippable</b> coatings are available to D and D professionals. However, these products exhibit a wide range of performance criteria and uses. The Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) at Florida International University (FIU) was commissioned to perform a 2 -year investigation into <b>strippable</b> coatings. This investigation was divided into four parts: (1) identification of commercially available <b>strippable</b> coating products; (2) survey of D and D professionals to determine current uses of these coatings and performance criteria; (3) design and implementation of a non-radiological testing program to evaluate the physical properties of these coatings; and (4) design and implementation of a radiological testing program to determine decontamination factors and effects of exposure to ionizing radiation.

40|$|The extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) {{is becoming increasingly}} important. Principal applications include orbital space-based astronomy and lithography for integrated circuit computer chips. A main impediment to further development of efficient mirrors {{is the lack of}} reliable optical constants for various materials in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. One reason for the unreliability of the optical constants is that the sample surfaces are often contaminated with foreign material, especially organic compounds, when exposed to laboratory air. Several cleaning techniques were evaluated, namely: 1) <b>strippable</b> solid optical cleaner (Opticlean®); 2) oxygen plasma etch; 3) high energy UV light/ozone; 4) <b>strippable</b> coating followed by oxygen plasma etch, 5) <b>strippable</b> coating fol-lowed by high intensity UV light and, 6) exposure to cold pressurized carbon dioxide (CO 2 snow). These processes are compared experimentally based on effectiveness, cleaning time and ease of use. DADMAC (polydiallyldimethyl-ammo-nium chloride), which forms a layer of known, uniform thickness on silicon wafers is used as a “stand in ” for organic contamination. Effectiveness is judged on how well the sur-face is cleaned. Ellipsometry is used to determine the thick-nesses of surface layers. XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectros-copy) is used to look for trace contaminants, particularly carbon from the DADMAC. We find that the <b>strippable</b> cleaning coat leaves a residue. Oxygen plasma rapidly re-moves contaminants, but can quickly oxidize the silicon surface. Exposure to the UV light/ozone for five minutes leaves the surface clean with little additional oxidation. Oxy-gen plasma or UV light effectively removes the <b>strippable</b> coat residue. Exposure to cold pressurized carbon dioxide has reduced oxide level in one case. The recommended procedure for cleaning bare silicon wafers is <b>strippable</b> coat application followed by 2. 5 minutes of exposure to high intensity UV light...|$|E

40|$|<b>Strippable</b> {{coatings}} are polymer mixtures, such as water-based organic polymers, {{that are}} applied to a surface by paintbrush, roller, or spray applicator. As the polymer reacts, it attracts, absorbs, and chemically binds the contaminants; then, during the curing process, it mechanically locks the contaminants into the polymer matrix. Incorporating fiber reinforcement (such as a cotton scrim) into the coating may enhance the strength of these coatings. Once the coating dries, it can be stripped manually from the surface, In the case of auto-release coatings, the mixture cracks, flakes, and is collected by vacuuming. The surface properties of these coatings may be modified by applying a thin top coat (e. g., polyvinyl alcohol), which may provide a smoother, less permeable surface that would become less severely contaminated. In such a duplex, the thicker basis layer provides the required mechanical properties (e. g., strength and abrasion resistance), while the top layer provides protection from contamination. Once the <b>strippable</b> coating is removed, the loose surface contamination is removed with the coating, producing a dry, hard, non-airborne waste product. The use of <b>strippable</b> coatings during D&D operations has proved a viable option. These coatings {{can be used in}} the following three functions: As a protective coating, when applied to an uncontaminated surface in an area where contamination is present, so that on its removal the surface remains uncontaminated; As a decontamination agent, when applied to a contaminated surface, so that on its removal a significant decontamination of loose particulate activity is achieved; and As a fixative or tie-down coating, when applied to a contaminated surface, so that any loose contamination is tied down, thus preventing the spread of contamination during subsequent handling...|$|E

This recognition has led to numerous studies that deal with the properties of various mercury forms, the development of methods to quantify and speciate the forms, fate and transport, toxicology studies, and the development of site remediation and decontamination technologies. This report reviews several critical areas that will be used in developing technologies for cleaning mercury from mercury-contaminated surfaces of metals and porous materials found in many DOE facilities. The technologies used for decontamination of water and mixed wastes (solid) are specifically discussed. Many technologies that have recently appeared in the literature are included in the report.

40|$|In silurid fishes, semen {{collection}} is practically impossible, even after hormonal stimulation. Instead, males are killed and testes macerated to obtain sperm. To understand the endocrine control of semen release in catfishes, we investigated {{the role of}} smooth muscle contractors in semen release and semen quality of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). In in vitro experiments, testis slices were incubated with oxytocin (1 and 10 IU), isotocin (2 and 20 ug), vasopressin (0. 2 and 2 ug), epinephrine (1 and 10 ug), PGF 2 alpha (1 and 10 ug), purified Clarias LH (300 ng) and partly purified Clarias pituitary extract (containing 300 ng LH). Only oxytocin increased sperm concentration of the medium (assessed by optical density measurements) compared to control incubations. Oxytocin was then tested in vivo in two groups of fish: normal males, and males that had been treated with 17 alpha-methyltestosterone during larval stages to inhibit seminal vesicle development (NIT males). Both groups of fish received two doses of carp pituitary suspension (8 and 10 mg/kg, respectively i. m.) with or without subsequent oxytocin treatment (5 IU/kg i. v.; cPS-OT treatment and cPS treatment, respectively). There was no effect of oxytocin {{on the number of}} <b>strippable</b> males. Of cPS and cPS-OT treated fish, 87 % MT males and 60 % normal males were, <b>strippable.</b> The stripped semen volume was low in both groups but MT males produced higher (P < 0. 001) hatching rates (63. 1 %) than did normal males (2. 1 %).

40|$|The {{number of}} lithographic {{applications}} {{that require the}} use of ultra-thick photoresists is rapidly increasing. Extremely large structure heights and high aspect ratios are often required for micro-electrodeposition of mechanical components such as coils, cantilevers and valves. These ultra-thick photoresists can also be used as a mold in micromachining (MEMS) applications. Ultra-thick photoresists are also used in bump bond applications to define the size and location of the bonds for advanced packaging. The process optimization required to obtain high aspect ratio structures in ultra-thick photoresist films is extremely challenging. The aspect ratios far exceed those encountered in advanced submicron lithography for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing. MicroChem’s epoxy-based SU- 8 thick photoresist, while yielding high performance in the thickness range greater than 100 µm, uses organic solvent development and can not be removed using standard stripper chemistries. This process issue limits the use of SU- 8 to applications where photoresist removal is not necessary. For this study an experimental chemically-amplified, aqueous-developable, <b>strippable,</b> negative photoresist designated STFN v 1 was examined at a thickness of 50 µm using a broad band lithography system optimized for thick photoresist processing. This stepper uses a combination of low numerical aperture, high wafer plane irradiance and broadband exposure from 350 to 450 nm for optimal processing of thick photosensitive films. Basic photoresist characterization techniques established for thin films in IC manufacturing are applied to STFN v 1 photoresist using a ghi-line lithography system. Cross sectional SEM analysis, process linearity and process windows are used to establish the lithographic capabilities of the photoresist. The performance results for the <b>strippable</b> STFN v 1 photoresist are then compared with the non-strippable material SU- 8.

We tested this hypothesis in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a species characterized by polyandry and intense sperm competition, by investigating whether age affects post-copulatory male traits and sperm competition success.

The angle of incidence of the exposing light when using high or hyper NA (numerical aperture) lithography is no longer negligible. As a consequence the optimum film thickness corresponding to the lowest reflection varies with the pitch of the features being imaged In this paper we discuss the results based on a Hyper-NA simulation illustrating the complexity of such at? optimization process.

40|$|We give a {{comprehensive}} review of credit term structure modeling methodologies. The conventional approach to modeling credit term structure is summarized and shown to be equivalent to a particular type of the reduced form credit risk model, the fractional recovery of market value approach. We argue that the corporate practice and market observations do not support this approach. The more appropriate assumption is the fractional recovery of par, which explicitly violates the <b>strippable</b> cash flow valuation assumption that is necessary for the conventional credit term structure definitions to hold. We formulate the survival-based valuation methodology and give alternative specifications for various credit term structures that are consistent with market observations, and show how they can be empirically estimated from the observable prices. We rederive the credit triangle relationship by considering the replication of recovery swaps. We complete the exposition by presenting a consistent measure of CDS-Bond basis and demonstrate its relation to a static hedging strategy, which remains valid for non-par bonds and non-flat term structures of interest rates and credit risk. ...|$|E

Although XLPE has excellent dielectric characteristics, extensive premature failures {{have been reported}} by the local power utilities. The main causes of such premature failures are related to manufacturing defects and insulation degradation mainly caused by water treeing phenomena. In this research work, five types of 15 -kV, XLPE-insulated cables were subjected to accelerated aging under simultaneous electrical, thermal, and environmental stresses for periods of 60, 120, and 180 days. After each aging period, partial-discharge (PD), mechanical properties, ac dielectric strength {{and the extent of}} degradation due to water treeing of these cables were measured. The results show that PD and mechanical properties show just little variations whereas the ac-retained dielectric strength decreases rapidly in the first 60 days after which the rate of its decrease retards.
