50|$|As soon as steam enters, the yarns {{quantity}} of moisture rises at once, {{caused by the}} heating of the yarn and by steam condensation. According to Speakmann the following phenomena {{can be seen in}} the stretched woolen fiber: The cystine side chains are subjected to a hydrolysis at the <b>sulphur</b> <b>bridge,</b> where cystine is dissolved into cysteine and a not yet isolated sulphonic acid.An ionization can be seen at the bridges that were produced from salt liberation. Due to the increase of temperature in the fibers during steaming an oscillation of the molecules is produced which leads to the bursting of the hydrogen bridges; now residual valencies are set free which are able to saturate with the dipole water. The water then acts like a lubrication between the individual molecules. Thus the bonds of the main chains between each other are dissolved by the side chains, the individual polypeptide chains can shift against each other and the tensions find their equilibrium (see illustration 4). When the steaming of the yarn is continued, new side chains are formed between the individual components of the main chains. When finally the yarn is dried, i.e. the moisture balance occurring within the yarn, salt is liberated again and hydrogen bridges are formed. Now the individual polypeptide chains can no longer be shifted against each other and the fibers regained their former closeness, however without having remarkable tensions inside.|$|E

The desired redox state (fully oxidized, reduced CO, mixed valence formate and CO) in the x-ray beam was controlled by low temperature (- 140 degrees C) and was continuously monitored by simultaneous optical spectroscopy and by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) monitoring every 30 min of x-ray exposure. The structure of the active site, a cytochrome a 3 -copper pair in fully oxidized and in mixed valence formate states where they are spin coupled, contains a <b>sulphur</b> <b>bridge</b> with three ligands 2. 60 +/- 0. 03 A from Fea 3 and 2. 18 +/- 0. 03 A from Cua 3. The distance between Fea 3 and Cua 3 is 3. 75 +/- 0. 05 A, making the sulphur bond angle 103 degrees reasonable for sp 3 sulphur bonding. The Fea 3 first shell has four typical heme nitrogens (2. 01 +/- 0. 03 A) with a proximal nitrogen at 2. 14 +/- 0. 03 A. The sixth ligand is the bridging sulphur. The Cua 3 first shell is identical to oxidized stellacyanin containing two nitrogens and a bridging sulphur. Upon reduction with CO, the active site is identical to reduced stellacyanin for the Cua 3 first shell and contains the sulphur that forms the bridge in fully oxidized and mixed valence formate states. The Fea 3 first shell is identical to oxyhemoglobin but has CO instead of O 2. The other redox centers, Fea and the other "EPR detectable" Cu are not observed in higher shells of Fea 3. Fea has six equidistant nitrogens and Cua has one (or two) nitrogens and three (or two) sulphurs with typical distances; these ligands change only slight on reduction.

M 89 2012 The aim of {{this study}} was to {{synthesize}} a binuclear iron complex which may serve as possible starting material for the formation of a dinitrogen complex at ordinary conditions of temperature and pressure. Dinitrogen complexes are important as they are seen as possible substitutes for the Haber process in the synthesis of ammonia gas as some dinitrogen complex undergo a proton induced reduction to ammonia. The following complexes were synthesized; FeH 2 (dppe) 2, FeH(SOCl) (dppe) 2 and the binuclear iron complex (dppe) 2 HFeSOFeH(dppe) 2. The complex FeH 2 (dppe) 2 was obtained by reacting anhydrous iron (II) chloride and l, 2 bisdiphenylphosphino) ethane -in equal molar amounts using acetone as a solvent. Sodium tetrahydroborate was used to reduce the chlorides in the complex formed. The complex FeH(SOCI) (dppe) 2 was obtained by reacting FeH 2 (dppe) 2 complex with thionyl chloride in equal molar amounts while the complex (dppe) 2 HFeSOFeH(dppe) 2 was obtained by reacting equal molar amounts of complexes FeH(dppe) 2 and FeH(SOClj(dppe) 2 using acetone as a solvent. All preparative work was done in a dry and oxygen-free nitrogen atmosphere as the complexes were thought to be susceptible to destruction by oxygen. The results so far obtained confirms that the binuclear iron complex were synthesized, which contain a <b>sulphur</b> <b>bridge</b> unlike most of the synthesized complexes which contain phosphine Iigands, The conclusion made is supported by elemental analysis data that were used to deduce the formula of the complexes, IR spectroscopy and l 3 C and I H NMR spectroscopy for all synthesizes complexes as recorded and used to determine the structural information of the complexes. Recommendation for further research are proposed and which include; attempt to crystallize the synthesized binuclear complex and carry out its X -Ray structural determination, and investigate the reaction between the complex FeH(SOCI) (dppe) 2 with the known molybdenum hydrides complexes which may forms an even better binuclear complex of iron and molybdenum joined by a sulphur ligand.

The chains contain 21 and 30 amino acids, respectively. Two sulphide bridges between the cysteine acids link the two chains together so that the protein can function. By staining the insulin with a fluorescent stain called Alexa Fluor 488, protein residues on a surface can be microscoped with a confocal microscope. In this project the <b>sulphur</b> <b>bridges</b> on stained and unstained insulin are reduced, forming unbound polypeptide chains and it is attempted to separate the chains in fractions by using the size chromatography, native and SDS PAGE, ion exchange chromatography and HPLC methods.

Such complexes {{can serve as a}} model system to understand the exciting magnetic phenomena in such class of materials and also can put forward as candidates for the so called molecular nanomagnets. A direct assessment of the effective magnetic moment and the effective interaction between the metal ions in the complex can be done using magnetization measurements. Here the magnetization studies are performed as a function of temperature and field using a SQUID magnetometer. Yet another powerful tool to characterize and determine the spin levels, the ESR spectroscopic methods, has also been exploited. The study of the dynamical properties of this class of materials was relevant to understand the relaxation mechanism in the low temperatures. For this a new ac susceptometer has been built in house which was another main objective of this dissertation work. The design, fabrication, calibration and automation done on this device is presented in this thesis. The device has been tested using the known molecular magnet Mn 12 acetate, and the antiferromagnet Dy 2 PdSi 3. The present work is mainly focused on the magnetic properties of Mn, Ni and Fe based organometallic complexes. The studied Mn dimer with different acceptor and donor ligands exhibit the fine tuning of the electron density at the core of molecular complex by variation in ligands. This in turn shows that the change in peripheral ligands can control the magnetism of the molecule. The influence of the change in Ni-S-Ni bond angle in the magnetic exchange interaction is studied in a Ni(2) dimer and a Ni(2) trimer complex. The Ni dimer complex shows a ferromagnetic interaction (J = - 42 K) whereas trimer shows an antiferromagnetic interaction (J = 140 K).

Under the same conditions, perchlorocoronene confined within a nanotube cavity, where the molecules are situated in very close proximity to each other, enables imaging of intermolecular reactions, starting with the Diels Alder cycloaddition of a generated aryne, followed by rearrangement of the angular adduct to a planar polyaromatic structure {{and the formation of}} a perchlorinated zigzag nanoribbon of graphene as the final product.

So chalcogenide glasses and fibers have potential wide applications {{in the fields of}} all-optical information processing, infrared lasers, nonlinear optical devices, and so on, the studies of their optical nonlinearity are one of the attractive subjects in the area of optoelectronics at present. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to improve the stability and enhance the intensity of nonlinearity in chalcogenide glasses and fibers by means of exploring new glass compositions, optimizing the external field poling method, designing and fabricating fibers with special structures, all of these will promote their real applications. The main results are concluded as follows. The glass-forming region of GeS 2 -GA 2 S 3 -AgX (X=Cl, Br, I) and GeS 2 -Ga (In) 2 S 3 -CuI systems were determined, the maximal content of the additive halides are 70 % and 12 % respectively. In both two systems glasses, with the increasing addition of halides, the thermal stability reduce, density and linear refractive index increase, the ultraviolet cut-off edges shift to longer wavelength, while the infrared cut-off edges keep almost the same. 30 GeS 2 35 Ga 2 S 3 35 AgCl and 47. 5 GeS 2 17. 5 Ga 2 S 3 35 AgCl surface- and bulk-crystallized glasses that contain AgGaGeS 4 nonlinear optical crystallites were prepared. Obvious second harmonic generation (SHG) could be observed in these crystallized glasses, and their intensity relate to the distribution and size of the precipitated AgGaGeS 4 crystals, the maximal second-order nonlinearity coefficients is as high as 12. 4 pm/V. These crystallized glasses have good chemical and SHG stability. For GeS 2 -Ga (In) 2 S 3 -CuI systems glasses, due to their small glass-forming region, they are not suit for the preparation of crystallized glasses that contain CuGaS 2 or CuInS 2 nonlinear optical crystals. According to the structural studies of two system glasses, the main structural units of theses glasses are [YS 4 -xXx] (Y=Ge, Ga, In. X=Cl, Br, I) mixed anion tetrahedrons, they form a three-dimensional glassy network through <b>bridging</b> <b>sulphur</b> bonds. When the contents of halides MX(M=Ag, Cu. X=Cl, Br, I) are low, some [XxS 3 -xGe(Ga) S 3 -xXx] (X=Cl, Br, I) mixed ethane-like structural units exist in the glass network, and they will gradually transform to [YS 4 -xXx] (Y=Ge, Ga, In. X=Cl, Br, I) mixed anion tetrahedrons with the increasing content of halides, till totally disappear. Both two system glasses have ultrafast (~ 150 fs) third-order optical nonlinearity and reverse saturation absorption, they belong to self-focusing medium. The third-order optical nonlinearity mainly originate from the distortion of electron cloud of Y-X (Y=Ge, Ga, In, X=Cl, Br, I, S) bonds in the structural units. For GeS 2 -GA 2 S 3 -AgX (X=Cl, Br, I) system glasses, the largest nonlinear susceptibility n 2 is 10. 50 x 10 - 18 m/W, the smallest figure of merit (FOM) is 0. 606. In addition, the relation of n 2 with n 0 do not obey Miller s rule, but in accordance with the structural variation.

40|$|Neutral organic {{radicals}} {{have been}} pursued for conductive and magnetic solid state properties {{associated with their}} unpaired electron. Historically, synthetic challenges and design limitations restricted these materials into Mott insulating states {{as a result of}} a strong Coulomb repulsion preventing the mobility of electrons. As a result, electrons were localized to their parent radicals, and exhibit only weak magnetic interactions. Recent synthetic advances by the Oakley group have allowed access more strongly interacting regimes in neutral radicals, where the kinetic and potential energies are in competition, and the electrons are on the verge of delocalization. This regime is characterized by a variety of strong magnetic interactions, and, under pressure, metallic states have been accessed for the first time. For this reason, it is important to consider the placement of these radicals with respect to other "strongly correlated" materials at the border between metals and magnets, which has proved a fruitful region, hosting unconventional high T_c superconductors, colossal magnetoresistive oxides, and other materials of technological interest. The purpose of this thesis is to consider radicals within this context, as well as introduce theoretical and experimental methods for probing this emerging class of correlated solids. We consider, in particular, the role of orbital degrees of freedom on the electronic and magnetic properties. To this end, we present a general framework for computing magnetic exchange interactions incorporating Hund's rule coupling and multiple orbitals in the vicinity of the Fermi level. We extend this framework to include spin-orbit coupling, which directly mixes the spin and orbital degrees of freedom over wide energy scales. This effect leads to anisotropic exchange interactions, which are responsible for a wide variety of magnetic phenomena in heavy selenium-based radicals. A new ab-initio method for constructing effective Hubbard models is presented, which allows us for the first time to directly compute the magnitude and character of anisotropic interactions for organic materials. In order to directly probe the effects of spin-orbit coupling, we have performed magnetic resonance experiments on an isostructural series of heavy selenium-based radicals. We demonstrate conclusively that the observed effects are the result of anisotropic exchange interactions, and find excellent agreement between the experimental and theoretical results, both at ambient, and high pressures. The modes of magnetic order are investigated over a range of pyridine-bridged bis-dithiazolyl radicals. On the basis of symmetry analysis, such materials may be grouped according to the sign of magnetic exchange along their π-stacks, with ferromagnetic interactions required for the appearance of a net moment, either due to bulk ferromagnetic order or spin-canting in antiferromagnets. We find evidence for a strong multi-orbital ferromagnetic contribution to the interactions between stacks in a selection of Se-based radicals. However, the empty orbitals responsible for this effect are not sufficiently low in energy to contribute to the states in the vicinity of the Fermi level in the solid state. This observation has implications for the response of these materials to pressure, which enhances solid state bandwidth, and prompts a transition from an insulating magnetic state to one exhibiting metallic properties above 6 - 8 GPa. We compare the properties of this metallic state to those predicted using the Dynamical Mean Field approach. We further consider how the modification of the orbital manifold may stabilize metallic states at lower pressures, and without need for synthetically challenging Se incorporation. The first materials considered are hybrid dithiazolyl/thiadiazinyl radicals for which additional orbitals may be introduced near the Fermi level through judicious choice of exocyclic groups. However, despite demonstrating a new and general synthetic pathway to these radicals, we find that the introduced orbitals do not satisfy the requirements for hybridization with the SOMO band appearing at the Fermi energy. Instead, we investigate the properties of <b>sulphur</b> based oxobenzene <b>bridged</b> radicals. These materials are found to have an exceedingly low-lying empty LUMO that is strongly coupled to the SOMO through Hund exchange. The interaction of the LUMO and SOMO allows metallic states to be accessed as low as 3 GPa, and generates strong ferromagnetic interactions. We investigate this Mott transition through infrared measurements, and introduce a phenomenological model for the evolution of the electronic structure, which is is confirmed through Dynamical Mean Field calculations. On the basis of this model, we consider chemical modifications to further tune the properties of these radicals, which leads to a nearly metallic material already at ambient pressure, and a spin-orbit coupled system that can only be understood outside the context of Moriya's standard treatment of anisotropic exchange. Viewing neutral radicals within the context of other strongly correlated materials not only provides insights into their properties, but also suggests routes to future functional materials. The most dramatic and exotic properties are often found where different energy scales compete, as in the kinetic and potential energy in the vicinity of the Mott transition. The results of this thesis suggest neutral organic radicals may additionally be influenced by spin-orbit effects and Hund's rule coupling of similar magnitude, the full exploration of which will no doubt lead to novel properties. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|El treball que es presenta en aquesta tesi {{doctoral}} és la continuació i ampliació de la feina feta en el nostre grup en els darrers anys sobre el metal·lacarborà cobalto-bis(dicarballur). Amb la finalitat de la seva aplicació com a components de materials moleculars, calia com a objectiu inicial la síntesi i caracterització de nous derivats en els àtoms de carboni i de bor del clúster, així com l'estudi teòric d'alguns d'aquests compostos que presentaven propietats que no s'havien observat fins al moment. A partir d'aquests compostos s'han buscat aplicacions en els camps del tractament de residus nuclears, motors sintètics moleculars i en el camp de la biomedicina. Finalment i per ampliar el coneixement en el camp dels carborans, s'han fet estudis teòrics del pKa de nido-carborans, s'ha estudiat tant teòrica com experimentalment la reacció de cloració de l'anió [Ph-CB 9 H 9]- i s'ha participat en l'elaboració d'un treball d'interaccions intermoleculars entre molècules de iode i fosfino-carborans. Pel que fa a la síntesi de derivats en els àtoms de carboni, s'han obtingut productes substituïts amb àtoms de fòsfor i de sofre. En el primer cas l'àtom de fòsfor fa de pont entre les dues caixes de dicarballur de manera semblant als derivats del ferrocè anomenats ferrocenofans. Pel que fa als derivats de l'anió cobalto-bis(dicarballur) amb sofre s'han obtingut derivats disubstituïts amb funcions tioèter a partir dels disulfurs orgànics apropiats, i altres en què l'àtom o àtoms de sofre estan pinçant les dues caixes de dicarballur. Les substitucions en els vèrtexs de bor s'han treballat en tres vies diferents. La primera és l'halogenació de l'anió cobalto-bis(dicarballur) amb àtoms de clor, brom i iode emprant diferents mètodes, tant en dissolució com en estat sòlid. S'ha estudiat en més detall la reacció de cloració per la importància dels seus compostos en l'extracció de radionúclids. La segona via que s'ha treballat consisteix en la formació d'enllaços B-C utilitzant les condicions de reacció ben establertes per l'acoblament C-C com la reacció de Kumada o la de Heck. La tercera via parteix ja d'un oxo-derivat de l'anió 1, el zwitterió [8 -OC 4 H 8 O- 1, 2 -(C 2 B 9 H 11) 2]- (43). Aquest té l'oxigen enllaçat al B(8) fet que el fa que estigui carregat positivament, i per tant susceptible a l'atac de nucleòfils. S'han sintetitzat i caracteritzat un ampli ventall de compostos utilitzant diversos nucleòfils com alcohols, àcids, reactius de grignard, tiols, carborans i tiocarborans. Alguns dels compostos sintetitzats en aquest treball s'han aplicat en diversos camps. Els derivats clorats del cobalto-bis(dicarballur) s'han provat com a agents sinèrgics en l'extracció selectiva de radionúclids amb resultats interessants en quant a la millora de la selectivitat quan s'usen aquests compostos. També s'ha provat la incorporació del metal·lacarborà cobalto-bis(dicarballur) en màquines moleculars, i més concretament en rotors del tipus rotaxà. S'han sintetitzat i caracteritzat nous rotaxans a fi d'estudiar l'efecte intramolecular o intermolecular del clúster de bor en la dinàmica d'aquest tipus de molècules. D'altra banda s'han utilitzat alguns dels oxo-derivats en el vèrtex B(8) en la investigació antimicrobiana i en el tractament en cèl·lules tumorals. Finalment, tot i que els objectius d'aquest treball es centraven en el metal·lacarborà cobalto-bis(dicarballur) també s'ha fet un estudi teòric de carborans tenint en compte que aquests són part del cobalto-bis(dicarballur). En primer lloc s'ha volgut ampliar l'estudi de cloració fet a l'anió 1 sobre un altre clúster de bor. L'anió [Ph-CB 9 H 9]- (86) mostra l'interès de tenir dos punts de reactivitat molt diferent, els vèrtex aromàtics C-H i els del clúster B-H. Per altra banda s'ha buscat un mètode teòric per tal de calcular l'acidesa de nido-carborans mitjançant una metodologia ràpida i senzilla. Per últim s'ha realitzat un estudi que tracta les interaccions entre els fosfinocarborans i el iode. És interessar observar el cas del compost [1 -Me- 2 -PPh 2 - 1, 2 -C 2 B 10 H 10] (99) on l'addició de iode no provoca una disminució de la interacció entre ambdós àtoms, indicant la formació d'una estructura del tipus P···I-I···P. Aquest tipus d'estructura també es troba en estat sòlid tal com demostra l'estructura de raigs X. The work {{presented in}} this manuscript is the continuation and extension of the work done in our group during the last years on the cobaltabisdicarbollide metallacarborane. To apply these molecules as components of molecular materials, the initial objectives were the synthesis and characterization of new derivatives of cobaltabisdicarbollide on the carbon and boron vertices of the cluster, {{as well as a}} theoretical study of some of these compounds that presented properties not previously observed. The second objective was the application of some of these compounds to different fields such as the treatment of nuclear waste, molecular synthetic motors and in biomedicine. Finally, work on carboranes has also been done as these are part of metallacarboranes. Theoretical calculations of pKa values of nido-carboranes have been done. It has been studied both theoretically and experimentally the chlorination reaction of the anion [Ph-CB 9 H 9]-. Also the intermolecular interaction between iodine molecules and phosphino-carboranes has been studied by computational methods. Concerning the synthesis of carbon functionalized compounds, products substituted with phosphorus and sulphur have been obtained. In the first case the phosphorus is bridging the two dicarbollide cages in a way similar to the already known ferrocene derivatives called ferrocenophanes. Sulphur derivatives of cobaltabisdicarbollide have been obtained as disubstituted molecules with thioether groups obtained from the appropriate organic disulfides. C,C bridging molecules in which one or two <b>sulphur</b> atoms <b>bridge</b> both dicarbollide cages have also been obtained. Boron substituted vertices have been studied in three different ways. The first concerns halogenation of cobaltabisdicarbollide anion with chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms by using different methods, such as solution or solid state reactions. It has been studied more deeply the chlorination reaction because of the importance of these compounds on the extraction of radionuclides. The second way studied concerning the derivatization of 1 refers to the formation of B-C bonds by using either Kumada reaction or Heck reaction conditions. The third way of cobaltabisdicarbollide derivatization has as the starting product the oxo-derivative of 1, the zwitterion [8 -OC 4 H 8 O- 1, 2 -(C 2 B 9 H 11) 2]- (43). This compound has an oxygen atom bonded to the B(8) vertex with a positive charge and this position is susceptible to the attack by nucleophiles. We have synthesized and characterized a wide range of compounds by using different nucleophiles such as alcohols, acids, Grignard reagents, thiols, carboranes and thiocarboranes. Some compounds synthesized during this work have been used in different applications. Chlorinated derivatives of cobaltabisdicarbollide have been tested as synergic agents in the selective extraction of radionuclides for nuclear waste treatment. It has been tested the incorporation of metallacarborane cobaltabisdicarbollide in molecular machine structures, and more precisely in rotors like organic molecules called rotaxanes. We have synthesized and characterized new rotaxanes specially designed to study intramolecular or intermolecular effects of the boron cluster in the dynamics of this kind of molecules. Moreover, some oxo-derivatives at the B(8) vertex of cobaltabisdicarbollide have been applied in the research of antimicrobial and antitumoral treatments. Finally and although the aims of this work were centered on cobaltabisdicarbollide, some theoretical and experimental studies on carboranes have been done taking into account that these are part of the cobaltacarborane. Firstly we would like to improve the understanding of the chlorination reaction, extending the work done for 1 to other boron clusters. Anion [Ph-CB 9 H 9]- (86) was selected because it has two very different reactivity points, aromatic C-H groups and B-H cluster vertices. On the other hand we have described a theoretical method to calculate the acidity of nido-carboranes by means of a fast, reliable and simple methodology. Finally, {{the last part of the}} manuscript was focused on interactions between phosphino-carboranes and iodine. It is remarkable the behaviour of compound [1 -Me- 2 -PPh 2 - 1, 2 -C 2 B 10 H 10] (99), where upon addition of iodine the decrease of the interaction can't be observed. This behaviour can be explained by the formation of a P···I-I···P moiety, which can be observed in solid state by its x-ray crystal structure...|$|R
40|$|Described herein, is the {{synthesis}} and coordination chemistry of eight novel ligands L 1 -L 8, and the solid state studies of diphenylcarbazide and dithizone. These ligands form metallosupramolecular assemblies upon coordination of {{transition metal ions}} resulting {{in a wide range}} of architectures. Described in chapter two is a series of ligands that contain both N-donor and N-oxide donor atoms, L 1 -L 4. Reaction of L 1 with Cu 2 + results in the formation of a mononuclear complex [Cu(L 1) (ClO 4) 2 (sol) ] (solvent = MeCN or H 2 O), whereas L 2 forms the dinuclear double helicate [Ni 2 (L 2) 2] 4 + with Ni 2 +. Reaction of L 3 with Cu 2 + results in the formation of a head-to-tail dinuclear double helicate [Cu 2 (L 3) 2] 4 +. The N-oxide units imparts flexibility in the ligand strand and where the unoxidised ligand strand forms a circular helicate, the incorporation of an N-oxide unit allows the formation of the dinuclear double helicate. Reaction of L 4 with Co 2 + results in the formation of a tetranuclear circular helicate [Co 4 (L 4) 4] 8 +. Analogous complexes that contain ligands with a 1, 3 -phenyl spacer unit give pentanuclear circular helicates, whereas with a 1, 3 -phenol spacer the lower tetranuclear species is observed. The difference in the nuclearity of the circular helicates is due to the steric bulk of the methyl group on the central phenol spacer. In the dinuclear double complex formed with L 3 the N-oxide unit allows the ligand to flex, whereas the steric bulk of the –OH unit in L 4 is sufficiently large that even with the added flexibility that the N-oxide units imparts a double helicate cannot be formed. Chapter three introduces a new class of polydentate ligands, L 5 -L 7, these ligands consist of N-donor domains separated by a 1, 3 -phenol unit. The ligand L 5 contains two identical tridentate N-donor domains, reaction of L 5 with Zn 2 + results in a tetranuclear circular helicate [Zn 4 (L 5) 4] 8 +. Within the structure all four Zn 2 + ions are six-coordinate, arising from the coordination of two tridentate domains from two different ligand strands. Reaction of L 6 with Ag+ results in the formation of the dinuclear double meso-helicate [Ag 2 (L 6) 2] 2 +. Reaction of L 6 with Cd 2 + produces a crystalline material that consists of both colourless and orange species. The colourless crystals correspond to the mononuclear complex [Cd(L 6) 2 (MeCN) 2] 2 +, whereas the orange crystals produce the dinuclear double meso-helicate [Cd 2 (L 6) 2] 2 +. This variation in self-assembly is a direct result of the –OH unit on the 1, 3 -phenol spacer; if the -OH unit is protonated the oxygen atom can only coordinate once and therefore the mononuclear complex forms, however deprotonation of one of the -OH unit results in the oxygen coordinating twice as a bridging donor to form the dinuclear complex. Both the [Cd(L 6) 2 (MeCN) 2] 2 + and [Cd 2 (L 6) 2] 2 + species are present in solution, under equilibrium conditions, varying the stoichiometry alters the predominant species. The ligand L 7 is unsymmetrical, upon reaction with Co 2 + the ligand partitions into two different binding sites; a tridentate N-donor domain and a tridentate domain consisting of the bidentate N-donor domain and the O-donor atom from the central 1, 3 -phenol spacer. The resulting dinuclear HH-[Co 2 (L 7) 2] 3 + complex demonstrates that the two cobalt metal centres occupy different binding sites. Examining the solid state X-ray crystallographic data suggests that the two cobalt metal centres in the [Co 2 (L 7) 2] 3 + complex occupy different oxidation states; Co 2 + and Co 3 + to give a mixed valence helicate. In an analogues fashion to L 6, reaction of L 7 with Zn 2 + produces a crystalline material that consists of both colourless and orange species. The colourless crystals correspond to the mononuclear complex [Zn(L 7) 2] 2 +, whereas the orange crystals produce the dinuclear double helicate [Zn 2 (L 6) 2] 3 +. In the mononuclear [Zn(L 7) 2] 2 + species the Zn 2 + metal centre is coordinated by the tridentate N-donor domain of two different ligands. In the dinuclear [Zn 2 (L 6) 2] 3 + species each Zn 2 + metal centres is coordinated by the tridentate N-donor domain of one ligand and the tridentate domain, consisting of the bidentate N-donor and the O-donor from the central 1, 3 -phenol spacer, from another different ligand. The variation in the self-assembly is a direct result of the stoichiometry of the reaction; the formation of these two complexes is under the same equilibrium conditions of the previous L 6 structures. Described in chapter four is the potentially pentadentate N-donor ligand L 8, which comprises of a bidentate and tridentate binding domains separated by a 1, 3 -pyrene spacer. Reaction of L 8 with Cu 2 + results in the formation of a tetranuclear circular helicate [Cu 4 (L 8) 4] 8 +. Each of the Cu 2 + ions adopts a 5 -coordinate geometry formed by the coordination of the bidentate domain of one ligand strand and the tridentate domain of a different ligand strand, resulting in a head-to-tail tetranuclear circular helicate. The formation of this head-to-tail circular helicate is a result of the 1, 3 -pyrene spacer preventing the formation of the linear double stranded assemblies and secondly the stereoelectronic preference of Cu 2 +. Chapter five reports the solid state studies of diphenylcarbazide and dithizone, which are both useful reagents for the colorimetric determination of a variety of different metal ions. Examination of the scientific literature over the past 100 years shows that the coordination chemistry of DPC and DPTC is inconsistent, with literature sources proposing contradictory and non-definitive explanations, this chapter aims to extend the knowledge surrounding these reagents by isolating crystals. DPC reacts with Cd 2 + to form the mononuclear species [Cd(DPC) 2] 2 + the two ligands are coordinating through both the N-donor and O-donor domains. The discrepancies surrounding the DPC reaction is whether the redox reactions between the metal and ligand occur, upon reaction of DPC and Cd 2 + the metal does not oxidise the ligand. Reaction of DPC and Cu 2 + is more complex than the previous Cd 2 + reaction, the resulting [Cu 3 OH(OH 2) 3 (DPTO) 6] 5 + structure comprises of six ligands and three metal ions. DPC undergoes oxidative intramolecular cyclisation to form the nitrogen containing heterocycle 2, 3 -diphenyltetrazolium- 5 -olate (DPTO) and coordinates the Cu 2 + metal centre in two different modes: via both the oxygen and amide nitrogen atoms or by the bridging carbonyl unit. The [Cu 3 OH(OH 2) 3 (DPTO) 6] 5 + structure is also generated when reacting DPCO with Cu 2 +. Unfortunately a crystal of a chromium or vanadium complex with DPC was not achieved; however the cyclised ligand was isolated, highlighting that the oxidation and cyclisation of DPC is important in the coordination chemistry of these ions. Reaction of the sulphur derivative DPTC with various metal ions results in the deprotonation of the ligand to form the monoanionic species, which coordinates the metal ions via the S-donor and azo N-donor atoms. Reaction of DPTC with Hg 2 + to form the mononuclear complex [Hg(DPTC) 2]. The simple mononuclear complex involves two DPTC ligands coordinating the four-coordinate Hg 2 + ion as a bidentate donor via the N-donor and S-donor atoms. The reaction of DPTC with both Hg 2 + and Ag+ results in an interesting structure containing two Ag+, two Hg 2 + and four DPTC ligands. The DPTC appears to first react with Hg 2 + to form the previous [Hg(DPTC) 2] complex, this then acts as a bidentate ligand, coordinating via the S-donor atom and the Hg 2 + itself to form the [Hg 2 Ag 2 (DPTC) 4 (acetone) 2 (ClO 4) 2] complex. The reaction of DPTC with Cu 2 +, whether the anion is perchlorate or tetrafluoroborate, results in a very interesting structure, which comprises of eight DPTC ligands and eight Cu+ metal ions. The reaction of Cu 2 + with DPTC results in the metal ion reducing to Cu+ and simultaneously the DPTC deprotonates to form the monoanionic form. The counter-anion acts as a template and the formation of the “Cu 8 ” is a result of the presence of the anion. Reaction of copper (II) acetate with DPTC results in the [Cu 2 (DPTC) 2 (DPTCO) ] complex. The structure contains three ligands and two reduced distorted tetrahedral Cu+ ions. Each Cu+ ion has four-coordinate geometry arising from the coordination of two different forms of the DPTC ligands. Two of the ligands present are the monoanionic DPTC, coordinating via the S-donor and terminal N-donor azo atoms. Whereas the third ligand has completely oxidised to form DPTCO, coordinating via both the terminal N-donor azo N-donor atoms, the <b>sulphur</b> atom <b>bridges</b> both of the metal ions...|$|R
