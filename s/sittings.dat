40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} erect <b>sitting,</b> slouched posture with cross-legged <b>sitting,</b> and erect posture with cross-legged <b>sitting</b> on the lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure. [Subjects] For the ex-periments, 17 healthy women were recruited. [Methods] All {{subjects were asked to}} perform three <b>sitting</b> postures: erect <b>sitting,</b> slouched posture with cross-legged <b>sitting,</b> and erect posture with cross-legged <b>sitting.</b> Lumbar and pelvic angles were measured using a three-dimensional motion-capture system, and gluteal pressure was measured using a pressure mat. [Results] Compared to erector <b>sitting,</b> slouched posture with cross-legged <b>sitting</b> showed significantly greater lumbar flexion, posterior pelvic tilt, and left pelvic tilt. Compared to erect <b>sitting,</b> erect posture with cross-legged <b>sitting</b> showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect posture with cross-legged <b>sitting,</b> slouched posture with cross-legged <b>sitting</b> showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect <b>sitting</b> and erect posture with cross-legged <b>sitting,</b> slouched pos-ture with cross-legged <b>sitting</b> showed significantly greater left gluteal pressure; {{there was no significant difference}} in right gluteal pressure.

40|$|High {{amounts of}} time spent <b>sitting</b> can {{increase}} cardiovascular disease risk and are deleteriously associated cardio-metabolic risk biomarkers. Though evidence suggests that accruing <b>sitting</b> time in prolonged periods may convey additional risk, verification using high-quality measures is needed. We examined this issue in adults from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study, using accurate measures of <b>sitting</b> accumulation. In 2011 / 12, 739 adults aged 36 to 89 years (mean±SD 58 ± 10 years) wore activPAL 3 ™ monitors (which provide accurate objective measures of sitting); 678 provided ≥ 4 valid days of monitor data and complete cardio-metabolic biomarker and confounder data. Multivariable linear regression models examined associations of <b>sitting</b> time, <b>sitting</b> time accrued in ≥ 30 minute bouts (prolonged <b>sitting</b> time), and three measures of <b>sitting</b> accumulation patterns with cardio-metabolic risk markers: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, high- and low- density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2 -hour post-load glucose (PLG). Interactions tests examined whether associations of <b>sitting</b> time with biomarkers varied by usual <b>sitting</b> bout duration. Adjusted for potential confounders, greater amounts of <b>sitting</b> time and prolonged <b>sitting</b> time were significantly (p< 0. 05) deleteriously associated with BMI, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Total <b>sitting</b> time was also significantly associated with higher PLG. Sitting accumulation patterns of frequently interrupted <b>sitting</b> (compared to patterns with relatively more prolonged <b>sitting)</b> were significantly beneficially associated with BMI, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, PLG, and with FPG. Effect sizes were typically larger for accumulation patterns than for <b>sitting</b> time. Significant interactions (p< 0. 05) showed that associations of <b>sitting</b> time with HDL, triglycerides and PLG became more deleterious the longer at a time <b>sitting</b> was usually accumulated. Adding to previous evidence reliant on low-quality measures, our study showed that accumulating <b>sitting</b> in patterns where <b>sitting</b> was most frequently interrupted had significant beneficial associations with several cardio-metabolic biomarkers and that <b>sitting</b> for prolonged periods at a time may exacerbate some {{of the effects of}} <b>sitting</b> time.

40|$|Background: Children {{adopting}} {{different styles}} of <b>sitting</b> in class rooms may have an influence over the hamstring length which indirectly produces an effect on posture, gait and musculoskeletal problems. Hence, physiotherapists {{play an important role}} in preventing the problems that are to be developed due to the <b>sitting</b> posture adopted at school. Hence, it is important for all the health professionals to understand and know about the effect of different <b>sitting</b> styles of children in school over the children health. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of two <b>sitting</b> postures (crossed leg <b>sitting</b> and bench <b>sitting)</b> on hamstring flexibility in school going children. Aim of the Study to observe the influence of bench <b>sitting</b> and crossed-leg <b>sitting</b> on hamstring flexibility in school going children. Methods: 200 school children (105 boys and 95 girls) from private schools (those who are bench <b>sitting)</b> and 200 school children (109 boys and 91 girls) from government schools (those who are crossed leg <b>sitting)</b> aged 6 - 10 years were included in this study. Active Knee Extension (AKE) test with the aid of a simple and economically cheap stabilizing apparatus was used to determine hamstring flexibility. Measurements were taken for both right and left knee. Results: The mean Active Knee Extension (AKE) score for bench <b>sitting</b> children was 132. 4 and for crossed leg <b>sitting</b> children was 130. 1.

5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary <b>sittings,</b> but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
40|$|Background Accelerometers {{have been}} used to {{determine}} {{the amount of time that}} children spend sedentary. However, as time spent <b>sitting</b> may be detrimental to health, research is needed to examine whether accelerometer sedentary cut-points reflect the amount of time children spend <b>sitting.</b> The aim of this study was to: a) examine agreement between ActiGraph (AG) cut-points for sedentary time and objectively-assessed periods of free-living <b>sitting</b> and <b>sitting</b> plus standing time using the activPAL (aP); and b) identify cut-points to determine time spent <b>sitting</b> and <b>sitting</b> plus standing. Methods Forty-eight children (54 % boys) aged 8 – 12 years wore a waist-mounted AG and thigh-mounted aP for two consecutive school days (9 – 3 : 30 pm). AG data were analyzed using 17 cut-points between 50 – 850 counts·min− 1 in 50 counts·min− 1 increments to determine sedentary time during class-time, break time and school hours. Sitting and <b>sitting</b> plus standing time were obtained from the aP for these periods. Limits of agreement were computed to evaluate bias between AG 50 to AG 850 sedentary time and <b>sitting</b> and <b>sitting</b> plus standing time. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analyses identified AG cutpoints that maximized sensitivity and specificity for <b>sitting</b> and <b>sitting</b> plus standing time. Results The smallest mean bias between aP <b>sitting</b> time and AG sedentary time was AG 150 for class time (3. 8 minutes), AG 50 for break time (− 0. 8 minutes), and AG 100 for school hours (− 5. 2 minutes). For <b>sitting</b> plus standing time, the smallest bias was observed for AG 850. ROC analyses revealed an optimal cut-point of 96 counts·min− 1 (AUC = 0. 75) for <b>sitting</b> time, which had acceptable sensitivity (71. 7 %) and specificity (67. 8 %). No optimal cut-point was obtained for <b>sitting</b> plus standing (AUC = 0. 51).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Effective {{interventions}} to influence workplace <b>sitting</b> are needed, as office-based workers demonstrate {{high levels of}} continued <b>sitting,</b> and <b>sitting</b> too much is associated with adverse health effects. Therefore, we developed a theory-driven, Web-based, interactive, computer-tailored intervention aimed at reducing and interrupting <b>sitting</b> at work. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our {{study was to investigate}} the effects of this intervention on objectively measured <b>sitting</b> time, standing time, and breaks from <b>sitting,</b> as well as self-reported context-specific <b>sitting</b> among Flemish employees in a field-based approach. METHODS: Employees (n= 213) participated in a 3 -group randomized controlled trial that assessed outcomes at baseline, 1 -month follow-up, and 3 -month follow-up through self-reports. A subsample (n= 122) were willing to wear an activity monitor (activPAL) from Monday to Friday. The tailored group received an automated Web-based, computer-tailored intervention including personalized feedback and tips on how to reduce or interrupt workplace <b>sitting.</b> The generic group received an automated Web-based generic advice with tips. The control group was a wait-list control condition, initially receiving no intervention. Intervention effects were tested with repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: The tailored intervention was successful in decreasing self-reported total workday <b>sitting</b> (time × group: P<. 001), <b>sitting</b> at work (time × group: P<. 001), and leisure time <b>sitting</b> (time × group: P=. 03), and in increasing objectively measured breaks at work (time × group: P=. 07); {{this was not the case}} in the other conditions. The changes in self-reported total nonworkday <b>sitting,</b> <b>sitting</b> during transport, television viewing, and personal computer use, objectively measured total <b>sitting</b> time, and <b>sitting</b> and standing time at work did not differ between conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results point out the significance of computer tailoring for sedentary behavior and its potential use in public health promotion, as the effects of the tailored condition were superior to the generic and control conditions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{workplace}} is a main setting for prolonged <b>sitting</b> for some occupational groups. Convincing evidence has recently accumulated on the detrimental cardio-metabolic {{health effects of}} leisure-time <b>sitting.</b> Yet, much less is known about occupational <b>sitting,</b> and the potential health risk attached compared to leisure-time <b>sitting.</b> OBJECTIVE: To explore the separate and joint associations of occupational and leisure-time <b>sitting</b> with cardio-metabolic risk factors in working adults. METHODS: All working adults (N = 2544) from the Health 2006, a Danish population-based study, were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants reported hours of <b>sitting</b> during work, during leisure-time along with socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics, including physical activity. Cardio-metabolic risk factors (waist circumference, body mass index, body fat percentage, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, hemoglobin A 1 c and plasma glucose) were measured. Associations were explored by linear regression for leisure-time, occupational, and overall <b>sitting</b> time. RESULTS: Statistically significant (p<. 05) detrimental associations of leisure-time <b>sitting</b> were observed with all cardio-metabolic risk factors, except hemoglobin A 1 c and plasma glucose. Similarly, occupational <b>sitting</b> time was significantly detrimentally associated with HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin. For categories of <b>sitting</b> time, a joint adverse association of <b>sitting</b> much during both work-time and leisure-time was observed. CONCLUSION: The associations of occupational <b>sitting</b> time with cardio-metabolic risk factors were fewer and weaker compared to leisure-time <b>sitting.</b> Yet, the joint associations of occupational and leisure-time <b>sitting</b> with cardio-metabolic risk factors were higher than the separate.
