The main purpose of this detector is to provide a state-of-the-art solution for NPAs at ITER experimental reactor.

5000|$|The Sarett {{oxidation}} efficiently oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes {{without further}} oxidizing them to carboxylic acids.

The Sarett and Collins oxidations occur in the absence of water. [...] The Sarett oxidation also proceeds under basic conditions, which allows for the use of acid <b>sensitive</b> <b>substrates,</b> such as those containing certain protecting groups. This is dissimilar to other common acidic oxidation reactions such as the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which would remove or alter such groups.

50|$|Fischer {{esterification}} or Fischer-Speier esterification is {{a special}} type of esterification by refluxing a carboxylic acid and an alcohol {{in the presence of}} an acid catalyst. The reaction was first described by Emil Fischer and Arthur Speier in 1895. Most carboxylic acids are suitable for the reaction, but the alcohol should generally be a primary or secondary alkyl. Tertiary alcohols are prone to elimination. Contrary to common misconception found in organic chemistry textbooks, phenols can also be esterified to give good to near quantitative yield of products. Commonly used catalysts for a Fischer esterification include sulfuric acid, tosylic acid, and Lewis acids such as scandium(III) triflate. For more valuable or <b>sensitive</b> <b>substrates</b> (for example, biomaterials), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is often used. The reaction is often carried out without a solvent (particularly when a large reagent excess of alcohol is used) or in a non-polar solvent (e.g. toluene) to facilitate the Dean-Stark method. Typical reaction times vary from 1-10 hours at temperatures of 60-110 °C.|$|E
50|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} to {{terminate}} the oxidation reactions taking place due to different weathering conditions and reduce the degradation of organic materials. For example, synthetic polymers react with atmospheric oxygen. Organic materials undergo auto-oxidizations due to free radical chain reaction. Oxidatively <b>sensitive</b> <b>substrates</b> will react with atmospheric oxygen directly and produce free radicals. Free radicals are of different forms, consider organic material RH. This material reacts with oxygen to give free radicals such as R•, RO•, ROO•, HO•1. These free radicals further react with atmospheric oxygen to produce more and more free radicals. For example, R• + O2 → ROO• ROO• + RH → ROOH + R• 1This can be terminated by using antioxidants. Then this reaction comes to,2R• → R - RROO• + R• → ROOR2ROO• → Non-radical products1Weathering of polymers is caused by absorption of UV lights, which results in, radical initiated auto-oxidation. This produces cleavage of hydro peroxides and carbonyl compounds. This {{is because of the}} weak bond in hydro peroxides which is the main source for the free radicals to initiate from. Homolytic decomposition of hydro peroxide increases the rate of free radicals production1. Therefore, it is important factor in determining oxidative stability. The conversion of peroxy and alkyl radicals to non-radical species terminates the chain reaction, thereby decreasing the kinetic chain length.|$|E
5000|$|UV-curable inks: These inks consist {{mainly of}} acrylic {{monomers}} with an initiator package. After printing, the ink is cured {{by exposure to}} strong UV-light. Ink is exposed to UV radiation where a chemical reaction takes place where the photo-initiators cause the ink components to cross-link into a solid. Typically a shuttered mercury-vapor lamp or UV LED {{is used for the}} curing process. Curing processes with high power for short periods of times (microseconds) allow curing inks on thermally <b>sensitive</b> <b>substrates.</b> UV inks do not evaporate, but rather cure or set as a result from this chemical reaction. No material is evaporated or removed, which means about 100% of the delivered volume is used to provide coloration. This reaction happens very quickly, which leads to instant drying that results in a completely cured graphic in a matter of seconds. This also allows for a very fast print process. As a result of this instant chemical reaction no solvents penetrate the substrate once it comes off the printer, which allows for high quality prints. The advantage of UV-curable inks is that they [...] "dry" [...] as soon as they are cured, they can be applied {{to a wide range of}} uncoated substrates, and they produce a very robust image. Disadvantages are that they are expensive, require expensive curing modules in the printer, and the cured ink has a significant volume and so gives a slight relief on the surface. Though improvements are being made in the technology, UV-curable inks, because of their volume, are somewhat susceptible to cracking if applied to a flexible substrate. As such, they are often used in large [...] "flatbed" [...] printers, which print directly to rigid substrates such as plastic, wood or aluminium where flexibility is not a concern.|$|E

This has made FLT 3 an important marker for disease diagnosis and a highly attractive target for therapeutic drug development. This study is intended to generate a <b>sensitive</b> <b>substrate</b> for assays of the FLT 3 enzymatic activity. Methods We expressed in Escherichia coli cells a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein designated GST-FLT 3 S, which contains a peptide sequence derived from an autophosphorylation site of FLT 3. The protein was used to analyze tyrosine kinase activity of baculovirus-expressed FLT 3 and crude cell extracts of bone marrow cells from AML patients. It was also employed to perform FLT 3 kinase assays for FLT 3 inhibitor screening. Results GST-FLT 3 S in solution or on beads was strongly phosphorylated by recombinant proteins carrying the catalytic domain of wild type FLT 3 and FLT 3 D 835 mutants, with the latter exhibiting much higher activity and efficiency. GST-FLT 3 S was also able to detect elevated tyrosine kinase activity in bone marrow cell extracts from AML patients. A small-scale inhibitor screening led to identification of several potent inhibitors of wild type and mutant forms of FLT 3. Conclusions GST-FLT 3 S is a <b>sensitive</b> protein <b>substrate</b> for FLT 3 assays.
