40|$|The {{quantity}} <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> requiring disposal {{has been}} for several years increasing greatly in Europe because of the progressive implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 91 / 271 /EEC. Land application and incineration {{are the two most}} widely used options for sewage sludge disposal. The benefits and costs of each option raised –and continues to raise– much debate. Besides, the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> on agricultural soils is not recent. And yet, there is little econometric analysis of the determinants of industrial and urban <b>sludge</b> <b>spreading.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the paper is to provide policy makers with an overview of the determinants <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>spreading</b> by farmers. We investigate variables pertaining to the farmer, to the farm (economic size and location) and also to the market for farm outputs. We use an exhaustive data base, the agricultural census in France coupled with location data such as distance to the nearest sewage sludge treatment facility, population density around the farm and environmental zoning...|$|R

40|$|The {{biotransformation}} {{during the}} 3 years <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> landfilling was evaluated by physicochemical analysis and phytotoxicity test. The final product exhibited {{a high degree}} of decomposition rate (51. 06 %) than the controls as shown by a decrease of C/N ratio of about 19. 67. The results showed that the lipid, surfactant and polyphenol as main compound <b>of</b> the <b>sludge</b> were breakdown over time. The concentrations decreased from 29. 9 to 11. 8 mg·g- 1 and 3. 4 to 0. 6 mg·g- 1, respectively for surfactant and polyphenols after 3 years of landfilling. This corresponds to a reduction of 80. 2 % for polyphenols and 60. 4 % for surfactant, due to the microorganisms activity. Total lipids decrease from 16. 5 to 6. 27 mg·g- 1 of dry matter, representing an abatement rate of about 62 %. The evolution of organic matter reflects the progress of the humification process, which judging by the increase in the polymerization degree, is about 20 %. The landfilling efficiency to reduce phytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> was confirmed by the germination index, which reached 52 and 59 %, respectively for alfalfa and cress after 3 years of landfilling.

40|$|Peatlands {{and other}} {{terrestrial}} ecosystems export {{large amounts of}} dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to freshwater ecosystems. In catchments used for supplying drinking water, water treatment works (WTWs) can remove large quantities of this organic matter, and can therefore play a unique modifying role in DOC processing and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the fluvial system. During this study we quantified the GHG emissions due to processes associated with carbon (C) removal during water treatment at four contrasting WTWs in the UK. Our results demonstrate that the removal of DOC from raw water supplies via coagulation, leading to the formation <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> usually makes it less susceptible to short-term oxidation when compared to DOC remaining in the fluvial system. Although this {{could be considered a}} means of reducing CO 2 emissions from waterborne carbon, the current practise <b>of</b> land <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> is unlikely to represent a long-term C sink and therefore water treatment probably only delays the rate at which fluvial C re-enters the atmosphere. Furthermore, we estimate that indirect CO 2 missions resulting from electricity use during water treatment, together with the use of chemicals and CO 2 degassing from the water during treatment, far outweigh any potential CO 2 reductions associated with DOC removal. Thus, the post-treatment handling <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> has the potential to mitigate, but not to negate, GHG emissions associated with water treatment processes...|$|R
30|$|Cationic {{polyacrylamide}} copolymers (PAMs) are a {{group of}} water-soluble polymers {{with a wide range}} of applications in industry, food processing, agriculture and waste management.

40|$|Abstract. Wastewater sludges {{are used}} in {{agriculture}} as soil amendment and fertilizer, {{with regard to their}} organic matter and nutrient content. However, availability of nitrogen and phosphorus from sludge-amended soils and their transfer in runoff may lead to eutrophication of downstream surface water. The aim {{of this study is to}} establish and compare the effect <b>of</b> two different <b>sludges</b> on these transfers: an anaerobically digested and thermically stabilised sludge (Seine-Aval treatment plant, sludge no. 1), and a limed sludge (Saint-Quentin treatment plant, sludge no. 2). Experiments were performed on 12 sloping micro-plots (1 m × 1 m) submitted to sludge spreading and controlled rainfall simulation. Runoff water was sampled and analysed for concentrations in nitrogen species and phosphorus. Results show that <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> no. 1 increased both ammonium nitrogen (mean of 1. 1 mg L− 1 N–NH 4 vs. 0. 2 mg L− 1 N–NH 4 for control micro-plots) and particulate phosphorus concentrations (mean of 2 mg L− 1 P vs. 1. 1 mg L− 1 P for control micro-plots) in runoff water. On the other hand, sludge no. 2 did not induce any significant effect on nutrient concentrations in runoff. These results are related to chemical composition and physical treatment <b>of</b> <b>sludges.</b> This study underlines the existence of a short-term risk of nutrient mobilisation by runoff after sludge spreading on soil, and the need to check precisely the impact of this practice on water quality...|$|R

40|$|Background {{concentrations}} of pollutants in soil can play different roles in soil protection policies. They {{can be used}} for instance to detect a local pollution or to calculate the cleaning targets if a site has to be remediate. However, soils from urban and industrial areas generally present high concentration of pollutants, since they usually are disturbed by urbanization, mixed with technogenic material and affected by smoke and dust fallout. In these zones, background concentrations can be very high and fluctuating across short distances. It is therefore difficult to calculate them precisely, and use them properly for the roles they must fulfill. Dealing with this notion in soil protection policy can therefore be complicated. We present seven western European approaches for the consideration of background concentrations in soil protection policies: Flanders, Wallonia, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Germany, France, England and the Netherlands. The definition of the concept of background {{concentrations of}} pollutants in soils, the way to calculate them and their roles are presented between these different systems that have various pedogeological and industrial contexts. The advantages and disadvantages of these systems are presented and discussed especially with regards to soils from urban and industrial areas. It appears from this survey that neighboring states use background concentrations to diverse goals. Background concentrations are used to calculate cleaning targets in the case of soil remediation (France, Flanders, Wallonia and Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) and to detect local pollution (England, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg and Wallonia). In the Netherlands and Germany, background concentrations are used for other purposes regarding soil protection (reuse <b>of</b> soil, <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> from wastewater treatment plants, etc) ...|$|R
40|$|Important {{issues for}} the local {{authorities}} are {{what to do with}} the sludge produced insewagetreatment plants. The tax for landfill leads to higher costs with 250 SEK/ton. On the 31 December 2004 it will be forbidden to landfill sludge. In Sweden the yearly production <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> is 240 000 tons, counted as DS. The phosphorouscontent is 3 % in sludge. The total yearly production <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> gives 6000 tons of phosphorous. (Andersson et al, 1999). During the last years about one third of this phosphorous has been used as fertilisers at fields and one third as fertilisers on outer areas, the rest to landfill. Värmdö is producing 2700 tons sludge from sewage treatment plant countedas DS. (Lidbjörk, 1999). During the autumn in 1999 there has been a large number of alarming reports saying that the sludge in addition to heavy metals, toxic organic compounds, also contains brominatedcontaining flame retardants and dangerous infectious matter from hospital waste water. The alarming reports made the LRF in October 1999 to ban all <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> as fertilisers. Today it is not clear when and if this ban will be removed. In this Master of Science it is shown that landfilling <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> leads to serious environmental effects, for example global warming, eutrofication and acidification. This indicates that landfill <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> is not good in an environmental perspective. In this study in Värmdö sludge treatment has been studied with the simulation tool ORWARE(ORganic WAste REsearch). ORWARE is a system analysis model for waste planing with tools for lifecycle and substance flow analyses. The model is used for calculating emissionsand energy consumption for a waste system. It is thought as a tool for simulating different treatment methods for liquid and solid waste in a given area. The alternatives to landfill that have been studied in this thesis is incineration, composting with sewage treatment sludge and garbage from household in an reactor compost, as well as composting <b>of</b> sewage treatment <b>sludge</b> and biowaste in string compost. The study indicates that if it is possible to guarantee low concentrations of toxic substances in the sludge, the best alternative is to spread the sludge on fields. The uncertainty of the containing components in the sludge makes the incineration alternative a good alternative to guarantee destroy possible toxic components and bacteria that can exist in the sludge. The problem with incineration is that essential components like phosphor are destroyed and cannot be utilised. There are same methods today were you could utilise the phosphorous in incineration. These methods are very expensive and energy demanding and is therefore notused that much. With the discussion today about sustainable development incineration wherephosphorous is not utilised is only acceptable in the short term until the problems about the toxic components in the sludge have been solved. www. ima. kth. s...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{recycling}} and social dynamics {{in the transition}} from rural to the peri-urban in Reunion Island. In a context of rapid urbanization, the insularity of Reunion Island makes waste management complex and calls for finding recycling solutions. Official requests for authorizing the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> on sugarcane {{are a source of}} conflict. The concern of a stronger territorial integration of agricultural activities, as illustrated by the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> urban waste, now disturbs the relationship between sugarcane producers and the sugar industry. This issue clearly differentiates the local (farmers, actors of the municipalities) and regional (agricultural production sectors, agricultural profession, administrations) institutional positions. This process of territorial integration is not new because {{it is part of the}} much broader changes in the society, initiated with the departmentalization of the island in 1946. In agriculture, following the land reform of the 1960 s, these transformations first resulted in the emergence of a family farming directly bound to the agroindustrial sugar sector, at the expense of large landownership. Then, from the sugar sector logic to today’s territorial and environmental issues seized by farmers, this new agriculture of Reunion Island demonstrates the ability of the society to reformulate its concerns by gradually replacing obsolete frameworks...|$|R
40|$|This {{review is}} based on 59 papers {{published}} between 2002 and 2015, referring to about 450 treatment trains providing data regarding sludge concentrations for 169 compounds, specifically 152 pharmaceuticals and 17 personal care products, grouped into 28 different classes. The rationale {{of the study is}} to provide data to evaluate the environmental risk posed by the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> treated <b>sludge</b> in agriculture. Following discussion of the legislative scenario governing the final disposal <b>of</b> treated <b>sludge</b> in European countries and the USA, the study provides a snapshot of the occurrence of selected compounds in primary, secondary, mixed, digested, conditioned, composted and dried sludge originating in municipal wastewater treatment plants fed mainly with urban wastewater as well as in sludge-amended soil. Not only are measured values reported, but also predicted concentrations based on Kd values are reported. It emerges that in secondary sludge, the highest concentrations were found for fragrances, antiseptics and antibiotics and an attenuation in their concentrations occurs during treatment, in particular anaerobic digestion and composting. An in-depth literature survey of the (measured and predicted) Kd values for the different compounds and treated sludge are reported and an analysis of the influence of pH, redox conditions, sludge type was carried out. The data regarding measured and predicted concentrations of selected compounds in sludge-amended soil is then analyzed. Finally an environmental risk assessment posed by their occurrence in soil in the case of land application <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> is examined, and the results obtained by different authors are compared. The most critical compounds found in the sludge-amended soil are estradiol, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, caffeine, triclosan and triclocarban. The study concludes with a focus on the main issues that should be further investigated in order to refine the environmental risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|Diversification of {{phosphorus}} sources {{can bring}} substantial synergy effects within all the sustainable development domains: environmental, economic and social, and such an opportunity {{should not be}} overlooked. Urban sinks accumulate phosphorus and other elements and may serve as sources of secondary raw materials. This paper evaluates phosphorus sources based on their total material requirement (TMR).

In a life cycle assessment (LCA) the conventional production {{was used as a}} yardstick against which tomeasure the performance of two recycling options: <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> and phosphorus recovery from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWA). When compared as three gate-to-gate processes, the sludge spreading had the lowest potential environmental impact, except in the impact categories eco- and human toxicity. In the future, the sludge spreading could potentially outperform the conventional process also with regard to toxicity, provided its Hg and Cu content can be reduced. Phosphorus extracted from the MSWA had the highest impact, except in relation to eutrophication. The benefits of avoiding the conventional production were greater than the sludge recycling impacts for all categories except toxicity. When conventional production is substituted by the MSWA recycling, the eutrophication and land-use impacts are avoided, while the impacts in other categories are considerable. The development needs identified for this method include substitution of HCl, reduced water consumption, and reduction of the product’smetal content.

The export <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> to neighbour countries {{was found to be}} an unsuitable solution at the given knowledge in this field. Sewage sludge from the municipal waste-water treatment plant in Murska Sobota is not waste but has energetic potential, among others. Analyses were performed, following procedures which are regulated by the current legislation. These analyses from the municipal waste-water treatment plant in Murska Sobota indicate that the sludge is harmless waste and is suitable for composting. The thesis discusses alternative sludge treatment options, sludge treatment in foreign countries, what can be expected in the future and the current legislative framework in this field. Based on the data collected, the most suitable use for sewage sludge from the municipal waste-water treatment plant in M. Sobota is for fertilization of suitable agricultural areas in the municipality of M. Sobota. The nutritional substances in sludge are more suitable and friendly to environment and plants, compared to mineralised fertilizers. Using sludge this way, means recycling of important nourishments for plants, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, the latter being the most valued element <b>of</b> <b>sludge.</b> It is known that in approximately 50 years from now all known supplies of apatite (source of phosphorus) will be exhausted and therefore it is urgent to set up a system of substance circulation wherever possible.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2006. A {{comprehensive}} {{literature survey}} looking at {{different aspects of}} organic contaminants in sewage sludge is incorporated in the thesis. It {{is clear from the}} data available that plants do not take up most of the organic pollutants. However, a risk of contamination of the food chain exists when sludge is spread directly onto crops that are to be consumed raw or semi-cooked. The major source of human exposure to sludge-borne organic pollutants is through the consumption of animal products such as meat and milk through the bioaccumulation of compounds such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This is due to the ingestion <b>of</b> soil and <b>sludge</b> by livestock due to the <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> on the land used for grazing. Currently {{little is known about the}} plant uptake of phthalates and nonylphenols, which are present in relatively high levels in sludge. Included in the literature survey is a list of the most common methods normally used for extraction of organic compounds and the possible methods of analysis. What is noted is that there is no universally accepted and validated analytical method for analysing most of the organic compounds. In addition, data concerning levels of organic pollutants is scarce worldwide. The methods selected for this project were EPA Methods 35 IOC (Liquid-liquid extraction) and 3540 C (Soxhlet extraction) for the aqueous and solid sewage sludge respectively. These two methods were chosen because they are simple, inexpensive and effective. The chosen purification method was the sulfur clean-up process (EPA Method 3660 B). This is because sulfur precipitates were observed in most of the concentrated extracts, especially from the solid samples. A total of 109 samples from 78 sewage works were extracted, using Soxhlet extraction for solids and liquid-liquid extraction for liquid samples. All the extracts were analysed using GC-MS. The identification of the organic compounds was made possible by the use of GC-MS Wiley library. A total of 712 organic compounds were identified in the South African sewage sludge. These included Phenols, Pesticides, PAHs, Phthalates, PCBs, Furans, Amines, Aldehydes, Esters, Acids, Chlorinated Hydrocarbons, Alcohols, Hydrocarbons and Others (all sorts of organic compounds that did not belong to the named categories). The extraction efficiency and reproducibility using a "clean" sludge matrix was carried out. The results showed that the method chosen for extraction i. e. Soxhlet method had an efficiency of over 80 % and the results were reproducible. A total of 14 samples were selected for the quantification of p-cresol, nonylphenol and pesticides listed in the current legislation. The results showed negative results for pesticides, confirming that the pesticides listed in the legislation are not the compounds that need to be regulated as far as organic pollutants are concerned. The reasons for this are most likely due to the fact that most of the pesticides listed are banned or their use is severely restricted. The results for the quantification of p-cresol and nonylphenol, when comparing the liquid and the solid extracts <b>of</b> the liquid <b>sludge,</b> show that 99 % of p-cresol is concentrated in the liquid phase. The opposite is true when looking at nonylphenol where 90 % of it is trapped in the solid matrix leaving 10 % in the liquid phase.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> (SS) among forest {{plantations}} may provide interesting results for firewood production. While sludges are good fertilizers, they may nevertheless contain trace metals, which can reduce productivity {{and lead to}} environmental risks. We investigated the effects of SS application on nutrient uptake and growth parameters in larch seedlings (Larix decidua) and determined trace metal and mineral distribution. Without incorporation into the soil, sludge {{was applied to the}} soil surface at three rates (0, 30 and 60 t dry weight DW ha− 1). The plants were harvested after 12 months. The results showed significantly increased nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the top soil layer in pots amended with sludge, whereas no changes appeared in the lower layers. Similar results were obtained for the Cu, Zn and Cd concentrations. However, no differences were observed for the other measured soil mineral elements. Nitrogen concentrations in needles increased with rising sewage sludge application rates, yet the sludge had no effect on the P, Mg, Zn, Pb and Cd concentrations. In addition, Cu accumulated only in the lateral roots of seedlings that received the highest sludge loading rate. Sludge application improved the net photosynthesis, which resulted in higher chlorophyll contents in the needles. Following application, the dry matter accumulation rate increased due to the excessive availability of N, whereas available mineral elements in the plant tissues were diluted. Furthermore, amending the soil with sewage sludge can promote a higher biomass yield which may result in an increased trace metal bioaccumulation capacity in plants. Though this investigation has established the benefits of municipal SS application, further studies are needed to assess the potential transfer of TM to groundwater and through the food chain...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn France, {{more than}} 70 % <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> is {{directly}} land spreading or composted before land spreading. Sludge application is responsible {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHG) emissions. In 2010 and 2011, Irstea produces a tool called GESTABoues to quantify GHG emissions emitted during sludge treatment and disposal routes. This paper aims to present how this tool {{can be used to}} quantify GHG emissions <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> land <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> a 380 000 per captia equivalent wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and to point out methodological aspects that could invert results of GHG emissions. Conclusions in GHG emissions results could vary depending on the system boundaries used, especially regarding additional fertilisation with mineral fertilisers and could be responsible for possible misunderstanding in conclusions of environmental assessment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{implementation}} of microaerobic conditions often improves {{the results of}} anaerobic digestion. The study was focussed on comparison <b>of</b> digested <b>sludge</b> qual-ity after shift from strictly anaerobic to microaerobic sludge digestion. The compared parameters were: chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> specific activity <b>of</b> methanogenic bac-teria, foaming potential and dewaterability <b>of</b> <b>sludge.</b> in most parameters the quality <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> digested at microaerobic and anaerobic conditions is comparable often the qual-ity <b>of</b> microaerobic <b>sludge</b> is better. From the operational point of view {{it is very important}} that foaming of microaerobic digester was lower and the dewaterability was better for microaerobic sludge...|$|R

40|$|The <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> urban sewage <b>sludge</b> is a {{constant}} cause of controversy, in particular as this practice is known to supply amounts of potentially toxic trace metals to the soil, particularly cadmium. In order to clarify some parts of this debate, this article presents a synthesis {{of the results of}} many studies carried out in France on the impact <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> spreading: old experiments as well as more recent trials. This paper deals mainly with cadmium but sometimes some interesting results relating to other trace metals are reported. Presented data are relative to: (i) the soil quality such as total trace metal contents and results of partial extraction aimed at determining the most phytoavailable fractions; (ii) the composition of cereal grain, chiefly wheat. Depending upon the period, the experiments were completely different as far as the tonnages <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> applied and the quantities of cadmium involved. Three categories of trials stand out: (1) During the 1970 s and 80 s, sludges with a high trace metal content, especially cadmium, were spread at one experimental farm on sandy soils and in the Vexin area on silty topsoils. In all cases, a notable long-lasting impact was found on the total Cd content of the topsoil and the composition of cereal grains. The quantities of applied Cd were very high, from 3, 600 g ha - 1 to 641, 000 g ha - 1. (2) Sludges containing high amounts of industrial Ca were spread on acid soils in the Limoges region for more than 20 years. Increases of the cadmium content in the topsoil were only measured in fields where the cadmium input was the highest, of 300 to 600 g per ha. A clear increase in the Cd content of cereal grains has been noted as well. (3) During the 1990 s and 2000 s, numerous experiments with sewage sludge applications compatible with the French regulations were implemented. Local authorities launched many, relatively light, experiments in diverse areas and on diverse soil types. Research institutions carried out other, more exacting, trials. The quantities of Cd input varied from 0. 6 to 270 g ha - 1. In these cases, no impact was measurable on the composition of cereal grains...|$|R
40|$|Operators and {{engineers}} in the chemical process industries {{who are responsible}} for the daily operations associated with sludge dewatering and drying equipment are undoubtedly aware that wastewater-sludge drying is not an easy task. A large number of the problems that arise during these operations are due to the sticky phase <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> which makes the drying <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> as much an art as a science. Although insight into the sticky behavior <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> during drying processes is critical for successfully drying sludge in practice, the sticky phase <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> is not a common topic in the standard engineering curriculum at universities and colleges. Providing more insights into the peculiar sticky phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> is the aim of this article. Further, an overview of applied strategies to tackle the operational issues related to the sludge's "glueyness" will be provided. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Predicting {{the flow}} behaviour, most notably, the {{apparent}} viscosity and yield stress <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> mixtures inside the anaerobic digester is essential {{because it helps}} optimize the mixing system in digesters. This paper investigates the rheology <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> mixtures as a function <b>of</b> digested <b>sludge</b> volume fraction. Sludge mixtures exhibited non-Newtonian, shear thinning, yield stress behaviour. The apparent viscosity and yield stress <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> mixtures prepared at the same total solids concentration {{was influenced by the}} interactions within the digested sludge and increased with the volume fraction <b>of</b> digested <b>sludge</b> - highlighted using shear compliance and shear modulus <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> mixtures. However, when a thickened primary - secondary sludge mixture was mixed with dilute digested sludge, the apparent viscosity and yield stress decreased with increasing the volume fraction <b>of</b> digested <b>sludge.</b> This was caused by the dilution effect leading to a reduction in the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic interactions when dilute digested sludge was added. Correlations were developed to predict the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the mixtures as a function <b>of</b> the digested <b>sludge</b> volume fraction and total solids concentration of the mixtures. The parameters of correlations can be estimated using pH <b>of</b> <b>sludge.</b> The shear and complex modulus were also modelled and they followed an exponential relationship with increasing digested sludge volume fraction...|$|R
