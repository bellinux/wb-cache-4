2500|$|Jeeps {{were used}} by every service of the U.S. military. An average of 145 were {{supplied}} to every Army infantry regiment. Jeeps were used for many purposes, including cable laying, saw milling, as firefighting pumpers, field ambulances, tractors and, with suitable wheels, would even run on railway tracks. An amphibious jeep, the model GPA, or [...] "seep" [...] (<b>Sea</b> <b>Jeep)</b> was built for Ford in modest numbers but {{it could not be}} considered a huge success—it was neither a good off-road vehicle nor a good boat. As part of the war effort, nearly 30% of all Jeep production was supplied to Great Britain and to the Soviet Red Army.|$|E
50|$|Amphibious {{automobiles}} {{have been}} conceived from ca. 1900, however the Second World War significantly stimulated their development. Two {{of the most}} significant amphibious cars to date were developed during World War II. The most proliferous was the German Schwimmwagen, a small jeep-like 4x4 vehicle designed by the Porsche engineering firm in 1942 and widely used in World War II. The amphibious bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, the firm's body construction designer, using the engine and drive train of the Kübelwagen. An amphibious version of the Willys MB jeep, the Ford GPA or 'Seep' (short for <b>Sea</b> <b>jeep)</b> was developed during World War II as well. A specially modified GPA, called Half-Safe, was driven and sailed around the world by Australian Ben Carlin in the 1950s.|$|E
