To assure a stable supply of qualified foreign seafarers, this study aims to research and select a foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> for Korean Flag vessels. Factors influencing the selection were identified, and these factors were assessed by Delphi, fuzzy, and fuzzy TOPSIS methods in order to make a selection from several countries. Via empirical analysis by the fuzzy method, the results show that the factor of “total crew costs” is the most significant, followed by “quality of seafarers’ education and training” and “supply ability for well-trained seafarers. ” “government support from supply countries” is the least weighted factor for decision makers. The alternative countries assessment by fuzzy TOPSIS method suggests that the Philippines should be chosen as the dedicated foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> for Korean Flag vessels, given the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of these alternative foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>countries.</b> Finally, some implications for continuous improvement of the seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>countries</b> are provided...|$|R

40|$|Suicide is {{a crisis}} of unknown {{proportions}} {{in much of the}} developing world. The majority of research into suicide has been done in high-resource <b>countries</b> such as <b>Australia,</b> and most intervention protocols have been drawn up using Western models.

This review compares suicide in a high-resource <b>country,</b> <b>Australia,</b> and low-resource <b>country,</b> Nepal. Many low-resource countries such as Nepal struggle to address barriers to mental health care due to limited mental health resources and issues such as stigma, workforce and mental health literacy.

In many cases, developing economies may have little choice but to sell through these intermediaries, and recent work has suggested the export taxes may be an optimal policy to recapture some of the monopsony rent. However, in many commodity markets there are a limited number of large <b>supplying</b> <b>countries.</b> Even if the markets are competitive, this supply-side concentration suggests that economies have market power themselves, and that the governments of the countries may be engaged in a strategic game when selecting trade policies.
