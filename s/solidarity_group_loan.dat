40|$|Confianza {{is a small}} {{regulated}} microfinance {{institution in}} central Peru that today provides agricultural loans alongside a range of rural, urban, small business, housing, and consumer loans to low-income clients. From its beginnings as an Inter-American Development Bank-funded NGO program in 1993 until becoming a regulated microfinance provider in 1999, Confianza’s loan portfolio was almost exclusively devoted to <b>solidarity</b> <b>group</b> <b>loans</b> for agricultural purposes. When a combination of factors, including plunging commodity prices, led to an arrears rate of over 50 percent in 1999, Confianza was forced to make a set of swift, substantial changes in order to survive: The MFI altered its lending methodology, instituted stricter lending requirements and monitoring, and added urban and individual loans to diversify its portfolio. Its non-agricultural port-folio flourished, and Confianza also maintained a focus on agricultural lending (about {{a quarter of its}} total portfolio), with lending to agriculture almost quadrupling in volume over the next few years. By year-end 2002, Confianza had become financially sustainable, lending more than $ 4 million annually, with a respectable arrears rate (portfolio at risk> 30 days) of less than 4 percent and a 19 percent adjusted return on equity. Notably, its agricultural arrears rate has remained consistently lower than that of the portfolio as a whole...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} form {{of poverty}} alleviation {{is known as}} credit-led microfinance. This approach involves a group of 15-30 entrepreneurs who together receive loans from HOPE International or its local partner. Each client cross-guarantees the <b>loans</b> of other <b>groups</b> members {{since there is no}} form of collateral to offer for the loan. As they access much-needed capital, clients can launch or expand businesses by purchasing productive assets, buying supplies in bulk, improving inventory, or investing in improvements. Accountability to the group provides powerful incentive to make regular loan repayments and to contribute additional savings to the group. In some cases, clients graduate out of a community banking setup and move on to a <b>solidarity</b> <b>group,</b> where <b>loan</b> amounts are higher.|$|R
50|$|AMK {{utilizes}} a <b>solidarity</b> <b>group</b> lending methodology {{to administer}} its <b>group</b> <b>loans.</b> This process begins with potential clients self-selecting themselves into <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> {{of four to}} six members. These <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> are then organized into Village Banks that consist of four to twelve groups (or twenty to sixty clients). Being part of a self-selected <b>solidarity</b> <b>group</b> signifies that three to five other villagers trust the loan applicant to let him/her join their <b>group.</b> All <b>loans</b> are guaranteed by the respective <b>group</b> members. <b>Loans</b> are appraised and approved by an AMK Client Officer and the Village Bank President prior to disbursement. Each group nominates a group leader {{who is in charge}} of ensuring member attendance at meetings, troubleshooting, and liaising with the VBP, CO, and other members. AMK also offers several individual loan options to its clients. Generally, these require physical collateral and at least one personal guarantor.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} credited the <b>solidarity</b> <b>group</b> {{system with}} rehabilitating {{the agricultural sector}} and increasing food production. The system's contribution to socialism, however, was less visible and significant. According to Chhea Song, deputy minister of agriculture, a mere 10 percent of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> really worked collectively in the mid-1980s (seven years after <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> had come into operation). Seventy percent of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> performed only some tasks in common, such as preparing the fields and planting seeds. Finally, 20 percent of the agricultural workers farmed their land as individuals and participated {{in the category of}} the family economy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> {{evolved into}} three categories, each {{distinct}} in its level of collectivization {{and in its}} provisions for land tenure. The first category represented {{the highest level of}} collective labor. Member families of each <b>solidarity</b> <b>group</b> in this category undertook all tasks from plowing to harvesting. Privately owned farm implements and draft animals continued to be individual personal property, and the owners received remuneration for making them available to the <b>solidarity</b> <b>group</b> during the planting and the harvesting seasons. Each group also had collectively owned farm implements, acquired through state subsidy.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> are {{distinctly}} different from earlier approaches in several important ways.|$|R

5000|$|In 1986, {{more than}} 97 {{percent of the}} rural {{population}} belonged to the country's more than 100,000 <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups.</b> Unlike the large communes of the Khmer Rouge, the <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> were relatively small. They consisted initially of between twenty and fifty families and were later reduced to between seven and fifteen families.

50|$|The Grameen {{approach}} uses <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> as {{its primary}} building block. However, responsibility for delinquent loans is {{handled by the}} elected leaders of a larger, village-level group called a ‘centre’ composed of eight <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups.</b> Because all the members are from the same village and loan payments take place during the centre meeting, the principle of using social capital for leverage is not compromised; {{the only difference is}} that all the members of the centre are collectively responsible for unpaid loans.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{microcredit}} institutions use <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> essentially {{as a form}} {{of joint}} liability. That is, they will take any action practical to collect a seriously delinquent loan not just from the individual member, but from any member of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>group</b> with the capability to repay it. But Yunus has always rejected this concept, arguing that whatever moral responsibility may pertain among group members, there is no formal or legal “… form of joint liability, i.e. group members are not responsible to pay on behalf of a defaulting member.” ...|$|R

50|$|Collectivization of the {{agricultural}} sector under the Heng Samrin regime included the formation of <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups.</b> As small aggregates {{of people living in}} the same locality, known to one another, and able to a certain extent to profit collectively from their work, they were an improvement over the dehumanized, forced-labor camps and communal life of the Pol Pot era. The organization of individuals and families into <b>solidarity</b> <b>groups</b> also made sense in the environment of resource-poor, post-war Cambodia. People working together in this way were able to offset somewhat the shortages of manpower, draft animals, and farm implements.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{microfinance}} {{institutions have}} expanded into group lending with individual liability, leaving out the joint liability clause {{which was an}} important feature in earlier lending contracts. Recent experimental evidence indicates that group lending may yield benefits, specifically lowering default rates, {{even in the absence}} of joint liability. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model where the public nature of group meetings means that borrowers have incentives to repay a <b>group</b> <b>loan</b> to safeguard their reputation. We show that the introduction of <b>group</b> <b>loans</b> with individual liability will cause sorting between joint liability and individual liability <b>group</b> <b>loans.</b> Specifically, borrowers who attach more importance to their reputation will select into individual liability loans, causing default rates and interest rates to rise for joint liability loans. The introduction of <b>group</b> <b>loans</b> with individual liability can even make joint liability loans infeasible in equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|As labour {{migration}} to South Africa is a pronounced feature of Swazi society, {{its impact on}} Swazi society is substantial. This paper examines what {{labour migration}} means to the social security role of the Swazi rural homestead. By discussing the relationship between labour migration and the conditions which {{determine whether or not}} a social group can act as a <b>solidarity</b> <b>group</b> (viz. the size of a social group, its composition, its durability, its capacity to raise means, and the existence of a 'normative insurance'), the author estimates the impact of labour migration on the rural homestead in its capacity as a <b>solidarity</b> <b>group.</b> For this purpose he compares a group of homesteads with migrants in South Africa and a group of homesteads without. Data are derived from a 1990 survey among 115 rural homesteads situated on Swazi Nation Land. The author shows that the impact of labour migration differs according to the type of homestead. As a <b>solidarity</b> <b>group,</b> homesteads in the establishment and expansion stage are far more affected by labour migration than homesteads in other stages of the developmental cycle (viz. consolidation, fission, decline).
