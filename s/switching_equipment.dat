25|$|Part of the {{previous}} permissive dialing plan included a mass calling prefix for radio station contests, introduced in the 1960s because some contests put unacceptable loads on the Bay Area's telephone switches. Until the 1980s, radio station call-in contests throughout the Bay Area used 575-numbers. Electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> of the day had been engineered to accommodate large call volumes to 575-numbers. Large numbers of calls would otherwise have overloaded <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> causing slow dial tone and blocked long distance circuits.|$|E

25|$|A {{patchwork}} quilt of electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> handled San Jose calls between 1949 and the 1980s. There {{were about}} eight Western Electric Crossbar switches, {{at least one}} Number 1 and mostly Number 5. There was a Western Electric 4A Crossbar that took up two floors of the Main telephone exchange. In the mid-1980s, the 4A crossbar was replaced with a digital switch which took up part of a single floor and quadrupled calling capacity.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} Space Needle had no {{land where}} they could build. Since it was not financed by the city, land had to be purchased that was within the fairgrounds. The investors thought {{that there would be}} no land available to build a tower and the search for a site was nearly dead when, in 1961, they discovered a plot, , containing <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> for the fire and police alarm systems. The land sold for $75,000. At this point, only one year remained before the World's Fair would begin. It was privately built and financed by the Pentagram Corporation, which consisted of Bagley Wright, contractor Howard S. Wright, architect John Graham, Ned Skinner, and Norton Clapp. In 1977 Bagley, Skinner and Clapp sold their interest to Howard Wright who now controls it under the name of Space Needle Corporation.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Jamaica Plain had a {{significant}} immigrant population, which helped shape {{the future of the}} community. Many Irish had settled in large numbers in the Heath Street, South Street, Forest Hills and Stony Brook area (Brookside), taking laboring and domestic jobs, and becoming one-quarter of the population. Germans had reached 14%, living in Hyde Square, Egleston Square and Brookside, employed as skilled workers and managers, with their own social clubs and churches. Canadians, many from the Maritime Provinces, made up 12% of the population, often working in white collar or skilled jobs. Italians would come as well, in the years after 1910. New technologies allowed local businesses to provide jobs into the new century. In the 1910s, Randall-Faichney Company manufactured automobile parts, and the Holtzer-Cabot Company moved from making electric motors and telephone <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> to add electric automobiles.|$|E
500|$|The {{transformers}} and <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> {{were removed}} from the generator building in 1930, when a separate switchyard/substation went into service {{to the west of the}} spillway. Shortly thereafter, in 1931, Croton and Rogers dams were joined by the Hardy Dam, situated between them. The Hardy was the last major hydroelectric project constructed in Michigan by Consumers Energy. Once completed, the -high dam would later impound 7.2 billion U.S.gallons (6billionimp.gal/27billionL) of water in its [...] reservoir and is capable of producing 8850 kilowatts at peak outflow.|$|E

In this vision, Farrells propose to demolish all but the central boiler hall and chimneys and display the <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> from the control rooms in 'pods'.

500|$|Torn {{was to use}} a {{modified}} version of the SPECIAL system; combat occurred in quasi-real-time, rather than strictly being turn-based. To achieve this, Black Isle Studios created the [...] "recovery system", in which action points were used to determine the amount a combatant could accomplish in a given amount of time. Action points were spent with each action, and based on what percentage of an acting character's total action points were used, that character would need to wait a varying amount of time before taking action again. For example, if two characters expend half of their action points, they will attack each other at the same speed, regardless of the point totals for each character. Exceptions to this were to include recovery being hindered by movement, using items, or <b>switching</b> <b>equipment,</b> which was always allowed, though it reset the recovery time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{decrease}} the cost {{brought by the}} electric energy waste, a three-phase equilibrium distribution soft-switching system is proposed. The system guarantees three-phase equilibrium. Firstly, the inverter tracks the original access phase to be synchronous, then <b>switch</b> the electric <b>equipment</b> to the inverter. Secondly, the inverter tracks the alternative access phase to be synchronous, then <b>switch</b> the electric <b>equipment</b> to the alternative access phase to accomplish the soft-switching. Experiment is used to carry out verification for this system. The result shows {{that there is no}} impulse current when the electric <b>equipment</b> <b>switches.</b> The system achieves “soft-switching”...|$|R

2500|$|Because of {{the design}} of U.S. central office (phone) switches, it was not {{practical}} to use the British emergency number 999 (as was briefly considered). What was {{up to that time}} unassigned area code 911 was chosen instead. The [...] "1" [...] as the second digit was key; it told the <b>switching</b> <b>equipment</b> {{that this was not a}} routine call. The first 911 emergency phone system went into use in Haleyville, Alabama in 1968. On February 16, 1968, the first-ever 9-1-1 call was placed by Alabama Speaker of the House Rankin Fite, from Haleyville City Hall, to U.S. Rep. Tom Bevill, at the city's police station. [...] However, 911 systems were not in widespread use until the 1980s when the number 911 was adopted as the standard number across most of the country under the North American Numbering Plan.|$|E

Users noticed crosstalk, and dial pulsing was audible during at least some of their calls.
