2500|$|Binding {{angle is}} defined by the degrees off of {{perpendicular}} from the length of the snowboard. A binding angle of 0Â° is when the foot is perpendicular to the length of the snowboard. Positive angles are pointed towards the front of the board, whereas negative angles are pointed towards the back of the board. The question of how much the bindings are angled depends on the rider's purpose and preference. Different binding angles can be used for different types of snowboarding. Someone who participates in freestyle competition would have a much different [...] "stance" [...] than someone who explores backcountry and powder. The recent advancement and boom of snowboard culture and technology has made binding angle adjustments relatively easy. Binding companies design their bindings with similar baseplates that can easily mount onto any type of snowboard regardless of the brand. With the exception of Burton, and their newly released [...] "channel system", adjusting bindings is something that remains constant among all snowboarders. Done with a small <b>screw-driver</b> or a snowboard tool, the base plates on bindings can be easily rotated to whatever preferred stance. One must un-screw the baseplate, pick their degree angles, and then re-screw the baseplates. Bindings should also regularly be checked to ensure that the screws don't come undone from the movements of snowboarding.|$|E

6000|$|When {{the button}} was finished, Stuyvesant looked in Phonny's nail-box {{to find a}} large screw, {{and when he had}} found one, he took the <b>screw-driver</b> and went out to the {{hen-house}} and screwed the button on. When the screw was driven home to its place, Stuyvesant shut the door and buttoned it. Then standing before it with his <b>screw-driver</b> in his hand, he surveyed his work with another look of satisfaction, and said, ...|$|E
5000|$|The Swiss Army Knife was not {{the first}} multi use pocket knife. In 1851 in [...] "Moby Dick" [...] (chapter 107), Melville {{references}} the [...] "Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior - though a little swelled - of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also <b>screw-drivers,</b> cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers." ...|$|R
50|$|One common {{improvement}} {{places the}} female parts {{in a small}} bucket to reduce entry of water. Another {{is to make it}} easier to open and close: For example, many modern Dzus fasteners use self-centering <b>screw-drivers.</b> Other improvements reduce the cost. For example, changing the spring so it can be secured to the female hole avoids the cost of rivets. Some manufacturers die-cast the button rather than machining it.|$|R
40|$|Penetrating head {{injuries}} {{can be the}} result of numerous intentional or unintentional events, including missile wounds, stab wounds, and motor vehicle or occupational accidents (nails, <b>screw-drivers).</b> Penetrating {{head injuries}} in children constitute {{only a small part of}} the total number of traumatic head injuries seen in casualty. We report a case of neuro-trauma who was operated in our institution. Patient, 4 years male presented in casualty on 15 / 01 / 09 with a iron rod penetrating into the skull...|$|R
60|$|After {{dinner the}} girls {{went to their}} room, Greta bearing with her the big <b>screw-driver</b> of Fritz. At dusk they slipped downstairs and out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was thinking," [...] said Greta humbly, [...] "if {{they have}} screwed it up, perhaps we shall screw it down again; {{there is the}} big <b>screw-driver</b> of Fritz." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Found a <b>screw-driver</b> {{and some}} screws on the wash-hand stand. Seems to have smoked heavily during the night, too. Here are four cigar-ends that I picked {{out of the}} fireplace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was frank talk, {{which is}} our Hawaiian way, as you have long since learned. In return, equally frank, she regretted she hadn't given me away as a feeding child when I was born. Next she bewailed that she had ever borne me. From {{that it was only}} a step to anaana me. She {{threatened}} me with it, and I did the bravest thing I have ever done. Old Howard had given me a knife of many blades, and corkscrews, and <b>screw-drivers,</b> and all sorts of contrivances, including a tiny pair of scissors. I proceeded to pare my finger-nails.|$|R
60|$|At last {{it is all}} gone. Nothing is left {{about the}} house but {{scattered}} leaves of catalogues, littered scraps of straw and hay, and a battery of pewter pots behind the hall-door. The men with the carpet-caps gather up their <b>screw-drivers</b> and bed-winches into bags, shoulder them, and walk off. One of the pen-and-ink gentlemen goes over the house as a last attention; sticking up bills in the windows respecting the lease of this desirable family mansion, and shutting the shutters. At length he follows the men with the carpet caps. None of the invaders remain. The house is a ruin, and the rats fly from it.|$|R
60|$|Then the mouldy gigs and chaise-carts reappear; {{and with}} them come spring-vans and waggons, and an army of porters with knots. All day long, the men with carpet caps are {{screwing}} at <b>screw-drivers</b> and bed-winches, or staggering by the dozen together on the staircase under heavy burdens, or upheaving perfect rocks of Spanish mahogany, best rose-wood, or plate-glass, into the gigs and chaise-carts, vans and waggons. All sorts of vehicles of burden are in attendance, from a tilted waggon to a wheelbarrow. Poor Paul's little bedstead is carried off in a donkey-tandem. For nearly a whole week, the Capital Modern Household Furniture, & c., is in course of removal.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{shall see}} about that after we've broken it open,' I {{answered}} grimly. 'Here, this <b>screw-driver</b> will do. The back's not strong. Now, your help, Mr. Hayes--one, two, three; we can prise it apart between us.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was formidably high, and garnished horribly {{with broken}} bottles; {{but it was}} also old, and when I came to pick at the mortar with my <b>screw-driver,</b> I found it {{reasonably}} rotten with age and damp.|$|E
60|$|That {{night was}} fine, {{but the next}} was thick and misty. At nine o'clock all were in bed, and he lay {{listening}} to the clocks in the distance. Ten struck, and eleven, and when {{he thought it was}} approaching twelve he got up and crept to the window. He was joined immediately by the others; the <b>screw-driver</b> was set to work; and, as he expected, Vincent found no trouble whatever with the screws, which were not yet rusted in the wood, and turned immediately when the powerful <b>screw-driver</b> was applied to them. When all were out the bar was carefully lifted from its place and laid upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|The box {{had been}} placed in the {{storeroom}} on the upper floor of the tower, and the boys took up <b>screw-drivers</b> and hammers to open it. The latter tools were not necessary, as the case was very carefully screwed up; and when the top was taken off, it was found that there was an inside case of tin, soldered up. As the boys were cutting through this, they expressed their opinion that, from the extreme care taken, the contents must be very valuable. Still Mr. Hardy would give no clue; and when the case was finally opened, the astonishment of all was unbounded to find that it contained four dozen large rockets and a dozen blue-lights. One dozen of these rockets were ordinary signal rockets, but the rest were covered with strong tin cases.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{twenty yards}} of strong string, {{and the same}} length of rope that will bear my weight; also a strong <b>screw-driver.</b> When I have got this I will let you know night and hour. Shall want {{disguise}} ready to put on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick!" [...] whispered Christian; and Greta, {{with all}} the {{strength}} of her small hands, began to turn the screws. It was some time before they yielded; the third was very obstinate, till Christian took the <b>screw-driver</b> and passionately gave the screw a starting twist.|$|E
60|$|And {{my desire}} was granted, for I saw near {{a corner of}} Broadway and Twenty-ninth Street, a little flaxen-haired man with a face like a scaly-bark hickory-nut, selling to a fast-gathering crowd a tool that omnigeneously proclaimed itself a can-opener, a <b>screw-driver,</b> a button-hook, a nail-file, a shoe-horn, a watch-guard, a potato-peeler, and an {{ornament}} to any gentleman's key-ring.|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} true, the door stood open. Madame {{put down the}} <b>screw-driver</b> and drew herself erect. Her eyes were a flame of excitement. This {{question}} of a door-spring that made the door fly open when it should make it close roused a vivid spark in her soul. It was she who was wrestling with the angel of mechanism.|$|E
6000|$|... 10 P. M. I have cleaned my {{coat with}} turpentine. I {{do not think}} that any one could have seen me. It was with my <b>screw-driver</b> that I made the marks. I found it all crusted with paint, and I have cleaned it. My head aches as if it would burst, and I have taken five grains of antipyrine. If it were not for Agatha, I should have taken fifty and had an end of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it ended}} by their taking Blessington and hanging him. The matter was so {{prearranged}} {{that it is}} my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows. That <b>screw-driver</b> and those screws were, as I conceive, for fixing it up. Seeing the hook, however they naturally saved themselves the trouble. Having finished their work they made off, and the door was barred behind them by their confederate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's feel of you again." [...] The circus {{man took}} hold of Pony and felt his joints. [...] "You're put {{together}} pretty tight; but I reckon we could make you do if you'd let us take you apart with a <b>screw-driver</b> and limber up the pieces with rattlesnake oil. Wouldn't like it, heigh? Well, let me see!" [...] The circus man thought a moment, and then he said: [...] "How would double-somersaults on four horses bareback do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, the Signora Gemma {{held her}} husband {{together}} whilst he undid the screw that fixed the spring. If {{they had been}} alone, she would have done it, pretending to be under his direction. But since I was there, he did it himself; a grey, shaky, highly-bred little gentleman, standing on a chair with a long <b>screw-driver,</b> whilst his wife stood behind him, her hands half-raised to catch him if he should fall. Yet he was strangely absolute, with a strange, intact force in his breeding.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the first}} topics on which I heard {{conversation}} turning in America {{was that of a}} very interesting book called Main Street, which involves many of these questions of the modern industrial and the eternal feminine. It is simply the story, or perhaps rather the study than the story, of a young married woman in one of the multitudinous little towns on the great central plains of America; and of a sort of struggle between her own more restless culture and the provincial prosperity of her neighbours. There are a number of true and telling suggestions in the book, but the one touch which I found tingling in the memory of many readers was the last sentence, in which the master of the house, with unshaken simplicity, merely asks for the whereabouts of some domestic implement; I think it was a <b>screw-driver.</b> It seems to me a harmless request, but from the way people talked about it one might suppose he had asked for a <b>screw-driver</b> to screw down the wife in her coffin. And a great many advanced persons would tell us that wooden house in which she lived really was like a wooden coffin. But this appears to me to be taking a somewhat funereal view of the life of humanity.|$|E
6000|$|Bathsheba {{in after}} times could never gauge the mood which carried {{her through the}} actions {{following}} this murmured resolution on this memorable evening of her life. She went to the lumber-closet for a <b>screw-driver.</b> At {{the end of a}} short though undefined time she found herself in the small room, quivering with emotion, a mist before her eyes, and an excruciating pulsation in her brain, standing beside the uncovered coffin of the girl whose conjectured end had so entirely engrossed her, and saying to herself in a husky voice as she gazed within-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God we {{know that}} much, Adolphe! Now, in the first place, I {{want you to get}} me some tools--a sharp saw, a chisel, a large <b>screw-driver,</b> and half a dozen large screws; also, two beams of wood to fasten across the {{hatchway}} and keep the boards up after I have sawn through them; also, I want three bundles of cork--flat pieces will be the best if you can get them, but that doesn't matter much. I may as well have an auger too. When you go back to your house will you go in next door and ask our landlady, Mere Leflo--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are putting}} up your prices, darky, and {{are making a}} fortune out of us," [...] Vincent said {{as he took the}} cucumber, which was a very large and {{straight}} one. He had no difficulty with this, as with the melon; a sharp twist broke it in two as he reached the corner he had used the day previously. It had been cut in half, one end had been scooped out for the reception of the handle of the <b>screw-driver</b> and the metal been driven in to the head in the other half. Hiding it under his jacket, he felt that he was now prepared for escape.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is as it}} may be, but it {{is certain}} {{they must have been}} aided by traitors outside the prison, for the rope hung loose {{on the outside of the}} wall, and must have been held by someone there as they climbed it. The inside end was {{fastened}} to a stone seat, and they were thus enabled to slide down it on the other side. Their uniforms were found lying at the foot of the wall, and their accomplice had doubtless had disguises ready for them. The authorities of the prison are unable to account for the manner in which the <b>screw-driver</b> and rope were passed in to them, or how they communicated with their friends outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great {{excitement}} {{was caused}} on Wednesday at Elmira {{by the discovery}} that three Confederate officers had, during the night, effected their escape from prison. One of {{the bars of the}} window of the ward on the first floor in which they were, with fifteen other Confederate officers, confined, had been removed; the screws having been taken out by a large <b>screw-driver</b> which they left behind them. They had lowered themselves to the yard, and climbed over the wall by means of a rope which was found in position in the morning. The rest of the prisoners professed an entire ignorance of the affair, and declared that, until they found the beds unoccupied in the morning, they knew nothing of the occurrence.|$|E
60|$|Unbuttoning his coat, {{he thrust}} them in; {{then he took}} the melon rind and broke it into very small pieces and threw them about. He then went up {{to his room and}} thrust the hanks, unobserved, one by one among the straw which, covered by an army blanket, {{constituted}} his bed. To-morrow, no doubt, Dan would supply him somehow with a <b>screw-driver.</b> On going down to the gate next day he found that the negro had changed his commodity, and that this time his basket contained very large and fine cucumbers. These were selling briskly, and Vincent saw that Dan was looking round anxiously, and that an expression of relief came over his face as he perceived him. He had, indeed, but eight or ten cucumbers left.|$|E
60|$|As {{we got on}} {{with the}} thing I found myself almost keenly interested. It was I who called in the {{housekeeper}} and broke matters to her, and it was I chiefly who fixed up the inverted bed. In fact, I spent two whole days at his flat. I am a handy, interfering sort of man with a <b>screw-driver,</b> and I made all sorts of ingenious adaptations for him--ran a wire to bring his bells within reach, turned all his electric lights up instead of down, and so on. The whole affair was extremely curious and interesting to me, and it was delightful to think of Pyecraft like some great, fat blow-fly, crawling about on his ceiling and clambering round the lintel of his doors from one room to another, and never, never, never coming to the club any more...|$|E
60|$|It {{was this}} {{adventure}} in wood-working and plumbing that {{brought about the}} building of the little workshop, where he slowly gathered a collection of loved tools. And he, who in the old days, out of his millions, could purchase immediately whatever he might desire, learned the new joy of the possession that follows upon rigid economy and desire long delayed. He waited three months before daring the extravagance of a Yankee <b>screw-driver,</b> and his glee in the marvelous little mechanism was so keen that Dede conceived forthright a great idea. For six months she saved her egg-money, which was hers by right of allotment, and on his birthday presented him with a turning-lathe of wonderful simplicity and multifarious efficiencies. And their mutual delight in the tool, which was his, was only equalled by their delight in Mab's first foal, which was Dede's special private property.|$|E
60|$|All this is true, and I {{think the}} lady {{might be more}} {{contented}} in her coffin, which is more comfortably furnished {{than most of the}} coffins where her fellow creatures live. Nevertheless, there is an answer to this, or at least a modification of it. There is a case for the lady and a case against the gentleman and the <b>screw-driver.</b> And when we have noted what it really is, we have noted the real disadvantage {{in a situation like that}} of modern America, and especially the Middle West. And with that we come back to the truth with which I started this speculation; the truth that few have yet realised, but of which I, for one, am more and more convinced--that industrialism is spreading because it is decaying; that only the dust and ashes of its dissolution are choking up the growth of natural things everywhere and turning the green world grey.|$|E
60|$|When {{he arrived}} at this {{conclusion}} he went upstairs to his room to write a line to Dan. The day was a fine one, and {{he found that the}} whole of the occupants of the room had gone below. This was an unexpected bit of good fortune, and he at once went to the window and examined the bars. They were thick and of new iron, but had been hastily put up. The building had originally been a large warehouse, and when it had been converted into a prison for the Confederate prisoners the bars had been added to the windows. Instead, therefore, of being built into solid stone and fastened in by lead, they were merely screwed on to the wooden framework of the windows, and by a strong <b>screw-driver</b> a bar could be removed in five minutes. This altogether altered the position. He had only to wait until the rest of the occupants of the room were asleep and then to remove the bar and let himself down.|$|E
60|$|The horn {{in which}} western hunters carry their powder is usually {{that of an}} ox. It is closed up at the large end {{with a piece of}} hard wood fitted tightly into it, and the small end is closed with a wooden peg or stopper. It is, therefore, {{completely}} water-tight, and may be for hours immersed without the powder getting wet unless the stopper should chance to be knocked out. Dick found, to his great satisfaction, that the stopper was fast, and the powder perfectly dry. Moreover, he had by good fortune filled it full two days before from the package that contained the general stock of ammunition, so that there were only two or three charges out of it. His percussion caps, however, were completely destroyed, and even though they had not been, it would have mattered little, for he did not possess more than half a dozen. But this was not so great a misfortune as at first it might seem, for he had the spare flint locks and the little <b>screw-driver</b> necessary for fixing and unfixing them stowed away in his shot pouch.|$|E
