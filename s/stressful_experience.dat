5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a <b>stressful</b> <b>experience,</b> due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E

40|$|Although tobacco smoking, {{which has}} been linked to depression, is a major public health problem, {{little is known about the}} neurobiological factors that confer {{vulnerability}} to smoking in youngsters and the effects of adolescent smoking on the course of depression. This study examined whether hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity and <b>stressful</b> life <b>experiences</b> are related to smoking behavior in depressed and non-depressed adolescents, and whether smoking predicts a worsening course of depression. Smoking history and <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> were assessed in 151 adolescents (48 with no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder, 48 with no psychiatric history, but at high risk for depression by virtue of parental depression, and 55 with current major depressive disorder). Evening salivary cortisol and nocturnal urinary-free cortisol were measured for three consecutive evenings. The participants were then followed at regular intervals for up to 5 years to assess smoking history, clinical course of depression and <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> during the follow-up period. Increased evening/night-time cortisol levels were associated with both initiation and persistence of smoking during follow-up. <b>Stressful</b> life <b>experiences</b> further increased the risk for smoking in depressed as well as non-depressed youth. Smoking was also associated with a higher frequency of depressive episodes during follow-up. A model that included <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> and cortisol levels reduced the contribution of smoking per se to depression. High evening/night-time cortisol level appears to be a vulnerability marker for smoking in adolescents, with <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> further increasing the risk for smoking in vulnerable youth.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Prenatal {{stress is}} thought to confer unique and {{enduring}} impairments in postnatal functioning in children (Van den Bergh, Mulder, Mennes, & Glover, 2005). Although prenatal stress {{is thought to}} have pervasive and lasting effects on children, few human studies have formally tested putative mechanisms or mediators conferring such effects. The existing literature on prenatal stress is clouded by interchanging definitions of prenatal stress between maternal psychological symptoms experienced in pregnancy and maternal <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> during pregnancy. This study examined the effects of maternal prenatal depression and stressful events on children’s adjustment in 306 preschool-age children and their mothers assessed across 4 time points. Multiple assessment methods were implemented, including neuroendocrine indicators of HPA activity, neuropsychological assessment of executive control, as well as the utilization of maternal and teacher-report questionnaire data. Using longitudinal modeling and multi-method assessments, the current study explored the unique effects of prenatal and postnatal psychological symptoms and the prenatal and postnatal experience of stress on preschooler’s social competence and total problems. Putative mediators, including children’s diurnal cortisol and executive functioning, were tested as potentially conferring the effect of prenatal stress. Sex differences in these relations were examined. Prenatal and postnatal maternal mood and <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> were not related to children’s diurnal cortisol (morning level or slope). There were trends of higher prenatal mood symptoms and prenatal <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> predicting lower initial levels of preschooler’s executive control. There was a trend for higher prenatal alcohol exposure predicting greater growth in executive control. Postnatal maternal mood and prenatal and postnatal <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> did not predict executive control. Higher postnatal mood symptoms predicted lower social competence and higher mother-report total problems. There was a trend for higher prenatal mood symptoms to predict lower mother-report social competence. Greater prenatal exposure to medications predicted higher mother-report total problems. Greater prenatal exposure to alcohol predicted higher teacher-report total problems. Greater postnatal <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> predicted higher mother-report total problems and lower mother-report social competence. Higher initial levels of executive control predicted higher social competence and lower total problems per teacher report. Greater growth in executive control predicted higher social competence and lower total problems by teacher report. There was no support for mediated relations. There was no evidence of child sex differences in these relations or evidence of differences in pathways predicted by prenatal maternal mood symptoms versus prenatal <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences.</b> The sample and study design afford the unique opportunity to evaluate two forms of prenatal stress, prenatal mood symptoms and prenatal <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences,</b> in a longitudinal framework. Prenatal medication and alcohol exposure were related to behavioral outcomes in the preschool period. Postnatal mood and <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> related to mother report of adjustment.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown a {{relationship}} between <b>stressful</b> war <b>experiences</b> and mental health symptoms in children and adolescents. To date, no comprehensive studies {{on the role of}} childhood adversities have been conducted with war-exposed adolescents living in post-war, low-resource settings in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 551 school-going adolescents aged 13 - 21 years old was undertaken four years post-war in northern Uganda. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires assessing demographics, <b>stressful</b> war <b>experiences,</b> childhood adversities, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety symptoms. Results: Our analyses revealed a main effect of gender on all mental health outcomes except avoidance symptoms, with girls reporting higher scores than boys. <b>Stressful</b> war <b>experiences</b> were associated with all mental health symptoms, after adjusting for potential confounders. Childhood adversity was independently associated with depression symptoms but not PTSD, anxiety, and PTSD cluster symptoms. However, in situations of high childhood adversity, our analyses showed that <b>stressful</b> war <b>experiences</b> were less associated with vulnerability to avoidance symptoms than in situations of low childhood adversity. Conclusions: Both <b>stressful</b> war <b>experiences</b> and childhood adversities are risk factors for mental health symptoms among war-affected adolescents. Adolescents with histories of high childhood adversities may be less likely to develop avoidance symptoms in situations of high <b>stressful</b> war <b>experiences.</b> Further exploration of the differential roles of childhood adversities and <b>stressful</b> war <b>experiences</b> is needed...|$|R

Previous {{studies have focused on}} general stressors, whereas the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate associations between individuals’ <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> and different types of headache. Methods: Adolescents from 10 th and 11 th grades of grammar schools filled in questionnaires. <b>Stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> were measured with the Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress. Type of headache was classified according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Linear regressions, adjusted for sex and grade, were calculated to estimate differences in stress scores that can be attributed to migraine, tension-type headache or miscellaneous headache. Results: A total of 1260 questionnaires were analysed. Tension-type headache, migraine and co-existing migraine plus tension-type headache were found in 48. 7 %, 10. 2 % and 19. 8 % of the participants. In subjects with migraine or co-existing migraine plus tension-type headache, high increases in stress scores were found in all investigated dimensions, whereas much weaker and inconsistent associations were found in subjects with tension-type headache only. Conclusions: The characteristic of migraine is more associated with <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> than this is the case for tensiontype headache. This suggests that adolescent migraine patients might especially benefit from behavioural interventions regarding stress. Keywords: Stress, TICS, headache, migraine, tension-type headache...|$|R

Using electron microscopy, we found glucocorticoid receptors localized to non-genomic sites in rat lateral amygdala, glia processes, presynaptic terminals, neuronal dendrites, and dendritic spines including spine organelles and postsynaptic membrane densities.

Each wave consisted of the assessment of depressive symptoms and the examination of <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> in daily life by means of experience sampling (70 occasions per wave). Cross-lagged panel models revealed that the perceived intensity of daily stressors, stressed and depressed feelings in daily life, as well as depressed reactions to daily stressors predict an increase in future depressive symptoms in young females but not males. Other cross-lagged effects, particularly from depressive symptoms to <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> in daily life, were not significant. Findings are in line with the stress exposure model according to which stress can cause increases in depressive symptoms.

In this study, posttraumatic stress symptoms and their relationship with personality traits, previous <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> and exposure to stressful events during air attacks in Yugoslavia were investigated. The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI; Millon, 1983), Impact of Events Scale (IES; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979), Life Stressor Checklist Revised (LSCL-R; Wolfe & Kimerling, 1997), and List of Stressors were administered to a homogeneous group of medical students 1 year after the attacks. In multiple regression analyses, compulsive and passive-aggressive personality traits and {{a higher level of}} exposure to stressors during air attacks independently predicted the degree of intrusion symptoms. Avoidance symptoms were predicted by avoidant personality traits and a higher exposure to stressors both previously in life and during the attacks. In the next step, we tested in analyses of variance whether personality traits, previous <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences,</b> and <b>stressful</b> events during attacks as independent variables interact in predicting intrusion and avoidance symptoms. For this, students were clustered into three groups depending on their predominant personality traits. In addition to direct predictive effects, there were significant interaction effects in predicting both intrusion and avoidance. The findings suggest that each of the tested factors, i. e., personality traits, previous <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences,</b> and exposure to traumatic events may have an independent and direct influence on developing posttraumatic stress. However, the effect of these factors cannot just be added up. Rather, the factors interact in their impact on posttraumatic stress symptoms.

In 2005 / 6, human rights violations and other war experiences, PTSD, post-traumatic stress symptoms and MD were assessed in war affected community samples in five Balkan countries (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Serbia) and refugees in three Western European countries (Germany, Italy, United Kingdom). The main outcome measures were the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. In total 3313 participants in the Balkans and 854 refugees were assessed. Participants reported on average 2. 3 rights violations and 2. 3 other <b>stressful</b> war <b>experiences.</b> 22. 8 % of the participants were diagnosed with current PTSD and also 22. 8 % had MD. Most war experiences significantly increased the risk for both PTSD and MD. When the number of rights violations and other <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> were considered in one model, both were significantly associated with higher risks for PTSD and were significantly associated with higher levels of intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal. However, only the number of violations, and not of other <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences,</b> significantly increased the risk for MD.

40|$|The present {{review was}} aimed at re-evaluating results {{obtained}} from animal models of depression based on experimental stressors {{in the light of}} the most recent data on the effects of stress on mesolimbic dopamine (DA) functioning. The data reviewed reveal that the effects of <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> on behaviour and on mesoaccumbens DA functioning can be very different or even opposite depending on the behavioural controllability of the situation, the genetic background of the organism and its life history. Exposure to a single unavoidable/uncontrollable aversive experience leads to inhibition of DA release in the accumbens as well as to impaired responding to rewarding and aversive stimuli. Moreover, the data reviewed indicate a strong relationship between these neurochemical and behavioural effects and suggest that they could model stress-induced expression and exacerbation of some depressive symptoms such as anhedonia and feeling of helplessness caused by life events as well as syndromal depression provoked by traumatic experiences in humans. Repeated and chronic <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences</b> can reduce the ability of stressors to disrupt behaviour, induce behavioural sensitisation to psychostimulants and promote adaptive changes of mesolimbic DA functioning. Opposite neural and behavioural changes, however, can be promoted in specific environmental conditions (repeated variable <b>stressful</b> <b>experiences)</b> or in genetically predisposed individuals.
