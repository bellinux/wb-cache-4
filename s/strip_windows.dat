25|$|The east bell-tower {{consists}} of a two-storey rusticated base and step-backs to an onion-shaped cupola above the belfry. At the ground level, an entry vestibule is created by an open, four-centered archway. At the second story, still within the tower's rusticated base-section, a series of four narrow, stained-glass <b>strip</b> <b>windows</b> provide a distinct, modernist, element. The first segment of the step-backs of the tower contains two smaller <b>strip</b> <b>windows,</b> and the following, taller set-back houses the church-bell behind narrow arches, one {{on each of the}} four sides, supported by Corinthian columns. The onion-cupola caps the composition.|$|E
2500|$|The shift or {{transition}} from Nordic Classicism to Functionalism is said sometimes {{to have been}} sudden and revolutionary, as with Aalto's Turku Sanomat newspaper offices and Paimio Sanatorium, which employs such distinct modernist features as use of reinforced concrete construction, steel <b>strip</b> <b>windows</b> and flat roofs. The shift in Aalto's design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the Viipuri Library (1927–35), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal (1927) to the completed high-modernist building, following delays in the project, yet still retaining many of {{the ideals of the}} original idea. Traces of Nordic Classicism would naturally continue synthesized with Functionalism and a more idiosyncratic individual style, a well-known example being Erik Bryggman's mature work, the Resurrection Chapel in Turku, dating from as late as 1941. Indeeed, in a major study of Finnish architecture during this period, albeit with a particular emphasis on Aalto, Greek historian-theoretician Demetri Porphyrios, in Sources of Modern Eclecticism (1983), argues that the [...] "organic" [...] ordering of Aalto's mature works makes use of the same [...] "heterotopic" [...] ordering - i.e. the juxtaposition of contrary elements - that is evident in the Nordic National Romantic architecture {{from the end of the}} 19th and beginning of the 20th century; for example, the works of Eliel Saarinen.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} façade and {{the external}} altar wall are concrete slabs. The {{rest of the}} structure is bare concrete. A canopy floats over the entrance, which slopes down in an inward curve. On its fascia is a dedicatory inscription. The entrance doors are carved wood planking and are set in varnished planking that fills the frontage below the canopy. At {{the top of the}} entrance façade is a horizontal <b>window</b> <b>strip.</b> Vertical <b>window</b> <b>strips</b> edge each vertical step along the side frontages. Another horizontal <b>window</b> <b>strip</b> {{is at the top of}} the altar wall.|$|R

25|$|Corbusier's piloti {{perform a}} number of {{functions}} around the house, both inside and out. On the two longer elevations they are flush {{with the face of}} the façade and imply heaviness and support, but on the shorter sides they are set back giving a floating effect that emphasises the horizontal feeling of the house. The wide <b>strip</b> <b>window</b> to the first floor terrace has two baby piloti to support and stiffen the wall above. Although these piloti are in a similar plane to the larger columns below a false perspective when viewed from outside the house gives the impression that they are further into the house than they actually are.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{sketches}} {{the design}} and implementation of Device-Driver Analyzer for x 86 (DDA/x 86), a prototype analysis tool for finding bugs in <b>stripped</b> <b>Windows</b> device-driver executables (i. e., when neither source code nor symbol-table/debugging information is available), and presents a case study. DDA/x 86 {{was able to find}} known bugs (previously discovered by source-code-based analysis tools) along with useful error traces, while having a reasonably low false-positive rate. This work represents the first known application of automatic program verification/analysis to stripped industrial executables, and allows one to check that an executable does not violate known API usage rules (rather than simply trusting that the implementation is correct). ...|$|R

5000|$|The William Stone Building {{comprises}} {{residential accommodation}} for eight fellows and 24 students of Peterhouse. It was constructed during 1963-64 to a design by Leslie Martin and Colin St John Wilson that {{was influenced by}} the work of Alvar Aalto. The March 1993 Grade II listing details describe it: [...] Buff brick; copper cladding. Flat roof. Irregular plan with staggered rooms, facing west. Eight storeys. Horizontal <b>strip</b> <b>windows</b> with bull-nosed cills. Varnished timber frames. Copper sheet cladding above top storey window. Elevation to east has expressed rectangular staircase and lift tower rising above roof line and narrow horizontal <b>strip</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E

40|$|We present ClearView, {{a system}} for {{automatically}} patching errors in deployed software. ClearView works on <b>stripped</b> <b>Windows</b> x 86 binaries without any need for source code, debugging information, or other external information, and without human intervention. ClearView (1) observes normal executions to learn invariants that characterize the application’s normal behavior, (2) uses error detectors to distinguish normal executions from erroneous executions, (3) identifies violations of learned invariants that occur during erroneous executions, (4) generates candidate repair patches that enforce selected invariants by changing the state or flow of control to make the invariant true, and (5) observes the continued execution of patched applications to select the most successful patch. ClearView is designed to correct errors in software with high availability requirements. Aspects of ClearView that make it particularl...|$|R

40|$|An Energy Dissipating Cladding System {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in buildings designed based {{on the concept of}} damage-controlled structure in seismic design. This innovative cladding panel system is capable of functioning both as a structural brace, as well as a source of energy dissipation, without demanding inelastic action and ductility from the basic lateral force resisting system. The structural systems of many modern buildings typically have large openings to accommodate glazing systems, and a popular type of construction uses spandrel precast cladding panels at each floor level that supports <b>strip</b> <b>window</b> systems. The present study focuses on developing spandrel type precast concrete cladding panels as supplementary energy dissipating devices that are added to the basic structural system. Through a series of analytical studies, the result of evaluating the ability of the proposed Energy Dissipating Cladding system to improve the earthquake resistance of the buildings is presented here...|$|R
50|$|Like the exterior, the {{interior}} is entirely exposed grey concrete. The vast single space houses abstract stained glass in the horizontal and vertical <b>window</b> <b>strips,</b> the colours of which are dominated by azure blue. Behind the altar is a semicircular coved concrete wall, surrounded by vertical and horizontal <b>window</b> <b>strips</b> that are mostly magenta. Above this is the main altar wall, which has an upward and outward sweep of raw concrete bearing a figure of Christ crucified without a cross. The two chapels are smaller with blue glass.|$|R
50|$|The former Masel Residence is a {{striking}} example of a building in {{what is known as}} the interwar functionalist style and incorporates typical features of the style such as asymmetrical cubic massing, expanses of undecorated brick walls, steel corner and <b>strip</b> <b>windows,</b> curved brickwork corners, flat cantilevered awnings and a concealed roof.|$|E

Building and lighting design: Rudolf Fränkel.|$|E
50|$|The {{enclosed}} cockpit {{was just}} ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} wing; its pilot sat on the left, though there was provision for a second seat with dual controls. A passengers' cabin, with long <b>strip</b> <b>windows</b> and 2.23 m in length, seated four and contained a toilet and baggage space at the rear. The cabin could be easily reconfigured into a freight compartment and was accessed through a large port-side door.|$|E

50|$|Solid, cubic and monumental, {{the house}} is a two-storey {{structure}} with some single-storey projections. These single storey sections include the former consulting rooms on the southern corner, a laundry and bathroom on the western corner, a garage at the rear and the eastern end of the living room, which supports a balcony above. Dominating the front facade is a centrally located curved stairwell with <b>strip</b> <b>windows</b> intersected by a continuous horizontal awning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house is}} notable {{for being the}} first {{building}} in Israel to use elongated recessed balconies, an adaptation of Le Corbusier's <b>strip</b> <b>windows.</b> [...] Horizontality is emphasized by the narrow intervals between the building's parapet and overhang; {{not only does this}} have the design impact of emphasizing the horizontal style, it has the practical effect of screening out the heat of the Mediterranean sun. [...] The timbered pergola, a design element frequently seen in Jerusalem, is unusual in Tel Aviv.|$|E
5000|$|Within the playground, {{near the}} {{entrance}} of the playground is a large elevated hall with a substantially infilled undercroft.
