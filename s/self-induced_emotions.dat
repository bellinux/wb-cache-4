40|$|Human {{computer}} interface (HCI) {{has become}} more and more important in the last few years. This is mainly due to the increase in the technology and in the new possibilities in yielding a help to disabled people. Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) represent a subset of the HCI systems which use measurements of the voluntary brain activity for driving a communication system mainly useful for severely disabled people. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been intensively used for the measurement of electrical signals related to the brain activity. The BCI usage requires the activation of mental tasks that could be derived by external stimulations (often audio-visual) or by autonomous activations (for example by thinking to move an arm for signaling a binary command). In the last few years, a new paradigm of activation has been used, consisting in the autonomous brain activation through <b>self-induced</b> <b>emotions,</b> remembered on autobiographical basis. In the present paper, we describe {{the state of the art}} of a BCI system based on <b>self-induced</b> <b>emotions,</b> from the activation paradigm to the used signal classification strategies and the final graphic interface. Moreover, we will discuss its extensio...|$|E
40|$|A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is {{a useful}} {{instrument}} to support human communication, frequently implemented by using electroencephalography (EEG). Regarding the used communication paradigm, {{a very large number}} of strategies exist and, recently, <b>self-induced</b> <b>emotions</b> have been introduced. However, in general the actual emotion-based BCIs are just binary, since they are capable of recognizing just a single emotion. A crucial node is the introduction of more than a single emotional state for improving the efficiency of a BCI. In order to be used in BCIs, signals from different emotional states have to be collected, recognized and classified. In the present paper, a method for mapping several emotional states was described and tested on EEG signals collected from a publicly available dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP). The proposed method, its experimental protocol, and preliminary numerical results on three different emotional states were presented and discussed. The method, based on multiple binary classification, was capable of optimizing the most discriminative channels and the features combination for each emotional state and of recognizing between several emotional states through a polling system...|$|E
40|$|Verbs {{of emotion}} with se in Slovene: between middle and {{reflexive}} semantics. A cognitive analysis This article presents a cognitive analysis of Slovene emotion verbs with the personal pronoun se ‘self’, e. g., bati se ‘to be scared’. Slavic verbs {{of this type}} are traditionally considered reflexive. The objectives of the article are twofold. First, the article aims to demonstrate that se in Slovene verbs of emotion indicates not the reflexive, but the middle voice construction. However, given specific pragmatic factors, these verbs also form reflexive constructions with the heavy form sebe ‘self’, or even both middle and reflexive constructions with se and sebe, respectively. Second, this article challenges Anna Wierzbicka’s assumption that the Slavic verbs with the light form of the personal pronoun or the -sja affix (Russian) express (almost) volitional, i. e. <b>self-induced</b> <b>emotion.</b> In line with cognitive Suzanne Kemmer, it is claimed that the constructions with the verbs under discussion indicate a low degree of volitionality {{in the process of}} emotional change i. e. they lexicalize an event that occurs independently of the Experiencer participant’s will...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} alter one’s {{emotional}} responses {{is central to}} overall well-being and to effectively meeting the demands of life. One of the chief symptoms of events such as trauma, that overwhelm our capacities to successfully handle and adapt to them, is a shift in our internal baseline reference such that there ensues a repetitive activation of the traumatic event. This can result in high vigilance and over-sensitivity to environmental signals which are reflected in inappropriate emotional responses and autonomic nervous system dynamics. In this article we discuss the perspective that one’s ability to self-regulate the quality of feeling and emotion of one’s moment-to-moment experience is intimately tied to our physiology, and the reciprocal interactions among physiological, cognitive and emotional systems. These interactions {{form the basis of}} information processing networks in which communication between systems occurs through the generation and transmission of rhythms and patterns of activity. Our discussion emphasizes the communication pathways between the heart and brain, as well as how these are related to cognitive and emotional function and self-regulatory capacity. We discuss the hypothesis that <b>self-induced</b> positive <b>emotions</b> increase the coherence in bodily processes, which is reflected in the pattern of the heart’s rhythm. This shift in the heart rhythm in turn {{plays an important role in}} facilitating higher cognitive functions, creating emotional stability and facilitating states of calm. Over time, this establishes a new inner-baseline reference, a type of implicit memory that organizes perception, feelings and behavior. Without establishing a new baseline reference, people are at risk of getting stuck in familiar, yet unhealthy emotional and behavioral patterns and living their lives through the automatic filters of past familiar or traumatic experience...|$|R
