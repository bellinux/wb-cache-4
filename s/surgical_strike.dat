When Duke's flagship Norad II is {{shot down by}} the Zerg during the battle, Duke is rescued by Raynor on Mengsk's orders {{in return for the}} defection of the general and his squadron, and Duke's knowledge is vital to Mengsk's assault on Tarsonis. Mengsk, still skeptical of Duke's loyalty, later dispatches Duke on expeditions to investigate the Zerg on Char and a Xel'Naga artifact on Bhekar Ro in Shadow of the Xel'Naga, engagements which decimate Alpha Squadron. In Brood War, Duke organises the Dominion's fleet defences against the United Earth Directorate, and later follows Mengsk into alliance with Kerrigan and her Zerg. However, as part of a <b>surgical</b> <b>strike</b> against the Dominion's military capabilities, Kerrigan has Duke's flagship destroyed, killing the general.|$|E

Modi increased the monetary {{compensation for victims}} of terrorist attacks, and stated that citizens of Azad Kashmir could also apply for this compensation. In September 2016, he urged the BRICS to target and destroy funding channels of terrorist groups. On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a <b>surgical</b> <b>strike</b> on terror launchpads in PoK, although Pakistan denied the claim, and {{the details of the}} confrontation are still in dispute.|$|E

5000|$|As Deputy Chief of Air Staff Operations [...] "DCAS (O)", Suleman was {{responsible}} for all operations of the PAF. He is the architect of anti-surgical strike strategy which barred India from carrying out strikes against Pakistan in aftermath of the Mumbai attacks. In that capacity, he planned response to Indian Air Force threat of <b>surgical</b> <b>strikes</b> against Pakistan {{in the wake of}} terrorists strike at Mumbai. He deployed force to face Indian threat in November 2008, which thwarted the Indian Air Force plans of <b>surgical</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R

He looked into what kind of military support was available to the South in case of such an attack, including from U.S. Forces Japan and the Unified Nations Command. He wanted information on who has operational control in times of crisis on the Korean Peninsula and cooperation among the armed forces of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Chechen Air Force (as {{well as the}} republic's {{civilian}} aircraft fleet) {{was completely}} destroyed in the air strikes that occurred on the very first few hours of the war, while around 500 people {{took advantage of the}} mid-December amnesty declared by Yeltsin for members of Dzhokhar Dudayev's armed groups. Nevertheless, Boris Yeltsin's cabinet's expectations of a quick <b>surgical</b> <b>strike,</b> quickly followed by Chechen capitulation and regime change, were misguided. Russia found itself in a quagmire almost instantly. The morale of the Russian troops, poorly-prepared and not understanding why and even where they were being sent, was low from the beginning. Some Russian units resisted the order to advance, and in some cases, the troops sabotaged their own equipment. In Ingushetia, civilian protesters stopped the western column and set 30 military vehicles on fire, while about 70 conscripts deserted their units. Advance of the northern column was halted by the unexpected Chechen resistance at Dolinskoye and the Russian forces suffered their first serious losses. Deeper in Chechnya, a group of 50 Russian paratroopers surrendered to the local Chechen militia after being deployed by helicopters behind enemy lines and then abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|The Chairman Senate of Pakistan, Senator Raza Rabbani, {{said that}} any <b>surgical</b> <b>strike</b> into its {{territory}} {{would be taken}} {{as an act of}} war and would be repulsed with [...] "full force", and that [...] "ach and every inch of the country will be safeguarded".

2500|$|Matthew Kroenig, Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Special Adviser in the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense from July 2010 to July 2011, {{argues that}} skeptics of {{military}} action fail to appreciate the threats posed by a nuclear Iran. If managed carefully, Kroenig believes that a surgical military strike targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities [...] "could spare {{the region and the}} world a very real threat and dramatically improve the long-term national security of the United States." [...] A nuclear-armed Iran would not only limit U.S. leverage in the Middle East, but Iran's rivals like Saudi Arabia would probably seek nuclear weapons and subsequently spark an arms race. Once Iran had a nuclear device, Tehran could [...] "choose to spur proliferation by transferring nuclear technology to its allies—other countries and terrorist groups alike" [...] in order to contain its regional rivals. In the midst of a global economic downturn, Kroenig believes that containing a nuclear-armed Iran would be a massive financial, political, and military burden for the United States. A <b>surgical</b> <b>strike</b> would be less costly. Kroenig notes that airstrike skeptics are concerned that military planners will not know the location of some key facilities. Kroenig thinks this concern is overblown: [...] "U.S. intelligence agencies, the IAEA, and opposition groups within Iran have provided timely warning of Tehran's nuclear activities in the past—exposing, for example, Iran's secret construction at Natanz and Qom before those facilities ever became operational." [...] In other words, Kroenig believes there is a high chance of Washington catching Iran before the latter hypothetically brings a nuclear facility online. To mitigate the global economic fallout from a military strike, Washington could [...] "offset any disruption of oil supplies by opening its Strategic Petroleum Reserve and quietly encouraging some Gulf states to increase their production {{in the run-up to the}} attack." [...] He also believes the United States could manage war-time escalation levels by indicating to the Iranians that they are not interested in government change. Finally, Kroenig addresses the skeptics who claim that even if a <b>surgical</b> <b>strike</b> against Iran were successful, it would only delay Iran's nuclear program. Kroenig believes that if a <b>surgical</b> <b>strike</b> was successful, the devastation could be so significant that Iran would abandon its nuclear ambitions forever.|$|E
5000|$|Pakistan {{denied that}} such <b>surgical</b> <b>strikes</b> occurred. The Inter-Services Public Relations {{said that there}} had been only [...] "cross border firing". But, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif {{condemned}} the [...] "unprovoked and naked aggression of Indian forces", which he said resulted in the death of two Pakistani soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{application of}} the ALAS missile system would be to defend an airfield and conduct <b>surgical</b> <b>strikes</b> until heavier forces are available.

[...] "The Lashkar men gathered there were blaming the Pak Army for failing to defend the border”, he said, “and were saying they would soon give India an answer it would never forget." [...] Several days after the raids, a leading Indian security official who had been closely involved in their planning said that Pakistan's continued denial that any <b>surgical</b> <b>strikes</b> took place was a [...] "stance that suits us."
