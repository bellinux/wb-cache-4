It was expected that credit-rating agencies will assist the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and investors by revealing the risk. However, given that they pursue their own objectives, of increasing business volume and revenue, credit-rating agencies may not pay attention to investor risks though they claim to do so. This study defines regulatory practices against this backdrop. It is obvious that regulatory measures can be directed to the originator, SPV, or the credit-rating agency. We attempt a comparative evaluation and arrive at an efficient design of regulatory mechanisms and derive the implied credit ratings. In particular, we show that an efficient regulatory practice will be to require a deposit, proportional {{to the amount of}} receivables being securitised, from the originator. securitisation; credit ratings; regulation; regulatory practices; structured instrument; financial instruments; excessive risk; credit agencies; special purpose vehicles; SPVs; investors; business volume; business revenues; originators; regulatory mechanisms; receivables; globalisation; trade; global markets; global economy; policy analysis. ...|$|E

[...] According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, during the years 2005, 2006, and 2007, rating of {{structured}} finance products such as mortgage-backed securities made up close to half of Moody’s rating revenues. From 2000 to 2007, revenues from rating <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> increased more than fourfold. However, there was some question about the models Moody's used to give structured products high ratings. In June 2005, shortly before the subprime mortgage crisis, Moody’s updated its approach for estimating default correlation of non-prime/nontraditional mortgages involved in <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> products like mortgage-backed securities and Collateralized debt obligations. Its new model was based on trends from the previous 20 years, during which time housing prices had been rising, mortgage delinquencies very low, and nontraditional mortgage products a very small niche of the market.|$|R

Traditionally many financial models employ Monte-Carlo simulation, which can take excessively long to compute in software. Hence, commonly a hardware accelerator is sought out. This thesis focuses on accelerating <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments,</b> namely Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) pricing, which have previously not been targeted for hardware acceleration despite their prominence in the financial market.

40|$|Neoclassical finance {{assumes that}} investors are Bayesian. In many {{realistic}} situations, Bayesian learning is challenging. Here, we consider investment opportunities that change randomly, while payoffs are observable only when invested. In a stylized {{version of the}} task, we wondered whether performance would be affected {{if one were to}} follow reinforcement learning principles instead. The answer is a definite yes. When asked to perform our task, participants overwhelmingly learned in a Bayesian way. They stopped being Bayesians, though, when not nudged into paying attention to contingency shifts. This raises an issue for financial markets: who has the incentive to nudge investors? (JEL C 91, D 83, D 87, G 02, G 11) We study learning when the agent cannot observe the payoffs on the available investment opportunities unless she actively invests in them. In abstract terms, this problem is known as a multi-armed bandit problem (Rothschild 1974). For instance, the risk/reward data of most <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> that trade exclusively over the counter are not publicly available in an actionable time frame.

40|$|Financial {{crisis has}} {{indicated}} {{a need for}} a research of the <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> like ABS, MBS and CDO. A default of one market segment was projected to a global recession by these instruments. Recently, there is a tendency of both, broad and classified public to comprise all structured products under ABS. In this master thesis, we try to demonstrate on a sample of MBS secured by commercial mortgages (CMBS) and residential mortgages (RMBS) that they should be considered as independent instruments. Differences are verified on CDS indices and their interaction with macroeconomic indicators. We base it on models for single-name CDS and extend them for MBS. We use correlation coefficients and models based on three fundamental methods of econometric analysis - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Heteroscedasticity Corrected Least Squares. Main contribution of this thesis is a verification of the hypothesis of divergence in structured instruments depending on an underlying asset and also a verification of generally accepted views on the behavior of credit default spreads in economy.

We examine the linkages between the financial and real sectors in the euro area, finding that (i) bank loan supply responds negatively to declines in bank soundness; (ii) a cutback in bank loan supply has {{a negative impact on}} economic activity; (iii) a positive shock to the corporate bond spread lowers industrial output; and (iv) risk indicators for the banking, corporate, and public sectors show an improvement beginning in 2002 – 03, followed by a major deterioration since 2007. These estimates imply that the currently estimated bank losses would subtract some 2 percentage points from the euro area output (but with considerable uncertainty around the estimates).

30|$|Mobile Internet, cloud computing, big data, {{blockchain}} technology, {{and other}} FinTech have greatly changed traditional commercial banks. First, they {{have broken the}} relationships and channels between traditional banks and customers. In the past, the relationship between banks and customers was established and maintained through business services. However, future relationships will depend more on daily nonbusiness social networking. Second, with advancements in technology, payment systems and methods have experienced revolutionary changes. Business conducted through counters or ATMs in the past can now be done at mobile terminals anywhere anytime. Banking workspaces and environments have expanded without boundaries, and traditional physical branches have disappeared or transformed. Third, these changes have fundamentally altered and restructured banks’ business models. Client managers currently wait and look for projects; they negotiate, deal, and communicate with customers offline. Thus, communication skills, social skills, and social resources are the core competencies of client managers. However, {{in the era of}} everyday banks, client managers mainly mine data and communicate online. Hence, big data mining and data analysis capabilities are now the core competencies. Fourth, the resulting bank value assessment system differs from its own value systems and ideas. Various assets face revaluations; many assets that cannot currently be priced by banks are likely to receive new value forms. Fifth, the social and commercial credit system faces changes in the mobile Internet era. Sixth, an era of financial disintermediation is emerging, and not just for commercial banks. As a result, the entire financial ecology will change. Seventh, financial innovation has been normalized and socialized. Eighth, the financial asset price discovery mechanism is now different. Ninth, the financial ecology has been diversified. More financial institutions and organizations will appear. More complex and <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> will become more widespread. Tenth, to address complex financial ecology and forms, banking regulation will have more flexibility. Classified, dynamic, and process regulations have become new regulatory models.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how the ad hoc <b>structure</b> of certain <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> can support targets of {{production}} and asset separation in the firm. Of major interest are some participatory instruments, recently introduced in Italy in connection with particular internal separation achieved by setting aside predetermined operative assets, fully separated {{from the rest of}} the firm. These assets are dedicated to carrying out a specific project and represent the capital put at risk for this purpose, in other words the impact boundary of such risk. Hence the amount of such assets cannot exceed a very small fraction of the company’s capital. However, possible integrations may occur externally, in the form of financial resources or professional competences, which have, as a counterpart, <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> whose asset rights rest only on the specific project’s performance. The particular leverage effect thereby obtained can strongly contribute to promote new drivers for an innovating corporate strategy.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of recent {{failures}} of risk management, {{there has been a}} widespread call for improved quantification of the financial risks facing firms. At the forefront of this clamor has been Value at Risk. Previous research has identified differences in models, or Model Risk, as an important impediment to developing a Value at Risk standard. By contrast, this paper considers the divergence in a model's implementation in software and how it too, affects the establishment of a risk measurement standard. Different leading risk management systems' vendors were given identical portfolios of instruments of varying complexity, and were asked to assess the value at risk according to one common model, J. P. Morgan's RiskMetrics™. We analyzed the VaR results on a case by case basis, and in terms of prior expectations from the <b>structure</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> in the portfolio, as well as prior vendor expectations about the relative complexity of different asset classes.

40|$|SUMMARY: Financial rating {{agencies}} are key actors of financial markets. Their different ratings are usually pre-conditions for issuing securities or bonds. If they assess the financial {{viability of the}} <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> issued, they also assess the soundness of the legal arrangements used. Thus, taking the law into account {{is a key element}} of their assessment. At a macro level, their ratings may express an opinion of the economic attractiveness of a territory. The same may apply to the legal framework used by issuers. Surprisingly, the literature on this topic reveals to be scarce. This paper aims at fulfilling this gap 5. It studies, in particular thanks to interviews, how {{rating agencies}} consider the law while rating a country, an enterprise or a <b>financial</b> <b>structured</b> <b>instrument.</b> One of the hypotheses we wanted to test was whether financial rating agencies use synthetic indicators of law and institutions effectiveness such as those of IFC (World Bank Group) Doing Business annual reports and if there are biases for or against certain legal traditions.
