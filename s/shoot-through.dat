50|$|Shoot Thru Umbrella (<b>Shoot-Through)</b> {{is where}} light passes through an {{umbrella}} {{as opposed to}} being reflected by it. The umbrella acts as a light diffuser, softening the light and allowing it to spread over the subject evenly.|$|E
50|$|Using the {{nomenclature}} above, the switches S1 and S2 {{should never}} be closed at the same time, as this would cause a short circuit on the input voltage source. The same applies to the switches S3 and S4. This condition is known as <b>shoot-through.</b>|$|E
50|$|The USMC is {{currently}} seeking to purchase commercial off-the-shelf bullet-trap or <b>shoot-through</b> rifle-grenades. These grenades will provide individual Marines additional firepower and will allow indirect fire against targets in defilade, behind walls and buildings or rooftops and elevated positions at ranges between 30 and 150 meters.|$|E
50|$|Umbrellas with a {{reflective}} inside {{are used by}} photographers as a diffusion device when employing artificial lighting, and as a glare shield and shade, most often in portrait situations. Some umbrellas are <b>shoot-through</b> umbrellas, meaning the light goes through the umbrella and is diffused, rather than reflecting off {{the inside of the}} umbrella.|$|E
50|$|A further {{variation}} is the half-controlled bridge, where the low-side switching device {{on one side}} of the bridge, and the high-side switching device on the opposite side of the bridge, are each replaced with diodes. This eliminates the <b>shoot-through</b> failure mode, and is commonly used to drive variable or switched reluctance machines and actuators where bi-directional current flow is not required.|$|E
5000|$|Frangible: Designed to {{disintegrate}} into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration {{for reasons of}} range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the <b>shoot-through</b> danger behind the intended target. An example is the Glaser Safety Slug, usually a pistol caliber bullet made from an amalgam of lead shot and a hard (and thus frangible) plastic binder designed to penetrate a human target and release its component shot pellets without exiting the target.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, it is {{necessary}} to allow a small interval between powering the transformer one way and powering it the other: the “switches” are usually pairs of transistors (or similar devices), and were the two transistors in the pair to switch simultaneously there would be a risk of shorting out the power supply. Hence, a small wait is needed to avoid this problem. This wait time is called [...] "Dead Time" [...] and {{is necessary}} to avoid transistor <b>shoot-through.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I and the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920 the Polish Army {{used a variety of}} World War I rifle grenade launchers and light mortars, notably the German World War I-vintage light mortar pressed into Polish service under the designation of Granatnik wz. 16 and the French <b>shoot-through</b> rifle grenade launcher of Vivien and Bessières system designed for the ageing Berthier rifle. While battle-tested, these weapons were neither accurate nor did they offer enough fire support on a modern battlefield.|$|E
5000|$|The cup-type {{launcher}} has {{the advantage}} of using standard hand-grenades. However, the need to load a blank cartridge into the rifle's chamber in order to launch the grenade proved to be clumsy in combat. This difficulty lead to the development the French [...] "Vivien and Bessières" [...] <b>shoot-through</b> grenade (or VB grenade). As the name implies, these grenades allow for the use of live ammunition. The VB grenade has a hole through the middle that permits the passage of a standard bullet; this arms the grenade, the expanding gasses launch the grenade, and the grenade explodes 8 seconds later. This removes the need to provide a special blank round to launch the grenade. To use: ...|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "spill fill" [...] {{refers to}} fill light which {{results from the}} {{footprint}} of light sources bouncing off surfaces in the shooting environment. It can, if not observed and understood, lead to erroneous assumptions about lighting strategies and modifier choices. For example, a difference between a softbox and <b>shoot-through</b> umbrella of identical size used in a small reflective space is that the softbox is designed to limit spill and the shoot through umbrella to maximize it. The umbrella will appear to [...] "wrap" [...] the light more, {{but in terms of}} actual cause and effect the [...] "wrap" [...] effect results from the light bouncing off ceiling and walls back into the shadows created by the key light from many different directions.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{significant}} {{design challenges}} for MOSFET driver circuits in class-D amplifiers are keeping dead times and linear mode operation {{as short as}} possible. [...] "Dead time" [...] is the period during a switching transition when both output MOSFETs are driven into Cut-Off Mode and both are [...] "off". Dead times need to be as short as possible to maintain an accurate low-distortion output signal, but dead times that are too short cause the MOSFET that is switching on to start conducting before the MOSFET that is switching off has stopped conducting. The MOSFETs effectively short the output power supply through themselves in a condition known as [...] "shoot-through". Meanwhile, the MOSFET drivers also need to drive the MOSFETs between switching states {{as fast as possible}} to minimize the amount of time a MOSFET is in Linear Mode—the state between Cut-Off Mode and Saturation Mode where the MOSFET is neither fully on nor fully off and conducts current with a significant resistance, creating significant heat. Driver failures that allow <b>shoot-through</b> and/or too much linear mode operation result in excessive losses and sometimes catastrophic failure of the MOSFETs.|$|E
50|$|Impedance (Z-) Source {{networks}} {{provide an}} efficient means of power conversion between source and load {{in a wide}} range of electric power conversion applications (dc-dc, dc-ac, ac-dc, ac- ac) 3, 4. Z-source-related research has grown rapidly since it was first proposed in 2002 by Prof. F. Z. Peng. A comprehensive pulse width modulation scheme for Z-source inverters was proposed by Prof. P. C. Loh and Prof. D. M. Vilathgamuwa 10. The numbers of modifications and new Z-source topologies have grown exponentially. Improvements to the impedance networks by introducing coupled magnetics have also been lately proposed for achieving even higher voltage boosting, while using a shorter <b>shoot-through</b> time 6. They include the Γ-source, T-source, trans-Zsource, TZ-source, LCCT-Z-source (proposed in 2011 by Dr Marek Adamowicz and utilizing high frequency transformer connected in series with two dc-current-blocking capacitors) 16, high-frequency transformer-isolated, and Y-source 5 networks. Among them, the Y-source network (proposed in year 2013 by Dr Yam P. Siwakoti) is more versatile and can in fact be viewed as the generic network, from which the Γ-source, T-source, and trans-Z-source networks are derived 6. The incommensurate properties of this network open a new horizon to researchers and engineers to explore, expand, and modify the circuit for a wide range of power conversion applications.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, Simulaser Corporation {{was founded}} by two {{entrepreneur}} engineers and began operations near Los Angeles to develop [...] "Advanced MILES" [...] training systems. Under initial contracts from Sandia National Labs, Simulaser produced standard MILES replacement laser transmitters and man-worn detector systems as well as [...] "Advanced MILES" [...] devices that incorporated player identification and scoring systems. These Advanced MILES systems made use of the CMOS 146800-series embedded controllers that had just become available at that time. The systems interleaved unique player identification codes within the weapon code bits transmitted by the laser, which were then stored by the receiver system of any player that was hit. Those systems utilized a controller gun to initialize each player, thus preventing players from [...] "resurrecting" [...] themselves by re-inserting the yellow weapon key. Each player's data was stored in memory until downloaded by the controller unit {{at the conclusion of}} the training exercise. Simulaser made use of hybrid microcircuits to reduce the size of certain components and eliminated the electronic module on the back of the helmet to improve player comfort. Simulaser also manufactured laser detector components and systems for vehicle applications sold to Sandia Labs and EG&G Inc., the operations and maintenance contractor at Kirtland AFB for use in training guards and couriers. Simulaser was acquired by Applied Solar Energy Corp. (ASEC, City of Industry, CA), its major supplier of silicon detectors, in 1984. Later, under contract from Fairchild-Weston Systems, Simulaser produced the laser and detector systems for the AGES/ADII (Air-to-Ground Engagement System/Air Defense II) program for the US Army, outfitting a number of helicopters with training systems and producing laser simulators for the HGSS/GVLLD (Hellfire Ground Support System Simulator/Ground-based Vehicle Laser Locator Designator). Simulaser also produced the early low rate of production run of MITS (Multiple Independent Target System) and in 1989 won a development contract from the US Army for STOM (<b>Shoot-through</b> Obscuration Miles) that utilized long-wavelength lasers instead of semiconductor lasers in order to penetrate battlefield obscurants. Late in 1989, Simulaser was awarded a $35 million production contract for standard MILES gear, subsequently increased to $44 million, following which Loral Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., acquired the business of Simulaser from ASEC in October 1989, after which Simulaser ceased to exist..|$|E

One advantage of the technique is it minimizes switching losses in the converter by minimizing the number of switching commutations of the active devices in the intermediate H-bridge. The duration of the active and <b>shoot-through</b> states are independently controllable, allowing the <b>shoot-through</b> duty cycle to reach its maximum limit (D st, max = 0. 5), thus enabling a high voltage gain suitable for applications with renewable energy sources (fuel cells, photovoltaics) and other applications requiring a large voltage boost.

40|$|A novel {{direct control}} of high {{performance}} bidirectional quasi-Z-source inverter (HPB-QZSI), with optimized controllable <b>shoot-through</b> insertion, {{to improve the}} voltage gain, efficiency and to reduce total harmonic distortion is investigated. The main drawback of the conventional control techniques for direct current to alternating current (DC-AC) conversion is drawn from the multistage energy conversion structure, which implies complicated control, protection algorithms and reduced reliability due to the increased number of switching devices. Theoretically, the original Z-source, Quasi-Z-source, and embedded Z-source all have unlimited voltage gain. Practically, however, a high voltage gain (> 2 or 3), {{will result in a}} high voltage stress imposed on the switches. Every additional <b>shoot-through</b> state increases the commutation time of the semiconductor switches, thereby increasing the switching losses in the system. Hence, minimization of the commutation time by optimal placing of the <b>shoot-through</b> state in the switching time period is necessary to reduce the switching loss. To overcome this problem, a combination of high performance bidirectional quasi-Z-source inverter with a sawtooth carrier based sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) in simple operation condition for maximum boost control with 3 rd harmonic injection is proposed. This is achieved by voltage-fed quasi-Z-source inverter with continuous input current, implemented at the converter input side which can boost the input voltage by utilizing the extra switching state with the help of <b>shoot-through</b> state insertion technique. This thesis presents novel control concepts for such a structure, focusing mainly on the control of a <b>shoot-through</b> insertion. The work considers the derivation and application of direct controllers for this application and scrutinizes the technical advantages and potential application issues of these methodologies. Based on the circuit analysis, a small signal model of the HPB-QZSI is derived, which indicates that the circuit is prone to oscillate when there is disturbance on the direct current (DC) input voltage. Therefore, a closed-loop control of <b>shoot-through</b> duty cycle is designed to obtain the desired DC bus voltage. The DC-link boost control and alternating current (AC) side output control are presented to reduce the impacts of disturbances on loads. The proposed strategy gives a significantly high voltage gain compared to the conventional pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques, since all the zero states are converted into <b>shoot-through</b> states. The simulated results verify the validity and superiority of the proposed control strategies...|$|E
