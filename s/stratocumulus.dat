5|$|A <b>stratocumulus</b> cloud {{is another}} type of a {{cumuliform}} or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, <b>stratocumulus</b> clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. <b>Stratocumulus</b> clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, <b>stratocumulus</b> is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise <b>stratocumulus</b> (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E

The line of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were scrambled to intercept the bombers in front of, or over the target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths <b>stratocumulus</b> at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet.

5|$|On August 26, the {{tropical}} cyclone {{that was once}} Hurricane Ilsa degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area, about 1,200miles (1,950km) west of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The remnants of Ilsa drifted northwestward through the <b>stratocumulus</b> cloud field of the eastern north Pacific Ocean. At the same time, a mid-tropospheric trough slowly intensified while gradually undergoing cyclogenesis to develop into a cold-core upper-level low. Early on August 31, a low-level circulation formed within the upper-level low about 930 miles (1,500 km) northeast of Hawaii; at that time, the circulation and the remnants of Ilsa were located within 370 miles (600 km) of each other. The cold-core low rapidly intensified as convection increased, and late on August 31 it absorbed the remnants of Ilsa, which influenced the development of the system. Convection steadily organized as it tracked westward, and it is estimated it transitioned into a subtropical depression by 18:00 UTC on September 1.|$|E
5|$|As Fefa turned {{more to the}} west, it paralleled {{the cooler}} waters, {{allowing}} the eye to remain distinct as the hurricane remained well-organized. Despite moving over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and becoming involved with the <b>Stratocumulus</b> cloud field to its north, the hurricane restrengthened on August 4 to reach a secondary peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h) while located about 1,265miles (2,070km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawai'i. After maintaining 105mph (170km/h) winds for about 18hours, Fefa weakened slightly due to increasing wind shear from a cold-core trough as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center area of responsibility. As the shear increased, the cyclone weakened more rapidly, and on August 6 it weakened to a tropical storm while located about 650miles (1,060km) east of the island of Hawaii. Initially, forecasters predicted Fefa {{to turn to the}} northwest {{to the north of the}} Hawaiian Islands. However, the storm continued moving almost due westward as it steadily weakened. Aircraft reconnaissance flew into Fefa three times as it neared Hawaii. Late on August 7, Fefa weakened to a tropical depression a short distance of the island of Hawaii, and early on August 8 the depression began dissipating and degenerated into a tropical wave after moving onshore. The remnants tracked west-northwestward and passed south of the Hawaiian Islands until dissipating on August 9 to the northwest of Kauai.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} moved northward over the Yellow Sea, {{atmospheric}} conditions became increasingly hostile, with significantly lower sea surface temperatures and high wind shear. During the overnight of August2728, the typhoon brushed South Korea as a weakening cyclone. Convection {{on the west}} side of the storm diminished and its feeder bands began to collapse. Increasing shear started taking its toll early on August28 as convection became displaced from the center of circulation, leaving part of the southwestern quadrant exposed. This also indicated that Bolaven had begun to undergo an extratropical transition as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Following structural weakening, the JMA and JTWC downgraded Bolaven to a severe tropical storm and tropical storm, respectively. Hours before moving onshore in North Korea, the majority of the convection had moved over land while the circulation and the center itself had only <b>stratocumulus</b> clouds covering it. Around 1500UTC on August28, Bolaven made landfall in North Korea with winds of 100km/h (65mph). Rapidly moving towards the northeast, the storm became fully embedded within a baroclinic zone near the ChinaNorth Korea border later that day. The JMA continued to monitor Bolaven as a tropical cyclone until early on August29, at which time the system was situated over the southern region of the Russian Far East. The extratropical remnants later turned eastward and were last noted on September1 crossing the International Dateline.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the pressure-scrambling terms (i. e., the pressure-strain and pressure gradient-scalar covariances) in the Reynolds-stress and scalar-flux budgets for cloud-topped boundary layers (CTBLs) is performed using high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES). Two CTBLs are simulated — one with trade wind shallow cumuli, and the other with nocturnal marine <b>stratocumuli.</b> The pressure-scrambling terms are decomposed into contributions due to turbulence-turbulence interactions, mean velocity shear, buoyancy, and Coriolis effects. Commonly used models of these contributions, including a simple linear model most often used in geophysical applications and a more sophisticated two-component-limit (TCL) nonlinear model, are tested against the LES data. The decomposition of the pressure-scrambling terms shows that the turbulence-turbulence and buoyancy contributions are most significant for cloud-topped boundary layers. The Coriolis contribution is negligible. The shear contribution is generally of minor importance inside the cloudy layers, but it is the leading-order contribution near the surface. A comparison of models of the pressure-scrambling terms with the LES data suggests that the more complex TCL model is superior to the simple linear model only for a few contributions. The linear model is able to reproduce the principal features of the pressure-scrambling terms reasonably well. It can be applied in the second-order turbulence modeling of cloud-topped boundary layer flows, provided some uncertainties are tolerated.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of second-order moment budgets for cloud topped boundary layers (CTBLs) is performed using high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES). Two CTBLs are simulated—one with trade wind shallow cumuli, {{and the other with}} nocturnal marine <b>stratocumuli.</b> Approximations to the ensemble-mean budgets of the Reynolds-stress components, of the fluxes of two quasi-conservative scalars, and of the scalar variances and covariance are computed by averaging the LES data over horizontal planes and over several hundred time steps. Importantly, the subgrid scale contributions to the budget terms are accounted for. Analysis of the LES-based second-moment budgets reveals, among other things, a paramount importance of the pressure scrambling terms in the Reynolds-stress and scalar-flux budgets. The pressure-strain correlation tends to evenly redistribute kinetic energy between the components, leading to the growth of horizontal-velocity variances {{at the expense of the}} vertical-velocity variance which is produced by buoyancy over most of both CTBLs. The pressure gradient-scalar covariances are the major sink terms in the budgets of scalar fluxes. The third-order transport proves to be of secondary importance in the scalar-flux budgets. However, it plays a key role in maintaining budgets of TKE and of the scalar variances and covariance. Results from the second-moment budget analysis suggest that the accuracy of description of the CTBL structure within the second-order closure framework strongly depends on the fidelity of parameterizations of the pressure scrambling terms in the flux budgets and of the third-order transport terms in the variance budgets.

25|$|Clouds {{initially}} form {{in clear}} air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus {{of a newly}} formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a mother cloud. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after {{the appearance of the}} new genus, it is termed a genitus cloud. One example of this is <b>stratocumulus</b> cumulogenitus, a <b>stratocumulus</b> cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift.

40|$|The {{climatology}} {{and recent}} trends of low-level coastal clouds at three sites {{along the northern}} Chilean coast (18. 3 degrees- 23. 4 degrees S) are documented based upon up to 45 years of hourly observations of cloud type, coverage, and heights. Consistent with the subtropical location, cloud types are dominated by <b>stratocumuli</b> having greatest coverage (> 7 oktas) and smaller heights (600 - 750 m) during the nighttime of austral winter and spring. Meridionally, nighttime cloud fraction and cloud-base heights increase from south to north. Long-term trends in mean cloud cover are observed at all sites albeit with a seasonal modulation, with increasing (decreasing) coverage in the spring (fall). Consistent trend patterns are also observed in independent sunshine hour measurements at the same sites. Cloud heights show negative trends of about 100 m decade(- 1) (1995 - 2010), although the onset time of this tendency differs between sites. The positive cloud fraction trends during the cloudy season reported here disagree with previous studies, with discrepancies attributed to differences in datasets used or to methodological differences in data analysis. The cloud-base height tendency, together with a less rapid lowering of the subsidence inversion base height, suggests a deepening of the coastal cloud layer. While consistent with the tendency toward greater low-level cloud cover and the known cooling of the marine boundary layer in this region, these tendencies {{are at odds with}} a drying trend of the near-surface air documented here as well.

40|$|Cloud {{information}} from UV/VIS/NIR spectrometers aboard spacecraft platforms is highly valuable {{for the construction}} of cloud property climatologies, since it is complementary to the information retrieved using IR spectrometers, imagers and active sensors (cloud radars and lidars). Clouds, when present, are the main modulators of the radiation transport across the atmosphere. They are very diverse in terms of composition (ice, liquid water), thickness (thin cirri to thick cumulonimbi), variability (homogeneous <b>stratocumuli</b> to inhomogeneous cumuli), altitude, etc. Consequently, the modeling of the cloud-radiation insteraction {{is one of the most}} challenging tasks in the atmospheric science. The distance that photons travel across the atmosphere before being captured by a spaceborne instrument can be greatly affected by clouds. Absorption by atmospheric molecules is not only proportional to the molecular number density but also to the photon path legth. Therefore, the effects of clouds on the photon path legth is of particular interest in the atmospheric remote sensing. During the retrieval processing, changes in the absorption bands within the spectra are analyzed. These changes can be linked to variations in the molecular number density but also to variations in the photon path legth. Therefore, precise cloud information to correct for variations in the photon path length is mandatory for the accurate retrieval of atmospheric trace gases. The ROCINN algorithm retrieves cloud top height (pressure), cloud optical depth and cloud albedo rom measurements in and around the oxygen A-band (760 nm) taking as input the cloud fraction computed with the OCRA algorithm (a color space approach based on broadband reflectances). This paper presents the latest version of the ROCINN algorithm as implemented to process Sentinel- 5 p, Sentinel- 4 and Sentinel- 5 data. There are two variants of the ROCINN algorithm: one that treats clouds as reflecting boundaries (CRB)) (i. e. Lambertian equivalent reflectors) and a second one that treats louds as scattering layers (CAL). The ROCINN-CRB algorithm has been successfully used operationally for GOME/ERS- 2 and GOME- 2 /MetOp-A and -B instruments since over one decade. The CAL algorithm treats clouds in a more realistic way and provides cloud properties closer to reality. ROCINN V 3. 0 in the CRB and CAL variants have been included into the latest UPAS operational processor and is the baseline algorithm for the generation of cloud products from the atmospheric Sentinels. In this work, we present and analyze preliminary ROCINN cloud properties from S 5 P/TROPOMI, in addition to those from GOME- 2 on both MetOp-A and Metop-B.

40|$|Warm clouds as <b>stratocumuli</b> swathe a {{significant}} part of earth’s surface and {{play a major role in}} the global dynamics of atmosphere by strongly reflecting incoming solar radiation so that an accurate representation of their dynamics is important in large-scale analyses of atmoshperic flows [Wood 2012]. The mixing and entrainment processes at the cloud top have been identified as fundamental to determine the internal structure of warm clouds, so that a clear and complete understanding of their physics is required [Gerber et al 2013]. The aim of this work is to study some of the basic phenomena which occur at a stratified interface focusing on the smallest scales of the flow which influence. These scales are important to understand the global dynamic of clouds, as pointed out by Malinowski et al (2013). To achieve the results, a campaign of high-resolution simulation of the local transport through a dry/moist air were performed by the means of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) using our home produced computational code that implements a de-aliased pseudospectral Fourier-Galerkin spatial discretization and an explicit low storage fourth order Runge-Kutta time integration scheme [Iovieno et al 2001]. We consider the interface between clear air and moist air in a 6 m × 6 m × 12 m parallelepipedic domain coupling two homogeneous and isotropic turbulent regions with different kinetic energy that interact through a mixing layer. The energy ratio is of the same order of the ones measured in warm clouds (see, e. g., [Malinowski et al 2013]) and, furthermore, it allows us to compare our results with experiments on shearless mixing (see [Veeravalli & Warhaft 1989, Tordella & Iovieno 2011]) in absence of any stratification. For each simulation two interfaces have been obtained, one in highly stably stratified condition, and one in unstable condition. The dynamics of interfaces is analyzed through an initial temperature perturbation located across one of the vapor/clear air interfaces thus generating a local stable layer; the water vapor is treated as a passive scalar. The level of stratification is quantified with the Froude number. For the stable cases, the Froude numbers considered ranges from 12. 7 (weak stratification) to 0. 6 (intense stratification), while for the unstable cases Fr^ 2 ranges from - 250 to - 16. In both stable and unstable cases the evolution of the system can be split in two different phases. In the first one, the buoyancy terms are negligible, and there are no significant differences with respect to a non-stratified case. As the system evolves, the effect of stratification becomes relevant (as soon as the stratification is intense). About the unstable case layer we observe a high intermittency and an intense growth rate of the layer, which becomes overdiffusive in the case Fr^ 2 = − 16. In particular, the entrainment, after an initial decay, asimptotically always shows a positive growth rate. Here, for reason of space, we give details about the stably stratified layer which presents a more complex dynamics associated to the onset of a pocket very low turbulent kinetic energy. It can be observed the onset of a sub-layer characterized by the presence of low values of kinetic turbulent energy. At about 8 time scales, we observe the 8 % of the energy in the wapor cloud and the 50 % of the kinetic energy in the clear-air region. A similar trend was also observed in the LES cloud topped boundary layer simulations carried out by using Deardoff TKE model (NCAR group) and by using the ARAP TKE model (WVU group) [Moeng et al 1996]. The presence of such sublayer induces the formation of two local interfaces. Both of these interfaces present an intermittent behavior, and the entrainment (flux of dry air into the moist one) is blocked; the velocity of the moist air front can be considered a characteristic parameter, since the entrainment of clear air is responsible of the growth of the cloud [Mellado 2010, Moeng 2000]. As a consequence, the entrainment of clear air is confined to a thin interfacial layer. Also the dissipative terms inside the pit becomes relatively more important compared to the kinetic energy, making the pit deeper and deeper with respect to the external regions...|$|R

This cloud often forms under a precipitating deck of altostratus or high-based nimbostratus associated with a well-developed warm front, slow-moving cold front, or low-pressure area. This can create the illusion of continuous precipitation of more than very light intensity falling from <b>stratocumulus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stratocumulus</b> clouds can be {{organized}} into [...] "fields" [...] that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics. In general, these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level. They {{can often be}} found in the following forms: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and <b>stratocumulus</b> of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with <b>stratocumulus</b> of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
2500|$|The weather {{conditions}} {{at the time of}} the accident were [...] "dark night due to 7/8 (broken) <b>stratocumulus</b> at [...] and to 8/8 coverage (overcast) by altostratus at [...]" [...] According to the Brazilian Air Ministry, the {{weather conditions}} did not contribute to the accident.|$|E
2500|$|A newly {{recognized}} {{species of}} <b>stratocumulus</b> or altocumulus {{has been given}} the name volutus, a roll cloud that can occur ahead of a cumulonimbus formation. [...] There are some volutus clouds that form {{as a consequence of}} interactions with specific geographical features rather than with a parent cloud. Perhaps the strangest geographically specific cloud of this type is the Morning Glory, a rolling cylindrical cloud that appears unpredictably over the Gulf of Carpentaria in Northern Australia. Associated with a powerful [...] "ripple" [...] in the atmosphere, the cloud may be [...] "surfed" [...] in glider aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Cloud cover {{has been}} seen on most other planets in the solar system. Venus's thick clouds are {{composed}} of sulfur dioxide (due to volcanic activity) and appear to be almost entirely stratiform. They are arranged in three main layers at altitudes of 45 to 65km that obscure the planet's surface and can produce virga. No embedded cumuliform types have been identified, but broken stratocumuliform wave formations are sometimes seen in the top layer that reveal more continuous layer clouds underneath. [...] On Mars, noctilucent, cirrus, cirrocumulus and <b>stratocumulus</b> composed of water-ice have been detected mostly near the poles. [...] Water-ice fogs have also been detected on Mars.|$|E
