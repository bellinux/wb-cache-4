25|$|When a {{specific}} combination of source, analyzer, and detector becomes conventional in practice, a compound acronym may arise to designate it succinctly. One example is MALDI-TOF, {{which refers to}} a combination of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization source with a time-of-flight mass analyzer. Other examples include inductively coupled plasma-mass <b>spectrometry</b> (ICP-MS), accelerator mass <b>spectrometry</b> (AMS), thermal ionization-mass <b>spectrometry</b> (TIMS) and spark source mass <b>spectrometry</b> (SSMS).|$|E
25|$|Mass <b>spectrometry</b> (MS), {{with its}} low sample {{requirement}} and high sensitivity, has been predominantly used in glycobiology for characterization and elucidation of glycan structures. Mass <b>spectrometry</b> provides a complementary method to HPLC {{for the analysis}} of glycans. Intact glycans may be detected directly as singly charged ions by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass <b>spectrometry</b> (MALDI-MS) or, following permethylation or peracetylation, by fast atom bombardment mass <b>spectrometry</b> (FAB-MS). Electrospray ionization mass <b>spectrometry</b> (ESI-MS) also gives good signals for the smaller glycans. Various free and commercial software are now available which interpret MS data and aid in Glycan structure characterization.|$|E
25|$|Capillary electrophoresis–mass <b>spectrometry</b> (CE-MS) is a {{technique}} that combines the liquid separation process of capillary electrophoresis with mass <b>spectrometry.</b> CE-MS is typically coupled to electrospray ionization.|$|E
25|$|Another type of tandem mass <b>spectrometry</b> {{used for}} {{radiocarbon}} dating is accelerator mass <b>spectrometry</b> (AMS), which uses very high voltages, {{usually in the}} mega-volt range, to accelerate negative ions into a type of tandem mass spectrometer.|$|E

25|$|Airborne gamma-ray <b>spectrometry</b> {{is now the}} {{accepted}} leading technique for uranium prospecting with worldwide applications for geological mapping, mineral exploration & environmental monitoring. Airborne gamma-ray <b>spectrometry</b> used specifically for uranium measurement and prospecting must account {{for a number of}} factors like the distance between the source and the detector and the scattering of radiation through the minerals, surrounding earth and even in the air. In Australia, a Weathering Intensity Index has been developed to help prospectors based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation and airborne gamma-ray <b>spectrometry</b> images.|$|E

25|$|Ion {{mobility}} <b>spectrometry</b> (IMS) is {{a technique}} of ion separation in gaseous phases based on their differences in ion mobility when an electric field is applied providing spatial separation prior to MS analysis. With the introduction of DESI as an ion source for ion mobility mass <b>spectrometry,</b> applications for IMS have expanded from only vapor-phase samples with volatile analyses to also in tact structures and aqueous samples. When coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, analysis of proteins is also possible. These techniques work in tandem to one another to investigate ion shapes and reactiveness after ionization. A key characteristic of this setup {{is its ability to}} separate the distribution of ions generated in DESI prior to mass <b>spectrometry</b> analysis.|$|E
25|$|Liquid chromatography–mass <b>spectrometry</b> (LC-MS) is an {{analytical}} chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography (or HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of mass <b>spectrometry</b> (MS). Coupled chromatography - MS systems are popular in chemical analysis because the individual capabilities of each technique are enhanced synergistically. While liquid chromatography separates mixtures with multiple components, mass <b>spectrometry</b> provides structural {{identity of the}} individual components with high molecular specificity and detection sensitivity. This tandem technique {{can be used to}} analyze biochemical, organic, and inorganic compounds commonly found in complex samples of environmental and biological origin. Therefore, LC-MS may be applied {{in a wide range of}} sectors including biotechnology, environment monitoring, food processing, and pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and cosmetic industries.|$|E

25|$|Ultrasound-assisted {{extractive}} electrospray ionization mass <b>spectrometry</b> (EESI-MS) {{has been}} developed at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) by Zhu et al., (2008) for a rapid detection of melamine in untreated food samples. Ultrasounds are used to nebulize the melamine-containing liquids into a fine spray. The spray is then ionised by extractive electrospray ionisation (EESI) and analysed using tandem mass <b>spectrometry</b> (MS/MS). An analysis requires 30 seconds per sample. The limit of detection of melamine is a few nanograms of melamine per gram of milk.|$|E
25|$|Determination of D/H ratio can be {{performed}} {{with a combination of}} different preparation techniques and instruments for different purposes. There are several basic categories of hydrogen isotope measurements: (i) organic hydrogen or water are converted to H2 first, followed by high precision IRMS (Isotope-ratio mass <b>spectrometry)</b> measurement with high precisions; (ii) D/H and 18O/16O are directly measured as H2O by laser spectroscopy also with high precisions; (iii) the intact molecules are directly measured by NMR or mass <b>spectrometry</b> with relatively lower precision than IRMS.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of mass <b>spectrometry</b> is {{as a tool}} for chemical analyses based on detection and quantification of ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. However, mass <b>spectrometry</b> also shows promise for material synthesis. Ion soft landing is characterized by deposition of intact species on surfaces at low kinetic energies which precludes the fragmentation of the incident species. The soft landing technique was first reported in 1977 for the reaction of low energy sulfur containing ions on a lead surface.|$|E
