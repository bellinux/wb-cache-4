AIM: To analyse the differences between Androgen Receptor (AR) expression in both epithelial and <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> in PCa and the surrounding benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and to compare the results with tumour grade. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples from 70 cases of radical prostatectomy specimens were used.

40|$|Recognizing that uterine <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> {{regulate}} several uter-ine {{epithelial cell}} function(s), {{the current study}} was undertak-en to more fully define cell-cell communication in the uterus and to examine the role of uterine <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> in regulating epithelial cell monolayer integrity and cytokine release. Uter-ine epithelial and <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> from adult intact mice were isolated and cultured separately on cell culture inserts and/or in culture plates. Epithelial cells, which reach confluence as indicated by high transepithelial resistance (TER. 1000 ohms/ well), preferentially release transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) into the basolateral chamber (ø 70 %. apical) and tu-mor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) into the apical compartment (ø 30 %. basolateral). When epithelial cells on cell culture inserts were transferred to plates containing <b>stromal</b> <b>cells,</b> co-culture for 24 – 48 h increased epithelial cell TER (ø 70 % higher than control) and decreased TNFa release into both the apical and basolateral chambers (ø 30 %– 50 %). In contrast, TGFb re-lease was not affected by the presence of <b>stromal</b> <b>cells.</b> In other studies, the effects of <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> on epithelial cell TER and TNFa release persisted for 5 – 7 days following the removal of <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> and were also seen in coculture studies in which conditioned stromal media (CSM) was placed in the basolateral chamber. These studies indicate that uterine <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> pro-duce a soluble factor(s) that regulates epithelial cell TER and release of TNFa without effecting TGFb release. These results suggest that uterine <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> communicate with epithelial cells via a soluble factor(s) to maintain uterine integrity and epithelial secretory function. cytokines, female reproductive tract, immunology, uteru...|$|R
40|$|The cyclic {{changes in}} the {{presence}} of the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin in endometrial <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> was studied by immunohistochemistry. The interstitial matrix around the <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> of the proliferative phase of the normal menstrual cycle was unreactive with antibodies to laminin. However, commencing with the secretory phase, <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> accumulated distinct cytoplasmic and pericellular laminin-immunoreactive material. The maximal amount of stromal cell-associated laminin was observed in predecidual cells of the late secretory phase. Thus, laminin immunostaining discriminates <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> of the proliferative phase (being "negative") from those in the secretory phase (being "positive"). Sixty-six cases of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinomas were also stained with antibodies to laminin. Sixty-nine percent of biopsies of cystic hyperplasia and 30 % of adenomatous hyperplasia contained laminin-positive <b>stromal</b> <b>cells.</b> Ultrastructural examination of <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> in cystic hyperplasia revealed the presence of pericellular basement membrane-like material, focally arranged into typical lamina rara and lamina densa. In contrast, <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> in the atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinomas did not react with antibody to laminin. The expression of laminin receptor in the <b>stromal</b> <b>cells</b> codistributed with laminin. Basement membranes of the surface epithelium, the glandular epithelium, and the vessels stained strongly with antibodies to laminin. In preneoplastic and neoplastic tissues, laminin immunostaining revealed discontinuous and defective basement membranes. In poorly differentiated carcinomas only sparse amounts of laminin-positive basement membrane were observed; these tumors, in contrast, exhibited cytoplasmic laminin and also significant immunoreaction with antibodies to laminin receptor...|$|R
