5|$|After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until {{crashing}} {{in central}} France; {{he returned home}} to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, he rode in the road world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes {{on the right side}} of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. <b>Simpson</b> <b>had</b> been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races.

5|$|One of Simpson's first tasks was {{to confer}} with the Chief Signals Officer at General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area, Brigadier General Spencer B. Akin. The two {{established}} mechanisms to divide responsibility for the theatre's communications between the two armies, which often worked together on the same projects. An important outcome of their first meeting {{was the creation of}} the Central Bureau as a combined signals intelligence organisation. <b>Simpson</b> <b>had</b> been thinking about such an organisation while on the Orcades. Blamey had an appreciation of signals intelligence from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and readily gave his support. After a slow start, signals intelligence became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{following}} {{a move to}} Epic Records, Simpson released her fifth studio album, A Public Affair. The album debuted and peaked at number 5 in the US and was certified gold by the RIAA. A Public Affair has sold just over 500,000 copies in the US and spawned three singles.

5|$|Simpson's primary {{objective}} for 1967 was overall {{victory in the}} Tour de France; in preparation, he planned to ride stage races instead of one-day classics. Simpson felt his chances were good because this Tour was contested by national, rather than professional teams. He would lead the British team, which– although one of the weakest– would support him totally, unlike Peugeot. During Simpson's previous three years with Peugeot, he was only guaranteed a place on their Tour team if he signed with them for the following year. Free to join a new team for the 1968 season, he was offered at least ten contracts; <b>Simpson</b> <b>had</b> a verbal agreement with Italian team Salvarani, and would share its leadership with Felice Gimondi. In an interview with Cycling (now Cycling Weekly) journalist, Ken Evans, in April, Simpson revealed his intention to attempt the hour record in the 1967 season. He also said he wanted retire from road racing aged 33, to ride on the track and {{spend more time with}} his family.|$|E

5|$|Within the year, Edward {{caused a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by announcing {{his desire to}} marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against {{the teaching of the}} Anglican church, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings. <b>Simpson</b> <b>had</b> been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately. She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.|$|E

25|$|A women's shelter, Sojourn, {{received}} a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, whom she believed was stalking her.

In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that <b>Simpson</b> <b>had</b> been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson would be there, watching her. Her friends Faye Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because <b>Simpson</b> <b>had</b> told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.|$|E
