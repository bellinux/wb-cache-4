5|$|According to Vrba's memoir, a Polish kapo by {{the name}} of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was {{part of a group of}} prisoners who were {{building}} a new railway line that would lead <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crematoria. Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami. He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E

5|$|Gaskins City – Includes a {{small village}} annexed in 1905, named for the Gaskins family of Harrisburg, {{prominent}} business owners and coal entrepreneurs of the Egyptian Coal Company, later sold to O'Gara. Gaskins City {{is a series of}} several blocks that exists to the east of the Harrisburg Levee and Route 45. Sloan Street crosses Route 45, runs <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> center of Gaskins City and terminates at the Harrisburg Medical Center. It contains Gaskins City Baptist Church, Shawnee Hills Country Club, and is an upper-class neighborhood. It used to have its own school at one time. A large part of Gaskins City was obliterated by the 2012 EF4 Tornado. Part of Harrisburg Medical Center was also heavily damaged.|$|E
5|$|He went <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{first team}} as {{replacement}} for Frank Mitchell {{who had joined}} Chelsea earlier that month, and made his debut in a goalless draw away at Preston North End. In the 1949–50 season, his first full season with Birmingham, he established himself in the first team {{but was unable to}} prevent his new team's relegation to the Second Division. When Fred Harris retired {{at the end of that}} season, manager Bob Brocklebank appointed Boyd as his successor as club captain, a post which he retained for the remainder of his Birmingham career.|$|E
5|$|In the {{moonlight}} of 3 October just before midnight Mansell {{was on the}} lookout for Spinola's galleys and were soon sighted. Mansell ordered an attack and off Dungeness; Moon, Samson and the Answer charged at the galleys. Spinola seeing this decided to swing his galleys round to face the South East, the direction of the Flanders coast but in so doing the lead ship San Felipe (St. Philip) ran <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Victory and Hope forcing the galleys inadvertently further East.|$|E

5|$|Stenson {{originally}} auditioned to play {{a friend}} of the established character Zara Morgan (Kelly Greenwood). Although unsuccessful, the Hollyoaks casting team later asked her to apply for the new role of Steph Cunningham, and placed her <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> final stage of auditions. She was delighted to subsequently be given the part, which was her first major television role. Stenson joined the cast straight after leaving high school, aged seventeen. She made her first appearance in March 2000, and by 2007 had become the longest-serving female cast member remaining.|$|E
5|$|The GWR {{provided}} special wagons, {{handling equipment}} and storage facilities for its largest traffic flows. For example, the coal mines in Wales sent {{much of their}} coal to the docks along the coast, {{many of which were}} owned and equipped by the railway, as were some in Cornwall that exported most of the china clay production of that county. The wagons provided for both these traffic flows (both those owned by the GWR and the mining companies) were fitted with end doors that allowed their loads to be tipped <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ships' holds using wagon-tipping equipment on the dockside. Special wagons were produced for many other different commodities such as gunpowder, aeroplanes, milk, fruit and fish.|$|E
5|$|The high US {{demand for}} {{tickets for the}} tour, and the {{difficulty}} which some fans had in getting them, brought attention to rapidity with which tickets turned up on the higher-priced secondary market. Some tickets were being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} holding back tickets from general sale and delivering them <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> secondary market, Live Nation said that U2 did not engage in this practice.|$|E

5|$|Burge {{moved to}} Championship club Doncaster Rovers on a {{short-term}} deal on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2011. He made his Doncaster debut as a second-half substitute in a 6–0 home defeat to Ipswich Town on 15 February 2011. That {{was to be}} his only appearance for the club. On 17 March 2011, Burge joined League Two team Oxford United on loan {{for the rest of}} the season, after impressing in a reserve game against Colchester United which Oxford won 2–0. He went <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> starting line-up for the match against Crewe Alexandra two days later, and provided the assist for James Constable's winning goal. His first performance at Oxford received praise in the local media. A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off his heel on its way into the net for what would have been his first Football League goal. In mid-April 2011 he was recalled by Doncaster, and a few weeks later they offered him a new deal.|$|E
5|$|Hassett came in {{with the}} score at 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10. The next day, the pair took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389. When England batted again, Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 40 with an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{signed for}} Second Division club Leicester City on 2 March 1989 {{as part of}} the deal that saw Phil Turner join County for a fee of £125,000, with over two months of 1988–89 remaining. He slotted <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{starting}} line-up, making his debut two days after joining in a 1–0 victory at home to Walsall. He made 13 consecutive appearances for Leicester before missing the last two matches of 1988–89, his new club finishing 15th in the Second Division. His first goal for Leicester was the only goal in a 1–0 win away to Stoke City on 25 November 1989. Other than a spell out of the team from early September to mid November 1989, Mills was a regular in the Leicester team that ranked 13th place in the Second Division in 1989–90, making 30 appearances and scoring four goals. He established himself as a popular player with the supporters, and was named the club's Player of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Nakano lost grip in {{the front}} of his vehicle and went <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turn four wall on the same lap. He heavily damaged his car's {{right-hand}} side prompting a third caution. Nakano slid through the infield and stopped unhurt on the frontstretch. Bräck led the field back up to speed at the lap-70 restart, with Takagi in second. Green-flag pit stops began on lap 94, with Bräck stopping on the same lap and Franchitti became the leader. It was part of Franchitti's strategy, devised by his team manager Kyle Moyer, to drive in clean air. Andretti was required to serve a stop-and-go penalty, which he took on the 103rd lap, after he was observed speeding in the pit lane. Franchitti made his pit stop four laps later and Manning took over first place. Manning made his pit stop on lap 114 and Bräck reclaimed the lead. After starting from 16th, Dixon was running in sixth place by the 126th lap. He served two stop-and-go penalties because he was twice observed exceeding the pit lane speed limit, while Domínguez was similarly penalised.|$|E
5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened {{all the way back to}} the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) headed <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the race}} were overshadowed by {{speculation}} over IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard's job, after he tweeted that some team owners {{were trying to get}} him fired. Dixon claimed pole position {{for the race}}, the first IndyCar event in Detroit since 2008, and maintained his lead throughout the race. After 38 laps, James Hinchcliffe hit a dislodged piece of the track and continued <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tire wall. Further investigation discovered that the track was disintegrating in various places, and the event was red flagged. After a two-hour break, in which track officials ripped out the damaged sections of track and filled the holes with concrete, the race was restarted, shortened to 60 laps. Rain also started to fall lightly, and shortly after the restart a caution was issued when Hélio Castroneves spun. Dario Franchitti gained four places after the red flag, benefiting from his softer red tires, to finish second behind his teammate.|$|E

5|$|The Master {{spends most}} of his time {{drinking}} alcohol, and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home, where no dogs are allowed. One summer, an outbreak of rabies spreads through the fox population. After one infected fox attacks a group of human children, the same people approach the Master and ask his help in killing the foxes. He uses traps and poison to try to kill as many foxes as possible; however, the poison also kills domestic animals. After a human child dies from eating it, the humans remove all of the poison, then the Master organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods, flushing out foxes to be shot. The aging Tod escapes all three events, as well as an attempt at coursing him with greyhounds.|$|E
5|$|The action {{continued}} {{across the}} Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk, Nieuwpoort, Gravelines and Sluis. The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon {{cut off the}} Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship Mackerel (Makreel), came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe, pouring in a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the galley found herself close to Vice-Admiral Cant's Half Moon (Halve Maene). The galley tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results. The Halve Maene bore straight down upon the galley and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop. Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waist. Another State's galliot bore down to complete the work; San Felipe sunk quickly carrying with her all the galley slaves, sailors, and soldiers.|$|E
5|$|A Company moved south, shaking {{out into}} an open {{formation}} across a frontage of , with 2 Platoon {{on the right and}} 3 Platoon on the left, while 1 Platoon was in depth. Already in the dense vegetation, 2 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Graham Ackland—had only advanced 150metres when a sniper was spotted in a tree and was subsequently shot by the platoon sergeant. Almost simultaneously, 3 Platoon was engaged with small arms fire, while behind them the company headquarters was engaged by more snipers. 2 Platoon assaulted <b>straight</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main Viet Cong position with grenades and machine-guns. Breaking-in they moved forward, killing a number of Viet Cong in their weapon pits but suffering six casualties in less than a minute, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys. Pinned down and in trouble, Ackland realised that he was facing a sizable and well dug-in force and he attempted to move his sections into an all-round defensive perimeter in order to defend against any counter-attack; the Viet Cong did not attack however and instead remained in their pits. In an attempt to relieve 2 Platoon, O'Brien manoeuvred 1 and 3 Platoons, while requesting B Company support his right flank as soon as they arrived at the landing zone.|$|E
