5000|$|<b>Snuff's</b> {{image as}} an aristocratic luxury {{attracted}} the first U.S. federal tax on tobacco, created in 1794. Despite {{two centuries of}} pipe smoking and <b>snuff</b> use, by the mid-1850s, North Americans rejected European practices in general -- especially British practices -- that entailed <b>snuff</b> boxes and formality. By the late 1700s, taking <b>snuff</b> nasally {{had fallen out of}} fashion in the United States. Instead, dry <b>snuff</b> users would use a twig as a brush to [...] "dip" [...] the <b>snuff,</b> which then involved placing the <b>snuff</b> inside the cheek. This is seen as a precursor to dipping tobacco (moist <b>snuff)</b> use which is still very much popular today. In addition, orally chewing tobacco or dipping <b>snuff</b> was more convenient for Americans trekking westward in their wagons. During the 1800s until the mid-1930s, a communal <b>snuff</b> box was installed for members of the US Congress. American <b>snuff</b> is subject to the same warning labels on all smokeless tobacco, indicating a possibility of oral cancer and tooth loss. This reflects the fact that American dry <b>snuff</b> users may still use the product orally, unlike the majority of Europe, but nasal use of <b>snuff</b> is also practiced by some users. Dry <b>snuff</b> is typically not readily available outside of the South and Appalachia, unlike its successor, dipping tobacco (moist <b>snuff),</b> which is available throughout the United States and is much more widely consumed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Snuff</b> bottles {{were used}} by the Chinese, Mongolians during the Qing Dynasty to contain {{powdered}} tobacco. Smoking tobacco was illegal during the Qing Dynasty, {{but the use of}} <b>snuff</b> was allowed because the Chinese considered <b>snuff</b> to be a remedy for common illnesses such as colds, headaches and stomach disorders. Therefore, <b>snuff</b> was carried in a small bottle like other medicines. The <b>snuff</b> bottle replaced the <b>snuff</b> box used by Europeans.|$|R

5000|$|Dipping tobacco {{evolved from}} the use of dry <b>snuff</b> in early American history. Up until the late 1700s, dry <b>snuff</b> was taken nasally, but then early Americans would take <b>snuff</b> orally by chewing the end of a twig until it resembled a brush, and then [...] "dipping" [...] the twig in the <b>snuff</b> and placing it in their mouths until the <b>snuff</b> dissolved.

(It {{should also be noted that}} the term smokeless tobacco itself is a broad one which, while generally referring to all tobacco products which do not require smoking (e.g. nasal <b>snuff,</b> chewing tobacco, snus, etc.), is popularly used to refer specifically to dipping tobacco.)

40|$|<b>Snuff</b> (Findlay/Nuchtern, 1976) {{might not}} be the 'best' film {{produced}} in the Americas in the 1970 s, but it may be the decade's most important 'worst' film. Rumoured to depict the actual murder of a female crewmember in its final moments, its notoriety consolidated the urban legend of <b>snuff</b> film. The <b>snuff</b> film legacy has manifested across a broad range of media, from fictional <b>snuff</b> narratives like Vacancy (Nimrod Antal, 2007) and 8 mm (Joel Schumacher, 1999), to purportedly real <b>snuff</b> footage distributed online and through mobile phones. Despite <b>Snuff's</b> status as a unique trash artefact, the suddenness with which the controversy exploded into the public arena allowed it very little time for a 'micro' analytical moment. [1] The <b>snuff</b> film enigma was so intoxicatingly extra-diegetic that it instantly transcended the nuts-and-bolts details of the film itself.

40|$|The use of Swedish oral moist <b>snuff</b> is a {{widespread}} habit in Sweden. In 1999, 25 % of the adult male population and 3. 1 % of the female population were users of <b>snuff.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate how variations in pH and nicotine concentrations of <b>snuff</b> affect the oral mucosa, clinically and histologically, salivary pH and daily nicotine intake in 20 habitual users of loose <b>snuff.</b> The subjects were studied during use of their usual brand, after 12 weeks use of a <b>snuff</b> with lower pH and after another 12 weeks use of a <b>snuff</b> with both lower pH and lower nicotine concentration. Consumption data, oral soft tissue changes, salivary pH and nicotine intake were meas-ured. Further, biopsies were taken from the central part of the clinically observed lesions and histological changes were analysed. The subjects maintained their <b>snuff</b> consumption during the observation periods. The average salivary pH was higher during <b>snuff</b> use than in the morning. Further, it was higher shortly after the <b>snuff</b> was removed than during <b>snuff</b> use. After having switched to the <b>snuff</b> with both lower pH and lower nicotine concentrations, they showed a significant reduction in daily nicotine intake and developed significantly less pronounced clinical and histological changes. These results indicate that nicotine is one of the substances in <b>snuff</b> that has a biological effect on the oral mucosa. However, there also seems to be a synergistic effect between the pH and nicotine concentration in the <b>snuff...</b>|$|R

50|$|By the 18th century, <b>snuff</b> {{had become}} the tobacco product of choice among the elite. <b>Snuff</b> use reached a peak in England {{during the reign of}} Queen Anne (1702-14). It was during this time that England's own {{production}} of ready-made <b>snuff</b> blends started, home-made blending was common. Prominent <b>snuff</b> users included Pope Benedict XIII who repealed the smoking ban set by Pope Urban VIII; King George III's wife Queen Charlotte, referred to as 'Snuffy Charlotte', who had an entire room at Windsor Castle devoted to her <b>snuff</b> stock; and King George IV, who had his own special blends and hoarded a stockpile of <b>snuff.</b> Napoleon, Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Marie Antoinette, Alexander Pope, Samuel Johnson and Benjamin Disraeli all used <b>snuff,</b> as well as numerous other notable persons.
