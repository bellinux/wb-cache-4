40|$|A multi-sided hole in {{a surface}} can be filled by a {{sequence}} of nested, smoothly joined surface rings. We show how to generate such a sequence so that (i) the resulting surface is C 2 (also in the limit), (ii) the rings consist of <b>standard</b> <b>splines</b> of moderate degree and (iii) the hole filling closely follows the shape of and replaces a guide surface whose good shape is desirable, but whose representation is undesirable. To preserve the shape, the guided rings sample position and higher-order derivatives of the guide surface at parameters defined and weighted by a concentric tesselating map. A concentric tesselating map maps the domains of n patches to an annulus in R 2 that joins smoothly with a λ-scaled copy of itself, 0 < λ < 1. The union of λ m-scaled copies parametrizes a neighborhood of the origin and the map thereby relates the domains of the surface rings {{to that of the}} guide. The approach applies to and is implemented for a variety of splines and layouts including the three-direction box spline (with ∆-sprocket, e. g. Loop layout, at extraordinary points), tensor-product splines (□-sprocket layout, e. g. Catmull-Clark), and polar layout. For different patch types and layout, the approach results in curvature continuous surfaces of degree less or equal 8, less or equal to (6, 6), and as low as (4, 3) if we allow geometric continuity. ...|$|E

The {{increase in the}} number N[subscript: H] of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all N[subscript: H], despite having vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the higher order B-splines, allowing large N[subscript: H] and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs rise sublinear with N[subscript: H]).

In this paper, we propose a novel and natural haptic interface and present a physics-based geometric modeling approach that supports the interactive sculpting of spline-based virtual material. Our desktop modeling system permits both expert and non-expert users to interactively deform virtual materials with real properties using force feedback. Using commercially available (and low-cost) haptic devices, modelers can feel the physically realistic presence of virtual spline objects such as B-splines throughout the design process. Our haptics-based B-spline is a special case of more powerful dynamic NURBS (D-NURBS) models.

This allows for an exact implementation of the ramp filter and improves the image quality by an additional 0. 2 dB. This comparison is unique as the first method has been published only for degree n 0, whereas the two other methods are novel.

40|$|The {{detailed}} {{shapes of}} spectral line profiles provide valuable {{information about the}} emitting plasma, especially when the plasma contains an unresolved mixture of velocities, temperatures, and densities. As a result of finite spectral resolution, the intensity measured by a spectrometer is the average intensity across a wavelength bin of non-zero size. It is assigned to the wavelength position {{at the center of}} the bin. However, the actual intensity at that discrete position will be different if the profile is curved, as it invariably is. <b>Standard</b> fitting routines (<b>spline,</b> Gaussian, etc.) do not account for this difference, and this can result in significant errors when making sensitive measurements. Detection of asymmetries in solar coronal emission lines is one example. Removal of line blends is another. We have developed an iterative procedure that corrects for this effect. It can be used with any fitting function, but we employ a cubic spline in a new analysis routine called Intensity Conserving Spline Interpolation (ICSI). As the name implies, it conserves the observed intensity within each wavelength bin, which ordinary fits do not. Given the rapid convergence, speed of computation, and ease of use, we suggest that ICSI be made a standard component of the processing pipeline for spectroscopic data.
