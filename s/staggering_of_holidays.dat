Odd–even <b>staggering</b> <b>of</b> the relative fragment yields is observed {{and can be}} explained by the odd–even <b>staggering</b> <b>of</b> the particle-emission threshold energies. IMS is a complementary technique to γ-ray spectroscopy for measuring isomeric ratios, in particular for nuclides with long lifetimes. It was found that the isomeric yield ratios in 53 Fe are almost constant for different longitudinal momenta...|$|R
40|$|The {{competition}} between the staggered flux state, or the d-density wave state, and the d-wave pairing state is analyzed in two-dimensional t-J model based on the U(1) slave boson mean-field theory. Not only <b>staggered</b> flux <b>of</b> spinon but also <b>staggered</b> flux <b>of</b> holon are considered. In this formalism, the hopping order parameter of physical electron is described by the product of hopping order parameters of spinon and holon. The <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude <b>of</b> electron is the difference <b>of</b> <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude <b>of</b> spinon and that of holon. In π-flux phase <b>of</b> spinon, <b>staggered</b> fluxes <b>of</b> spinon and holon cancel completely and <b>staggered</b> flux order <b>of</b> electron does not exist. However, in <b>staggered</b> flux phase <b>of</b> spinon whose <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude is not π, fluxes does not cancel completely and <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude <b>of</b> electron remains. Thus, the phase transition between these two phases, π-flux phase and <b>staggered</b> flux phase <b>of</b> spinon, becomes a second order transition in physical electron picture. The order parameter which characterizes this transition is staggered flux order parameter of electron. A mean-field phase diagram is shown. It is proved analytically {{that there is no}} coexisistence <b>of</b> <b>staggered</b> flux and d-wave pairing. The temperature dependences of Fermi surface and excitation gap at (0,π) are shown. These behaviors are consistent with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|As tourism complex {{facility}} {{the holiday}} village {{is both an}} old and new concept in Romania. It is usually located in a specific area, with controlled access, designed to provide tourists {{a wide range of}} services such as: accommodation, catering, additional travel facilities for recreation, sports, and cultural activities. The present study focuses on the legal framework and regulations on the implementation and functioning <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> villages, by analyzing their stage of development and causes of the increasing number <b>of</b> newly established <b>holiday</b> villages. However, the multitude <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> villages, not necessarily complying with the requirements of the concept, brings out definite inconsistencies with the concept <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> village. This was possible due to lack of legal and concept clarification <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> villages and also due to the spatial dispersion of this tourism development phenomenon. Other states have managed to raise tourism to the rank of basic economic activity by narrowing the range of tourist activities and promotion of advanced specialization of some activities. Yet, it is not the case of tourism in Romania. Without this type of approach, tourism activities are largely losing their particularities, along with the concept <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> village, whose true meaning is limited to just a few examples. Based on an exhaustive analysis we tried to establish a typology <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> villages as well as to propose a zoning of the Romanian territory, in accordance with its suitability for the optimal functioning of these types <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> village...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a model that}} can account for the almost uniform <b>staggering</b> <b>of</b> wage contracts in some countries {{as well as for}} the markedly nonuniform staggering in others. In the model, short and long contracts as well as long contracts concluded in different periods are strategic substitutes, which provide a powerful rationale for staggering. We show that for realistic parameter values, there is a continuum of possible equilibria with various degrees <b>of</b> <b>staggering</b> <b>of</b> long contracts. If the contracting cost is not too large, then the lowest possible degree <b>of</b> <b>staggering</b> decreases with the contracting cost and increases with monetary uncertainty.

This is 14 days more than the European average of 76. Virtually all Maltese state schools run tuck shops, while some secondary schools are home to cafeterias.|$|R
40|$|We {{analytically}} examine output persistence from monetary shocks in a DSGE {{model with}} staggered prices or wages under a Taylor Rule for monetary policy. The best known such model assumes Calvo-style <b>staggering</b> <b>of</b> prices and flexible wages {{and is known}} to yield no persistence under a Taylor Rule. Switching to Taylor-style staggering introduces lagged output into the model’s ‘New Keynesian Phillips Curve’ equation. Despite this, we show it generates no persistence, whether staggering is in wages or prices. Surprisingly, however, Calvo-style <b>staggering</b> <b>of</b> wages does generate persistence, if there are decreasing returns to labour.

The aim of the thesis is to compare the both markets on the basis of analyses and comparison of acquired information. The thesis focuses on the aspects which directly influence the market, the supply and the price <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> homes. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first chapter presents the actual situation of research on the subject, the methodology and the structure of this thesis. The second chapter defines term holiday home and the typology <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> homes. The third chapter separately analyses and then compares the Czech and French real estate market <b>of</b> <b>holiday</b> homes in terms of its size, typology of owners, taxation and charges <b>of</b> the <b>holiday</b> home. The fourth chapter focuses on sale <b>of</b> the <b>holiday</b> home and the factors which influence the value and the price of house. The last chapter examines types <b>of</b> the <b>holiday</b> homes, their supply and their price in two particular markets, Limousin and the Plzeň Region.
