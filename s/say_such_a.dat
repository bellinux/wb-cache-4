500|$|Ebert {{was also}} an {{advocate}} and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming {{to the defense of}} the cast and crew of Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would <b>say</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: how could you do this to [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!"

500|$|Lang did not {{disguise}} his {{relief that}} the crisis was over. He wrote of George VI: [...] "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." [...] On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. Time magazine recorded: [...] "All through the three-hour ceremony, {{the most important person}} there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." [...] Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." [...] He also said of the Coronation: [...] "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." [...] "Thank God that is over!" [...] said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. [...] "Lumley, how can you <b>say</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing!" [...] cried the archbishop. [...] "I only wish it was beginning over again." ...|$|E

[...] The singer always denied saying, or ever wanting to <b>say,</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> racist remark. Jet magazine, run by and for African-Americans, {{subsequently}} investigated the story and found no basis to the claim.

2500|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} may arise between {{different parts of}} a bank, creating the potential for market manipulation, according to critics. Authorities that regulate investment banking, such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom and the SEC in the United States, require that banks impose a [...] "Chinese wall" [...] to prevent communication between investment banking {{on one side and}} equity research and trading on the other. However, critics <b>say</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> barrier does not always exist in practice. Independent advisory firms that exclusively provide corporate finance advice argue that their advice is not conflicted, unlike bulge bracket banks.|$|E

New York Post critic Linda Stasi praised the series, particularly the acting of Cranston and Paul, stating [...] "Cranston and Paul are so good, it's astounding. I'd say {{the two have}} created great chemistry, but I'm ashamed to <b>say</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> cheap thing." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming [...] "There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt's efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well. But even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful, as the duo learns that killing someone, even in self-defense, is ugly, messy work." ...|$|E
