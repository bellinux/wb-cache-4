25|$|A game {{typically}} includes 64 to 96 TTL-level inputs from {{a variety}} of sensors such as mechanical leaf switches, optical sensors and electromagnetic sensors.

25|$|The {{development}} of television {{was the result}} of work by many inventors. Among them, Baird was a prominent pioneer and made major advances in the field. Many historians credit Baird with being the first to produce a live, moving, greyscale television image from reflected light. Baird achieved this, where other inventors had failed, by obtaining a better photoelectric cell and improving the <b>signal</b> <b>conditioning</b> from the photocell and the video amplifier.|$|E
5000|$|Semiconductor {{vendors are}} {{incorporating}} <b>signaling</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{features such as}} pre-conditioning, pre-emphasis and equalization into their devices to help move signals at higher frequencies.

50|$|In 2002/2003, the GreenChip II TEA155x {{series was}} released. Derived from the TEA1507, the new series was {{specifically}} aimed at notebook adapters. The GreenChip II series {{was capable of}} reducing notebook adapter no-load power to below 500 mW (a 100% improvement on the state-of-the-art 1 W at that time). It also improved system robustness by integrating more adapter specific protections and <b>signaling</b> <b>conditioning</b> functionality. The TEA155x grew to take a dominant share in the notebook adapter market.|$|R

25|$|A {{year before}} the flight, Aaron had been observing a test at Kennedy Space Center when he had noticed some unusual {{telemetry}} readings. On his own initiative, he traced this anomaly back to the obscure <b>Signal</b> <b>Conditioning</b> Electronics (SCE) system, {{and became one of}} the few flight controllers who was familiar with the system and its operations. For the case that first drew his attention to the system, normal readings could be restored by putting the SCE on its auxiliary setting, which meant that it would operate even with low-voltage conditions.|$|E
25|$|Parameters {{measured}} include acceleration, angular velocity, flow rate, position, pressure, temperature, voltage, current, frequency, and others. Sensor signals were {{conditioned by}} amplifiers or converters located in measuring racks. There are four measuring racks in the IU at locations 1, 9, and 15 and twenty <b>signal</b> <b>conditioning</b> modules in each. Conditioned signals were routed to their assigned telemetry channel by the measuring distributor at location 10. There were two telemetry links. In {{order for the}} two IU telemetry links to handle approximately 200 separate measurements, these links must be shared. Both frequency sharing and time sharing multiplexing techniques were used to accomplish this. The two modulation techniques used were pulse code modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM) and frequency modulation/frequency modulation (FM/FM).|$|E
50|$|An RF matrix {{is used in}} test systems, in both design {{verification}} and manufacturing test, to route high frequency signals between the device under test (DUT) and the test and measurement equipment. In addition to signal routing, the RF/Microwave Switch Matrix may also contain <b>signal</b> <b>conditioning</b> components including passive <b>signal</b> <b>conditioning</b> devices, such as attenuators, filters, and directional couplers, as well as active <b>signal</b> <b>conditioning,</b> such as amplification and frequency converters. Since the signal routing and <b>signal</b> <b>conditioning</b> needs of a test system differ from design to design, RF/Microwave Switch Matrices typically are custom designed by the test system engineer or by a hired contractor for each new test system.|$|E

The design of MPPC electronic readout for position determination was based on Anger logic. Wide-band amplifiers (by MITEQ®, US) were used for <b>signals</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Digitized traces of background, 57 Co and 133 Ba collimated irradiation were captured, characterized and stored by using the data-logging capabilities of a WaveMaster Oscilloscope (by LeCroy, US).

50|$|In control {{engineering}} applications, {{it is common}} to have a sensing stage (which consists of a sensor), a <b>signal</b> <b>conditioning</b> stage (where usually amplification of the signal is done) and a processing stage (normally carried out by an ADC and a micro-controller).

40|$|Rorick-Kehn and Steinmetz (2005) {{report that}} neurons {{in the central}} and basolateral nuclei of the {{amygdala}} exhibit learning-related spike firing to conditional stimuli associated with shock in 3 different aversive conditioning paradigms: eyeblink conditioning, fear <b>conditioning,</b> and <b>signaled</b> avoidance <b>conditioning.</b> Central nucleus neurons responded in all 3 tasks, whereas basolateral nucleus neurons were more activated by fear and avoidance conditioning. These results reveal that amygdala neurons are differentially engaged by aversive conditioning, but questions remain concerning the associative basis and functional role for these unit responses...|$|R
40|$|In {{experiments}} on awake cats, we recorded {{the activity of}} 79 putative serotonergic (STE) neurons localized within {{the region of the}} brainstem dorsal and anterior central raphe nuclei. The animals were trained to perform a self-initiated (voluntary) movement, to press a pedal by the forelimb; an additional limitation was to perform the movement not earlier than after a definite time interval. Changes in the activity of STE neurons related to the preparation for and performance of the movement and reactions to presentation of a feedback <b>conditioning</b> <b>signal</b> preceding the reward and receipt of the food reward were most clearly manifested. More than 50 % of the units changed their activity before the movement initiation. Most neurons responded to presentation of a positive <b>conditioning</b> <b>signal</b> by phasic activation, while a negative signal informing them of the absence of the reward evoked considerably weaker reactions. We hypothesize that reactions of STE neurons forestalling the movement initiation can provide activation of the neocortex necessary for the movement performance within a preset time interval. Activating and inhibitory reactions observed within the period of expectation of a feedback <b>conditioning</b> <b>signal</b> and developing after presentation of this signal can be related to a noticeable role of the STE system in the formation of memory engrams and development of emotional states...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examined the}} {{mechanisms by which}} downward shifts in reinforcer value influence learning in appetitive unblocking procedures. The downward shift was accomplished by omitting the second of a two-reinforcer sequence (food-food or food-sucrose). Performance of normal rats was {{compared with that of}} rats with lesions of the central nucleus of the amygdala, which are thought to interfere with surprise-induced enhancements of event processing. The results suggested that in normal rats, omission of the second reinforcer enhanced processing of the first reinforcer, rather than processing of the conditioned stimuli, and that lesions of the central nucleus eliminated this enhancement. The roles of reinforcement error <b>signals</b> in <b>conditioning</b> were discussed...|$|R
3000|$|Although uniformly sampled {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (UPWM) represents a very efficient digital audio coding scheme for digital-to-analog conversion and full-digital amplification, it suffers from strong harmonic distortions, as opposed to benign non-harmonic artifacts present in analog PWM (naturally sampled PWM, NPWM). Complete elimination of these distortions usually requires excessive oversampling of the source PCM audio signal, which results to impractical realizations of digital PWM systems. In this paper, a description of digital PWM distortion generation mechanism is given and a novel principle for their minimization is proposed, based on a process having some similarity to the dithering principle employed in multibit <b>signal</b> quantization. This <b>conditioning</b> <b>signal</b> is termed [...] "jither" [...] {{and it can be}} applied either in the PCM amplitude or the PWM time domain.
