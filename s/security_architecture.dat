25|$|The African Union (AU) {{is working}} on {{building}} an African Peace and <b>Security</b> <b>Architecture</b> that fulfils the mandate to enforce peace and security on the continent. In cases of genocide or other serious human-rights violations, an AU-mission could be launched even against {{the wishes of the}} government of the country concerned, {{as long as it is}} approved by the AU General Assembly. The establishment of the African Peace and <b>Security</b> <b>Architecture</b> (APSA) which includes the African Standby Force (ASF) is planned earliest for 2015.|$|E
25|$|The laptop's <b>security</b> <b>architecture,</b> {{known as}} Bitfrost, was {{publicly}} introduced in February 2007. No passwords {{will be required}} for ordinary use of the machine. Programs are assigned certain bundles of rights at install time which govern their access to resources; users can later add more rights. Optionally, the laptops can be configured to request leases from a central server and to stop functioning when these leases expire; this is designed as a theft-prevention mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} treaty of the AU {{also called for}} the establishment of the African Peace and <b>Security</b> <b>Architecture</b> (APSA), including the African Standby Force (ASF), which is to be deployed in emergencies. That means, in cases of genocide or other serious human-rights violations, an ASF mission can be launched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned, {{as long as it is}} approved by the AU General Assembly. In the past AU peacekeeping missions, the concept was not yet applied, forces had to be mobilised from member states. The AU is planning on putting the concept into practise by 2015 the earliest.|$|E

25|$|Chromebooks {{ship with}} Google Chrome OS, an {{operating}} system {{that uses the}} Linux kernel and the Google Chrome web-browser with an integrated media-player. Enabling developer mode allows the installation of Linux distributions on Chromebooks. Crouton is a script that allows the installation of Linux distributions from Chrome OS, and running both operating systems simultaneously. Some Chromebooks include SeaBIOS, which can be turned on to install and boot Linux distributions directly. With limited offline capability and a fast boot-time, Chromebooks are primarily designed for use while connected to the Internet. Instead of installing traditional applications such as word processing and instant messaging, users add web apps from the Chrome Web Store.

40|$|This {{technical}} report is {{a survey of}} existing techniques which could potentially {{be used in the}} analysis of <b>security</b> <b>architectures.</b> The report has been structured to section the analysis process over three phases: the capture of a specific architecture in a suitable representation, discovering attacks on the captured architecture, and then assessing and comparing different <b>security</b> <b>architectures.</b> Each technique presented in this report has been recognised as being potentially useful for one phase of the analysis. By presenting a set of potentially useful techniques, it is hoped that designers and decisionmakers involved in the development and maintenance of <b>security</b> <b>architectures</b> will be able to develop a more complete, justified and usable methodology other than those currently being used to perform analyses...|$|R
40|$|As virtual {{machines}} become pervasive {{users will}} be able to create, modify and distribute new “machines ” with unprecedented ease. This flexibility provides tremendous benefits for users. Unfortunately, it can also undermine many assumptions that today’s relatively static <b>security</b> <b>architectures</b> rely on about the number of hosts in a system, their mobility, connectivity, patch cycle, etc. We examine a variety of security problems virtual computing environments give rise to. We then discuss potential directions for changing <b>security</b> <b>architectures</b> to adapt to these demands. ...|$|R
40|$|Expressing <b>security</b> <b>architectures</b> {{that meet}} {{required}} security goals {{for a system}} in SELinux policy language is quite difficult, particularly for those without a strong understanding {{of the implications of}} SELinux security mechanisms and object class permissions. However, SELinux policy language is an excellent base upon which to build a higher-level policy language that more directly expresses specific <b>security</b> <b>architectures.</b> We have developed one such lan-guage, CDSFramework, for implementing security policies focused on information flow applications as typically found in cross-domain solutions.

40|$|The {{future of}} {{enterprise}} software development {{lies in the}} use of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) to support business concerns. Additionally <b>security</b> <b>architectures</b> for SOA are offering services to be used by functional services for security support, e. g. access control. The question remains how to implement the security services using traditional security products and how to map security policies defined at service level to product-specific policies.
