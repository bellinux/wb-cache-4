25|$|A {{new series}} of {{banknotes}} had to be printed soon to meet higher <b>security</b> <b>standards.</b> The engravings were executed and designed by Endre Horváth, Hungarian graphic artist. New 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pengő notes were printed and even a 1000 pengő banknote was added to this series - however, the latter had such a high value that a big proportion of the people hardly ever saw any.

On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of nuclear submarine propulsion to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether it was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> set by the 1955 agreement. With the 1956 presidential election approaching, Eisenhower was forced to back down.|$|E

While the Privacy Rule pertains to all Protected Health Information (PHI) including paper and electronic, the Security Rule deals specifically with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI). It lays out {{three types of}} security safeguards required for compliance: administrative, physical, and technical. For each of these types, the Rule identifies various <b>security</b> <b>standards,</b> and for each standard, it names both required and addressable implementation specifications. Required specifications must be adopted and administered as dictated by the Rule. Addressable specifications are more flexible. Individual covered entities can evaluate their own situation and determine {{the best way to}} implement addressable specifications. Some privacy advocates have argued that this [...] "flexibility" [...] may provide too much latitude to covered entities. The standards and specifications are as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1948, he {{returned}} to the U.S. to head the Strategic Air Command (SAC) at Offutt Air Force Base, replacing Gen George Kenney. When LeMay took over command of SAC, it consisted of little more than a few understaffed B-29 bombardment groups left over from World War II. Less than half of the available aircraft were operational, and the crews were undertrained. Base and aircraft <b>security</b> <b>standards</b> were minimal. Upon inspecting a SAC hangar full of US nuclear strategic bombers, LeMay found a single Air Force sentry on duty, unarmed. [...] After ordering a mock bombing exercise on Dayton, Ohio, LeMay was shocked to learn that most of the strategic bombers assigned to the mission missed their targets by one mile or more. [...] "We didn't have one crew, not one crew, in the entire command who could do a professional job" [...] noted LeMay.|$|E
