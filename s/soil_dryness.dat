Several phenomena contribute to this relationship: increasing evaporation (amount of water vapour discharged from soil) due to increasing air temperature, decreasing moisture content in the soil, the collapse of aggregates of fine soil particles, and the resulting effects on forest plants. To clarify the relationships among climate variation, the collapse of soil particle aggregates, and rainfall–runoff processes, a numerical model was developed to reproduce such aggregate collapse in detail. The validity of the numerical model was confirmed by its application to the granitic mountainous catchment of the Nagara River basin in Japan and by comparison with observational data. The simulation suggests that important problems, such as the collapse of forest plants in response to decreases in soil moisture content and antecedent rainfall, will arise if air temperature continues to increase...|$|E

We identified and tested key parameters in soil hydrology and forest water and carbon-exchange-related formulations, and optimised them using the adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm for Hyytil with a 5 -year calibration period (2000 - 2004) {{followed by a}} 4 -year validation period (2005 - 2008). Sodankyla acted as an independent validation site, where optimisations were not made. The tuning provided estimates for full distribution of possible parameters, along with information about correlation, sensitivity and identifiability. Some parameters were correlated with each other due to a phenomenological connection between carbon uptake and water stress or other connections due to the set-up of the model formulations. The latter holds especially for vegetation phenology parameters. The least identifiable parameters include phenology parameters, parameters connecting relative humidity and <b>soil</b> <b>dryness,</b> and the field capacity of the skin reservoir. These soil parameters were masked by the large contribution from vegetation transpiration. In addition to leaf area index and the maximum carboxylation rate, the most effective parameters adjusting the gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes in seasonal tuning were related to soil wilting point, drainage and moisture stress imposed on vegetation. For daily and half-hourly tunings the most important parameters were the ratio of leaf internal CO 2 concentration to external CO 2 and the parameter connecting relative humidity and <b>soil</b> <b>dryness.</b> Effectively the seasonal tuning transferred water from soil moisture into ET, and daily and half-hourly tunings reversed this process. The seasonal tuning improved the month-to-month development of GPP and ET, and produced the most stable estimates of water use efficiency. When compared to the seasonal tuning, the daily tuning is worse on the seasonal scale. However, daily parametrisation reproduced the observations for average diurnal cycle best, except for the GPP for Sodankyla validation period, where half-hourly tuned parameters were better. In general, the daily tuning provided the largest reduction in model-data mismatch.

In addition, such testing is increasingly evolving as a practice within other soil testing performed during the design and construction phases of a project. Theoretical considerations suggest that soil water content may significantly affect measurements of radon concentrations in soil gas prior to construction, during soil preparation, and after foundationlslab construction. An experimental assembly has been designed and constructed to investigate soil water content effects on soil gas radon concentration measurements. Soil samples were first weighted and dried using a hot air conventional oven, and then placed inside the assembly's testing chamber. Temperature and relative humidity inside the chamber, pressure differentials between the chamber and the ambient, and radon concentration emanated from the soil samples are simultaneously monitored during the experiments. Timedependent responses of the measured parameters are continuously collected using a micro data-logging system and retrieved at the conclusion of each experiment.

For localized heating within {{a large portion of the}} continental interior, regardless of the specific location of this heating, the spatial pattern of the forced atmospheric circulation anomaly (in terms of 250 -mb eddy streamfunction) is largely the same: a high anomaly forms over west central North America and a low anomaly forms to the east. In supplemental atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments, we find similar results; imposing <b>soil</b> moisture <b>dryness</b> in the AGCM in different locations within the US interior tends to produce the aforementioned pattern, along with an associated near-surface warming and precipitation deficit in the center of the continent. The SWM-based and AGCM-based patterns generally agree with composites generated using reanalysis and precipitation gauge data. The AGCM experiments also suggest that dry anomalies imposed in the lower Mississippi Valley have remote surface impacts of particularly large spatial extent, and a region along the eastern half of the US-Canada border is particularly sensitive to dry anomalies in a number of remote areas. Overall, the SWM and AGCM experiments support the idea of a positive feedback loop operating over the continent: dry surface conditions in many interior locations lead to changes in atmospheric circulation that act to enhance further the overall dryness of the continental interior...|$|R

The selected microenvironments at the arid, semi-arid, and Mediterranean sites were ‘under shrub’, ‘between shrubs’, and ‘under rock fragments’; those at the humid Mediterranean site were ‘under shrub’, ‘between shrubs’, and ‘under tree’. Intracellular and extracellular arylsulfatase enzyme activities, and some soil properties, were examined. The research aims were: (1) to analyse the relationship between arylsulfatase enzyme activity and some soil properties; (2) to analyse the effects of soil components (local factor) and climatic conditions (regional factor) on arylsulfatase enzyme activity. At both arid sites the organic carbon content, which had {{a positive effect on}} arylsulfatase activity, was much higher under shrubs and somewhat higher under rock fragments than between shrubs.

The two hydraulic schemes differ in the modeling of the root ability to cooperate, i. e., the capacity of roots to increase the water uptake from the wetter soil layers when {{other parts of the}} soil are dry (compensation effect) and to transfer water from moister into drier soil layers (water redistribution effect). Both compensation and water redistribution are direct consequences of the hydraulic structure of the root system, which is modeled here considering two contrasting cases corresponding to non-interacting uptake paths from different soil layers, and converging uptake paths. Only the latter hydraulic architecture allows for compensation and water redistribution. Another important difference between the hydraulic schemes is the stomatal response to <b>soil</b> <b>dryness.</b> When the soil water is unevenly distributed in the soil layers, the differences in the hydraulic schemes emerge.

40|$|Agriculture is {{the result}} of a balance between soil, climate, plants and {{cropping}} techniques applied by the farmers. Once one of those elements, in this case the climate, is perceptibly modified in a sustainable way, it is important that the other elements are also modified to respect the balance. To adapt to climate change farmers can modify their strategic or tactic decisions. But the very first point is to have good ideas of what are to be expected in terms of climate modifications and their agronomic consequences: acceleration of crop cycles, increase of summer droughts and increase in inter-season and inter-annual variability. Concerning strategic choices, one must not expect revolution and climate change will not deeply modify cropping systems. Yet rainfed crops will be more difficult in the south while summer crops and crop successions will become easier in the north. Escape strategies in terms of crop and genotype choices could be advantageous. An important point of discussion is about sowing dates.

For all vegetation zones, climate ranges were exceeded in the future climate, with the average annual temperature range exceeded in all zones, and in the majority of the zones, winter temperatures were also exceeded. Annual precipitation range was exceeded in several zones, and dry periods increase in both the western and eastern locations, this has implications for species that are susceptible to drought or reduced soil water conditions. Most of the selected vegetation within each zone is likely to experience varying degrees of negative impacts from future climate, with some species possibly being unable to grow within the region in the future...|$|E
40|$|Grassland/livestock systems {{differ in}} their wherewithal to enhance the {{magnitude}} of GHG fluxes (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O) and their global warming potential (GWP). A simulation study was performed using the model PASIM to extrapolate potential emissions from grassland/livestock systems under alternative climate/soil/plant/management regimes at 12 French sites. Fluxes of CO 2 associated with those of N 2 O indicate that both gases may be controlled by similar or concomitant environmental factors. In particular, CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes {{were higher in the}} temporary grasslands, where grass management (mowing, N fertilization) promotes increased plant respiration and soil organic matter turnover. In these systems, high CO 2 and N 2 O emissions were accompanied by absence of CH 4 emissions. Similar responses were observed with intensive permanent grasslands, where the presence of grazing animals also determines CH 4 emissions. High CH 4, and low CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes were generally estimated with extensive permanent pastures. While there are site-to-site and climate-to-climate variations, a general conclusion is that the GWP is expected to decrease in the future as result of increased <b>soil</b> <b>dryness</b> and C stocking. Also, temporary grasslands are indicated as the most desirable land use in reducing global warming. Strategies to enhance fertilizer use efficiency, animal feed and return of animal waste could be explored as adaptation/mitigation measures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to understand how large-scale processes, cloud cover and surface fluxes affect the temperature variability over the SIRTA site, near Paris, and in a regional climate simulation performed in the frame of HyMeX/Med-CORDEX programs. This site is located in a climatic transitional area where models usually show strong dispersions despite the significant influence of large scale on interannual variability due to its western location. At seasonal time scale, the temperature is mainly controlled by surface fluxes. In the model, the transition from radiation to soil moisture limited regime occurs earlier than in observations leading to an overestimate of summertime temperature. An overestimate of shortwave radiation (SW), consistent with a lack of low clouds, enhances the <b>soil</b> <b>dryness.</b> A simulation with a wet soil is used to better analyse the relationship between dry soil and clouds but while the wetter soil leads to colder temperature, the cloud cover during daytime is not increased due to the atmospheric stability. At shorter time scales, the control of surface radiation becomes higher. In the simulation, higher temperatures are associated with higher SW. A wet soil mitigates the effect of radiation due to modulation by evaporation. In observations, the variability of clouds and their effect on SW is stronger leading to a nearly constant mean SW when sorted by temperature quantile but a stronger impact of cloud cover on day-to-day temperature variability. Impact of cloud albedo effect on precipitation is also compared...|$|E
40|$|The Qianyanzhou (QYZ) forest site {{is located}} in the mid-{{subtropical}} region under typical subtropical continental monsoon climate. Despite its plentiful water and heat resources, changes in their seasonal distributions result in frequent occurrences of seasonal drought, influencing both the structure and function of forest ecosystems. In order {{to examine the effects of}} drought stress on energy and water fluxes and the related physiological processes, we used tower flux measurements from 2003 and 2004 from the QYZ site and the ecosystem model EALCO (Ecological Assimilation of Land and Climate Observations). The model explained almost 90 % of the variance in the daily LE for both years; whereas 71 % and 55 % of the variance in H for 2003 and 2004, respectively. Simulations suggested that, during the 2003 summer drought, about 80 % of water extraction by roots occurred below 0. 45 m, and canopy stomatal conductance decreased in response to <b>soil</b> <b>dryness</b> at a threshold theta(r) (relative water content) of 0. 5 m. The response of canopy stomatal conductance appeared to be linked to the soil water exposed to the majority of the roots, even if substantial water was being extracted from greater depth. The decrease of canopy stomatal conductance made the ratio of transpiration to ET relatively constant along the years with only a small difference. The different extent of the seasonal drought resulted in different water fluxes for the two years with more distinct influence on evaporation than on transpiration...|$|E
40|$|The {{predictions}} of five simulation models {{were compared with}} data from a winter sown wheat experiment performed in a mobile automatic rainshelter at Lincoln, New Zealand in 1991 / 1992, where observed grain yields ranged from 3. 6 to 9. 9 t ha− 1. Four of the five models predicted the yield of the fully irrigated treatment to within 10 %, and SWHEAT underestimated by more than 20 %. The same four models also predicted the grain yield response to varying water supply with reasonable accuracy, but SWHEAT again underestimated the yield reduction with increasing drought. However, the performance of all the models in predicting both the time course and final amount of aboveground biomass, of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration, varied substantially. These variations were associated with their diverging assumptions {{about the effects of}} root distribution and <b>soil</b> <b>dryness</b> on the ability of the crops to extract water, the value of the ratio of water supply to water demand at which stress begins to reduce leaf area development, and photosynthetic, or light-use efficiency (LUE). All the models predicted, to varying degrees, that reductions in photosynthetic efficiency or LUE was an important contributor to reductions in the rate of biomass accumulation. In contrast, analysis of the experimental data indicated that this factor was a minor contributor to the reduction, and variation in light interception, associated with changes in LAI, was the major cause...|$|E
