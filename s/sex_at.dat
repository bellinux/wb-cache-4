5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier <b>sex</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning of a}} breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, {{it is possible that the}} pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E
5|$|The Puranas {{introduce}} {{themes that}} are echoed in later works, including the deception of the unsuspecting Ahalya by Indra's devious disguise as Gautama in his absence. The Padma Purana states that after Gautama leaves for his ritual bath, Indra masquerades as Gautama and asks Ahalya to satisfy him. Ahalya, engrossed in worship, rejects him, considering it inappropriate to have <b>sex</b> <b>at</b> {{the cost of}} neglecting the gods. Indra reminds her that her first duty is to serve him. Finally Ahalya gives in, but Gautama learns of Indra's deception through his supernatural powers {{and returns to the}} ashram. A similar account is found in the Brahma Purana. At times, Indra {{takes the form of a}} cock that crows to dispatch Gautama for his morning ablutions, as in the 18th-century Telugu rendition of the tale by the warrior-poet Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty. In other versions, he uses an accomplice, such as the moon-god Chandra, to distract Gautama. In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Ahalya comes to bathe in the Svarnadi (heavenly river) and Indra becomes infatuated with her when he sees her. Assuming Gautama's form, Indra has sex with her until they sink to the river bed in exhaustion. However, Gautama catches them in the act. Another version in the same Purana focuses on the question of how the chaste Ahalya was seduced by Indra. In this version, Indra approaches Ahalya on the banks of the Mandakini river in his own form to ask for a sexual favour, which is flatly refused by Ahalya. Indra subsequently poses as Gautama and fulfils his objective.|$|E

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth is partially determined by environmental and social factors. The modern change in those factors serves as {{an explanation for the}} secular decline in <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth in most of the industrialized countries. This article is the reexamination of the results from my previous communication in which no trend in <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth was established for the Croatian data from 1946 to 2007.

Although the numerous factors associated with the decline in <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth did occur during the studied period (e. g. increased exposure to the environmental pollution through food, air and water, the rise of the obesity and diabetes incidence, the economic crisis etc.), it appears that none of them made the measurable impact on <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth.

This study tested the hypothesis that the male-to-female <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> amniocentesis should be lower than the <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth, if a certain percentage of female fetuses are being selectively aborted after amniocentesis. Therefore, we examined the differences between fetal <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> amniocentesis at a tertiary medical center in southern Taiwan and the nationwide <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth in Taiwan from 1992 to 2011. Materials and MethodsData of normal male and female karyotypes during the study period were collected from the cytogenetic laboratory of the National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) in southern Taiwan. Data of <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth nationwide in Taiwan were obtained from the Department of Statistics, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan. We calculated 95 % binominal confidence intervals for the sex ratios and differences between fetal <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> amniocentesis, and nationwide <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth were tested by the χ 2 test and Bonferroni correction. ResultsThe nationwide <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> birth ranged from 1. 07 to 1. 11 during the period from 1992 to 2011 in Taiwan, with the highest in 2004 and the lowest in 1993. The fetal <b>sex</b> ratio <b>at</b> amniocentesis at NCKUH ranged more widely (0. 82 – 1. 28), with the lowest in 1993 and the highest in 2007.

40|$|Background: While {{national}} {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccination estimates exist by sex, {{little is known}} about HPV vaccination rates by gender identity.

Results: Six hundred sixty respondents were age eligible for HPV vaccination: 84 % reported gender identity aligned with their <b>sex</b> assigned <b>at</b> birth, while 10 % reported gender identity the differed from their <b>sex</b> assigned <b>at</b> birth; an additional 6 % reported non-binary gender identity.

25|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) infection causes {{more than}} 90% of cases; {{most people who}} have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting <b>sex</b> <b>at</b> a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity.
