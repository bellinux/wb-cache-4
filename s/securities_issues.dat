40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse if the UN today {{constructs}} the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> and to argue about in which way the organization in that case does so alternatively why it can be said that the UN doesn’t construct the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue.</b> In order to reach this purpose the following questions will be answered: •Does the UN construct the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> today? -If yes, in which way? -If no, why can it be said that the organisation doesn’t? The methods used are qualitative literature studies of policy documents on water from the UN. The focus is to analyze the ideas about water and to apply my theory on the concept of security, which is Barry Buzan’s framework on security, to these ideas. The main results showed that the UN strongly constructs the water issue as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for environments and species and in relatively strong terms also constructs it as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for civilisations. In rare cases the organisation constructs it as a societal <b>security</b> <b>issue,</b> but the UN doesn’t construct the water issue as a military, political or economic <b>security</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Finally, if phantom {{stock or}} SARs are {{intended}} to benefit most or all employees and defer some or all payment until termination or later, they may be considered de facto “ERISA plans.” ERISA (the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) is the federal law that governs retirement plans. It does not allow non-ERISA plans to operate like ERISA plans, so the plan could be ruled subject to all the constraints of ERISA. This does not necessarily {{have to be a}} problem, because ERISA is not a valid law in most countries. However, for this might be a consideration for people living in the United States, where ERISA is applicable. Similarly, if there is an explicit or implied reduction in compensation to get the phantom stock, there could be <b>securities</b> <b>issues</b> involved, most likely anti-fraud disclosure requirements. Plans designed just for a limited number of employees, or as a bonus for a broader group of employees that pays out annually based on a measure of equity, would most likely avoid these problems. Moreover, the regulatory issues are gray areas; it could be that a company could use a broad-based plan that pays over longer periods or at departure and not ever be challenged.|$|E
