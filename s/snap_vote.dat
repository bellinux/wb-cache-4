25|$|While the Government {{wanted to}} pass C-38, its main {{priority}} was to first pass C-48 (the NDP {{additions to the}} budget), which the Bloc and the Conservatives opposed. The third reading vote on that bill in the House was expected the final week of June, after the House adopted a motion (supported by the Liberals, Bloc Québécois, and NDP) to extend the sitting of the house. Bill C-48 passed just before midnight on June 23, 2005 when the Liberals agreed with the Bloc and NDP to force a <b>snap</b> <b>vote</b> on the bill. The <b>snap</b> <b>vote</b> on C-48 was significant because if all Conservative MPs were present for the vote, and if all Bloc opposed, and the Independents voted as they usually did, the Government would have been defeated.|$|E
25|$|June 23, 2005 - Traditionally, it {{is around}} this date that the House of Commons closes. But with Bill C-38 in the process, MPs of the Liberal, Bloc and NDP parties vote {{to extend the}} sitting time through the {{following}} week to pass Bill C-38 in third and final reading. The same night, the budget bill (Bill C-48) passes after a late night <b>snap</b> <b>vote</b> is called, ending the threat by Bill C-38 opponents to derail the bill by defeating the budget thereby bringing down the government and forcing a general election.|$|E
25|$|The Smith bill won several early {{tests in}} the House, which also voted to {{substantially}} cut the NLRB's budget. Smith won a <b>snap</b> <b>vote</b> in the House Rules Committee permitting him to bring his bill directly to {{the floor for a}} vote and bypass the committee process (where Roosevelt and his House allies had intended to bottle up the bill). In an attempt to defuse the legislative crisis, Madden fired 53 staff and forced another five to resign, and decentralized the NLRB's trial process to give regional directors and field agents more authority. But the House easily passed the Smith bill by a vote of 258 to 129 on June 7, 1940. To protect the NLRB, Roosevelt convinced Senator Elbert D. Thomas, chair of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, to hold no hearings or votes on the bill, and the legislation died.|$|E

Dawkins played in 14 games {{the following}} 2011 season, compiling just 38 tackles in limited <b>snaps.</b> He was <b>voted</b> into the 2012 AFC Pro Bowl team as the team's starting strong safety, after an injury to Troy Polamalu prevented him from attending.|$|R

25|$|He {{dissolved}} the Dáil on four occasions (in 1948, 1951, 1954 and 1957). On each occasion the Taoiseach {{who advised}} {{him to do so}} (de Valera in the first and third cases, and John A. Costello in the other two) had not been formally defeated in a Dáil vote in a manner showing a loss of support by a majority of TDs. Therefore, under Article 13.2.3° of the Constitution, O'Kelly had no discretion to refuse to act on their advice to dissolve. A more complex case occurred however in 1949 when the First Inter-Party Government was defeated in a <b>snap</b> Dáil <b>vote</b> on a financial measure due to the absence of a number of Government TDs. O'Kelly was advised by the Secretary to the President, Michael McDunphy that had Costello requested a dissolution, he could have refused it. However Costello, on the basis that the loss of the vote was accidental (due to a mistake by the party whips), not evidence of a shift in voting, opted to reintroduce the measure the following morning, rather than seek a dissolution. With all Deputies present this time the Government won the vote. McDunphy later changed his mind and in the files on the event concluded that the President could not have refused a dissolution because the loss had merely been a technical loss, not an actual decision by the Dáil to vote against the government.|$|R
