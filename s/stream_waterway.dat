40|$|A rapid {{population}} increase in South East Queensland (SEQ) has placed extra {{demands on the}} ecosystem of the region. This {{has led to an}} increase in the need to understand what’s happening within the landscape, in particular the need to understand more about the health of waterways and catchments. Therefore, there is a requirement for more information relating to waterways and catchments. Information about waterways and catchments has become more important than ever before. Catchment groups, waterways managers, Local Governments and State Government departments all valuing any data about waterways and catchments. This information assists them manage the health and remediation of these systems. Any data that assists with planning and the continued maintenance of healthy ecosystems is highly sought after. Managing waterways to ensure environmental values are maintained while allowing for continued economic development is major challenge facing many areas of Australia (Newham et al. 2004). It has been identified by planners and users of the existing waterways data {{that there is a need}} for knowledge of lengths of streams in land use types, for existing and future land use. Identification of lengths of stream order in land use types would enable better management of these waterways and assists with planning change, or lack of change for an area. This study provides information on the lengths of waterways in existing and future land use categories. There was also a need for more information about SEQ waterways with regard their relationship with the slope of the land over which they lie. Slope analysis of waterways assists in the estimation of sedimentation run-off and transport of pollutants through waterways. It also assists with such things as identifying nutrient export ‘hot spots’ that require treatment. Knowledge of slope of the land over which waterways flow can assist characterise land, and therefore help with the planning process. This study supplies information on the lengths of waterways in slope categories. This study addresses the identified waterway, land use and slope requirements for the eastward draining (mostly into Moreton Bay) catchments and shires of SEQ. The project builds on previous waterways and catchments data created by the author through a project at BMT WBM. This project created <b>stream</b> ordered <b>waterways</b> information of the region for the SEQ Healthy Waterways Partnership (SEQHWP). A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) created for the previous work is used in this new project as the basis to create categories of slope for SEQ. From the slope categories, lengths of <b>stream</b> ordered <b>waterways</b> are derived for each catchment and shire in the region. The waterways are also analysed with both existing and future land use categories. Finally, information about lengths of stream order within land use areas for each SEQ catchment and shire is provided. Lengths of waterways are already available for catchments, but not for the shires, and not for land use and slope categories for catchments or shires. So, while the project defines these waterway lengths in land use and slope categories, it also delivers another benefit in that it supplies areas of land use (existing and future) for the catchments and shires. It also delivers areas of slope categories for each of the catchments and shires in SEQ. A major implication from this study is that it has become apparent that there is a straight forward, simplistic way to work out lengths of waterways, and indeed lengths of <b>stream</b> ordered <b>waterways</b> (see Figure 1 - 3 for explanation of <b>stream</b> ordered <b>waterways)</b> within catchments and land use areas (and any other large land area). This can be done without the need for detailed DEM construction and processing. It was found that for every square kilometre of catchment or land use there is approximately two kilometres of waterways. Also, for every square kilometre of land use there is approximately one kilometre of <b>stream</b> order one <b>waterways.</b> <b>Stream</b> order two <b>waterways</b> are half the length of <b>stream</b> order one <b>waterways.</b> <b>Stream</b> order three <b>waterways</b> are approximately half the length of <b>stream</b> order two <b>waterways,</b> and so on. The accompanying hard copy A 3 Drawing addendum gives details for all catchments (Levels 1, 2 and 3) and shires, or parts of shires within the SEQ catchments area, detailing lengths of waterways within the various land use and slope categories. Information from this study will be of use to a large number of organisations in SEQ, being delivered in various formats, from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data through to the A 3 hard copy output. Any available resources for waterway management may be better utilised with an improved knowledge of those waterways. To the authors knowledge, this is the first time this type of information has been created over such a large area, and over so many catchments and shires...|$|R

50|$|Governor John Milton, {{an ardent}} secessionist, {{throughout}} the war {{stressed the importance of}} Florida as a supplier of goods, rather than personnel.

50|$|Ironically, {{given the}} {{industry}} was started by government research aimed at soil conservation, a number of negative impacts have emerged. The two major criticisms are the run off of fertiliser into <b>streams</b> and <b>waterways</b> which encourages marine plant growth, leading to choking of the waterways and altering the fresh water ecosystem, disadvantaging many fish, (and frustrating anglers). To minimise impact, topdressing is now prohibited within certain distances of water. The second impact is less direct. By enabling sheep to be run profitably on steep hillsides, the topdressing industry stopped reforestation of otherwise uneconomic land, contributing to the erosion it was originally designed to prevent.|$|R

However, nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from urban impervious surfaces (i. e., parking lots, roadways, sidewalks, rooftops, etc.) is also a major contributor. Parking lots collect grease, oil, anti-freeze, and other vehicle leakage, heavy metals from brake dust, as well as litter, other debris, and pathogens. All of these pollutants are flushed into waterways by rain and melting snow. In addition, impervious areas hasten the movement of stormwater runoff across the surface, into a series of curbs, gutters, drains, and pipes, increasing flood occurrence and stream bank erosion.

There were few settlers and no village of real importance in St. Jones/Kent County in the 17th century. A census taken just after the formation of the county in 1680 enumerated only 99 people and subsequent settlement occurred slowly, driven mostly by migrants from Maryland who settled along the <b>streams</b> and <b>waterways</b> of central Delaware (Scharf 1888:1028-1029).|$|R
