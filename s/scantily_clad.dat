5|$|For {{the opening}} credits, Maurice Binder had {{disagreements}} with the producers {{and did not}} want to return. Designer Robert Brownjohn stepped into his place, and projected the credits on female dancers, inspired by constructivist artist László Moholy-Nagy projecting light onto clouds in the 1920s. Brownjohn's work started the tradition of <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women in the Bond films' title sequences.|$|E
5|$|Two ballets caused great {{excitement}} in Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable had its first performance. It featured a short ballet called Ballet of the Nuns. In this little ballet, <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> nuns rise from their graves to dance wantonly in the moonlight. The public loved this little supernatural ballet.|$|E
5|$|At Fontainebleau, Catherine {{arranged}} entertainments {{that lasted}} for several days, including fancy-dress jousting and chivalrous events in allegorical settings. On Mardi Gras, {{the day after the}} banquet in the meadow, knights dressed as Greeks and Trojans fought over <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> damsels trapped by a giant and a dwarf in a tower on an enchanted island. The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E
5|$|At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty {{exhibited}} two paintings: Drunken Barnaby and The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos. Drunken Barnaby is a {{scene of}} a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built, plump and rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty would continue to paint women throughout his career. The Coral Finder is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they serve}} {{alcoholic}} beverages, casino nightclubs {{are prohibited from}} offering full nudity. In 2013, Trump Taj Mahal opened the nation's first casino strip club, featuring <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> dancers. New Jersey's casinos initially had closing times like most ABC-licensed establishments, but were allowed to stay open 24 hours per day, 7 days a week starting in 1992 It is legal for a minor {{to go to a}} casino, insofar as they do not gamble, consume alcoholic beverages in public areas of the casino, or remain on the gambling floor. Because Atlantic City has ordinances prohibiting underage drinking on private property, it is illegal for a person underage 21 to drink in a casino hotel room unless a family member is present.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a small}} {{customer}} base in Japan, Alisia Dragoon sold few copies on its release (April 24, 1992); the console it was made for, the Sega Mega Drive, was not a popular device in Japan, selling 33.5million units (10% of all Mega Drives/Genesis sold around the world). The game was published earlier by Sega for North America and Europe, on March 30. However, it was a subdued release; Sega did not place major advertisements for {{the game in the}} media. To localize the contents for the Western market, the video game publisher made several cosmetic changes to Alisia Dragoon. Instead of a big-eyed heroine drawn in typical anime styling, Alisia was portrayed as a golden bikini-wearing female barbarian on the box covers outside Japan. The Western version of Alisia was likened to the <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> females in artist Boris Vallejo's work.|$|E
5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published {{felt that they had}} to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.|$|E
5|$|As soon as late 1961, United Artists {{started a}} {{marketing}} campaign to make James Bond a well-known name in North America. Newspapers received a box set of Bond's books, {{as well as}} a booklet detailing the Bond character and a picture of Ursula Andress. Eon and United Artists made licensing deals revolving around the character's tastes, having merchandising tie-ins with drink, tobacco, men's clothing and car companies. The campaign also focused on Ian Fleming's name due to the minor success of the books. After Dr. No had a successful run in Europe, Sean Connery and Terence Young did a cross-country tour in March 1963, which featured screening previews for the film and press conferences. It culminated in a well-publicised premiere in Kingston, where most of the film is set. Some of the campaign emphasised the sex appeal of the film, with the poster artwork, by Mitchell Hooks, depicting Sean Connery and four <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women. The campaign also included the 007 logo designed by Joseph Caroff with a pistol as part of the seven.|$|E
25|$|By 2000, {{the covers}} {{had begun to}} evolve from {{featuring}} a <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> couple to instead showing {{a view of the}} landscape featured in the novel.|$|E
25|$|The sketch {{also showed}} the Doctor {{examining}} a <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> female mannequin, claiming {{he thought it}} was an Auton. At the end of the sketch, the Doctor regenerated into Todd Carty.|$|E
25|$|Ventures {{into the}} genre by writers {{who were not}} devoted {{exclusively}} to science fiction also added respectability. Magazine covers of bug-eyed monsters and <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women, however, preserved {{the image of a}} sensational genre appealing only to adolescents. There was a public desire for sensation, a desire of people to be taken out of their dull lives to the worlds of space travel and adventure.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s and 1890s, Parisian {{shows such}} as the Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergère were {{featuring}} attractive <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women dancing and tableaux vivants. In this environment, an act in the 1890s featured a woman who slowly removed her clothes in a vain search for a flea crawling on her body. The People's Almanac credits the act as the origin of modern striptease.|$|E
25|$|In July 1912, Jay Sherwood and F. J. McWilliams, {{operators}} of Madison's Grand and Fair Play theaters, {{gained control of}} the Majestic, renovating and re-opening it as a movie house on September 14. Showing first-run releases from the Universal Film Company, the theater was operated by a succession of managers including William M. Fursman, Hugh Flannery, Archie M. Cox, and George B. Thompson. In 1915, Wisconsin doctors were criticized for hiring a <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> dancer from the Majestic as entertainment for their convention.|$|E
25|$|She {{was one of}} {{the first}} female emcees. Upon the {{introduction}} of Prohibition, she opened a speakeasy called the 300 Club at 151 W. 54th Street in New York City (1920). The club became famous for its troupe of 40 <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> fan dancers and for Guinan's distinctive aplomb, which made her a celebrity. Arrested several times for serving alcohol and providing entertainment, she always claimed that the patrons had brought the liquor in with them, and the club was so small that the girls had to dance close to the customers. Guinan maintained that she had never sold an alcoholic drink in her life.|$|E
25|$|The 03 (later 04) {{team were}} {{a group of}} young female journalists who {{appeared}} in the Sunday Independent during 2003 and early 2004. The articles, originally appearing in the Living supplement but soon promoted to the main section, comprised the various members of the team writing usually very poor quality short articles on a common subject. However they were usually accompanied by a large colour group photo of the team posing <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> and very occasionally topless. Eventually the feature was dropped, but not before the team had made a television appearance on the RTÉ One show Open House. They occasionally featured as a fantasy figure for fictional Sunday Tribune character Ross O'Carroll-Kelly.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, Lilac {{magazine}} {{has become the}} first Arabic magazine to show a cover with a bikini. The 22-year-old model, Huda Naccache, from Haifa, Israel is pictured posing in a black sequinned bikini. Young Animal (Yangu Animaru) is a magazine published by Hakusensha in Japan that features about 288 black and white pulp pages of seinen manga and <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women. wrapped in about 20 slick pages of color photos of teen age girls (pop stars and gravure idols) topless or in bikinis. Editor of the bulletin of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Jean Rabe resigned the post on June 5, 2013 {{in the course of}} a controversy about sexism cover in the image of no. 200 of the Bulletin, depicting a woman in a scalemail bikini.|$|E
500|$|Branham was {{critical}} of the [...] "immorality of modern women". He taught that a woman with short hair was breaking the commandments of God and ridiculed women's desire to artificially beautify themselves with makeup. Branham believed that <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women were guilty of committing adultery because their appearance motivated men to lust. A woman's place was [...] "in the kitchen".|$|E
500|$|I went to New York to meet (Madonna), begrudgingly, {{and showed}} up at an address at SoHo, {{which turned out to}} be a squat basically. Madonna was <b>scantily</b> <b>clad,</b> working out to a massive disco track. She was charismatic. She kept putting her head down on the table and talking to me, very flirtatious, and that gave me the idea for the scene in [...] "burning up", where her face is on the road, and the camera's really low and close.|$|E
500|$|In October 2003, the {{self-regulatory body}} of the French {{advertising}} industry criticized Triumph International for a campaign for the sloggi brand. At {{the center of the}} protest was a picture of <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women on billboards which advertised thongs under the slogan [...] "It's String Time". It was claimed that the ads violated the dignity of women and harmed the public perception of advertising, but the company did not adjust the campaign. It was also criticized for the same reason by leading French politicians like Ségolène Royal.|$|E
500|$|Another {{interview}} {{features an}} Amsterdam pimp, [...] "Slim", {{who owns a}} business allowing passers-by to view <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> girls in a display window; they can have sex with them on a mattress in a back room. He initially says that the display window women are not in any danger while with a client in the back room, but later clarifies that the girls should [...] "keep a hand close to the panic button" [...] located on the wall. When asked by Nolot if these activities are financed by organized crime, Slim hesitates, then says no.|$|E
500|$|The news made {{headlines}} in Europe. [...] King George {{is reported to}} have burst into the chambers of the <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> Queen, exclaiming, [...] "I have beat them! I have beat all the Americans!" [...] The French and Spanish courts were less happy with the news, as they had been supporting the Americans, allowing them to use their ports, and engaging in trade with them. [...] The action emboldened the British to demand that France and Spain close their ports to the Americans; this demand was rejected, heightening tensions between the European powers.|$|E
500|$|On December 11, 2010, Aguilera {{performed}} [...] "Express" [...] {{again on}} the seventh series of British television singing contest The X Factor. During the show, the singer cavorted around the stage in her lingerie with her [...] "army of <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> female dancers". Aguilera's performance, as well as Rihanna's one of [...] "What's My Name?", received criticism for being inappropriate for pre-watershed television. ITV was later exonerated and the performances were deemed to be [...] "at the limit" [...] of acceptability for pre-watershed television. However, Ofcom received about 2,868 complaints about the matter.|$|E
500|$|Critical opinion {{concerning}} [...] The World Before the Flood {{was divided}} when the painting, {{along with two}} other of Etty's works, was exhibited at the 1828 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. Some reviewers were intensely critical of the piece. A writer in the Literary Gazette called the painting a [...] "deadly sin against good taste", describing the background as [...] "unnecessarily harsh and crude" [...] with [...] "much to blame and lament" [...] and the dancing figures [...] "outrageous", complaining that the women reminded him not of Paradise Lost, but of the <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> witches in Robert Burns's Tam o' Shanter.|$|E
500|$|Allan Williams, the Beatles' {{unofficial}} manager, {{arranged a}} residency {{for them in}} Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, left four days later, contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider for {{what would be a}} 3½-month residency. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes: [...] "They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, the PTC {{targeted}} {{an episode}} of the Fox series Glee, stating that the episode featured outfits that were <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> and guest-star Britney Spears going shopping in lingerie, calling it, [...] "an endorsement of narcotics abuse, public masturbation, and school-sanctioned burlesque." [...] They were also criticizing it for making an episode idolizing Britney in the first place, stating: [...] "Perhaps most troubling is the deification of a troubled popstar into a symbol of empowerment and self-esteem." [...] On October 20, PTC criticized GQ magazine for featuring three Glee stars posing in risque outfits; the PTC statement said that the photoshoot [...] "borders on pedophilia." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye Baby" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who complimented {{the composition and}} lyrics, but were disappointed with Madonna's vocal delivery. The song received limited release worldwide, peaking at number seven in Italy, and also charting in Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland. Madonna performed [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] on the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards and on her Girlie Show World Tour the same year. For both performances, she was dressed as a Victorian gentleman in tailcoat and top hat. She and her backup singers danced with three <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women in a brothel-style setting, while singing the song. Critics and authors noted the gender bending and role play in the performance, and {{found it to be}} a response to misogyny.|$|E
500|$|As a pre-order incentive, the demo disc of God of War II {{was made}} {{available}} to all customers who pre-ordered the game. On March 1, 2007, Sony held a media event that featured <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women and a dead goat in Athens {{as part of the}} game's marketing campaign. The following month, the Daily Mail learned of the event from the UK Official PlayStation Magazine, called it a [...] "depraved promotion stunt", and reported that Member of Parliament and anti-video game violence campaigner Keith Vaz said he would understand if the incident resulted in a boycott of Sony products. In response, Sony said the event had been sensationalized with hyperbole and that the article contained several inaccuracies, but apologized for the event.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} the episode's {{original}} American {{broadcast on}} April 30, 2009, the official NBC Parks and Recreation website launched a duplicate of the Sullivan Street Pit social networking site which was featured in the episode, complete with photos of the pit, the list of [...] "friends" [...] from the show and a link to Mark's page and his photos with <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women. The pit page, as well as the regular NBC website, also included the actual video of Aubrey Plaza pretending to drink wine and get drunk, as it was featured on the episode. Schur said for those scenes, [...] "We just gave Aubrey a camera and told her to just drink wine and talk to the camera." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{contemporary}} Spanish {{attitude toward}} paintings of nudes was unique in Europe. Although such works were appreciated by some connoisseurs and intellectuals within Spain, they were generally treated with suspicion. Low necklines were commonly worn by women during the period, {{but according to}} the art historian Zahira Veliz, [...] "the codes of pictorial decorum would not easily permit a known lady to be painted in this way". For Spaniards of the 17th century, the issue of the nude in art was tied up with concepts of morality, power, and aesthetics. This attitude is reflected in the literature of the Spanish Golden Age, in works such as Lope de Vega's play La quinta de Florencia, which features an aristocrat who commits rape after viewing a <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> figure in a mythological painting by Michelangelo.|$|E
500|$|Fast Five (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was {{released}} on iTunes on April 25, 2011, and on CD on May 3, 2011, by ABKCO Records. [...] It features many reggaeton and rhythmic Latin tracks, including songs by Don Omar, Busta Rhymes and many others, with three pieces from Tyler's original score for the film: [...] "Assembling the Team", [...] "Mad Skills" [...] and [...] "Fast Five Suite". [...] Music guide AllMusic awarded the album 3 stars out of 5, commenting that [...] "The goal here is to accompany a picture that, as usual, is packed with driving sequences involving flashy cars, beautiful, <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women, and muscled men. That goal is accomplished with this beat-heavy music and the gruff, aggressive Latin rapping." [...] Ludacris collaborated with Slaughterhouse and Claret Jai for the soundtrack's lead single, [...] "Furiously Dangerous".|$|E
500|$|Posters and {{publicity}} photos were often tantalizing. Women appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed {{in the films}} themselves. In some cases actresses with small parts in films (or {{in the case of}} Dolores Murray in her publicity still for The Common Law, no part at all) appeared <b>scantily</b> <b>clad.</b> Hays became outraged at the steamy pictures circulating in newspapers around the country. The original Hays Code contained an often-ignored note about advertising imagery, but he wrote an entirely new advertising screed {{in the style of the}} Ten Commandments that contained a set of twelve prohibitions. The first seven addressed imagery. They prohibited women in undergarments, women raising their skirts, suggestive poses, kissing, necking, and other suggestive material. The last five concerned advertising copy and prohibited misrepresentation of the film's contents, [...] "salacious copy", and the word [...] "courtesan".|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Janet {{signaled}} the singer's transformation from conservative teen role model to adult sex symbol. In You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996), Lilly J. Goren observed that [...] " [...] 1993 album Janet {{moved away from}} politically driven lyrics to songs about love and sex-lyrics that could capitalize on her new sexy, more <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> image in MTV music videos. Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue." [...] Reporter Edna Gunderson commented: [...] "The woman whose hourglass torso and sensual gyrating have made her MTV's reigning sex kitten is today a vision of wholesome beauty." [...] Professor and social critic Camille Paglia expressed: [...] "Janet's unique persona combines bold, brash power with quiet sensitively and womanly mystery. Her latest music is lightning and moonglow." ...|$|E
500|$|The two writers most {{identified}} with Planet Stories are Leigh Brackett and Ray Bradbury, {{both of whom}} set many of their stories on a romanticized version of Mars that owed much to the depiction of Barsoom {{in the works of}} Edgar Rice Burroughs. [...] Bradbury's work for Planet included an early story in his Martian Chronicles sequence. [...] Brackett's best-known work for the magazine was a series of adventures featuring Eric John Stark, which began in the summer of 1949. [...] Brackett and Bradbury collaborated on one story, [...] "Lorelei of the Red Mist", which appeared in 1946; it was generally well-received, although one letter to the magazine complained that the story's treatment of sex, though mild by modern standards, was too explicit. [...] The artwork also emphasized attractive women, with a <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> damsel in distress or alien princess on almost every cover.|$|E
500|$|For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty {{exhibited}} three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The {{latter was}} {{a portrait of}} the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it [...] "will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent.|$|E
500|$|A {{single mother}} with two children, Cher {{realized}} that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers {{for more than half of}} 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, [...] "I never thought I would want to do disco... it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé riding a black horse over an open, deserted plain. As the horse lifts off the ground, scenes of Beyoncé {{standing}} atop a ruined vehicle are shown, as she leads a large army of women. Additional scenery includes a large bull {{in the middle}} of the battleground and a large banner featuring an African themed drawing of Beyoncé. A woman seemingly nailed on a cross is later seen. As several <b>scantily</b> <b>clad</b> women are shown, a SWAT team of men charge towards the battlefield as a sample from Major Lazer's [...] "Pon de Floor" [...] is played. As the male forces arrive, Beyoncé, is wearing a large golden helm and is surrounded by a lion, a large group of women prepared for battle and banners featuring Beyoncé insignia. As the song begins, Beyoncé removes her armor and confronts the male army, engaging in a series of shoulder-thrusting dance routines.|$|E
