40|$|The {{concurrent}} use of karst aquifers as drinking water resources and receptors of {{combined sewer overflow}} lacking appropriate pre-treatment may cause conflicts between drinking water supply and storm water management. A <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> (SWT) for combined wastewater is identified {{as the source of}} sporadic contamination of a karst spring (Gallusquelle, "Schwabische Alb", SW Germany) used for public water supply. Spring water quality was examined by routine and event sampling and by evaluating physicochemical and microbiological parameters. The total number of microbial colonies growing at 20 A degrees C and the number of Escherichia coli colonies rose to values up to four orders of magnitude higher than background, 2 - 5 days after overflow of the SWT. High concentrations of chloride, sodium, and total organic carbon (TOC) and high values of turbidity coincide with this increase. However, high bacterial contamination is also observed while turbidity and TOC are low. Several wastewater-related organic micro-pollutants such as chlorinated and non-chlorinated organophosphates were detected in the SWT and, depending on their K (ow) values and their biodegradability, in lower concentrations at the spring...|$|E

40|$|In {{the near}} future in the Netherlands many {{reservoirs}} {{will have to be}} built to abate the pollution of the surface <b>water</b> by overflowing <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> from combined sewer systems [Kluck, 1992 -a]. These reservoirs, called <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> sedimentation <b>tanks,</b> reduce the pollution in two ways. The most important is by simply storing a part of the sewage (waste <b>water</b> and <b>storm</b> <b>water)</b> and thus reducing the quantity of overflowing water. The second is by providing flow conditions in which particles can settle, so that the overflowing water is less polluted. There are no satisfactory design methods - taking into account the time-varying inflow - for this kind of structures. The aim of the study is to develop design methods for these tanks such that the overall efficiency of the tanks will be optimal. A mathematical model (PHOENICS package) is used to describe the flow and settling in the reservoirs. By using the time-dependent, 2 -DV or 3 -D mathematical model the effect of changes in lay-out for various shapes of reservoirs can be investigated under variable flows. The course of this study has been defined as follows: First a mathematical model in which only the water flow is considered will be set up. Computational results will be compared with measurements on a scale model. The flow model will be calibrated with these measurements. Next the particle movement will be modelled. Computations will be compared with experimental data and the model will be calibrated. With the validated model different designs of tanks will be judged and optimal working tanks will be designed. The work done in the period February 1992 to July 1993 is presented in four reports [Kluck, 1992 -a, 1992 -b, 1993 -a and 1993 -b] (written in Dutch). The first report presents the objectives of the research and the present design methods for <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> sedimentation <b>tanks.</b> In the second report the choice for using PHOENICS to set up a mathematical model has been made. Also a start has been made with setting up a model for water movement only. The next report deals with the problems encountered in modelling a varying free-surface flow. Finally in the fourth report further progress in modelling the water flow is presented. In the future the most important parts of these reports will be translated into English. The present report describes the progress which has been made from July 1993 until July 1994. In chapter 2 {{a brief description of the}} flow model is given.

The composite samples of drained <b>storm</b> <b>water</b> runoff sediments were collected at the sedimentation tanks located in the districts of Verkiai and Karoliniskes on the 2 nd of June, 2008.

The results showed that the particles with the particle size of 1 – 2 mm were obtained up to 10 m from the inlet and the particles with the size of 0, 01 – 0, 05 mm mainly were obtained close to the outlet of sedimentation tank. It is recommended to divide the sedimentation tank in two parts in order to get proper management of sediments: the particles that size is 1 – 10 mm could be managed as waste from grit chambers and particles of smaller size could be managed as primary sludge.
