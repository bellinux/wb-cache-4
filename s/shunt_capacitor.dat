25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitor</b> is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because reactive power does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E

Distortion of sinusoidal {{voltage and current}} waveforms caused by harmonics {{is one of the}} major power quality concerns in electric power industry. The efforts have been made in recent years to improve the management of harmonic distortions in power systems. Standards for harmonic control have been established. Instruments for harmonic measurements are widely available. The area of power system harmonic analysis has also experienced significant advancement. More harmonics are being injected into distribution systems. Adding <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitors</b> may lead to high distortion levels. The capacitor placement and sizing problem is a nonlinear integer optimization problem, with locations and ratings of <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitors</b> being discrete values.
