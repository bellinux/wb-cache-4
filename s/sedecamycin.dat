40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} subcutaneously administered <b>sedecamycin</b> on experimental Treponema hyodysen-teriae infection in mice were evaluated. <b>Sedecamycin</b> was more active than tiamulin and lincomycin. The efficacy of <b>sedecamycin</b> upon subcutaneous administration {{was similar to}} that upon oral administration. <b>Sedecamycin</b> given subcutaneously provided similar degrees of protection in bile duct-ligated and intact mice. Pharmacokinetic studies utilizing a liquid chromatographic technique were carried out to determine the concentration of <b>sedecamycin</b> in the cecum, the site of T. hyodysenteriae infection in mice. Little <b>sedecamycin</b> was found; however, lankacidinol, a major metabolite of <b>sedecamycin,</b> was found in the cecal contents of intact mice after subcutaneous or oral administration of <b>sedecamycin.</b> Lankacidinol was also found in the cecal contents of bile duct-ligated mice, although the concentration found after subcutaneous administration of <b>sedecamycin</b> was much lower than that found after subcutaneous or oral administration to intact mice. These results indicate that <b>sedecamycin</b> is excreted directly into the intestinal tract as an active metabolite by a route other than the bile duct. It is suggested that this intestinal excretion {{plays an important role in}} the efficacy of subcutaneously administered <b>sedecamycin</b> against cecal infection of mice by T. hyodysenteriae. Treponema hyodysenteriae, the etiologic agent of swine dysentery, is characterized by mucohemorragic diarrhea (9...|$|E

The MICs of <b>sedecamycin</b> against 79 field isolates of T. hyodysenteriae {{ranged from}} 0. 78 to 12. 5 micrograms/ml, the MIC for 90 % of the strains tested (MIC 90) being 3. 13 micrograms/ml. The protective and therapeutic effects of <b>sedecamycin</b> were {{compared with those of}} carbadox, tiamulin, and lincomycin against experimental infection with T. hyodysenteriae in mice. The protective effect of <b>sedecamycin</b> was similar to that of carbadox, two times more potent than that of tiamulin, and three times greater than that of lincomycin. In the therapeutic test, <b>sedecamycin</b> showed activity similar to that of carbadox and was two times more active than both tiamulin and lincomycin. At doses of 10 mg or more of <b>sedecamycin</b> per kg, the recurrence of shedding of T. hyodysenteriae into the feces of mice was not detected for at least 8 weeks postmedication...|$|E
