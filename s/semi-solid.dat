25|$|Definition: Combining {{particles}} into a <b>semi-solid</b> or solid mass via liquid.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogenation {{converts}} liquid {{vegetable oils}} into solid or <b>semi-solid</b> fats, {{such as those}} present in margarine. Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties, such as the melting range, which is why liquid oils become <b>semi-solid.</b> Solid or <b>semi-solid</b> fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product. Because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal fats, are available {{in a wide range}} of consistencies, and have other desirable characteristics (such as increased oxidative stability and longer shelf life), they are the predominant fats used as shortening in most commercial baked goods.|$|E
25|$|Partially {{hydrogenated}} oils {{have been}} used in food for many reasons. Hydrogenation increases product shelf life and decreases refrigeration requirements. Many baked foods require <b>semi-solid</b> fats to suspend solids at room temperature; partially hydrogenated oils have the right consistency to replace animal fats such as butter and lard at lower cost. They are also an inexpensive alternative to other <b>semi-solid</b> oils such as palm oil.|$|E
50|$|Licaps {{capsules}} are two-piece gelatin or {{hydroxypropyl methylcellulose}} capsules {{designed specifically for}} containing liquids or <b>semi-solids.</b> Licaps can be used when drugs' ingredients are more stable as a liquid, such as in dietary supplements.|$|R
50|$|Actavis, plc has 27 global R&D {{facilities}} {{focusing on}} the development of modified release products, solid oral dosages, transdermals, <b>semi-solids,</b> liquids and injectables around the world.The company’s R&D facilities are located in Belgium, Bulgaria, China, France, Iceland, Italy, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Northern Ireland, Romania, UK and USA.|$|R
25|$|Microwave {{volumetric}} heating (MVH) is {{the newest}} available pasteurization technology. It uses microwaves to heat liquids, suspensions, or <b>semi-solids</b> in a continuous flow. Because MVH delivers energy evenly and deeply into the whole body of a flowing product, it allows for gentler and shorter heating, so that almost all heat-sensitive substances in the milk are preserved.|$|R
25|$|Parmigiano cheese {{typically}} contains cheese crystals, <b>semi-solid</b> to gritty crystalline {{spots that}} at least partially consist of the amino acid tyrosine.|$|E
25|$|The food {{industry}} uses hydrogenation to completely or partially saturate the unsaturated fatty acids in liquid vegetable {{fats and oils}} to convert them into solid or <b>semi-solid</b> fats, {{such as those in}} margarine and shortening.|$|E
25|$|Dietary fiber has {{distinct}} physicochemical properties. Most <b>semi-solid</b> foods, {{fiber and}} fat are {{a combination of}} gel matrices which are hydrated or collapsed with microstructural elements, globules, solutions or encapsulating walls. Fresh fruit and vegetables are cellular materials.|$|E
50|$|Frozen dessert is {{the generic}} name for desserts made by {{freezing}} liquids, <b>semi-solids,</b> {{and sometimes even}} solids. They may be based on flavored water (shave ice, ice pops, sorbet, snow cones, etc.), on fruit purées (such as sorbet), on milk and cream (most ice creams), on custard (frozen custard and some ice creams), on mousse (semifreddo), and others.|$|R

50|$|The {{company has}} 40 {{manufacturing}} facilities in five continents providing {{the company with}} a core leadership position in modified release products, solid oral dosages, transdermals, <b>semi-solids,</b> liquids and injectables.The company’s manufacturing facilities are located in Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Northern-Ireland, Italy, Malta, Puerto Rico, Romania, Singapore, Serbia, Thailand, UK and USA.|$|R
25|$|Petroleum jelly, {{petrolatum}} or soft paraffin is a <b>semi-solid</b> {{mixture of}} hydrocarbons originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing properties. The raw material for petroleum jelly was discovered in 1859 by Robert Chesebrough, a chemist from New York. In 1870, this product was branded as Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.|$|E
25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} used in various German breads and desserts {{as well as in}} Polish cuisine. Like sesame seeds, poppy seeds are often added to {{hamburger}} buns. Le Snak is a food product made by Uncle Toby's of New Zealand, consisting of three poppy-seed crackers and a portion of <b>semi-solid</b> cheese.|$|E
25|$|The {{end-product}} of catabolism {{of protein}} metabolism in animals is nitrogen. Animals must excrete this {{in the form of}} nitrogenous compounds. Ostriches are uricotelic. They excrete nitrogen as the complex nitrogenous waste compound uric acid, and related derivatives. Uric acid's low solubility in water gives a <b>semi-solid</b> paste consistency to the ostrich's nitrogenous waste.|$|E
5000|$|This is in {{contrast}} to traditional thermal processing, which relies on conduction and convection from hot surfaces to deliver energy into the product. Liquids, suspensions, or <b>semi-solids</b> heated by MVH do not come into contact with hot surfaces; this minimizes thermal damage to functional components, and allows thick and viscous products to be heated without fouling.|$|R
50|$|The {{last part}} of the small {{intestine}} is the ileum. This also contains villi and vitamin B12; bile acids and any residue nutrients are absorbed here. When the chyme is exhausted of its nutrients the remaining waste material changes into the <b>semi-solids</b> called feces, which pass to the large intestine, where bacteria in the gut flora further break down residual proteins and starches.|$|R
40|$|Saliva is {{expected}} to be of significance for the perception of food stimuli in the mouth. Mixing the food with saliva, including breakdown and dilution, is considered to be of large importance for <b>semi-solids</b> as these products are masticated without chewing. It is known that there are large variations in composition of saliva originating from different glands and different subjects. In this study we investigated how variations in salivary characteristics affect sensory perception. Eighteen trained subjects participated in the study. Saliva was collected at rest and during three types of stimulation (odour, parafilm chewing and citric acid), and flow rates were determined. The collected saliva was analyzed for protein concentration, buffer capacity, mucin level and ¿-amylase activity. The salivary components measured in this study varied considerably among subjects, but also within subjects as a result of different means of stimulation. Variations in salivary components were correlated with sensory perception of a number of flavour, mouth feel and after feel attributes in the <b>semi-solids</b> mayonnaise and custard dessert. Total protein concentration and ¿-amylase activity were observed to correlate most strongly with texture perception...|$|R
25|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{is the process}} of removing contaminants from wastewater, primarily from household sewage. It includes physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove these contaminants and produce environmentally safer treated wastewater (or treated effluent). A by-product of sewage {{treatment is}} usually a <b>semi-solid</b> waste or slurry, called sewage sludge, that has to undergo further treatment before being suitable for disposal or land application.|$|E
25|$|The coordinated contractions {{of these}} layers is called {{peristalsis}} and propels the food through the tract. Food in the GI tract {{is called a}} bolus (ball of food) from the mouth down to the stomach. After the stomach, the food is partially digested and semi-liquid, and {{is referred to as}} chyme. In the large intestine the remaining <b>semi-solid</b> substance is referred to as faeces.|$|E
25|$|Fossil fuels are {{of great}} {{importance}} {{because they can be}} burned (oxidized to carbon dioxide and water), producing significant amounts of energy per unit mass. The use of coal as a fuel predates recorded history. Coal was used to run furnaces for the melting of metal ore. <b>Semi-solid</b> hydrocarbons from seeps were also burned in ancient times, but these materials were mostly used for waterproofing and embalming.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} acoustic resonance spectrometry (ARS) as an alternative process analytical technology to near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for the quantification of active pharmaceutical ingradient (API) in <b>semi-solids</b> such as creams, gels, ointments, and lotions. The ARS used for this research was an inexpensive instrument constructed from readily available parts. Acoustic-resonance spectra were collected with a frequency spectrum from 0 to 22. 05 KHz. NIR data were collected from 1100 to 2500 nm. Using 1 -point net analyte signal (NAS) calibration, NIR for the API (colloidal oatmeal [CO]) gave anr 2 prediction accuracy of 0. 971, and a standard error of performance (SEP) of 0. 517 %CO. ARS for the API resulted in anr 2 of 0. 983 and SEP of 0. 317 %CO. NAS calibration is compared with principal component regression. This research demonstrates that ARS can sometimes outperform NIR spectrometry and can be an effective analytical method for the quantification of API in <b>semi-solids.</b> ARS requires no sample preparation, provides larger penetration depths into lotions than optical techniques, and measures API concentrations faster and more accurately. These results suggest that ARS is a useful process analytical technology (PAT) ...|$|R

25|$|Advances in the {{instrumentation}} and in detection {{have expanded}} {{the number of}} applications in which pH measurements can be conducted. The devices have been miniaturized, enabling direct measurement of pH inside of living cells. In addition to measuring the pH of liquids, specially designed electrodes are available to measure the pH of <b>semi-solid</b> substances, such as foods. These have tips suitable for piercing semi-solids, have electrode materials compatible with ingredients in food, and are resistant to clogging.|$|E

25|$|This way of {{evaluation}} deals with agar-agar or gelatine containing <b>semi-solid</b> layers made {{prior to the}} experiment. Small wells are cut into the layer and filled with cells and the test substance. Cells can migrate towards the chemical gradient in the semi solid layer or under the layer as well. Some variations of the technique deal also with wells and parallel channels connected by a cut {{at the start of}} the experiment (PP-technique). Radial arrangement of PP-technique (3 or more channels) provides the possibility to compare chemotactic activity of different cell populations or study preference between ligands.|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} {{properties of}} foods - rheological, heat, and mass transfer data - are essential {{in the design}} and efficient operation of food processes and processing equipment. The transport properties of gases and liquids can be measured and predicted {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. However, in solids, <b>semi-solids,</b> and colloids, like foods materials, theoretical prediction of the engineering properties is not possible. This paper discusses the importance of transport properties in food processing, and presents some typical data, based mostly on research and pilot-plant experience in fruit and vegetable processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to improve the understanding of oral texture perception. In particular to examine the role of oral physiological processes on oral texture perception of <b>semi-solids</b> and to investigate whether individual differences in perception could be attributed to differences in oral physiology among subjects. The main results reveal that: •	Large intra-individual differences in oral physiology and sensory ratings were confirmed. •	Oral size perception results from a combination of sensory inputs from the palate and the tongue. Size itself determines the size perception of single objects, while material and weight are negligible factors. •	For particles mixed into a medium, size and type of particle influenced size perception, which is suggested to be mediated by vibration. Soft and round particles are perceived as smaller than hard and irregular particles. •	The two methods - direct-scaling and forced ranking - produce similar results on size perception. •	Some measurements of oral sensitivity correlate, such as masticatory performance and size perception of spheres. Subjects who are poor chewers are more sensitive to particles in sizes which could cause then discomfort on swallowing. •	The natural volume of saliva did not affect the texture perceptions, presumably because the subjects were used to their inherent levels of saliva. In contrast, a change in the natural amounts of saliva, realized by an artificial addition of saliva or saliva related fluids, did affect attributes related to dilution and breakdown of the product, such as thickness and melting. •	The composition of saliva exhibited correlations with the perception of numerous texture attributes. The fractions of solubles in the saliva, many of which have enzymatic, lubricative or other actions important for mastication, do seem to be important for the perception of <b>semi-solids.</b> Accordingly, the attributes for custard dessert, which is thickened mainly by starch, were especially sensitive to the activity of amylase and proteins. •	The sensation of virtually all flavour and mouth-feel attributes requires at least some tongue movement. Most attributes showed a similar pattern, with lowest attribute ratings where the tongue’s movement was restricted and gradually increasing ratings with increasing complexity of the tongue movements. An individual’s normal mastication behaviour, which exhibited the largest diversity and complexity of movements, typically resulted in the most intense sensations of flavour and mouth-feel. This suggests that consumers aim to maximize their food sensations. •	The addition of particles to a custard dessert had large effects on perception of the texture attributes. Roughness increased with increasing particle size and hardness, while smooth, slippery, creamy and fatty decreased, irrespective of type of particle. Very small particles (2 µm) also have strong effects on the perception. Subjects who perceive particles of a certain size to be large, do not perceived that same stimulus to be rough. Hence, particles need to be sufficiently small to be considered part of the stimulus. •	The primary result of an increase in stimulus temperature probably was the decrease in stimulus viscosity, which was reflected in decreased perception of thickness. With the decrease in viscosity, a number of secondary effects were observed, such as facilitated migration of fat {{to the surface of the}} product, resulting in more fatty sensations. The results demonstrate that the oral physiological parameters oral sensitivity, tongue movements, temperature and saliva composition are of importance for texture perception of <b>semi-solids.</b> Many parameters of oral physiology correlated with various texture attributes. This implies that intra-individual differences in texture perception could be attributed to variations in oral physiology. Oral physiology thus plays a role in texture perception of <b>semi-solids</b> and should be taken into account in future texture research...|$|R

On the basis of well-known procedures in the microwave domain, we present a new measurement cell equipped with a sample holder that can contain any kind of materials: solids, <b>semi-solids</b> (granular or powder materials), liquids. This technique can also characterize materials of thin thickness that are also more and more used in the RFID domain or in the realization of antennas on flexible substrates...|$|R
25|$|The Athabasca {{oil sands}} or (tar sands) are large {{deposits}} of bitumen or extremely heavy crude oil, located in northeastern Alberta, Canada – roughly centred on the boomtown of Fort McMurray. These oil sands, hosted {{primarily in the}} McMurray Formation, consist of a mixture of crude bitumen (a <b>semi-solid</b> rock-like form of crude oil), silica sand, clay minerals, and water. The Athabasca deposit is the largest known reservoir of crude bitumen {{in the world and}} the largest of three major oil sands deposits in Alberta, along with the nearby Peace River and Cold Lake deposits (the latter stretching into Saskatchewan).|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-1990s, the Fifth {{generation}} of silicone-gel breast implant {{is made of}} a <b>semi-solid</b> gel that mostly eliminates the occurrences of filler leakage ("silicone-gel bleed") and of the migration of the silicone filler from the implant-pocket to elsewhere in the woman's body. The studies Experience with Anatomical Soft Cohesive Silicone gel Prosthesis in Cosmetic and Reconstructive Breast Implant Surgery (2004) and Cohesive Silicone gel Breast Implants in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery (2005) reported low incidence-rates of capsular contracture and of device-shell rupture; and greater rates of improved medical-safety and technical-efficacy than that of early generation breast-implant devices.|$|E
25|$|Ice cream (derived {{from earlier}} iced cream or cream ice) is a {{sweetened}} frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors. It is typically {{sweetened with sugar}} or sugar substitutes. Typically, flavourings and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, <b>semi-solid</b> foam that is solid at very low temperatures (<nbsp&). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.|$|E
40|$|Background: Health {{status of}} infants is a {{sensitive}} indicator {{of development and}} factors influencing it need to be better understood. Objectives: This {{study was conducted to}} search for factors associated with morbidity among infants and to find out their influence on weight gain during infancy. Materials and Methods: This longitudinal study was undertaken in south India from November 2004 till April 2006. A birth cohort of all children born during first 6 months of the study period were assessed at enrollment and followed up monthly till they attained 1 year of age. Results: Incidence of morbidity among infants was found to be least among those exclusively breast fed (EBF) for 6 months and most when EBF for less than 6 months (P = 0. 045). It was also more when infants were weaned with a combination of animal milk, formula milk, <b>semi-solids</b> and solid diet and least when weaned only with <b>semi-solids</b> and solids (P = 0. 018). Diarrheal episodes were more in infants who were bottle-fed (P < 0. 001). Weight gain between 6 th and 12 th month of infancy was found to be significantly affected by various morbidities (P = 0. 001). Incidence of morbidities was less among preterm babies and more among partially immunized (P < 0. 001) babies with birth order ≥ 3 (P = 0. 012), babies of mothers with low socio-economic and educational status. Delayed milestones during infancy was seen more in babies with history of birth asphyxia (P = 0. 018). Conclusion: Several factors influenced incidence of morbidities and these morbidities had a negative effect on weight gain. Hence these factors need to be addressed to promote better child health...|$|R
25|$|A solvent {{can carry}} a {{supersaturated}} load of gas in solution. Whether it {{will come out of}} solution in the bulk of the solvent to form bubbles will depend on a number of factors. Something which reduces surface tension, or adsorbs gas molecules, or locally reduces solubility of the gas, or causes a local reduction in static pressure in a fluid may result in a bubble nucleation or growth. This may include velocity changes and turbulence in fluids and local tensile loads in solids and <b>semi-solids.</b> Lipids and other hydrophobic surfaces may reduce surface tension (blood vessel walls may have this effect). Dehydration may reduce gas solubility in a tissue due to higher concentration of other solutes, and less solvent to hold the gas.|$|R
500|$|Apart from frozen remains, {{the only}} soft tissue known {{is from a}} {{specimen}} that was preserved in a petroleum seep in Starunia, Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths {{have been found in}} the northern parts of Siberia and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the Arctic Circle, in permafrost. It appears that soft tissue was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate was milder during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded prior to discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This [...] "natural mummification" [...] required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or <b>semi-solids</b> such as silt, mud and icy water, which then froze.|$|R
