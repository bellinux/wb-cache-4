The physical characteristics of the real profiles that transformers are subjected to (deterministic and random), and the uncertainty associated to transformer's specific parameters used in its thermal model, require a probabilistic approach for the study of expected LOL.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{maximum demand}} currently and {{most widely used}} method in Australia is to simply follow Australian Standard guidelines and sum together the loads and find a <b>suitable</b> <b>transformer</b> rating. This practice is considered to have many flaws specifically from a construction and financial {{point of view and}} it is this lack of diversity, which this paper will be focusing on. Because of not giving due consideration for diversity, many transformers are largely oversized and as such can easily put strain on low budget contracts issued by clients as larger transformers not only cost more for the unit itself but will also increase structural support costs to adequately support the increased size and weight that the unit will have. The difficulty in attempting to create a more optimized transformer design is attributed to having to understand the ship loader operations at key intervals since maximum demand is the maximum load at certain time intervals.

Introduction: Alternating current will {{perhaps in}} time {{supplant}} direct current for traction purposes {{as it did}} in lighting, {{with the advent of the}} long distance high potential transmission, but as yet the direct current plays a very important part in both power and traction. It has however the disadvantage of being difficult to transmit long distances without great loss. This is due to the inherent limitations in the production of high voltages from the direct current generator. Commutation at voltages sufficiently high to warrant economical transmission over long distances, is extremely difficult. Sparking and other difficulties at once arise which place the voltage within the limitations mentioned. The alternating current generator has not only the advantage of higher voltage, but by means of <b>suitable</b> <b>transformer</b> devices the voltage may be raised to any desired value for economical transmission. It will be readily seen, therefore, that alternating current machinery will supplant the direct current for traction purposes. In this thesis only direct current is treated. Direct current on a small scale and for local distribution fulfills more nearly the requirements demanded for traction purposes such as is needed on railways. The discussions are confined to the electrical equipment of the car only, the mechanical construction being referred to only as needed in line with the electrical connections...|$|E

Several algorithms, that perform these functions and are suitable for implementation on microprocessors, have been proposed in the past. This thesis describes and evaluates an improved technique for modelling inverse-time overcurrent relay characteristics. This technique, which is used in a digital overcurrent relaying algorithm, is simple and requires a modest amount of computer memory. The proposed algorithm performs most computations in an off-line mode and, therefore, requires few on-line computations. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using computer simulations. Some test results are reported in the thesis. Digital algorithms that can detect winding faults in power transformers are described in the thesis.

Typically, Photovoltaic (PV) strings’ output voltage is limited to ~ 1500 V due to safety constraints, and thus requires boosting to higher DC levels (non-isolated step-up DC-DC <b>transformer)</b> <b>suitable</b> for High-Voltage DC (HVDC) and AC grid applications in order to provide the required DC-Link voltage level. Nevertheless, conventional non-isolated DC-DC converters provide a limited practical gain due to their parasitic elements. Other options include isolated DC-DC converters that utilize costly high-frequency transformers with limited power capability. Moreover, the isolation requirements of transformers in HVDC significantly increase the footprint of the converters. High-frequency transformers for high-power applications are hard to design and are usually associated with higher losses. Alternatively, connecting conventional DC-DC converters in different combinations can provide higher gains to the required levels, while maintaining the high efficiency requirements. This thesis proposes the cascade and/or series connection of DC-DC modules as a solution to the high-conversion ratio requirement, based on Cuk and Single-Ended Primary Inductor Converter (SEPIC) topologies, whose continuous input current is suitable for PV applications, and reduces the bulky capacitor filters at the input side. Detailed theoretical models of the proposed topologies are first derived, then their trends are practically verified by low power prototypes. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to assess the effect of small variations to the parasitic inductors’ resistances on the overall system gain, where the input inductor is found to have a considerable effect, especially at higher duty ratios (i. e. higher gains).

40|$|Summary. The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} applicability of extending inverse feedback techniques to electrodynamic loudspeakers by finding first, what the general limitations were, and second, how much improvement in speaker characteristics could be secured. A simple lumped-constant representation of low-frequency speaker behavior was used for analysis of various types of electrical damping. Constants were determined for a typical speaker and mounting, and also for a <b>suitable</b> output <b>transformer.</b> The resulting combined equivalent circuit could be used to calculate the characteristics of the low-frequency cutoff, but was of little help for the upper cutoff. No simple, adequate representation of high-frequency speaker behavior could be found. An attempt was made to measure the frequency characteristics of the voice coil motional voltage by bridge measurements, but this was abandoned because of difficulties inherent in the method and lack of proper sized bridge elements. Three methods applicable to practical feedback systems were next used to obtain a speaker motional voltage. It was impossible to get usable high frequency data with two of the types, at least with the versions used, and the third gave misleading results. It appeared that the more obvious ways of obtaining a motional voltage were not as simple to use as one might expect from references in the literature. More accurate data obtained with a frequency modulation type of displacement pickup (whose output is much less convenient to use in a practical feedback system than the output of a velocity pick-up) put the upper limit to the use of feedback from 4 to 9 kc in a few typical cases, on a velocity to voice coil voltage basis, and with the latter held constant. Use of a high impedance amplifier would probably extend this limit at least one octave, but limitations in the measuring systems prevented finding the actual limit in this case. Transient response tests were made, and the results indicated qualitatively that electrical damping has noticeably less effect on speaker performance at the middle and high audio frequencies-than at the lower ones. This means that the beneficial effects of feedback would be less at the higher frequencies than at the low. Velocity-type feedback is potentially a useful means of controlling speaker damping and providing some distortion reduction in the speaker itself, at least in the range of piston action. Velocity-type feedback is a considerably more effective means of speaker damping than. the usual method of impedance reduction by feedback from the output of the amplifier. Further work is necessary to find the exact upper limit to the use of feedback with typical speakers, and to develop a velocity pickup which can cover all the usable feedback range. Frequency response and distortion tests on an actual speaker feedback system are needed to evaluate definitely the worth of such systems...|$|R

The Prussian state railways preferred to electrify the Euskirchen-Trier and the Altona-Kiel lines, but the army command had objections in both cases. In addition, lignite deposits in the area meant that a power station with short supply routes could be constructed at Muldenstein. Construction on the Muldenstein railway power station started on 18 January 1910 and about two months later the construction of a substation in Bitterfeld and the erection of overhead contact wire for the first section from Dessau to Bitterfeld began. [...] The state police approved the power supply and contact line systems on 4 January 1911 and trial operations with a voltage of 5 kV and a supply line voltage of 30 kV began on 18 January 1911 using a borrowed Baden State Railways class A1 locomotive, which had previously had test runs on the Ammergau Railway with <b>transformers</b> <b>suitable</b> for 5.5 kV. From 25 March, after increasing the supply line voltage to 60 kV, the catenary voltage was increased to 10 kV for test runs so that the newly built WSL 10502 HALLE and WGL 10204 HALLE locomotives could be tested at 10 kV. On 1 April, the line was opened for public operations by the Prussian Minister Paul von Breitenbach in the presence of members of parliament. After the “Convention relating to the implementation of electric traction" [...] was established by the state railway administrations of Prussia-Hesse, Bavaria and Baden in 1912, it was agreed in the autumn of 1913 that a voltage of 15 kV and frequency of 16 2/3 Hz would be adopted. In order to extend electrified service to the south, a sub-station was put into operation on 1 May 1914 in Wahren along with a 60 kV feeder line. By 1 June 1914, electric rail operations had been extended to Neuwiederitzsch and beyond to parts of the Leipzig freight ring, but after the outbreak of the First World War it was closed in the first few days of August 1914 so that the materials could be completely recovered. According to Tetzlaff, the whole line to Leipzig Hauptbahnhof was taken into operation by electric traction in June 1914, but this is considered unlikely.|$|R
40|$|For decades until now, {{manufacturers}} and end users alike have been {{absorbed by the}} challenge of extending {{the life span of}} power transformers. The life span of power transformers averages between 50 to 70 years, as the high capital cost of its replacement is astronomical. It is therefore essential that the utilization of the transformer can be optimized to the fullest extent of its maximum lifespan. It is generally accepted that the reliability of power and distribution transformers decreases with the ageing of their insulation system. This ageing is mainly due to the degradation of the characteristics of the insulating materials. In determining the life consumption of the transformer, measuring the degree of polymerization of the insulating paper is the more reliable way. However, this intrusive test requires a sample of the paper which means that the transformer has to be taken out from service and that portion of the unit be destroyed in the process. Therefore this method is not <b>suitable</b> for the <b>transformers</b> in service. The operating conditions of power and distribution transformers and other oil filled electrical equipment are usually monitored by measuring dissolved gasses in the insulating oil using gas chromatography. The analysis of oil samples does not represent a significant difficulty. Most electrical equipment is provided with sampling valve and a number of physical and chemical analyses can be performed both in the field and in the laboratory to determine the oil condition. Moreover, the insulating oil is widely used in predictive maintenance because its degradation under faulty operating conditions such as thermal defects, arcing or partial discharges, will produce gases that partially dissolved by the oil and their analysis may indicate the type or severity of the fault. The deterioration of transformer insulation is primarily a function of temperature and time, but it is also influenced by other factors such as moisture and oxygen content. Therefore, most predictive maintenance techniques of the transformer are focused on the monitoring of these factors. This is quite satisfactory for the assessment of the insulation conditions of the liquid. However, the techniques adopted such as the gas-in-oil analysis cannot give an account on the condition of the paper insulation. Similar sampling technique cannot be easily implemented with cellulosic paper due to the bad accessibility from the outside of the transformer tank. Therefore, a method of assessing the condition of the paper without involving the paper sample itself is required. An in-depth oil analysis had shown the presence of 2 -fulfuraldehyde and related compounds, where these compounds are known to be specific to the degradation of cellulose and other paper constituents [1 - 3]. One such in-depth oil analysis is known as the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). When the cellulosic insulation materials within a transformer undergo degradation, either by normal aging or by being involved with an incipient fault, among the by-products formed are carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases and derivatives of the aromatic compound called furan. Thus the amount of furans present in the oil might be a good indication of the cellulosic insulation condition. In this work, the degradation of Kraft transformer insulation paper is examined by means of monitoring the increase in the concentration of furan compounds as well as the increase of moisture content. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a reliable, {{versatile}} and rigorous method for {{high frequency power}} transformer modeling is searched and established. The purpose is to apply this model to sensitivity analysis of FRA (Frequency Response Analysis) which is a quite new diagnostic method for assessing the mechanical integrity of power transformer windings on-site. The method should be versatile {{in terms of being}} able to estimate internal and external overvoltages and resonances. Another important aspect is that the method chosen is <b>suitable</b> for real <b>transformer</b> geometries. In order to verify the suitability of the model for real transformers, a specific test-object is used. This is a 20 MVA transformer, and details are given in chapter 1. 4. The high frequency power transformer model is established from geometrical and constructional information from the manufacturer, together with available material characteristics. All circuit parameters in the lumped circuit representation is calculated based on these data. No empirical modifications need to be performed. Comparison shows capability of reasonable accuracy in the range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz utilizing a disc-to-disc representation. A compromise between accuracy of model due to discretisation and complexity of the model in a turn-to-turn representation is inevitable. The importance of the iron core is emphasized through a comparison of representations with/without the core included. Frequency-dependent phenomena are accurately represented using an isotropic equivalent for windings and core, even with a coarse mesh for the FEM-model. This is achieved through a frequency-dependent complex permeability representation of the materials. This permeability is deduced from an analytical solution of the frequency-dependent magnetic field inside the conductors and the core. The importance of dielectric losses in a transformer model is also assessed. Since published data on the high frequency properties of pressboard are limited, some initial measurements are done on impregnated pressboard at different temperatures and moisture-levels. Tanδ is found to be twice the corresponding value for impregnated paper at frequencies from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. Moisture has a minor effect on the losses when frequency approaches 1 MHz. Service-aged paper (impregnated) is also tested in order to investigate other ageing-effects than produced water, but the test show the same decreasing influence at higher frequencies as impregnated pressboard with moisture added. The following main conclusions were drawn from this work: • A simple, analytical approach cannot be used to build a versatile high frequency power transformer model. The reason being mainly the lack of a proper representation of the iron core, since a FEM-representation without the core did not increase coherence to measurements significantly. • A proper representation of the iron core is very important for the calculation of inductances. Losses mainly originate from the core at intermediate frequencies (10 - 200 kHz), and not only from eddy currents in the windings as traditionally assumed. The permeability seem to be of less importance {{as long as it is}} well above permeability for oil, since the internal resonances mainly depends on the leakage inductances. The core leg equivalent is important for the leakage field and determines the leakage inductances and winding losses. • Using a frequency-dependent complex permeability in a FEM-simulation makes possible an accurate representation of core and windings using a coarse mesh. If coating resistivity is sufficiently low to create interlaminar currents/ losses, the iron laminates should be represented by a 2 -dimensional complex permeability. Coating parameters are seldom available. • Dielectric properties of power transformer insulating materials depend on frequency, temperature, moisture, ageing and pressure. Temperature has minor influence on FRA-signatures, other parameters have practically no influence. • Impulse- and resonant overvoltages both internally and on terminals can be analysed using this method with sufficient accuracy, provided the discretisation of the winding is sufficiently refined regarding the frequencies involved. Since terminal behaviour is given by the internal geometry and material parameters, it is assumed that internal behaviour is related to the accuracy of the terminal behaviour. • FRA sensitivity to axial displacement is 1. 2 % of total axial height. The sensitivity to radial deformation (forced buckling) is found to be a buckling depth of 9 % of the radius of the winding. Turn-to-turn short-circuits could not be modeled correctly since the lumped elements includes several turns. Disc-todisc short circuits are easily detected. Axial bending is not detectable. Detection of loose windings and aged insulation is improbable and will be dependent on the available sensitivity (mainly related to the repeatability of the measurements and the reference utilized for comparison). The contributions in this work relates to different topics such as; Frequency-dependent iron core representation in FEM, study of interlaminar currents and its effect on the internal magnetic field, characterization of high frequency dielectric properties of impregnated pressboard and service-aged impregnated paper, procedure for evaluation of internal/external overvoltages, and finally sensitivity guidelines for the application of FRA to mechanical deformations. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
