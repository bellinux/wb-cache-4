We present a 3 D {{interaction}} model for exploring volume image data by extending the capabilities of 3 D <b>slice</b> <b>plane</b> widgets. Our model provides the ability to navigate through a volume image in a fast, intuitive manner, using object-relative user navigation. Employ-ing a cut-fold-slide analogy, 3 D <b>slice</b> <b>plane</b> widgets are rotated and translated relative to each other. The planes can be progressively cut to extend existing views and form staircase-like arrangements, minimizing occlusion and visual clutter problems that result from multiple, disconnected slice planes. Extending existing views also allows cutting actions to be easily “mended”, providing users {{with the ability to}} return to a previous “good ” view and explore again. A user makes cuts by drawing “hinge ” lines on a <b>slice</b> <b>plane</b> widget, in any orientation, dividing the <b>slice</b> <b>plane</b> into two pieces.

It is our goal to automatically create these toolpaths for machining and eliminate the complex planning traditionally associated with CNC machining. In this paper, we consider a problem that arises in automating this process - visibility to the surface of a model that is rotated about a fourth axis.

We introduce six parameters to describe the <b>slice</b> <b>plane,</b> and we formulate the coordinate mapping from the screen to the object space. We designed six alternative algorithms that use the given data to estimate the density at any location in space and produce a slice of a three-dimensional array. Some of the algorithms exploit global information and some are self-adaptive; all but one have advantages in certain circumstances. We extended a well-known two-dimensional model of a human head model to build a three-dimensional model of a head, consisting of 10 ellipsoids of different size, orientation, and density. We produced the data sets by sampling in the object space (the head model) at evenly spaced intervals; the dimension of the data set is 128 * 128 * 128. We devised several test slices to test our model and algorithms. Some test slices have a complex shape, some are critical in their position, and some are really disasters to most algorithms. We also tried different sampling intervals to verify our ideas about the model. Based on subjective and objective comparisons, wesummarize {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the algorithms.

40|$|Advances in {{graphics}} hardware {{in recent}} years have led not only to a huge growth in the speed at which 3 D data can be rendered, but also to a marked change in the way different data types can be displayed. In particular, point based rendering techniques have benefited from the advent of vertex and fragment shaders on the GPU which allow simple point primitives to be displayed not just as dots, but rather as complex entities in their own right. We present a simple way of displaying arbitrary 2 D slices through 3 D SPH data by evaluating the SPH kernel on the GPU and accumulating the contributions from individual particles intersecting a <b>slice</b> <b>plane</b> into a texture. The resulting textured plane can then be displayed alongside the particle based data. Combining 2 D slices and 3 D views in an interactive way improves perception of the underlying physics and speeds up the development cycle of simulation code. In addition to rendering particles themselves, we can improve visualization by generating particle trails to show motion history, glyphs to show vector fields, transparency to enhance or diminish areas of high/low interest and multiple views of the same or different data for comparative visualization. We combine these techniques with interactive control or arbitrary scalar parameters and animation through time to produce a feature rich environment for exploration of SPH data. 1...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} the spatial resolution of microtomographs, a test object on the submicrometer scale was prepared by {{focused ion beam}} milling and subjected to microtomographic analysis. Since human tissues are composed of cells and extracellular matrices with micrometer and submicrometer structures, {{it is important to}} investigate the three-dimensional spatial resolution of microtomographs used to visualize microstructures of human tissues. The resolutions along the direction within the tomographic <b>slice</b> <b>plane</b> (in-plane resolution) and perpendicular to it (through-plane resolution) were determined from the modulation transfer function of square-wave patterns. The in-plane resolution was estimated to be 1. 2 um from the modulation transfer function of the non-zoom image. In contrast, the zoom image gave the in-plane resolution of 0. 8 um. This in-plane resolution is comparable to the through-plane resolution, which was estimated to be 0. 8 um. Although the two-dimensional radiographs were taken with the pixel width of half the x-ray optics resolution, these three-dimensional resolution analyses indicated that the zoom reconstruction should be performed to achieve the in-plane resolution comparable to the x-ray optics resolution. The submicrometer three-dimensional analysis was applied in the structural study of human cerebral tissue stained with high-Z elements and the obtained tomograms revealed that the microtomographic analysis allows visualization of the subcellular structures of the cerebral tissue.
