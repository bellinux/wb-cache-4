5|$|After {{the opening}} {{game of the}} 2009 season, Blount was {{suspended}} for punching a Boise State University opponent and angrily confronting fans after the nationally televised season-opening loss.

5|$|The game {{includes}} twelve playable characters {{originating from}} popular Nintendo franchises. Characters have a symbol appearing behind their damage meter {{corresponding to the}} series to which they belong, such as a Triforce behind Link's and a Poké Ball emblem behind Pikachu's. Furthermore, characters have recognizable moves derived from their original series, such as Samus's charged blasters and Link's arsenal of weapons. Eight characters are initially playable, and four additional characters can be unlocked by meeting <b>specific</b> <b>criteria</b> within the game.|$|E

5000|$|The fourth rule {{resolves}} {{the situation}} where two cluster centers connect in 1-hop neighborhood and need to decide which cluster center should continue its role as cluster center. Given any <b>specific</b> <b>criterion</b> (e.g., device ID, battery power), one cluster center remains while the other cluster center is hierarchized in 1-hop neighborhood to that new cluster center. The choice of the <b>specific</b> <b>criterion</b> to resolve the decision-making depends on the used application scenario and on the available information.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill <b>specific</b> <b>criteria.</b> Firstly, signallers must incur {{different}} levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E
5|$|In {{their design}} of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had <b>specific</b> <b>criteria</b> for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used in the construction of the settlements.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{then turns}} up mysteriously at a {{hospital}} in a coma. An out of control Mulder demands to know how she got there, and is escorted out by security but later calms down and meets with Dr. Daly (Jay Brazeau), who reveals that no one can figure out how she got there or what's wrong with her. He tells Mulder and Mrs. Scully that she has a living will that dictates she be taken off of life support when her condition falls to <b>specific</b> <b>criteria.</b> At Scully's bedside, Mulder meets her older sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw). Scully has a vision of sitting in a boat, attached by rope to a dock where Mulder and Melissa stand, and nurse Owens behind them. Frohike visits Scully and sneaks out her medical chart, which the Lone Gunmen later investigate. Byers finds that Scully's blood contains branched DNA that may have been used for identification but now is inactive and nothing more than a poisonous waste product in her system.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} planners specified a set {{of conditions}} regarding {{the timing of the}} invasion, deeming only a few days in each month suitable. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the highest tides. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles the enemy had placed on the beach while minimising the amount of time the men had to spend exposed in the open. <b>Specific</b> <b>criteria</b> were also set for wind speed, visibility, and cloud cover. Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing; high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact of giving {{students}} <b>specific</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> in the first part of a badminton unit on the response rates of students with various skill levels. This study also investigated whether setting and stating <b>specific</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> in the beginning of an activity unit increased student achievement and learning throughout the course of instruction. Participants of this study consisted of a purposeful sample of 12 female physical education students from an Indiana high school participating in a badminton unit. Data was collected during a 10 -day badminton unit on two more-skilled, two average-skilled, and two less-skilled students in each of two classes. One of these classes received <b>specific</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> in the first part of the badminton unit, while the other class received the <b>specific</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> at the end of the same badminton unit. The participants' response rates for each forehand, backhand, overhand, and serve badminton hit attempted were coded as correct successful, incorrect successful, correct unsuccessful, or incorrect unsuccessful. Participant data was graphed, including a 3 -day baseline, and compared between the control group and experimental group. Research findings revealed that participants in the experimental group, who received <b>specific</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> in the first part of the badminton unit, had a higher quality of response rates throughout the unit than participants of similar skill level in the control group, who did not receive the <b>specific</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> unit the end of the same unit. The results of this study suggest that student response rates increase throughout a unit when <b>specific</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> is given at the beginning of the unit for students of more-, average-, and less-skill levels. This study concludes that physical educators may increase student achievement and learning throughout an instructional unit by setting and stating <b>specific</b> assessment <b>criteria</b> at the beginning of an instructional unit. Increased student response rates mean greater time spent on task and improved skill development. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
