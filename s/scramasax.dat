2500|$|While {{the above}} {{quotations}} {{have been used}} as a statement of the military practices of the Frankish nation in the 6th century and have even been extrapolated to the entire period preceding Charles Martel's reforms (early mid-8th century), post-Second World War historiography has emphasised the inherited Roman characteristics of the Frankish military from the date of the beginning of the conquest of Gaul. The Byzantine authors present several contradictions and difficulties. Procopius denies the Franks the use of the spear while Agathias makes it one of their primary weapons. They agree that the Franks were primarily infantrymen, threw axes and carried a sword and shield. Both writers also contradict the authority of Gallic authors of the same general time period (Sidonius Apollinaris and Gregory of Tours) and the archaeological evidence. The , the early 7th century legal code of the Rhineland or Ripuarian Franks, specifies the values of various goods when paying a wergild in kind; whereas a spear and shield were worth only two , a sword and scabbard were valued at seven, a helmet at six, and a [...] "metal tunic" [...] at twelve. <b>Scramasaxes</b> and arrowheads are numerous in Frankish graves even though the Byzantine historians do not assign them to the Franks.|$|R
40|$|U radu se raspravlja o prilozima noževa i strijela, odnosno njihovih sačuvanih željeznih vrhova, u grobovima na području ranosrednjovjekovne Hrvatske. Nešto duži primjerci noževa često se klasificiraju kao bojni, a neki od njih nazivaju i (scrama) saxevima prema istoimenim bojnim noževima s merovinškog područja. U skladu s time, pokojnici s takvim prilozima definiraju se najčešće kao ratnici, a ako su u grobu prisutne i ostruge, kao ratnici-konjanici. I strijele se najčešće jednako interpretiraju kao prilozi oružja u grobovima ratnika. Na temelju analize konteksta ovih grobnih priloga, preispituje se takva atribucija i predlaže drukčija, primarno u smislu simbolike lova, uz osvrt na njihovu ulogu u grobnom ritusu u kontekstu promjena na prijelazu 8. u 9. stoljeće. Knives {{rank among}} the most {{numerous}} grave goods within the horizon with pagan burial characteristics on the territory of Early Medieval Croatia. They are usually classified into knives for everyday use and battle knives, the main criterium for such a division being {{the length of a}} knife. The ones shorter than 20 cm are ascribed to the first category and the ones longer than 20 cm are considered battle knives. The veryrare longer examples (30 cm and more) are usually called saxes or <b>scramasaxes</b> and their appearance in thisarea is associated with Frankish influences. However, such attribution is unjustified, since those are specifictypes of weaponry, a good deal different from the greatest part of Croatian finds. The whole burial context and other associated grave goods also speak against their warrior attribution. These are most often very simple and common objects – ceramic pots and flint steels, sometimes awls with loop at the base. Grave goods that could be characterised as warrior equipment (swords, spears, spurs) appear in only a smaller number of graves. Another type of weaponry which often gives rise to characterisations of graves and those buried in them as warriors are arrows, i. e. their iron heads, which are the only parts to remain preserved. However, not a single arrowhead has been found in a grave containing a sword (nor in a grave with a knife of 40 cm or longer, for that matter). All this suggests a different interpretation of these finds, in the sense of their primary function – the hunt. Even if arrows/javelins and certain knives had been deposited in a grave with the meaning of the hunt in mind, that {{does not necessarily mean that}} the deceased was simply characterised as a hunter during burial. Following parallels from Late Antique northern Gaul, such grave goods can be interpreted through the symbolic importance of the hunt in the burial rite context. The hunt is a prestige activity, during which mastery over animals and domination over nature is also exhibited so the deposition of hunting weapons in a grave can symbolise the right to a certain territory, as well as domination within a community. Through contacts with the Franks during the last quarter of the 8 th century and further, such burial rites are added to and acquire an additional dimension – competition for power on a higher level, for the predminance over a wider territory...|$|R

50|$|Most puukkos have {{a slight}} {{shoulder}} but no , since {{the point where the}} edge ends and the handle begins is also the point where most power can be applied. A puukko often has no guard to stop the hand from slipping onto the edge, but this is of no great importance, since it is primarily considered a cutting tool, not a stabbing weapon. In cases where the knife and the hand are expected to get wet, like if the puukko is meant for gutting fish or game, some form of guards are carved into the handle. The traditional length of the puukko blade is the same as one's palm width, usually 90-120 mm. Carvers, huntsmen and leatherworkers favour shorter blades; woodworkers, carpenters and constructors longer. The Saami leuku, which is an outdoorsman's tool, may have a blade up to 400 mm, and the blade of the historical väkipuukko may be up to 500 mm. The väkipuukko more closely resembles a machete or short sword (<b>scramasax</b> style) than true puukko.|$|E
50|$|To a degree, some {{antipathy}} {{towards the}} dagger has remained unchanged up to modern times. This is perhaps, {{partly due to}} the periodic, contemporary broadcasting of bloodthirsty films and television series depicting gangsters employing the stiletto daggers. History is punctuated with accounts of daggers being used in assassinations and coup d'état attempts. On March 15, 44BC, Gaius Julius Caesar was assassinated by a large group of conspirators who stabbed him repeatedly with their daggers. This took place in Rome in a room behind the Theatre of Pompey which was being used for government business whilst the Senate was being rebuilt. On May 26, 946, the twenty-four-year-old King Edmund of England was stabbed to death by a criminal during the feast of St. Augustine at Pucklechurch in Gloucester. The attacker probably used a <b>Scramasax</b> dagger. Another murder of particular brutality was that of Rizzio, secretary to Mary Queen of Scots, on March 9, 1566 at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh. Whilst seated at supper with the Queen, he was dragged away by several nobles and stabbed to death in an adjoining room. The assassins may have used Dudgeon daggers.|$|E
