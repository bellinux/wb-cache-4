40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{has been}} {{generally}} accepted by civil engineers {{as an alternative}} for steel reinforcing bars (rebar) due to its advantageous specific tensile strength and non-corrosiveness. Even though some {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) rebars are available on a market, GFRP is still somewhat uncompetitive over steel rebar due to their high cost and relatively low elastic modulus, and brittle failure characteristic. If the price of component materials of GFRP rebar is not reduced, it would be another solution to increase the performance of each material to the highest degree. The tensile strength generally decreases with increasing diameter of FRP rebar. One of the reasons is that only fibers except for fibers in center resist the external force {{due to the lack of}} force transfer and the deformation of only outer fibers by gripping system. Eliminating fibers in the center, which do not play an aimed role fully, are helpful to reduce the price and finally FRP rebar would be optimized over the price. In this study, the effect of the hollow section in a cross-section of a GFRP rebar was investigated. A GFRP rebar with 19 mm diameter was selected and an analysis was performed for the tensile test results.

In contrast to the classical assumption of the perfect bonding of constituent layers, herein the existence of interracial bonding imperfections among the layers of the host structure is stipulated. The requirements of shear traction continuity and displacement jump across each interface are used to model structures featuring imperfect bonding. Their implications on free and forced vibration control is analyzed via a combined dynamic feedback control law relating the piezoelectrically induced bending moment at the beam tip with the various kinematic response quantities. Numerical results for cantilever adaptive beams experiencing flexural motion under transient distributed loading are presented. For the case of an out-of-phase electrical activation of the smart structure, implications of the interface bonding imperfections on the structural quantities are investigated. The obtained results reveal the powerful role played by the proposed control methodology towards enhancing the dynamic response of cantilevered multilayered anisotropic beams to transient loadings.

In detail, although the provided equations are valid for any one-dimensional structural theory in a unified sense, layer-wise kinematics are employed in this paper through the use of Lagrange polynomial expansions of the primary mechanical variables. The principle of virtual work and a finite element approximation are used to formulate the governing equations in a total Lagrangian manner, whereas a Newton-Raphson linearization scheme along with a path-following method based on the arc-length constraint is employed to solve the geometrically nonlinear problem.

40|$|Summary: Buckling of slender beam-columns {{subject to}} axial {{compressive}} loads represents a critical design constraint for light-weight structures. Passive solutions {{to increase the}} criti-cal buckling load are limited by increasing or modifying the cross-sectional area, changing the material or reducing the beam-column length and may lead to oversizing or unwanted change in geometry. Active buckling control provides a possible alternative to stabilize slender beam-columns by active lateral forces or bending moments with fewer modifications in geometry, shape and material. In this paper, the potential of active buckling control of an axially loaded beam-column with circular <b>solid</b> <b>cross-section</b> by active supports with integrated piezoelectric actuators at both ends is investigated numerically. The beam-column itself stays free from any geometrical or material modifications along its length. A mathematical model of the axially loaded beam-column is derived and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with state observer is designed to stabilize the system. The effectiveness of the stabilization concept is investigated by numerical simulation of the supercritically loaded beam-column. With the proposed active buckling control {{it is possible to}} increase the maximum bearable axial compressive load signif-icantly above the first critical buckling load of the passive beam-column. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interaction}} between a hollow cylindrical nanofiber and {{a crack in}} an infinite medium is investigated. The two-dimensional problem, when the crack lies in the cross-sectional plane of the fiber, is solved for a transversely isotropic fiber in an isotropic matrix phase. The reported work to date on crack–fiber interaction problems seems {{to be based on}} a conventional solid fiber cross-section, whereas in this study, a hollow fiber cross-section is considered. The crack is considered at various orientations with respect to the nanofiber. Mismatch between Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratios of the fiber and matrix, fiber diameter, and fiber wall thickness, are some of the parameters in the study. Finite element method is used as the analysis tool to compute energy release rates in mixed mode conditions. Fiber–matrix interface tractions are also computed to investigate secondary failure mechanism. The behavior of a hollow nanofiber is shown to be significantly different from that of a fiber with a <b>solid</b> <b>cross-section.</b> However, with increasing nanofiber wall thickness {{the results of the present}} investigation are seen to converge to the solutions of a solid fiber.

40|$|This study proposes an {{alternate}} method {{for the analysis}} of beams with <b>solid</b> <b>cross-section</b> or built as a framed structure and subjected to transverse impact loads from an external striker. The procedure used in the analysis is a combination of two essential tools using pseudo-dynamic techniques. The method reported here involves only one degree of freedom for the structure modelling and assumes an elastic contact between an external striker and the beam structure, which in reality does not happen. As only one degree of freedom is considered in the analysis, some important limitations are inherent to the method proposed here. Essentially, there is the difficulty of modelling the displacement field associated with the transient structure behaviour accurately, as a consequence of fast-rate impact loads. Another difficulty faced by the method refers to a local structure behaviour associated with contact loads. The present method can deal with large displacements in transversely loaded beams associated to a collapse mechanism having a simple geometry and defined with precision from a single parameter. This ensures reasonable accuracy in the evaluation of the strain energy absorbing capacity of transversely impacted beam structures using a single degree of freedom model in a pseudo-dynamic procedure.

40|$|Buckling of axially loaded beam-columns {{represents}} a critical design constraint for light-weight structures. Besides passive solutions {{to increase the}} critical buckling load, active buckling control provides a possibility to stabilize slender elements in structures. So far, buckling control by active forces or bending moments has been mostly investigated for beam-columns with rectangular cross-section and with a preferred direction of buckling. The proposed approach investigates active buckling control of a beam-column with circular <b>solid</b> <b>cross-section</b> which is fixed at its base and pinned at its upper end. Three controlled active lateral forces are applied near the fixed base with angles of 120 ° to each other to stabilize the beam-column and allow higher critical axial loads. The beam-column is subject to supercritical static axial loads and lateral disturbance forces with varying directions and offsets. Two independent modal state space systems are derived for the bending planes in the lateral y- and z-directions of the circular cross-section. These are used to design two linear-quadratic regulators (LQR) that determine the necessary control forces which are transformed into the directions of the active lateral forces. The system behavior is simulated with a finite element model using one-dimensional beam elements with {{six degrees of freedom}} at each node.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the problem of the {{identification}} of the optimum rib thickness in ribbed R/C floors without shear reinforcements, particularly in those floors that are made by using prefabricated or partly precast elements and industrially produced temporary or permanent shutterings. The rib thickness is an important factor both of the floor weight and of its cost, as the ribbed section makes R/C floors lighter by removing a part of the cracked concrete below the neutral axis. Unfortunately, due to the mass production, in this case the rib thickness is chosen by the manufacturer instead of the R/C floor designer, so that the choice of the rib geometry should be made by the manufacturer by optimizing it. In fact {{it is not possible to}} make R/C floors too much lighter by exceedingly reducing the rib thickness because, close to the floor ends, the moment of resistance and the shear resistance would become too low. In this way, being the ribbed section stopped off close to the floor ends to increase the moment of resistance and the shear resistance, the floor would become heavier at its ends with a <b>solid</b> <b>cross-section</b> so that, due to an eventually too much reduced rib thickness, this heavier part would become too long and the concrete volume removed in the lighter ribbed part of the floor would be recovered in the heavier part at the floor ends. Consequently, the problem is whether it is better to make R/C floors with thicker ribs to reduce the heavier part of the floor at its ends, or to make the floor lighter in the span with thinner ribs but having a long heavier part at the floor ends. Therefore, by using nonlinear programming, we make an analysis at the ultimate limit state to find out the best way to make R/C floors lighter and with thin ribs. Depending on the type of R/C floors, this approach can be used by the designers as well as by the manufacturers which make permanent or removable moulds, partly prefabricated ribs, burnt clay or concrete hollow blocks, partly precast floor panels and, anyway, every industrialised product for R/C floor construction related to the rib thickness; this allows the industry to choose the size of its industrialized products that will determine the rib thickness in a great number of R/C floors...|$|E
