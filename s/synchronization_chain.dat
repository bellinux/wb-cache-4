40|$|Emerging {{markets for}} {{satellite}} communications, such as maritime and aeronautical applications, require reliable communications in challenging conditions and low-cost, low-complexity user terminals. In this perspective, the <b>synchronization</b> <b>chain</b> {{is a fundamental}} part of the receiver and its design becomes critical. When a quadricorrelator is used as first stage of the <b>synchronization</b> <b>chain</b> so as to perform a coarse frequency estimation, then a noncoherent algorithm for frame synchronization can be employed as second stage. A popular algorithm for frame synchronization is the post-detection integration (PDI), whose noncoherent version (NCPDI) is quite robust to non-negligible residual frequency offsets. In this paper we will assess the performance of NCPDI in presence of a random uniformly-distributed residual frequency offset and will find a closed-form approximation for the probability of detection. Moreover, we will optimize the design parameters of NCPDI for a system operating at very low signal-to-noise ratio (VL-SNR) by minimizing the probability of missed detection for a given probability of false alarm...|$|E

40|$|Network {{providers}} {{are faced with}} significant challenges in delivering backhaul solutions. Given that solutions based on Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), is not providing improved efficiency at a reasonable cost. Thus {{the need for new}} backhaul solutions is becoming significant. With the full-IP evolution, all the mobile networks are migrated to full-IP, thus capabilities inherent to traditional TDM needs to be developed in these IP networks. Real-time applications have relatively tight timing requirements concerning delay and delay variations. Therefore, need efficient timing solution for those real-time applications. Synchronization is important aspect in networks and it is more critical in mobile networks. Loss of synchronization in mobile networks leads to call drops, mobile broadband data speed degrades and packet losses. Network equipment should be synchronized in frequency, time and time of day. To achieve the packet network based synchronization new strategies should be adopted. Else, traditional synchronization techniques is to be continued to synchronize networks. Specialized synchronization networks can deliver better and accurate performances, but that is with a higher cost. There are new technologies introduced to the industry for synchronization. Before migrating in to new technologies, analyzing these techniques against the service delivery requirement is a prerequisite. There is information available and accessible for the operators, in the areas related to developments of technical standardization proceedings, but there is clear lack of resources and information for practical implementations. There are gaps to be addressed while migration mobile networks into packet switching networks. Migration from circuit switching network to packet switching networks will break the <b>synchronization</b> <b>chain.</b> Most importantly, delivering the synchronization across the borders is required to interwork communication systems. Packet networks are asynchronous in nature therefore integrating time aware applications with packet network require correct timing at the interfaces to provide acceptable performance. Hence, special consideration and design is required in All-IP networks. Cost {{plays a major role in}} the adaptation of modern technologies to existing telecommunication networks. Hence backhauling need to be a highly cost effective. At present, the IP networks have proven to be the most cost effective and thus migrating mobile network to a full-IP based network with synchronization capability provides additional cost benefit for the network operators. In this research, technical standards and available synchronization methods are extensively evaluated. Moreover, network requirements, possibilities and limitations are also extensively analyzed. Logical behaviors are compared and analyzed for standardized synchronization techniques. Based on these analyses, implementation guidelines have been developed. The guidelines have been prepared within the overall technical framework published by ITU-T standards and it is hoped that they will be helpful for the mobile operators who wish to migrate from existing network to future proof capacity agile packet switching network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Asynchronous circuit {{implementations}} {{operating under}} strong constraints (DIMS, Direct Logic, some of NCL gates, etc.) are attractive due to: 1) regularity; 2) combined {{implementation of the}} functional and completion detection logics, what simplifies the design process; 3) circuit output latency {{is based on the}} actual gate delays of the unbounded nature; 4) absence of additional <b>synchronization</b> <b>chains</b> (even of a local nature). However, the area and speed penalty is rather high. In contrast to the state-of-the-art approaches, where simple (NAND, NOR, etc.) 2 -input gates are used, we propose a synthesis method based on complex nodes, i. e., nodes implementing any function of an arbitrary number of inputs. Synchronous synthesis procedures may be freely adopted for this purpose. Numerous experiments on standard benchmarks were performed and the efficiency of the proposed complex gate based method is clearly shown.

40|$|In modern, {{computer-aided}} engineering processes, restoring {{and maintaining}} the consistency of multiple, related artefacts is an important challenge. This is especially the case in multi-disciplinary domains such as manufacturing engineering, where complex systems are described using multiple artefacts that are concurrently manipulated by domain experts, each with their own established tools. Bidirectional languages address this challenge of consistency maintenance by supporting incremental change propagation with a clear and precise semantics. Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) are a prominent rule-based and declarative bidirectional model transformation language with various implementations, and a solid formal foundation based on algebraic graph transformations. Although TGGs are well suited for synchronizing models that are already on an appropriate, high-level of abstraction, practical model <b>synchronization</b> <b>chains</b> typically require handling models on different levels of abstraction. This poses additional challenges including: (i) handling massive information loss typically incurred when abstracting from a low-level model to a high-level model, (ii) supporting complex attribute manipulation as low-level models are often simple trees extracted from textual or XML-files, with relevant information encoded in attribute values rather than structural relations, and (iii) enabling arbitrary structural constraints to cope with complex, often recursive structural context relations, which are usually not present as explicit links in low-level models. This thesis addresses these challenges by: (1) Establishing a general framework for organizing and structuring model <b>synchronization</b> <b>chains.</b> This framework is applied to an industrial case study {{in the domain of}} manufacturing engineering, which is used consequently throughout this thesis to identify requirements, formulate corresponding challenges, and evaluate the contributions of this thesis. (2) Identifying and formalizing new language extensions for TGGs: attribute conditions for complex attribute manipulation in TGG rules, and dynamic conditions for integrating arbitrary structural constraints. To guarantee the maintainability of large TGG specifications, a new modularity concept for TGGs, rule refinement is also introduced. Similar to inheritance and composition for programming languages, rule refinement enables the reuse and flexible combination of TGG rule fragments to form similar TGG rules without introducing redundancy in specifications.

To achieve this, the employed mechanism maintains counters at both sides (mobile station and network) and verifies that the provided AVs are among the last α generated. However, there are many {{cases in which the}} mobile station receives AVs that have not been previously used, but the employed mechanism rejects them as outdated. This phenomenon, called false synchronization, causes signaling overhead and delays, and increases the cost of the network use. False synchronizations are more frequent in 3 G-WLAN integrated networks. The frequency of false synchronizations decreases with α, {{while at the same time}} the risk of a replay attack increases. This paper aims at analytically determining an appropriate value of α, which balances effectively in 3 G-WLANs the tradeoff between the rate of false synchronizations and exposure to adversaries exploiting compromised AVs. This is done by determining a threshold value of α beyond which the further reduction in false synchronizations is marginal, while the potential for a replay attack is constantly increasing and substantial. To this end, an analytical model based on a four dimensional Markov chain is developed whose accuracy is verified through simulations.

40|$|M. Comm. As part {{of supply}} chain management, the {{handling}} of market demand information forms {{one of the most}} important concepts in any supply chain. One of the specific goals of supply chain management is to manage and co-ordinate the flow of information from the original source to the final customer. If consumer demand forms the activating element in the supply chain, it becomes clear that the process of demand planning can play an active role in improving the effectiveness of a supply chain. The correct management of information can thus greatly influence the level of integration, the responsiveness, level of customer service and value added to the end product. This is however not a one-sided approach where demand planning can be used as the tool to facilitate supply <b>chain</b> <b>synchronization.</b> The opposite effect can also be found that certain efforts to synchronize the supply chain can greatly improve the demand planning process. The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry relies heavily on forecasted demand figures due to the structure of this industry 5. Developing demand forecasts forms a great part of the demand planning process and the accuracy, timely flow, interpretation and final format of the information is of the utmost importance. A well controlled forecasting process can form a solid foundation to address supply chain problems, reduce the level of wastage, increase the product value to the customer and improve the level of supply chain agility. With this background, the aim of this study will be: To explore the subject of Demand Planning in the synchronization of a FMCG supply chain.

40|$|Abstract — Since WSNs have {{restricted}} energy sources, {{the energy}} efficiency of a synchronization scheme {{is as important}} as the accuracy of a clock. To accomplish both the energy efficiency and the accuracy, we propose a new clock <b>synchronization</b> scheme called <b>Chaining</b> Clock <b>Synchronization</b> (CCS). In CCS, a subset of nodes whose transmission range cover the overall network carries out a two-way message exchange algorithm while the remaining nodes synchronize themselves by overhearing the messages. To reduce the energy consumption associated with the message exchange, CCS integrates a clock request and a clock reply into a single message. Therefore, CCS requires only a single message transmission per node for the synchronization. To increase the accuracy of the clock synchronization, we also propose a new technique called clock skew propagation to reduce the error accumulation associated with multi-hop clock synchronization schemes. According to the results from NS- 2, in comparison with TPSN, CCS can effectively reduce the energy consumption by up to 95 % while sacrificing 9. 2 % of the average accuracy of clocks. Moreover, the average clock error accumulation of CCS is reduced by 58 % as the hop distance from a reference node increases.

40|$|Abstract—New {{applications}} {{based on}} cloud computing, such as data <b>synchronization</b> for large <b>chain</b> departmental stores and bank transaction records, require very high-speed data transport. Although {{a number of}} high-bandwidth networks have been built, existing transport protocols or their variants over such networks cannot fully exploit the network bandwidth. Our experiments show that the fixed-size application level buffer employed in the receiver side is {{a major cause of}} this deficiency. A buffer that is either too small or too large impairs the transfer performance. Due to the varied natures of network conditions and of real-time packet processing (i. e., consuming) speed at the receiver, it is important to ensure that the buffer size is dynamically adjusted according to the perceived execution situation during runtime. In this paper, we propose Rada, a dynamic receiving buffer adaptation scheme for high-speed data transfer. Rada employs an Exponential Moving Average aided scheme to quantify the data arrival rate and consumption rate in the buffer. Based on these two rates, we develop a Linear Aggressive Increase Conservative Decrease scheme to adjust the buffer size dynamically. Moreover, a Weighted Mean Function is employed to make the adjustment adaptive to the available memory in the receiver. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the rationale and parameter bounds of Rada. The performance of Rada is also theoretically compared with potential alternatives. We implement Rada in a Linux platform and extensively evaluate its performance in a variety of scenarios. Experimental results conform to the theoretical results, and show that Rada outperforms the static buffer scheme in terms of throughput, memory footprint, and fairness. Index Terms—cloud computing, high-speed data transfer, buffer adaptation, rate detection. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{considered}} diffusion-driven processes on small-world networks with distance-dependent random links. The {{study of}} diffusion on such networks {{is motivated by}} transport on randomly folded polymer <b>chains,</b> <b>synchronization</b> problems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on networks. Changing {{the parameters of the}} distance-dependence, we found a rich phase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of random walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases: in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and in the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the motion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that in a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density of, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction topology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some cases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the Edwards-Wilkinson process in "low-dimensional" small-world networks. This break-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where the mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a naive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also confirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the network Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework for the relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finite networks. This work provides a detailed account of the self-consistent-perturbative and renormalization approaches briefly introduced in two earlier short reports. Comment: 36 pages, 27 figures.
