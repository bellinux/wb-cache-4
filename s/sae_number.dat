We found that 25 mM BABA as a root drench had minimal adverse impact on plant growth and also efficiently protected soybean from SA infestation. In both choice and non-choice tests, <b>SA</b> <b>number</b> was significantly decreased to a low level in soybean seedlings drenched with 25 mM BABA compared to the control counterparts.

Meanwhile, the induction of 15 defense-related genes by aphid, such as AOS, CHS, MMP 2, NPR 1 - 1, NPR 1 - 2, and PR genes, were significantly augmented in BABA-treated soybean seedlings.

He sent a personal request to Röhm, asking him to return to serve as the SA's chief of staff. Röhm accepted this offer and began his new assignment on 5 January 1931. He brought radical new ideas to the SA, and appointed several close friends to its senior leadership. Previously, the SA formations were subordinate to the Nazi Party leadership of each Gau. Röhm established new Gruppen which had no regional Nazi Party oversight. Each Gruppe extended over several regions and was commanded by a SA Gruppenführer who answered only to Röhm or Hitler. Under their popular leader, Stabschef (Staff Chief) Ernst Röhm, the SA grew in importance within the Nazi power structure, growing to thousands of members. In the early 1930s, the Nazis expanded from an extremist fringe group to the largest political party in Germany, and the SA expanded with it.

Although subordinate to the SA until the summer of 1934, its members behaved as though they were the Nazi Party elite. From January 1929 forward, the SS was commanded by Heinrich Himmler in his capacity as Reichsführer-SS; later in 1936, Himmler was appointed chief of all German police. Within the SS main branches of the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverbände and Waffen-SS, there further existed sub-branches, including the RSHA (which had as departments: the SD, Gestapo and the Kripo). After the war, pursuant to the judgments rendered at the Nuremberg trials, as well as many war crimes investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was judged to be a criminal organization and determined to be responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes.

Much attention {{has been focused on}} this association, but subgroup analysis has generated conflicting results, raising questions about the role of trait-impulsiveness in suicidal behavior and substance misuse in bipolar patients. METHOD: We compared Barratt Impulsiveness Scale- 10 scores between 385 euthymic bipolar patients and 185 healthy controls. We then investigated possible association between impulsiveness scores and the following clinical characteristics: suicide attempt (SA), lifetime alcohol/cannabis misuse, rapid cycling and mixed episodes. RESULTS: Bipolar patients and healthy controls had significantly different BIS- 10 total score and subscores (motor, attentional and nonplanning impulsiveness) (all p values < 0. 0001). No association was observed between BIS- 10 total score, personal history of <b>SA,</b> <b>number</b> of <b>SA,</b> age at first SA and history of violent SA. Higher BIS- 10 total scores were associated with alcohol misuse (p= 0. 005), cannabis misuse (p< 0. 0001), with an additive effect for these two substances (p= 0. 005). Higher BIS- 10 total scores were also associated with rapid cycling (p= 0. 006) and history of mixed episodes (p= 0. 002), with an additive effect of these two variables (p= 0. 0006). LIMITATIONS: We used only one clinical measurement of impulsiveness and did not carry out cognitive assessment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that trait-impulsiveness may be considered as a dimensional feature associated with BD and with a more severe clinical expression of the disease, characterized by a history of substance misuse, rapid cycling and mixed episodes. We found no association between impulsiveness and SA characteristics in bipolar patients, confirming some previous negative results...|$|R

40|$|Many {{joint and}} bone {{diseases}} are caused by, or associated with vascular changes. Particularly in rheumatoid arthritis, vascular sprouting of synovial vessels {{plays a major}} role in the generation of joint pathology. To assess the effects of pharmaceuticals that are designed to inhibit neovascularization, we developed a quantitative procedure to measure vascular changes in cross-sections of the mouse knee joint during arthritic inflammation. Arthritis was induced in the knee joint of C 57 Black 6 mice by a single subpatellar injection of methylated BSA after previous immunization. Total vascularity was visualized with a specific monoclonal rat anti-mouse antibody (9 F 1). Functional vessels were detected with the fluorescent perfusion marker Hoechst 33342. The localization of Hoechst and the vascular marker 9 F 1 were analyzed in separate images with an automated digital image processing system. By combining the two images, total vascularity and the perfusion status of the vessels during arthritis could be established. The digital image system measures synovial area (<b>SA),</b> <b>number</b> of all blood vessels (NBV) and the number of perfused blood vessels (NpBV). From these parameters the percentage of perfused vessels (perfusion fraction; PF), the vessel density (VD = NBV/SA) and the density of perfused vessels (VDp = NpBV/SA) can be calculated. The measurements showed that the area of synovial tissue had increased during arthritis. Moreover, both the number of blood vessels (NBV) and the number of perfused vessels (NpBV) in the synovial area had increased significantly on Days 4 and 7 after arthritis induction. This procedure enabled quantitation of total vascularity and of functional blood vessels in cross-sections of synovial tissue. It is expected to be a powerful tool, not only to analyze the effects of anti-angiogenic therapies in animal models of arthritis, but could also be applicable to study vascular and perfusion changes in vascular related diseases of the skeleton...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} to design fault-tolerant hexagonal systolic array (SA) for multiplication of rectangular matrices is described. The approach comprises three steps. First, redundancies are introduced at the computational level by deriving three equivalent algorithms but with disjoint index spaces. Second, we perform the accommodation of index spaces to the projection direction to obtain hexagonal <b>SA</b> with optimal <b>number</b> of processing elements (PE) {{for a given}} problem size. Finally, we perform mapping of the accommodated index spaces into fault-tolerant systolic array using valid transformation matrix.

In the case of square matrices of order N × N, this array comprises N 2 + 2 N PEs with active computation time tc = 5 N − 4 time units. Fault tolerance is achieved through triplicated computation of the same problem instance and majority voting. We have proposed two hardware solutions for the voting process: one when voting is performed {{at the end of}} the computation, i. e., at the output of the SA, and the other where voting is performed after each computational step.
