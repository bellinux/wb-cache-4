25|$|It is said by {{some that}} Zia-Junejo rift was {{encouraged}} by late Mahboob-ul-Haq and Junejo's insistence on signing Geneva pact without deciding the composition of next government of Afghanistan before Soviet withdrawal. Junejo also gave Benazir a <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in parleys before that. Junejo did not strengthen the Islamization drive and rather weakened it. His era led to serious disturbances in Karachi and ultimately Karachi went into the secular control of MQM from the clutches of Sunnis Jamaat-e-Islami.|$|E
500|$|In June 1941, LeHand {{collapsed}} at a White House {{dinner party}} {{and two weeks}} later suffered a major stroke that left her partially paralyzed with little speech function. Goodwin says a factor that {{may have led to}} her illness was stress stemming from fears that the exiled Princess Märtha of Sweden, a Washington-area resident during World War II, had replaced her as FDR's favorite companion, occupying the <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that had long been LeHand's in automobile rides. Kathryn Smith cites the stress of the world crisis that spring, as Britain stood alone against the Nazis, and the ill health of FDR, who had expected her to be at his bedside for weeks on end. [...] She had also become critical of FDR's leadership {{for the first time that}} spring, sharing her disappointment with Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, a close friend. FDR paid LeHand's medical bills and later made provisions for her in his will, stating that half the income of his estate would go to Eleanor and half to [...] "my friend Marguerite A. LeHand...for medical attention, care and treatment during her lifetime." [...] He also sent her to Warm Springs, where he hoped she could recover with the help of the physical therapy staff there. She was very unhappy in Warm Springs and may have tried to kill herself by eating chicken bones during the 1941 Christmas season. In early 1942, she spent some weeks in her old room at the White House, but quickly deteriorated due to her frustrations at not being able to help. After an incident in which she set the bed on fire—probably while smoking—it was agreed that LeHand would return to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts, and she departed from Washington on May 15, 1942.|$|E

60|$|Dinner {{was soon}} announced, and I had the honour of leading in Miss B., who looked back rather angrily, I thought, at Captain Fizgig, because that gentleman had offered {{his arm to}} Mrs. Brough.

60|$|I {{told him}} {{to the best of}} my ability. He listened attentively enough, but {{thereafter}} he had not another word for me, and presently he went into the next car. I took his manner to be the Western abruptness that I had heard of, and presently forgot him in the scenery along the line. At Albuquerque I got off for a trip to a lunch-counter, and happened to take a <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

60|$|Under {{the seat}} {{was a small}} basket filled with sandwiches, and his head {{ought to have been}} equally well filled with the advice his mother had given him as to his {{behavior}} at Penfold Hall. As his place had been booked some days before, he had the advantage of an outside <b>seat.</b> <b>Next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> was a fat woman, who was going up to town, as she speedily informed her fellow-passengers, to meet her husband, who was captain of a whaler.|$|E
60|$|This was on week-days; on the Sabbath Master Hardy's daring {{ingenuity}} led him {{to still}} further flights. All the seats at the parish church were free, but Captain Nugent, whose admirable practice it was to take his entire family to church, never thoroughly realized how free they were until Master Hardy squeezed his way in and, taking a <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> prayed with unwonted fervour into {{the interior of a}} new hat, and then sitting back watched with polite composure the efforts of Miss Nugent's family to re-strain her growing excitement.|$|E
60|$|In all {{his days}} Hare {{had never seen}} such a {{bountiful}} board. Yet he was unable to appreciate it, to share in the general thanksgiving. Dominating all other feeling was the fear that Mescal would come in and take a seat by Snap Naab's side. When Snap seated himself opposite with his pale little wife Hare found himself waiting for Mescal with an intensity that made him dead to all else. The girls, Judith, Esther, Rebecca, came running gayly in, clad in their best dresses, with bright ribbons to honor the occasion. Rebecca took the seat beside Snap, and Hare gulped with a hard contraction of his throat. Mescal was not yet a Mormon's wife! He seemed to be lifted upward, to grow light-headed with the blessed assurance. Then Mescal entered and took the <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She smiled and spoke, and the blood beat thick in his ears.|$|E

60|$|These {{roads were}} for the coaches. Young folks, who never saw {{anything}} nearer approaching to a stage coach than the drags some gentlemen keep, can hardly fancy what these stage coaches were--tall vehicles, holding four inside passengers and at least twelve outside and quantities of luggage. They were drawn by four of the strongest and quickest horses that could be procured, and these were changed about every five or six miles, so as to keep up full speed. The coachman, generally a big, burly man, with a face reddened by exposure to the weather, and often by a glass of ale at every stage, sat on the box in a drab coat, with many capes one over the other. The <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> was the favourite one with the passengers, and gentlemen would sometimes bribe coachmen to let them drive; nay, some gentlemen actually took to the trade themselves. There was also a guard, who in mail coaches {{took care of the}} post bags, and dropped them at the places where they were intended for. In the days when highwaymen infested the roads the guard had carried pistols, and still the guard of the mail wore a red coat, and blew a horn on entering any place to warn the people to bring out their post bags and exchange them for others.|$|E
