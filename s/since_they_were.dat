5|$|A 1000-year-old {{skeleton}} of a woman was discovered in the caves by Balch in 1912, and has also traditionally {{been linked to the}} legendary witch.

5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{what time}} {{they entered the}} straits, the Persians did not move to attack the Allies until daylight. <b>Since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not {{planning}} to flee after all, the Allies {{would have been able}} to spend the night preparing for battle, and after a speech by Themistocles, the marines boarded and the ships made ready to sail.|$|E

Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E

The BCS formula took into account strength of schedule so that teams received more credit for beating stronger opponents. This allowed Texas to advance in the rankings since they beat an unbeaten team while University of Southern California, who previously held the numberone spot, beat Washington, a 1–6 team.|$|E

5|$|The Lexington-class {{ships were}} {{originally}} designed to be battlecruisers, with heavy guns, high speed, and moderate armor protection. The Navy laid down six ships of the class in 1919–20. When the battlecruisers were cancelled under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, two of the unfinished ships were designated for completion as carriers. Lexington and Saratoga were selected <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the most advanced of the six ships in construction.|$|E
5|$|The allies had no 'standing army', nor {{was there}} any {{requirement}} to form one; <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> fighting on home territory, they could muster armies as and when required.

5|$|The ethical {{requirements}} of senators were significant. Senators could {{not engage in}} banking or any form of public contract.
