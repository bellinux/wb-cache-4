In the corners of the Memorial Hall are four [...] high bronze lamps, donated by the Order of the Eastern Star (a Masonic social organization composed primarily of women). On the north and south sides of the Memorial Hall are murals by Allyn Cox depicting Washington attending a service at Christ Church, Alexandria and of Washington (in Masonic garb) laying the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol building. The murals were photographed in their entirety {{for the first time in}} 2000.|$|E
2500|$|The 16th Street Bridge is [...] long. Its span is [...] in length, {{and has a}} rise of [...] The span is a {{parabolic}} arch, {{the first}} built in the United States and the longest {{in the world at}} the time, according to its designer, W.J. Douglas. The abutments and substructure of the bridge are of reinforced concrete; the arch itself is not reinforced with steel. The interior of the bridge is hollow. Square vertical interior columns [...] in length on each <b>side</b> <b>support</b> the road deck. A latticework of horizontal square beams, each [...] in size, intersect the columns and are set perpendicular to one another. This system of columns and beams compress the arch and keep it stable as well push outward against the walls. The bridge's abutments are hollow. The abutments are stabilized by soil pressing against them from the outside, and the system of beams and columns on the interior of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|The Chilean General Staff had two {{alternative}} {{plans for}} their attack. Baquedano, the army chief, advocated {{a direct and}} frontal advance through the [...] "Tablada de Lurín", a known area with large areas of relatively plain terrain, against the line of Chorrillos. The advantages of this axis of advance were the shorter distances {{that had to be}} covered, a withdrawal line, sea <b>side</b> <b>support</b> from the Chilean navy, water supply (from Lurín), less requirement to train the troops and, as important, less need for complex Chilean discipline to control any advance and subsequent attack. The alternative plan of War Minister José Francisco Vergara laid down a turning movement, bypassing the Peruvian line by attacking from further to the east: through the Lurín valley, moving via Chantay and reaching Lima at Ate. Utilising this approach meant that Lima could be seized without resistance or both defense lines could be attacked from the rear.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this naturalistic study was to {{investigate}} the effect of booster seat design on the choice of children’s seating positions during naturalistic riding. Data was collected through observations of children during in-vehicle riding by means of a film camera. The children were positioned in high back boosters in the rear seat while a parent drove the car. The study included two different booster designs: one with large head and torso <b>side</b> <b>supports,</b> and one with small head <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> and no torso <b>side</b> <b>supports.</b> Six children between three and six years of age participated in the study. Each child was observed in both boosters. The duration of the seating positions that each child assumed was quantified. The design with large <b>side</b> head <b>supports</b> resulted more often in seating positions without head and shoulder contact with the booster’s back. There was shoulder-to-booster back contact during an average of 45 % of riding time in the seat with the large head <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> compared to 75 % in the seat with the small head supports. The children in the study were seated with the head in front of the front edge of the head <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> more than half the time, in both boosters. Laterally, the children were almost constantly positioned between the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> of the booster in both seats. The observed seating positions probably reduce the desired protective effect by the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> in <b>side</b> impact, and may increase the probability of head impact with the vehicle interior in frontal impact...|$|R
40|$|Several {{factors can}} affect the {{behaviour}} of the hollowcore floor slabs in fire. This paper analytically investigates {{the relationship between the}} fire resistance of the overall floor system and the floor length to width ratio as well as the type of <b>side</b> <b>supports.</b> The study uses beam grillage and shell elements to model the hollowcore slabs and the topping concrete under the platform of the non-linear finite element program, SAFIR. Different methods to model precast, prestressed concrete hollowcore floor slabs subjected to fire are also investigated. The results show that <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> can enhance the fire performance of hollowcore floor slabs provided that the spacing of the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> does not greatly exceed the span length...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the fire {{performance}} of hollowcore units is significantly affected by the end support conditions, but it has not been clear how the fire resistance of the overall floor system can be improved by providing <b>side</b> <b>supports.</b> The previous studies used beam grillage and shell elements to separately model the hollowcore units and the topping concrete slab using the platform of the non-linear finite element program SAFIR. The modelling method required a lot of computational resources and is not ideal to model a large floor area. This paper describes the effect of the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> and the aspect ratio of the floor on the predicted fire resistance. It also compares the efficiencies of shell elements and short beam elements for finite element modelling of the topping concrete in fire conditions. The results show that integrating the topping concrete slab into the beam grillages reduces the complexity of the model and also provides satisfactory results. <b>Side</b> <b>supports</b> can increase the fire performance of hollowcore floor slabs provided that the spacing of the <b>side</b> <b>supports</b> does not greatly exceed the span length...|$|R

50|$|With the {{original}} design of email protocol, the communication between email servers was plain text, which posed a huge security risk. Over the years, various mechanisms have been proposed to encrypt the communication between email servers. One {{of the most commonly}} used extension is STARTTLS. It is a TLS (SSL) layer over the plaintext communication, allowing email servers to upgrade their plaintext communication to encrypted communication. Assuming that the email servers on both the sender and the recipient <b>side</b> <b>support</b> encrypted communication, an eavesdropper snooping on the communication between the mail servers can not see the email contents. Similar extensions exist for the communication between an email client and the email server.|$|E
50|$|There is no general {{agreement}} on how much, or even what {{use to make}} of the third wheel on a tilter. Sometimes it does little more than a kickstand with a caster, employed at low speed. These are called free-leaners and they must be balanced through countersteering before turning, just as on a motorcycle or other single-track vehicle. For comfort, the free-leaners are the best for cyclists, as the legs don't get thrown to the side when you hit a bump on one side, and no muscles are used for <b>side</b> <b>support</b> of the torso. Most motorcycles using this technology are scooters. According to the manufacturers' marketing these three-wheelers are more stable, have a better weight distribution and handle poor road surfaces better compared to a standard two-wheeler scooter.|$|E
