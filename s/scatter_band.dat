50|$|The Brown University Band is the {{official}} band of Brown University. Like all Ivy League bands except Cornell's, it is a <b>scatter</b> <b>band.</b> The Brown Band began performing on ice skates in 1970, and {{claims to be the}} world's only ice skating <b>scatter</b> <b>band.</b> It is the source of much of Brown's school spirit, and often appears as a public representation of Brown to the Providence community and to other universities. The Band is present at Brown's football, hockey, and basketball games, in addition to Commencement and many other events each year. It receives funding from Brown's Undergraduate Finance Board.|$|E

Besides standard types of band instruments, the YPMB includes violins, bagpipes, accordions, keyboards, keytars, musical saws, and air guitars, and in 1973, {{was the first}} <b>scatter</b> <b>band</b> to incorporate electric guitars.|$|E

40|$|The elastic {{fracture}} toughness {{of the three}} steels is shown to not decrease significantly with decreasing temperature from room temperature to about 244 K (- 20 F.). The elastic {{fracture toughness}} of the three steels increased with increasing specimen width and thickness. The fatigue-crack-growth data for all three steels fall into relatively narrow <b>scatter</b> <b>bands</b> on plots of rate against stress-intensity range. An equation is shown to predict the upper bounds of the <b>scatter</b> <b>bands</b> reasonably well.

30|$|High-speed, {{high-resolution}} OCT, {{by providing}} unprecedented details, has enhanced {{our understanding of}} the ultrastructure of the retina [9]. Distinct <b>scattering</b> <b>bands</b> correspond to photoreceptor IS/OS junction, photoreceptor outer segment tips, and the RPE and represent the thick <b>scattering</b> <b>bands</b> of outer retina [9]. The SD-OCT changes in healed scars of SLC have shown disruption of the outer retina at the site of scars with loss of junction between the inner and outer segments of photoreceptors and thinning of RPE/Bruch membrane complex and a correspondent increase in light reflectivity from the choroid [3]. Areas of thickening of RPE/Bruch membrane complex have also been shown in the regions of scars. However, there is no report of SD-OCT changes in any active and healing stages of SLC lesions.|$|R

5000|$|A {{scramble}} band - {{also known}} as a <b>scatter</b> <b>band</b> - is a particular type of field-performing marching band with distinct characteristics that set it apart from other common forms of marching bands; most notably, scramble bands do not normally march. In fact, the name comes from {{the way in which the}} band moves between formations [...] - [...] members run to each form without using a predescribed path; this is known as scrambling or, in the western half of the United States, scattering.|$|E
5000|$|Barnes had a {{tough time}} convincing the {{students}} that a song from British band Free could represent the university, but to this day, students and alumni still jump during [...] "All Right Now", the school's de facto fight song. While [...] "Come Join The Band" [...] has been the official fight song since long before Stanford had a <b>scatter</b> <b>band,</b> the band plays [...] "All Right Now" [...] before every game, after every touchdown or field goal, after every Stanford win (when they play their [...] "Victory Mix"), and as the last song of any set that they perform.|$|E
5000|$|In {{previous}} years, {{the band}} {{aspired to be}} a Big Ten type marching band. However, during the early 1970s the band revolted against the strict disciplinary style of conventional marching bands and almost succumbed to campus pressure to become a <b>scatter</b> <b>band</b> like the other Ivy League bands. In 1971, the marching band became quite similar to the scatter bands in appearance, with the drum major wearing either a blazer or a dinner jacket. However, the band eventually returned to its traditional roots, and in 1973, the traditional drum major uniform returned for good. Rather than the high-stepping Big Ten style of marching, the band now uses a modern [...] "corps-style" [...] marching technique (similar to Southeastern Conference marching bands) during performances.|$|E

60|$|The trail, {{hardly more}} than a wood road, grew wilder and lonelier as they climbed. Cattle fed on the hillsides in <b>scattered</b> <b>bands</b> like elk.

50|$|The Band {{is present}} at every home and Ivy {{football}} {{game in the}} fall semester. During the spring semester, the band will play at basketball or hockey games {{once or twice a}} weekend. Other sports, such as soccer, water polo, and even rowing will occasionally be cheered on by the Band. Brown University administration also occasionally asks the band to be present at certain important events, such as the kickoff of the Boldly Brown campaign. Other yearly events include the stealth show, where the band hides in bushes and buildings surrounding the main green, then surprises students who are just leaving class at the busiest time of day with a humorous and uncensored <b>scatter</b> <b>band</b> show. On the morning of the Parents' Weekend football game, the Band completes a Campus March that takes them inside several dorms and outside most of the rest. While the Band stands by the claim that this is to build team spirit and to get people to come to the football game, many students are unhappy with the early wakeup. However, not all parades are early in the morning. Every December, the Band parades around campus playing Christmas and Hanukkah carols, giving out hot chocolate and candy canes to anyone willing to brave the cold New England weather, and even playing inside the dining hall, library, and CIT. Once a year, the Band performs for patrons waiting in line for Ben and Jerry's Free Cone Day before getting their own free ice cream.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of geometry, residual welding stresses and secondary bending effects on the fatigue strength of fillet welded joints made of structural steels. Joints with main plate thicknesses ranging from 10 to 100 mm subjected both to axial and to bending load with load ratios between - 1 and 0. 1 were considered. The experimental results {{were taken from the}} literature and then re-analysed in terms of local stress field intensity instead of nominal stress. This approach led to the definition of a new unified <b>scatter</b> <b>band</b> valid for structural steels, similar to that defined in the past for welded joints but with new characteristic parameters. The application of the <b>scatter</b> <b>band</b> to local strain fields evaluated by numerical analyses or measured by strain gauges is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The energy {{dissipated}} to {{the surroundings}} as {{heat in a}} unit volume of material per cycle, Q, was recently proposed as fatigue damage index, and it was successfully applied to rationalise fatigue data obtained by carrying out stress-controlled and strain-controlled fatigue tests on AISI 304 L stainless steel plain and hole specimens. In this paper, it is shown that the Q parameter is independent on thermal and mechanical boundary conditions occurring during experiments. After that, additional stress-controlled fatigue tests on plain and notched specimens characterised by smaller notch tip radii than those tested previously have been performed. Present data have been compared with previous ones, and {{it was found that}} all available results can be synthesised in terms of the energy parameter Q into a unique <b>scatter</b> <b>band,</b> independently on the testing conditions (stress-controlled or strain-controlled) and on the specimens’ geometry (plain or notched). About 100 data were included in the statistical analysis to characterise the energy-based <b>scatter</b> <b>band</b> of the material. Finally, some limitations of applicability of the experimental technique adopted in the present paper are discussed...|$|E
