50|$|The <b>Senegal</b> <b>coucal</b> (Centropus senegalensis) is {{a member}} of the cuckoo order of birds, the Cuculiformes, which also {{includes}} the roadrunners, the anis, and the hoatzin. It is a medium-sized member of its genus and is found in lightly-wooded country and savannah in central and southern Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Senegal</b> <b>coucal</b> takes a {{wide range}} of insects, {{caterpillars}} and small vertebrates. It occasionally eats other food items. It nests off the ground in low vegetation, and the typical clutch is two to four eggs laid in a large nest built from stalks and leaves.|$|E
50|$|Other {{specials}} {{that occur}} in Mapungubwe National Park include great white pelican, white-backed night heron, bat hawk, augur buzzard, African hobby, Dickinsonâ€™s kestrel, green sandpiper, three-banded courser, blue-spotted wood dove, grey-headed parrot, <b>Senegal</b> <b>coucal,</b> pennant-winged nightjar, blue-cheeked bee-eater, broad-billed and racket-tailed roller, African golden oriole and olive-tree warbler.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{widespread}} species distributed through much of central and southern Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The range extends from Senegal {{in the west to}} Ethiopia and Kenya in the east, and Angola and Congo to the south. A separate population in southern Africa is centred on Zambia, Zimbabwe and northern Botswana. The <b>Senegal</b> <b>coucal</b> is a bird of grassy habitats with trees, such as bushes and savannah.|$|E
50|$|The {{blue-headed}} coucal {{occurs in}} tropical central Africa at altitudes {{of up to}} 3000 m, generally at higher altitudes than the <b>Senegal</b> <b>coucal</b> (Centropus senegalensis). It is found in Angola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda. Its habitat is swamps and marshes, tall grassland, river banks, wet savannah, plantations, secondary growth forests, farmland and villages.|$|E
50|$|An adult coppery-tailed coucal {{is about}} 48 cm long {{and has a}} curved beak and long, broad tail. Males are {{slightly}} smaller than females. The coppery-tailed coucal's plumage {{is similar to that}} of the <b>Senegal</b> <b>coucal</b> (Centropus senegalensis). It has a black head and upperparts, white or cream-coloured underparts, a brown rump with a coppery-sheen and a blackish-brown tail. Immature birds have pale streaks on the head and their flight feathers are barred. The call of the coppery-tailed coucal consists of deep, bubbling notes.|$|E
50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g <b>Senegal</b> <b>coucal</b> (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
