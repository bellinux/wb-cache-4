40|$|The {{position}} {{behind this}} study is that the college faculty member can improve his teaching, even if he is already a master teacher, by scientifically identifying some of the key variables that {{have a major impact on}} student learning in his classes. Two studies have attempted to answer the following question: Ts there any evidence Ail+ a college student's personality is related to his preference for various instructional experiences? Jungian personality types were used. The first study found that the students teeted hold predictable views for and against self-paced instruction: intuitive students preferred eelf-paced instruction to more tradieional group-paced teaching mothods; sensing types liked more traditional methods of instruction. The present study sought to find if associations made in the first study still held up and to lore mine what relationships, if any, existed between student types and each of *he <b>self-paced</b> <b>course</b> modules. The instrument of study was a five-credit, <b>self-paced</b> <b>course</b> of 54 students in thermodynamics. It consisted of 2 ^ self-paced instructional modules (packages).

The grading technique of differential credit, found practical in general mathematics courses, was used.

Semester credits were {{directly related to the}} amount of lesson material covered by the different students: less material learned, fewer credits, but the grade earned was a C or better, Compared with a matched group of regular algebra students, the DCA group performed significantly poorer. The reason for this was that the experimental DCA group did not cover all the material as fast as the control group, and that both groups were tested alike to determine the significant difference. When compared {{on the basis of what}} the DCA students had covered, there was no significant difference in the performance of the two groups.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} is to study the relation between self-reported procrastination and actual procrastination {{within the context of a}} self-paced introductory level psychology class. ^ The main features of the method of the present study involve tracking the progress of students in a self-paced introductory psychology class, and relating that information to their self-reports of procrastination based on their responses to a commonly used procrastination inventory. The <b>self-paced</b> <b>course</b> was selected because it allows students to be responsible for their rate of progress through the course. ^ To answer questions posed by the present study, one set of analyses was performed to determine whether self-reported procrastination is related to actual procrastinatory behavior. Analyses were also conducted to determine the impact of procrastination on a number of outcome variables including final grade in the course, ACT scores, and drop out rates in the PSI course. A third set of analyses were conducted to determine the relation between the rate of completion in the class and grade with respect to procrastination. ^ The results suggested little or no relation between self-reported procrastination and behavioral or actual procrastination. The only statistically significant finding was that students who score in the medium range as self-reported procrastinators tended to take a slightly longer period of time to complete the course. ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Government Accounting OFfice (GAO) {{has stated that}} insufficient attention is given to Human Factors Engineering (HFE) {{in the design of}} systems during the Weapons Acquisition Cycle (WAC). According to GAO these inadequacies have adversely impacted our military capabilities and wasted lives and millions of dollars. A myriad of handbooks, manuals and standards exist which provide detailed guidelines, criteria and test plans for conducting HF T&E which remain unused because their technological level is beyond the average user. The need for basic training in HFE has been clearly identified. A cost effective vehicle to bridge this gap in conceptual knowledge has been developed {{in the form of an}} HFE <b>Self-Paced</b> <b>Course.</b> As coordinated with the course's sponsor, an internal review and trial run were conducted, via this thesis, to assess its potential effectiveness.

Additionally, the value of the job tasks identified in the course's terminal objectives were substantiated. The conclusions provided in this study are intended to encourage further course development through incorporation of the recommendations outlined. Ultimately, this would lead to its validation and implementation into the instructional system of the military.

50|$|<b>Self-paced</b> <b>courses</b> {{maximize}} student freedom, as {{not only}} can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or {{up to a year}} or longer. Students often enroll in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, {{have not been able to}} complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies, for use in self-paced programs.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Problem: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of three different methods of teaching chemistry at a community college. Procedure: Three classes of college chemistry were taught using the traditional lecture-discussion with a typical text, a lecture-discussion using a programed text, and an individualized self-paced method. The <b>self-paced</b> <b>course</b> was designed to allow the students to proceed only after they had mastered the material. The students used a programed text and had material presented cm audio cassette and dittoed pages of lecture notes. The students were free {{to listen to the}} tapes at any time and also to take the tests at the time they determined they were ready. All three groups of students were tested with an American Chemical Society test at the completion of the three term sequence. Conclusions: The results were analyzed by comparing the results with high school grade point averages by the statistical method of analysis of covariance. The self-paced approach was shown to produce improved learning. The students using this approach consistently scored very high on the standardized test. One reason for this may be the greatly increased involvement in the business of learning by the students. The more active type of learning appears to be more effective. The self-paced approach clearly solved the problems of scheduling which are normally quite prevalent in a small community college. The philosophy of self-pacing fits well with the philosophy of meeting the needs of the students. The class is much more available to all students than a class that is tied to an administratively determined schedule. The most negative aspects of the self-paced approach were the extreme amount of time required of the instructor and the small number of students who completed the sequence...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if three exercise counseling treatments, locus of control, and self-motivation affect the exercise adherence of college students enrolled in a health and fitness course. Secondary purposes included determining whether the completion date of a <b>self-paced</b> <b>course,</b> family activity patterns, and/or individual or group exercise affected exercise adherence. ^ Students enrolled in a fitness course (n = 238) completed the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) and the Self-motivation Inventory. Subjects classified as internals on the MHLC were randomly assigned to three treatment groups (contingency contracting, graduated regimen implementation and tailoring) or a control group, and externals were similarly assigned. Subjects met with specified counselors over a ten week period to receive assistance consistent with their treatment groups on their exercise programs. Three and six months after completion of the course, subjects were mailed 7 -day re-call questionnaires regarding the amount and type of their current exercise programs. ^ Analyses of variance (p ≤ 0. 05) revealed that significantly more hours of vigorous exercise were reported by (1) internals than externals, (2) subjects who exercised with others than subjects who exercised alone, and (3) subjects who completed course requirements ahead of time than those who completed the course on time. Significantly more hours of exercise were reported at six months (June) than at three months (March). Correlations revealed a significant positive relationship between exercise adherence and self-motivation. Non-significant differences were found for exercise adherence of (1) subjects in different treatment groups, (2) internals and externals, or subjects with different levels of self-motivation, within the different treatment groups, and (3) subjects from families with different physical activity patterns. ^ This study indicates that being an internal, having high self-motivation, exercising with others, and completing self-paced tasks early have a positive influence on exercise adherence. In addition, students clearly are more active in the summertime than during the academic year. Furthermore, it would appear that exercise counseling strategies and family exercise patterns do not influence exercise adherence. Exercise adherence does not appear to differ between internals and externals within different exercise counseling strategies, nor for subjects with different levels of self-motivation. ...|$|E
