25|$|The {{spinning}} jenny, a multi-spool {{spinning wheel}} invented c. 1764 by James Hargreaves, dramatically reduced {{the amount of}} work needed to produce yarn of high consistency, with a single worker able to work eight or more spools at once. At roughly the same time, Richard Arkwright and a team of craftsmen developed the <b>spinning</b> <b>frame,</b> which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny. Too large to be operated by hand, a <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> powered by a waterwheel became the water frame.|$|E
25|$|This is a later {{development}} of the ring <b>spinning</b> <b>frame.</b> The passage of the yarn from the front rollers to the paper tube - used {{in place of a}} bobbin - is different from other types of spinning frames. When the yarn leaves the rollers it passes direct to the top of an elongated spindle and coils round it two or three times before forming a balloon to the ring traveller. This enables the twist to be imparted between the spindle top and roller nip, thus helping to produce a smoother yarn.|$|E
25|$|The next {{process is}} to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to {{strengthen}} the resulting slubbing such {{that it can be}} wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the <b>spinning</b> <b>frame.</b> However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E

25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A felt or cloth washer is placed between the lifter plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> {{or water}} frame was {{developed}} by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. [...] For each spindle, the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. [...] The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. [...] Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread. [...] The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight. [...] The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length. [...] The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth {{to be made in}} Britain. [...] A horse powered the first factory to use the <b>spinning</b> <b>frame.</b> Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.|$|E
2500|$|In 1764 in {{the village}} of Stanhill, Lancashire, James Hargreaves invented the {{spinning}} jenny, which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> with multiple spindles. [...] The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting. It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792, and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft, not warp.|$|E
2500|$|Some early {{spinning}} and weaving machinery, {{such as a}} 40 spindle jenny for about six pounds in 1792, [...] was affordable for cottagers. [...] Later machinery such as <b>spinning</b> <b>frames,</b> <b>spinning</b> mules and power looms were expensive (especially if water powered), giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories.|$|R

2500|$|The river {{has been}} an {{important}} source of power, from at least 1086, when there was a watermill in Mansfield. A big {{increase in the number of}} mills began in the 1780s, when the frame knitting industry was decimated by the advent of Richard Arkwright's water-powered <b>spinning</b> <b>frame.</b> William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, encouraged the building of textile mills to relieve unemployment and poverty. Most were converted to do [...] "cotton doubling", and several later became hosiery mills. The conversion of watermills which had formerly ground corn to textile mills led to the building of windmills to carry on milling corn. Although water power has largely ceased, there is still an operational water-mill at Ollerton.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advent of}} the Industrial Revolution in Britain {{provided}} a great boost to cotton manufacture, as textiles emerged as Britain's leading export. In 1738, Lewis Paul and John Wyatt, of Birmingham, England, patented the roller spinning machine, {{as well as the}} flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing cotton to a more even thickness using two sets of rollers that traveled at different speeds. Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves' spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright's <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's spinning mule in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of Manchester acquired the nickname [...] "Cottonopolis" [...] due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis Paul {{patented}} {{the roller}} <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool {{to a more}} even thickness. The technology was developed {{with the help of}} John Wyatt of Birmingham. [...] Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743 a factory opened in Northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster, but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill. Lewis's invention was later developed and improved by Richard Arkwright in his water frame and Samuel Crompton in his spinning mule.|$|E
25|$|An {{inventory}} of 1802 suggests that spinning {{was to be}} carried out on hand-powered spinning jennies, with a waterwheel (costing £450) powering the carding machines. By 1816 the mill contained worsted <b>spinning</b> <b>frames,</b> and in 1822 a new waterwheel costing £1,500 had been installed.|$|R
50|$|After {{a record}} year in 1896, the company faced {{competition}} from new ring <b>spinning</b> <b>frames,</b> an alternative technology suited to coarse counts. Their competitors were Howard & Bullough of Accrington and Tweedales and Smalley of Rochdale. Platts also supplied plans for mills and the fitters to install them.|$|R
50|$|In 1835, Mason {{moved to}} Taunton, Massachusetts {{to work for}} Crocker and Richmond, a company that made ring <b>spinning</b> <b>frames</b> for the cotton textile industry. While the firm failed in the {{financial}} crisis of 1837, it was soon taken over by Leach and Keith. Mason was made foreman.|$|R
2500|$|Richard Arkwright first {{spinning}} mill, Cromford Mill, Derbyshire, {{was built}} in 1771. It contained his invention the water frame. The water frame was developed from the <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> that Arkwright had developed with (a different) John Kay, from Warrington. [...] The original design was again claimed by Thomas Highs: which he purposed he had patented in 1769. [...] Arkwright used waterwheels to power the textile machinery. His initial attempts at driving the frame had used horse power, but a mill needed far more power. Using a waterwheel demanded a location with a ready supply of water, hence the mill at Cromford. This mill is preserved {{as part of the}} Derwent Valley Mills [...] Arkwright generated jobs and constructed accommodation for his workers which he moved into the area. This led to a sizeable industrial community. Arkwright protected his investment from industrial rivals and potentially disruptive workers. This model worked and he expanded his operations {{to other parts of the}} country.|$|E
2500|$|Mansfield had {{a cottage}} industry, which by 1800 {{consisted}} of around 700 knitting frames. It operated {{as a social}} service, {{as most of the}} workers were either orphaned children, or children from families who would otherwise be destitute. Following the invention of the [...] "water-frame", a <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> that was powered by a water wheel, which had been invented by Richard Arkwright in 1771 and used in his mills at Cromford, the cottage industry could not compete, and there was widespread unemployment and poverty in Mansfield. In an attempt to remedy the situation, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, who was the landowner, and who later became Home Secretary, organised a programme of building water-powered spinning mills along the river. Hermitage Mill was the first to be built, in 1782, and still stands on Hermitage lane. Little Matlock Mill was built three years later on Sheepbridge Lane, and again still stands. Field Mill on Nottingham Road was converted to work with cotton in 1785. Immediately above it was Drury Mill, a corn mill run by Daniel Drury, but this had to be closed in 1791 when the water level in Field Mill Dam was raised, preventing Drury's wheel from working efficiently. Field Mill was in use as a leather works by 1916 and was demolished in 1925.|$|E

50|$|For instance, when {{holding onto}} a {{carousel}} that turns at {{constant angular velocity}} you experience a radially inward (centripetal) proper-acceleration due to {{the interaction between the}} handhold and your hand. This cancels the radially outward geometric acceleration associated with your <b>spinning</b> coordinate <b>frame.</b> This outward acceleration (from the <b>spinning</b> <b>frame's</b> perspective) will become the coordinate acceleration when you let go, causing you to fly off along a zero proper-acceleration (geodesic) path.
