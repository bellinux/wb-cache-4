He emphasized that cost accounting is a <b>service</b> <b>function</b> whose value depends on its usefulness to other departments. As a staff man negotiating with foremen and executives, the cost accountant must be diplomatic, yet forceful enough {{to take full advantage of}} the discipline that costing makes possible. Nicholson stressed the importance of supplying cost figures that are appropriate for each executive level, and the need to educate foremen and department heads about overhead costs as a first step toward controlling such costs. Cost accountants should give department managers comparative costs of materials, labor, overhead, production quantities, and inventories. Each production department should in turn inform the sales department how all these amounts are likely to vary in relation to changes in sales volume.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{provides a}} focused study on eighty-five comprehensive community colleges {{located within the}} states of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. Specifically, the study is focused upon twenty-five basic student <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> and 250 mid-level managers within four distinct student service areas. First, the focus on basic student <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> centers upon their absence or presence at the institutions. This situation is analyzed {{with regard to the}} effect of institutional headcount enrollment and reporting lines for the mid-level managers. Second, the focus on mid-level managers revolves around their perceptual differences in regard to institutional priority and their individual priority for the basic student <b>service</b> <b>functions.</b> ^ Findings of the study are presented in tables of descriptive and inferential data. The chi-square statistic was utilized to determine the statistical significance of headcount enrollment and reporting lines. The analysis of variance statistic was utilized to identify statistically significant interaction in regard to perceptual differences within the mid-level managers. ^ Conclusions of this study support the premise that headcount enrollment does influence the presence of certain student <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> while reporting lines for mid-level managers have a limited influence on the presence of basic student <b>service</b> <b>functions.</b> In addition, mid-level managers were generally in agreement about perceived institutional priority for the basic student <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> but had some significant differences in regard to what they felt the priorities should be for selected student <b>service</b> <b>functions.</b> When viewed collectively, the mid-level managers felt that all of the basic student <b>service</b> <b>functions</b> were assigned a lower priority by the institution than they thought appropriate. This was verified by utilizing the t-test statistic which yielded statistically significant differences for all of the student <b>service</b> <b>functions.</b> ^ Future research possibilities are unlimited and necessary to further understand the complexities of the management relationship and its consequences for departmental productivity and efficiency. This is particularly true when institutional and departmental priorities are potentially in conflict. ...|$|R

The respondents were private individuals purposively selected from among the academic and non-academic staff members. A total of 68 respondents (45 %) were willing to pay amounts of money ranging from # 5 to# 1000 monthly. The modal value was # 100 having recorded the highest percentage of response (41 %).

50|$|The {{client-server}} {{model is a}} distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs which share their resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources, but requests a server's content or <b>service</b> <b>function.</b> Clients therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests.Examples of computer applications that use the {{client-server model}} are Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.|$|E
50|$|The network {{elements}} {{that use the}} Session Initiation Protocol for communication are called SIP user agents. Each user agent (UA) performs the function of a user agent client (UAC) when it is requesting a <b>service</b> <b>function,</b> and that of a user agent server (UAS) when responding to a request. Thus, any two SIP endpoints may in principle operate without any intervening SIP infrastructure. However, for network operational reasons, for provisioning public services to users, and for directory services, SIP defines several specific types of network server elements. Each of these service elements also communicates within the client-server model implemented in user agent clients and servers.|$|E
