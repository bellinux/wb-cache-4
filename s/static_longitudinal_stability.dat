40|$|ABSTRACT:The {{issue of}} the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> of a WIG vehicle {{has been a very}} {{critical}} design factor since the first experimental WIG vehicle has been built. A series of studies had been performed and focused on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> analysis. However, most studies focused on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stability</b> of WIG vehicle in cruise phase, and less is available on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> requirement of WIG vehicle when hydrodynamics are considered: WIG vehicle usually take off from water. The present work focuses on <b>stability</b> requirement for <b>longitudinal</b> motion from taking off to landing. The model of dynamics for a WIG vehicle was developed taking into account the aerodynamic, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and then was analyzed. Following with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> analysis, effect of hydrofoil was discussed. Locations of CG, aerodynamic center in pitch, aerodynamic center in height and hydrodynamic center in heave were illustrated for a stabilized WIG vehicle. The present work will further improve the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> theory for WIG vehicle...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study is}} carried out {{of the behavior of}} modern high-speed aircraft of inertially slender configurations in maneuvers involving large rates of roll. Inertia cross-coupling, as well as a linear variation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> (C/m-alpha/) with angle of attack, are considered. The steady-state solutions of the nonlinear equations of motion, based on principal inertia axes, are studied to obtain useful information on the response behavior of the state variables during roll maneuvers. It is shown that, in addition to the critical values of aileron deflection that have been previously found to limit a steady-state roll with constant <b>longitudinal</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability,</b> there can be two new critical values introduced by a linear decrease of the absolute value of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> with angle of attack.
