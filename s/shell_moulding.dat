As compared to sand casting, this process has better dimensional accuracy, a higher productivity rate, and lower labor requirements. It is used for small to medium parts that require high precision.Shell mold casting is a metal casting process similar to sand casting, in that molten metal is poured into an expendable mold. However, in shell mold casting, the mold is a thin-walled shell created from applying a sand-resin mixture around a pattern. The pattern, a metal piece {{in the shape of}} the desired part, is reused to form multiple shell molds. A reusable pattern allows for higher production rates, while the disposable molds enable complex geometries to be cast. Shell mold casting requires the use of a metal pattern, oven, sand-resin mixture, dump box, and molten metal.|$|E

The slurry composition produces green(unfired) ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> which low in strength and easily crack or fail during wax removal or handling processing. By strengthening of this brittle ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> via reinforcement technique can enhance the strength of green <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> body. In this work, {{the presence of the}} treated rice husk fibre toughened the green <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> by creating mechanical interlocking bonding in shell matrix which contributes to higher modulus rupture value. In fact, through SEM observations showed that the addition of fibers to the ceramic body to form a composite <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> prevent the crack propagation mechanism due to the existence of the matrix-fibre bridging which create the resistance of fiber to pull-out.

40|$|This paper aims at {{studying}} the iron casting solidification and the optimisation {{of the design}} parameters by means of numerical simulations. In particular, the aim of computer modeling has been the prediction of solidification pattern, indicating where shrinkage cavities and associated defect could arise, and simulate solidification with the casting system in different positions, in order to select the optimal position. To this purpose, the software MAGMASOFT was used to simulate the solidification of simple iron castings with a ring shape, obtained by means of <b>shell</b> <b>moulding</b> processes with different gating systems.

40|$|Basically, {{permeability}} {{of ceramic}} <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> system {{play an important}} role in minimizing the casting defects in most investment casting <b>shell.</b> The <b>mould</b> has to be sufficiently permeable to obtain complete mould filling during casting process. Mould fill can be improved by increasing the open porosity that definitely will increase permeability ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould.</b> The elimination of rice husk volatile elements has contributed to the increment of pore structure that provides a great deal of connected pathways through the ceramic shell which directly will increase the permeability of the ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> during casting process.

40|$|Aiming at the {{cracking}} {{phenomenon of}} the thin <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> in the expendable pattern shell casting during the pattern removing process, some systemic researches are presented. The influence of the pattern removing method and temperature on the pattern removing were investigated. The <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> cracking mechanism was analyzed by using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and combining the temperature field and the volume change of the expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam pattern being tested. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> was not easily cracked when the pattern removing process was carried out with the furnace being heated little by little because of the shell slowly shrinking with dehydration and shell strength gradually increasing. The <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> was soon destroyed when it was set directly into the furnace at above 400 ℃ because of the thin <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> rapidly shrinking and the foam pattern hindering. However, the <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> had no cracking when it had been preheated for a long time even if the furnace temperature was above 400 篊 and the shell was put into the furnace directly. Moreover, when the <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> was directly set into the furnace at lower temperatures, 250 to 300 ℃, the shell would shrink slowly and the foam pattern would stay at the maximum expansion stage temperature of 100 to 110 ℃ for a long time; and the <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> would experience an expansion force from the foam pattern for a long time. The expansion force is related to the pattern removing temperature, holding time, foam pattern thickness and density. Therefore, the foam pattern with higher density could make the shell crack...|$|R
40|$|For inany years, {{precision}} {{investment casting}} foundries have periodically reported serious casting defects. One source {{is associated with}} the brittle ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> which is very weak in tension and highly expose to the cracking mechanism. This situation not only lead to the appearance of defect in the end cast product but always attribute to the handling problem at the earlier stage in the investment casting industry. Due to this fact the strengthening mechanism of the brittle sllell mold using reinforcement method was studied and investigated in this work. Rice husk was chosen as a reinforcement material as it contains silica element which can withstand high temperature of molten metal. Several testing procedures and characterization technique were carried out in order to measure the performance of the reinforced <b>shell</b> <b>mould.</b> Results show that the MOR value for the green reinforced <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> is higher than the green body of non reinforced <b>shell</b> <b>mould.</b> Scanning electron microscope observations also show that the fiber alignment across the matrix structure increase the failure resistance and yet increase the strength of the <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> green body.

40|$|Generally, {{production}} of metal component via investment casting process need a {{development of a}} very thin ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> that can withstand a higher molten metal temperature. Development of ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> is very crucial as its involves several times of dipping process followed by the drying and firing stages. Typically, this ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> is very brittle and easily prone to cracks {{that will lead to}} the casting defects and handling problem at early stage. Therefore, this work focuses on the development of brittle ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> via reinforcement method. Rice husk fibers and rice husk ash were selected as a reinforcement material due to the facts that its contains higher percentage of silica. The samples were prepared by three compositions which are untreated rice husk fiber, rice husk treated fiber by sodium hydroxide and rice husk ash. The mechanical and physical properties of ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> layering system were measured via Modulus of Rupture, density and porosity, permeability, shrinkage, thermal expansion and observation of metal casting. Experimental results show that the reinforced ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> with treated rice husk fiber achieved highest green strength (1. 34 MPa). However, ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> with rice husk ash shows the highest fired strength (4. 87 MPa). Indeed, rice husk fibers additions have greatly increased porosity after firing at 1000 ºC by values of 20. 06 % and hence promotes increments of permeability by value of 2. 46 x 10 - 11 cm 2. The present of silica also gives highest density, lowest shrinkage and thermal expansion by value of 1. 9516 g/cm 3, 0. 1258 mm and 0. 088 % respectively for ceramic shell with rice husk ash. Observation of metal casting shows that reinforced ceramic shell can withstand high molten metal temperature without cracking. Hence, reinforced ceramic shell has reduced production time and cost via avoiding failure to the mould and end cast product...|$|R

40|$|The directional/single-crystal {{solidification}} (DS/SC) of {{turbine blades}} made of superalloys {{is a key}} technology on a high scientific and technical level. Industrial DS/SC turbine blades are traditionally produced by using the expensive Bridgman process, which {{is characterized by a}} relatively inefficient heat dissipation and a low thermal gradient. In this thesis a Thin Shell Casting (TSC) process for downwards directional solidification is developed. This novel technique is a combination of the Czochralski, dynamical baffle and GCC technologies, which is characterized by a thin <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> (~ 1 mm), a complete isolation between the heating and cooling zone as well as a gas cooling. By pulling up the <b>shell</b> <b>mould</b> through the floating baffle from the melt bath, a directional solidification is performed downwards. Application of gas cooling enables a significantly increased heat extraction. Thus the specific disadvantage of the Bridgman process, i. e. the low temperature gradient and the consequent casting defects could be generally overcome by this new technique. Using a Cu alloy in the first work phase, the feasibility of this novel process was successfully confirmed. With simplified <b>shell</b> <b>moulds,</b> DS/SC components were cast. The second work phase dealt with the directional solidification of Al alloys, in order to fundamentally investigate the solidification condition and to systematically analyze the resultant microstructure in the TSC process. Thereafter DS/SC turbine blades of Al alloys were also successfully cast. In the third part, some DS rods of the Ni-base superalloy CMSX- 6 were cast under inert gas. According to the metallographic examination, an extremely high temperature gradient G of about 24 K/mm was evaluated, which is a considerable increase by an order of magnitude over that of the conventional Bridgman process. As a consequence, the primary dendrite arm spacing lambda 1 is reduced by a factor of three. The reduction of the size and volume fraction of gamma/gamma'-eutectic is even more pronounced. Due to the strongly shortened interdendritic feeding path, the interdendritic porosity is almost completely eliminated. The result is a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of DS/SC components...|$|R
