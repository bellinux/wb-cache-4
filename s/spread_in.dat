40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{macroeconomic}} determinants of interest rate <b>spreads</b> <b>in</b> Ghana for the period 1980 - 2013. Design/methodology/approach: The autoregressive distributed lag bounds test approach to cointegration and the error correction model were used for the estimation. Findings: The results indicate that exchange rate volatility, fiscal deficit, economic growth, and public sector borrowing from commercial banks, increase interest rate <b>spreads</b> <b>in</b> Ghana in both the long and short run. Institutional quality reduces interest rate <b>spreads</b> <b>in</b> the long run while lending interest rate volatility and monetary policy rate reduce interest rate <b>spreads</b> <b>in</b> the short run. Research limitations/implications: The depreciation of the Ghana cedi must be controlled since its volatility increases spreads. There is a need for fiscal discipline since fiscal deficits increase interest rate spreads. Government must reduce its domestic borrowing because the associated crowding-out effect increases interest rate spreads. The central bank must improve its monitoring and regulation of the financial sector in order to reduce spreads. Originality/value: The main novelty of the paper (compared to other studies on Ghana) lies on the one hand; analysing macroeconomic determinants of interest rate spreads and, on the other hand, controlling for the impact of institutional quality on interest rate <b>spreads</b> <b>in</b> Ghana...|$|R

5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui Dynasty, Yang (reigned 604–618), the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane: the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, coupled with natural disasters, caused unrest in the provinces, while the successive military failures eroded the emperor's prestige and legitimacy ("Mandate of Heaven") among the provincial governors. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, {{and by the time}} he realized the gravity of the situation, it was too late: as revolts <b>spread,</b> <b>in</b> 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade {{began to take}} {{advantage}} of the new trading opportunities in the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse. The trade routes were expanded further reaching Cyprus, Amman in the Near East, Apulia in Italy and Spain.

The use of the new script <b>spread</b> <b>in</b> mainland Greece and offers valuable insight of the administrative network of the palatial centers.
