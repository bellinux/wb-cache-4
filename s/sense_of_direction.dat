5|$|After visiting England in July 1936, Thomas Finucane, then {{a company}} director, decided {{to set up}} an office in the West End of London on Regent Street. In November 1936, the family moved to England {{permanently}} and bought a house at 26 Castle Gate Road, Richmond in the London suburbs. Brendan was sent to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. Brendan completed his schooling with good qualifications. He started in an office job as an accountant which he loathed. In 1937, the RAF began offering short-service commissions (SSC) to lower-class persons who met the academic standard. It offered a four-year term as a junior rank on squadron service with flying lessons. A further six years would be spent on the reserve list. In November 1937, Brendan approached his father about joining the British Armed Forces. Despite his Republican past, the senior Finucane agreed believing a military career would provide him a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> lacking in his own youth. His parents cashed in their insurance policies, even though they needed the money and Thomas Andrew Finucane had been made unemployed.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine and observe the effects <b>of</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> (i. e., {{abilities}} of memory and awareness of orientation) on wayfinding behaviors for biking tourists. A total of 295 biking tourists completed a questionnaire using a purposive sampling method. The hierarchical regression model was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Results show that biking tourists’ abilities of memory and awareness of orientation have a direct effect on their wayfinding behaviors. The contribution of this study is to demonstrate the implication <b>of</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> to biking tourists’ wayfinding behaviors and to provide biking tourists suggestions for wayfinding strategies...|$|R

5|$|There is no {{consistent}} {{relationship between}} the classification of spiders {{and the types of}} web they build: species in the same genus may build very similar or significantly different webs. Nor is there much correspondence between spiders' classification and the chemical composition of their silks. Convergent evolution in web construction, in other words use of similar techniques by remotely related species, is rampant. Orb web designs and the spinning behaviors that produce them are the best understood. The basic radial-then-spiral sequence visible in orb webs and the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> required to build them may have been inherited from the common ancestors of most spider groups. However, the majority of spiders build non-orb webs. It used to be thought that the sticky orb web was an evolutionary innovation resulting in the diversification of the Orbiculariae. Now, however, it appears that non-orb spiders are a sub-group that evolved from orb-web spiders, and non-orb spiders have over 40% more species and are four times as abundant as orb-web spiders. Their greater success may be because sphecid wasps, which are often the dominant predators of spiders, much prefer to attack spiders that have flat webs.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{improved}} {{when the}} government then tried to go into reverse with contractionary macroeconomic policies and renewed depreciation. Output plunged, but inflation once more went up instead of down, to 163 percent by 1985. By this time, pessimism about the government's capacity to solve anything, inflationary expectations turning into understandable convictions, and the price-increasing effect of devaluation all combined to give Peru a seemingly unstoppable inflation despite the elimination of anything that might be considered excess demand. The government apparently lost its <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> retreated from its attempt to reopen the economy by returning to higher tariff levels, and otherwise did little except wait for its own end in 1985.|$|E

40|$|In a cursor-control task {{in which}} {{the motion of the}} cursor is rotated {{randomly}} relative to the movement of the hand, the <b>sensed</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> hand and cursor are mutually biased. In our previous study, we used implicit and explicit measures of the bias <b>of</b> <b>sensed</b> hand <b>direction</b> toward the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the cursor and found different characteristics. The present study serves to explore further differences and commonalities of these measures. In Experiment 1, we examined the effects of different relative reliabilities of visual and proprioceptive information on the explicitly and implicitly assessed bias <b>of</b> <b>sensed</b> hand <b>direction.</b> In two conditions, participants made an aiming movement and returned to the start position immediately or after a delay of 6 s during which the cursor was no longer visible. The unimodal proprioceptive information on final hand position in the delayed condition served to increase its relative reliability. As a result, the bias <b>of</b> <b>sensed</b> hand <b>direction</b> toward the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the cursor was reduced for the explicit measure, with a complementary increase of the bias <b>of</b> <b>sensed</b> cursor <b>direction,</b> but unchanged for the implicit measure. In Experiment 2, we examined the influence of global context, specifically of the across-trial sequence of judgments of hand and cursor direction. Both explicitly and implicitly assessed biases <b>of</b> <b>sensed</b> hand <b>direction</b> did not significantly differ between the alternated condition (trial-to-trial alternations of judgments of hand and cursor direction) and the blocked condition (judgments of hand or cursor directions in all trials). They both substantially decreased from the alternated to the randomized condition (random sequence of judgments of hand and cursor direction), without a complementary increase of the bias <b>of</b> <b>sensed</b> cursor <b>direction.</b> We conclude that our explicit and implicit measures are equally sensitive to variations of coupling strength as induced by the variation of global context in Experiment 2, but are differently sensitive to variations of the relative reliabilities as induced by our additional unimodal proprioceptive information in Experiment 1...|$|R

25|$|Our {{ideas about}} God are {{important}} indicators {{of how we}} view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our {{vision of the world}} – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> and purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{music for}} the film was {{composed}} by Geir Bøhren and Bent Åserud. They traveled to Svalbard to gather inspiration {{and found that the}} lack of vegetation distorted one's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction.</b> Inspiration was gathered more from the associations of the nature and culture in Svalbard, rather than that of a traditional action film. This included such elements as listening to whale and Inuit song. For the storm scenes, the team made a Richard Wagner-inspired piece, which was distinct from the Inuit-inspired music. At the end of the piece was a flute melody, which was then adapted to become the theme song, Svalbardtema. Although the music was not mentioned in the original reception, it later became very popular and has become a de facto anthem for the archipelago. Bøhren and Åserud established themselves as film music composers with Orion's Belt and composed the music for nearly all of Solum's later films.|$|E
25|$|Technical dives {{in waters}} where the diver's vision is {{severely}} impeded by low-visibility conditions, caused by turbidity or silt out and low light conditions due to depth or enclosure, require greater competence. The combination of low visibility and strong current can make dives {{in these conditions}} extremely hazardous, particularly in an overhead environment, and greater skill and reliable and familiar equipment are needed to manage this risk. Limited visibility diving can cause disorientation, potentially leading to loss of <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> loss of effective buoyancy control, etc. Divers in extremely limited visibility situations depend on their instruments such as dive lights, pressure gauges, compass, depth gauge, bottom timer, dive computer, etc., and guidelines for orientation and information. Training for cave and wreck diving includes techniques for managing extreme low visibility, as finding {{the way out of}} an overhead environment before running out of gas is a safety-critical skill.|$|E
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Table  1, a large {{proportion}} of the metaphors (9 in 21) regarded assessment as a guide. Assessment was introduced as a “guiding star” that gives direction and meaning to learning. For one of the participants, assessment was the “steps of a ladder.” Such a metaphor rightfully emphasizes the fundamental role of assessment (steps) in education (ladder) and it also views assessment as a gradual and ongoing process. Another interesting metaphor was “life of a free bird but forever a wanderer,” which emphasized that world without assessment may mean freedom for a bird (learner) that wishes to fly freely, and yet the problem is that without assessment, this bird does not know where to fly since it has no <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|R

25|$|In February 1807, he led his brigade at the Battle of Eylau {{where the}} VII Corps {{suffered}} very heavy losses.

Losing their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> the corps instead assaulted the enemy center which was defended by a 70-gun battery. Crushed by artillery fire and ridden down by Russian cavalry the survivors fled. The shattered corps was later broken up and its units redistributed throughout the army. At the Battle of Friedland, Lapisse commanded the 2nd Division in Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's I Corps. The division included two battalions each of the 16th Light, 8th Line, 45th Line, and 54th Line Infantry Regiments. Michel Ney's VI Corps started the French attack from the right flank. When Ney's soldiers faltered, Emperor Napoleon committed the I Corps from the army reserve. As Victor's troops drove a wedge into the Russian center, Ney's corps returned to the attack on their right. Aided by Victor's exceptionally well-handled corps artillery, the French defeated the Russian Imperial Guard and fought their way into Friedland, ending the battle.|$|E
25|$|The book is {{in three}} sections, on telepathy, on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> {{including}} animal migration and the homing of pigeons, and on animal precognition, including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of {{dogs and cats}} that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes {{for half an hour}} or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when {{she was on her way}} home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly significant statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines. Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.|$|E
40|$|Parathyroid <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> {{change of}} calcium in uremia. It could be {{advantageous}} for the parathyroids {{to be able}} to sense not only the absolute concentration of extracellular Ca 2 +, but also the rate and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> change of Ca 2 +, thereby allowing the parathyroids to respond earlier to threats to Ca 2 + homeostasis. By using high and low Ca 2 + dialysis in a single session, we examined the parathyroid response to <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> change of Ca 2 + during acute Ca 2 + perturbation in nine hemodialysis patients. Separate PTH/ionized calcium (PTH/iCa) response curves were generated for rising Ca 2 + and falling Ca 2 +. Significant directional hysteresis (higher PTH level during falling than during rising Ca 2 +) was found. During hypercalcemia, PTH levels were between 2. 2 and 1. 6 times higher at iCa concentrations of between 0 and + 0. 1 mM above the baseline iCa, when Ca 2 + was falling than when it was rising. During the phase of induced hypocalcemia, parathyroid fatigue was seen in six of the nine patients. Fatigue patients tended to have higher basal PTH (1 - 84) levels than those not showing fatigue. The existence of fatigue provides an explanation for directional hysteresis during hypocalcemia, and therefore parathyroid <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> change of Ca 2 + could not be assessed during hypocalcemia. These studies demonstrate a capacity of the parathyroids to <b>sense</b> the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> movement of Ca 2 + during hypercalcemia...|$|R

25|$|Citation: On 26 August 1967, Colonel Day {{was forced}} to eject from his {{aircraft}} over North Vietnam when it was hit by ground fire. His right arm was broken in 3 places, and his left knee was badly sprained. He was immediately captured by hostile forces and taken to a prison camp where he was interrogated and severely tortured. After causing the guards to relax their vigilance, Col. Day escaped into the jungle and began the trek toward South Vietnam. Despite injuries inflicted by fragments of a bomb or rocket, he continued southward surviving only on a few berries and uncooked frogs. He successfully evaded enemy patrols and reached the Bến Hải River, where he encountered U.S. artillery barrages. With {{the aid of a}} bamboo log float, Col. Day swam across the river and entered the demilitarized zone. Due to delirium, he lost his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction</b> and wandered aimlessly for several days. After several unsuccessful attempts to signal U.S. aircraft, he was ambushed and recaptured by the Viet Cong, sustaining gunshot wounds to his left hand and thigh. He was returned to the prison from which he had escaped and later was moved to Hanoi after giving his captors false information to questions put before him. Physically, Col. Day was totally debilitated and unable to perform even the simplest task for himself. Despite his many injuries, he continued to offer maximum resistance. His personal bravery in the face of deadly enemy pressure was significant in saving the lives of fellow aviators who were still flying against the enemy. Col.

25|$|Tanith is briefly {{visited in}} Ghostmaker, and {{described}} by the Ghosts in various novels. It was a heavily forested world located in the Sabbat Worlds, a cluster of planets in the Segmentum Pacificus. The main export of Tanith was nalwood, which becomes extremely rare after the planet's destruction. Nalwood trees were capable of uprooting and moving; entire forests migrating and making paths through the forests useless as the constant movement erased them. As a result of this, the Tanith have a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>direction,</b> bred into them by adapting to this environment. It is assumed that Tanith had one major sea or ocean and polar ice caps. Although Tanith's oceans are never mentioned, Trooper Lesp {{is said to have}} come from a coastal settlement called Tanith Longshore, where he worked in the fishing industry; confirming that there was at least one sea on Tanith's surface. The capital city of Tanith – surrounded by a giant wall, presumably to keep the nalwood trees from moving into the city – was Tanith Magna. The world was governed by an Elector, and the main governmental building appears to be the Assembly (although Rawne mentions a place called the Elector's Palace when under the influence of psykers on Monthax). It is unclear {{as to whether or not}} the Elector was elected as the title sounds, or if it was an inherited position like a king. Tanith was split up into counties, not unlike Ireland (Counties Pryze and Cuhulic are mentioned). Each city on Tanith had a Militia, from which a number of Ghosts (including Corbec, Larkin, Mkvenner and Rawne) are drafted into the Imperial Guard. Tanith's native wildlife included larisel, small animals hunted by woodsmen – for their fur and possibly for food – and shoggy; small amphibian creatures with bulging eyes that dwelled by woodland pools in Tanith's forests.|$|E

50|$|To orient {{themselves}} correctly, plants {{must have}} an adequate <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> gravity’s unidirectional pull. The subsequent response plant movement is known as gravitropism. Typically, in the root this works as gravity is sensed and translated in the root tip, and subsequently roots grow towards gravity via elongation of the cells. In the shoot, similar effects are happening, but gravity is perceived and then growth occurs in the opposite direction, as the above ground part of the plant experiences negative gravitropism.|$|R
