Data collection included pre and post measurements of handwriting and <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speed,</b> observations, perception surveys, and student interviews. Results from the study indicated that students, even after keyboarding instruction, possess faster handwriting <b>speeds</b> than <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speeds.</b> Results indicated limited improvement in <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speed</b> after <b>keyboarding</b> instruction, but indicated positive student experience with keyboarding instruction and high levels of motivation toward continuing instruction. Negligible differences were noted between students who used keyboard masks and those who did not. Findings suggest a longer instruction period is necessary to produce <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speeds</b> that match handwriting <b>speeds</b> and that <b>keyboarding</b> instruction can be a positive experience for elementary students when planned in a developmentally appropriate manner...|$|R
40|$|Russell and Haney (1997) {{reported}} that open-ended test items administered on paper may underestimate {{the achievement of}} students accustomed to writing on computers. This study builds on Russell and Haney's work by examining the effect of taking open-ended tests on computers and on paper for students with different levels of computer skill. Using items from the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), this study focuses on language arts, science and math tests administered to eighth grade students. In addition, information on students' prior computer use and <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speed</b> was collected. Unlike the previous study that found large effects for open-ended writing and science items, this study reports mixed results. For the science test, performance on computers had a positive group effect. For the two language arts tests, an overall group effect was not found. However, for students whose <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speed</b> is at least 0. 5 or one-half of a standard deviation above the mean, performing the language arts test on computer had a moderate positive effect. Conversely, for students whose <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speed</b> was 0. 5 standard deviations below the mean, performing the tests on computer had a substantial negative effect. For the math test, performing the test on computer had an overall negative effect, but this effect became less pronounced as <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speed</b> increased. Implications are {{discussed in terms of}} testing policies and future research...|$|R

40|$|A study {{compared}} the typing speeds attained by students who learned to type on typewriters with the speeds attained by students who learned on computers {{in order to}} determine whether the medium of instruction has any effect on achievement. Data were gathered on the speeds of 585 students from west central Indiana high school business teachers. Of the students timed, 242 learned on typewriters and 343 learned on computers. The study showed that mean <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speeds</b> were higher for students who learned on computers as compared to those who learned on typewriters. Mean <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speeds</b> achieved by students using computers were 30 words per minute, whereas speeds for those using typewriters were 28. 8 words per minute.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the utility of}} using keyboarding {{as an alternative to}} handwriting for students with ASD who experience handwriting difficulties. Participants included 22 students with ASD (M age = 10. 83 ± 1. 4 years) who had been using portable word processors in mainstream classrooms for at least 6 months to circumvent handwriting difficulties. Teacher, parent and student questionnaires rated perceptions of students’ motivation, ability, preferences and frequency of use of keyboarding as compared to handwriting, helpfulness of portable word processors and factors contributing to or limiting their use. <b>Keyboarding</b> and handwriting <b>speeds</b> were measured in letters per minute. Two short compositions using handwriting and keyboarding were compared in length and quality. Handwriting legibility was also rated. The teacher, parent and student questionnaires indicated that students’ motivation was generally rated as much higher for keyboarding than for handwriting. Teachers and parents predominantly perceived portable word processors as helpful. The group mean scores for <b>keyboarding</b> <b>speed,</b> and length and quality of keyboarded compositions were greater than comparable group mean scores for handwriting. These differences, however, did not reach statistical significance. Keyboarding, nevertheless, was effective in overcoming difficulties experienced by many students in respect of legibility...|$|R

Essays were scored by teachers and advanced graduate students using MCAS scoring materials, with handwritten essays transcribed and printed on the computer so that scorers would not know whether the essay was originally written by hand or not. Overall, students performed significantly better when they composed essays on the computer.
