40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Space cryocoolers {{are often}} used to cool the focal planes and optics of {{telescope}}s. Since telescope and focal plane jitter can affect {{the clarity of the}} image, space cryocoolers are designed for inherent low vibration. For very sensitive applications, many cryocooler systems incorporate active vibration control in addition to passive isolation from their mounting structures. The sole moving parts in all the NGAS pulse tube coolers, whether one, two or three stage, are the moving compressor pistons and their flexure supports that are inherently balanced in a back to back configuration. To further reduce the vibration below this already very low level, all the cooler systems are provided with single axis active control on the drive axis of the compressor that contains the moving piston masses. The cryocooler control electronics takes a signal from an accelerometer mounted parallel to the drive axis and feeds it back to the compressor motor drive signals to further reduce the vibration by > 40 dB. In this paper we present the <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> measurements made on a number of NGAS flight coolers including the single stage HEC cooler with both linear or coaxial cold heads and a micro cooler. We also present <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> measurements for the simultaneous operation of two HEC coolers mounted to the same platform...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{generation}} of long life, space pulse-tube cryocoolers require electronics capable of controlling <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> {{down to a}} fraction of a newton and coldhead temperature with high accuracy down to a few kelvin. Other functions include engineering diagnostics, heater and valve control, telemetry and safety protection of the cryocooler subsystem against extreme environments and operational anomalies. The electronics are designed to survive the thermal, vibration, shock and radiation environment of launch and orbit, while providing a design life in excess of 10 years on-orbit. A number of our current generation high reliability radiation-hardened electronics units are in various stages of integration on several space flight payloads. This paper describes the features and performance of our latest flight electronics designed for the pulse-tube cryocooler that is the pre-cooler for a closed cycle Joule-Thomson cooler providing 6 K cooling for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid Infra-Red Instrument (MIRI). The electronics is capable of highly accurate temperature control over the temperature range from 4 K to 15 K. <b>Self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> is controlled to low levels on all harmonics up to the 16 th. A unique active power filter controls peak-to-peak reflected ripple current on the primary power bus to a very low level.

Using finite element immersed boundary method combined with traditional feedback force method, the self-propelled swimming fish is numerically simulated. Firstly, a <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> of a cantilever beam immersed in a fluid {{is one of the}} benchmarks of fluid-structure interaction, which is used to verify the validity of the numerical method.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{a methodology}} of modeling <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibrations</b> {{that occur in}} the course of machining of metal objects, i. e. when shaping casting patterns on CNC machining centers. The modeling process presented here is based on an algorithm that makes use of local model fuzzy-neural networks. The algorithm falls back on the advantages of fuzzy systems with Takagi-Sugeno-Kanga (TSK) consequences and neural networks with auxiliary modules that help optimize and shorten the time needed to identify the best possible network structure. The modeling of <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibrations</b> allows analyzing how the vibrations come into being. This in turn makes it possible to develop effective ways of eliminating these vibrations and, ultimately, designing a practical control system that would dispose of the vibrations altogether...|$|R

Currently, a new process for manufacturing special anti-vibration coatings made of nano-composites is being investigated, where the coating is applied directly onto the relevant parts.

40|$|Introduction: Mulch tillage {{system is}} an {{intermediate}} system which covers some of disadvantages of no tillage and conventional tillage systems. In farms in which tillage {{is done with}} a chisel plow, runoff and soil erosion have a less important relation to moldboard and disk plow and naturally absorption of rainfall will be developed. Thus, the mulch tillage system is an appropriate alternative to conventional tillage and no tillage (Backingham and Pauli, 1993). The unwanted vibration in machinery and industry mainly processes most harmful factors, for example: bearing wear, cracking and loosening joints. And noise is produced in electrical systems by creating a short circuit (Wok, 2011). Self-induced and induced vibration are used in tillage systems. Induced vibration is created by energy consumption and <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> is created by collision among the blades and soil at the shank (Soeharsono and Setiawan, 2010). A study by Mohammadi-gol et al. (2005) was conducted. It was found that on the disk plow, plant residues maintained on the soil are more than that of moldboard plow. 99...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMotion of gas {{bubbles and}} rigid {{particles}} in an oscillating fluid is of fundamental {{interest for the}} theory of various widely used technological processes, in particular, for the flotation process. Therefore, many studies have been concerned with this problem, some of those being undertaken by eminent scientists. The main remarkable effects are heavy particles rising and light particles (gas bubbles) sinking in vibrating fluid's volume, and asynchronous <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> of emerging air cushion. In the authors’ recent papers, {{the problem has been}} solved by means of the concept of vibrational mechanics and the method of direct separation of motions; experimental studies have been also conducted. The present paper generalizes and supplements these studies. A special attention is given to the analysis of motion of bubbles and light rigid particles, whose sizes are small in comparison with the amplitude of external excitation; motion of larger (compressible) bubbles is also considered in the paper. It is shown that at certain parameters of external excitation such particles and bubbles will sink in the fluid, corresponding conditions are formulated...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the power}} uprate of Boiling Water Reactors have been {{conducted}} at several existing power plants {{as a way to}} improve plant economy. In one of the power uprated plants (117. 8 % uprates) in the United States, the steam dryer breakages due to fatigue fracture occurred. It is conceivable that the increased steam flow passing through the branches caused a <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> with the propagation of sound wave into the steam-dome. The resonance among the structure, flow and the pressure fluctuation resulted in the breakages. To understand the basic mechanism of the resonance, Dynamic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system was applied to investigate acoustic vibration inside the upper plenum. In this study, time-series velocities of the air driven by the acoustic standing wave were obtained in three dimensional space by three high speed cameras. Also, it was succeeded to evaluate the resonance frequency of the upper plenum and three dimensional fluid vibration. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2010 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(環境学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 3499 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科人間環境学専...|$|E
40|$|The {{tribological}} aspects {{concerning the}} behaviour of friction {{materials in the}} range of low and very low sliding speeds (0. 2 – 200 mm/min) are essentially different of those in the high sliding speeds range. This paper aims to study the stick-slip phenomenon which occurs {{in the range of}} low and very low speeds. Typically, for the stick-slip phenomenon to occur, the static friction coefficient between the two contact surfaces of the friction materials must be larger than the kinetic friction coefficient. For disc brakes, the stick-slip phenomenon is mentioned in many specialized scientific papers. The phenomenon is manifested through <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibrations.</b> The experimental results were obtained on a dedicated testing machine where the parasite stick-slip motion is reduced through the use of bearings...|$|R

Two years before, the running crowd on the Bosphorus Bridge caused dangerous instability by <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibrations</b> in the structure which could result in its failure. Influenced by this lesson, several start times with ten minutes intervals were held after the first start, which took place on 9:30 hours. The groups were not allowed to run on the bridge rather than to walk only. In order to avoid stopping for taking pictures, the outmost lanes of the bridge were blocked by barriers.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{controlling}} the vibrations of a large space structures {{by the use of}} actively augmented damping devices distributed throughout the structure is addressed. The gyrodamper which consists of a set of single gimbal control moment gyros which are actively controlled to extract the structural vibratory energy through the local rotational deformations of the structure, is described and analyzed. Various linear and nonlinear dynamic simulations of gyrodamped beams are shown, including results on <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibrations</b> due to sensor noise and rotor imbalance. The complete nonlinear dynamic equations are included. The problem of designing and sizing a system of gyrodampers for a given structure, or extrapolating results for one gyrodamped structure to another is solved in terms of scaling laws. Novel scaling laws for gyro systems are derived, based upon fundamental physical principles, and various examples are given...|$|R
30|$|Grinding chatter is a <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> {{which is}} {{unfavorable}} to precision machining processes. This paper proposes a forecasting method for grinding state identification based on bivarition empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and least squares {{support vector machine}} (LSSVM), which allows the monitoring of grinding chatter over time. BEMD is a promising technique in signal processing research which involves the decomposition of two-dimensional signals {{into a series of}} bivarition intrinsic mode functions (BIMFs). BEMD and the extraction criterion of its true BIMFs are investigated by processing a complex-value simulation chatter signal. Then the feature vectors which are employed as an amplification for the chatter premonition are discussed. Furthermore, the methodology is tested and validated by experimental data collected from a CNC guideway grinder KD 4020 X 16 in Hangzhou Hangji Machine Tool Co., Ltd. The results illustrate that the BEMD is a superior method in terms of processing non-stationary and nonlinear signals. Meanwhile, the peak to peak, real-time standard deviation and instantaneous energy are proven to be effective feature vectors which reflect the different grinding states. Finally, a LSSVM model is established for grinding status classification based on feature vectors, giving a prediction accuracy rate of 96 %.|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Cryocooler {{is a major}} {{consideration}} {{in the design of}} IR imaging systems, especially when mounted on stabilized platforms with gimbals. The coolers in these types of applications induce forces and moments that interfere with proper stabilization of the camera leading to image blurring and loss of pointing accuracy. This phenomenon is known as “jitter” and presents a challenge to the motion control system engineer. To overcome this problem system designers often elect to avoid the use of rotary Stirling machines and instead select linear split Stirling or pulse tube coolers. Thus, they trade off size, input power, and reliability for image quality. This paper deals with the problem of a rotary cooler's <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> and ways to eliminate or minimize its affect on imaging system performance. In this paper we will point out the vibration sources in rotary coolers and methods to reduce their magnitude. Also, we will present actual test data of a cooler with dynamically balanced crack mechanism and an external torque vibration absorber, and compare it to a standard cooler...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{systems of the}} form Mẍ+Dẋ+Kx= 0, x ∈ R^n, with a {{positive}} definite mass matrix M, a symmetric damping matrix D and a positive definite stiffness matrix K. If the equilibrium in the system is unstable, a small disturbance is enough to set the system in motion again. The motion of the system sustains itself, an effect which is called self-excitation or <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration.</b> The reason behind this effect {{is the presence of}} negative damping, which results for example from dry friction. Negative damping implies that the damping matrix D is indefinite or negative definite. Throughout our work, we assume D to be indefinite, and that the system possesses both stable and unstable modes and thus is unstable. It is now the idea of gyroscopic stabilization to mix the modes of a system with indefinite damping such that the system is stabilized without introducing further dissipation. This is done by adding gyroscopic forces Gẋ with a suitable skew-symmetric matrix G to the left-hand side. We call G=-G^T∈ R^n× n a gyroscopic stabilizer for the unstable system, if Mẍ+(D+ G) ẋ+Kx= 0 is asymptotically stable. We show the existence of G in space dimensions three and four...|$|E
40|$|The glucose {{concentration}} in the blood represents a metabolic state characterised in all living by variations that can be reliably recorded. It therefore is a parameter suitable for observation over prolonged periods for the classification of physiological oscillations. By aid of the continuous in vivo technique osculations are observed in 3 different fields of indication: 1. high-frequency oscillations after acute metabolic disturbances in ischaemia, 2. medium-frequency oscillations after experimental hyperglycaemia in the intravenous glucose tolerance test, and 3. low-frequency oscillations {{in the form of}} diurnal or circadian rhythms. The described oscillations are interpreted not only as an indication of counter-regulation and feed-back but as principal features of individual-specific, <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Die Glucosekonzentration im Blut repräsentiert einen metabolischen Zustand, der in allen lebenden Systemen durch gut registrierbare Schwankungen gekennzeichnet ist. Sie ist daher ein geeigneter Parameter, um im Zusammenhang mit der Einordnung physiologischer Oscillationen über längere Zeitabstände beobachtet zu werden. Mit Hilfe der kontinuierlichen in-vivo-Analyse wird dies in drei verschie-denen Indikationsräumen getan: es handelt sich um 1. die hochfrequenten Oszillationen nach akuten Stoff Wechselstörungen durch Ischämie, 2. die mittelfrequenten Oszillationen nach experimenteller Hyperglykaemie im intravenösen Glucose-Toleranz^Test, und 3. die niederfrequenten Oszillationen in Form diurnaler und circadianer Rhythmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibrations</b> of prismatic beams in a cross-flow {{has been studied}} for decades, {{but it is still}} of great interest due to their important effects in many different industrial applications. This paper presents the experimental study developed on a prismatic beam with H-section. The aim of this analysis is to add some additional insight into the behaviour of the flow around this type of bodies, in order to reduce galloping and even to avoid it. The influence of some relevant geometrical parameters that define the H-section on the translational galloping behaviour of these beams has been analysed. Wind loads coefficients have been measured through static wind tunnel tests and the Den Hartog criterion applied to elucidate the influence of geometrical parameters on the galloping properties of the bodies under consideration. These results have been completed with surface pressure distribution measurements and, besides, dynamic tests have been also performed to verify the static criterion. Finally, the morphology of the flow past the tested bodies has been visualised by using smoke visualization techniques. Since the rectangular section beam is a limiting case of the H-section configuration, the results here obtained are compared with the ones published in the literature concerning rectangular configurations; the agreement is satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|The {{metal removal}} rates {{attainable}} during grinding may often {{be limited by}} the onset of an unstable tibration. commonly called regenerative chatter. Chatter is a <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> which leads to increased power consumption, a poor, generally unacceptable, workpiece surface finish, uneven wear of the grinding wheel and, in some cases, actual damage to the wheel. It is known that chatter {{is more likely to}} occur when the grinding wheel is hard and for this reason chatter often develops when grinding with diamond or cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheels, whose chief characteristic is that [hey are very hard-wearing. This paper describes the developiiicnt of a technique for suppressing chatter which is particularly applicable to the use of diamond and CBN wheels. It has been predicted theoretically and confirmed by experiment that chatter mag he suppressed. or even eliminated: by increasing the radial flexibility oC a grinding wheel, whilst at the same time maintaining high values of the wheel's natural frequency and damping. I t has been shown that the increased flexibility may be achieved by mounting the abrasive rim of the wheel via a flexible coupling, or by manufacturing a wheel by conventional means but with a flexible hub material. Both techniques are successful and diamond and CBN wheels, manufactured to these designs, have performed substantially better than conventional ultra-hard abrasive wheels currently marketed...|$|E
40|$|When {{designing}} slim {{structures such as}} {{columns and}} chimneys, their dynamic behaviour {{has to be taken}} into account in calculating their dimensions. When exposed to wind, steel structures are particularly susceptible to vibrations because of their low damping. Various kinds of stimuli can initiate vibrations in a slim structure. Vortex excitation occurs when the frequency of the vortex coincides with the natural frequency of the structure. In addition to high amplitudes ovalling of cylindrical shells can also occur at low pressures. The vortex-induced amplitudes may be reduced by means of aerodynamic devices (vortex breakers) or damping devices applied to the structure. Aeroelastic instabilities and interference effects may also cause damage to such structures. One form of this instability is so-called galloping. Galloping is a <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> of a flexible structure in transverse bending mode. If such structures are arranged in groups, they can affect one another mutually. This phenomenon is known as „interference galloping“. These effects depend principally on the ration between the distance and the diameter of the structures in question. In the case of high amplitudes, special steps have to be taken to reduce the resulting stresses. As a rule poor structural damping is the reason for strong movements caused by wind. By increasing the damping, it is possible to construct very tall slim buildings with a high degree of safety. The article outlines the various means of damping and their technical implementation. A concept for passive vibration damping by means of fluid dampers is proposed using a 125 -metre high chimney as an example...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} several years, cryogenically cooled sensors have become an {{increasingly}} popular method of observation and study for both space-based and ground-based operations. Accordingly, various cooling techniques {{have been developed to}} accommodate this group of sensors. Because of rising performance standards and escalating cost limitations, cryocoolers have become an impressive cooling technique to consider. This report focuses on the use of a mechanical cryocooler in conjunction with the Russian American Observational Satellites (RAMOS), a future pair of earth-imaging satellites which will fly infrared radiometers. The RAMOS program consists of mapping the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface in stereo using two co-orbital satellites. The American Observational Satellite (AOS) will utilize an infrared radiometer with the telescope focal plane assembly (FPA) operating at approximately 60 K. The FPA will be cooled using a multiple cryocooler configuration. The use of multiple coolers introduces redundancy into the cooling system-a redundancy which has been absent from many previously flown satellites. In addition, the cooling system will incorporate various other new technologies, such as thermal disconnects, a thermal storage unit, low-resistance flexible thermal links, etc., to meet the overall system objectives and requirements. Thermal storage units are discussed as a means of eliminating cryocooler <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> and passively controlling FP A temperatures. Incorporating thermal switches and thermal storage units into a cooling system design can alleviate the concerns of cryocooler vibration and parasitic heat loads. An understanding of these concepts and configurations will assist in the design of similar optical instruments for both space-based and ground-based exploration campaigns...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of two-dimensional cantilevered flexible plates subjected to axial flow and proposes a new energy-harvesting concept, the flutter-mill, utilizing the flutter motions to generate electrical power. The nonlinear model of the cantilevered flexible plate is developed using the inextensibility assumption. The panel method, in particular the unsteady lumped vortex model associated with a dynamic vortical wake, is used for calculating the aero/hydro-dynamic loads acting on the plate. The investigation of {{the dynamics of}} this system is conducted systematically in the multiparameter space involved, in order to give a comprehensive picture of the global dynamics of the system. The influence of various factors on the dynamics of the system are discussed, including the length of the upstream rigid segment, the material damping and the viscous drag. Moreover, the dynamics of the system in a variety of modified configurations, i. e., with the gravitational force taken into account, with parallel solid walls, an additional spring support, an additional concentrated mass, an oscillating angle of incidence in the undisturbed flow, and two identical parallel plates, is also studied. The energy transfer between the cantilevered flexible plate and the surrounding fluid flow is examined. Based on the analysis of energy transfer, the concept of a flutter-mill, which utilizes the <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibrations</b> of a cantilevered flexible plate in axial flow to generate electrical power is proposed. The performance of this device is preliminarily evaluated and compared to other wind-energy converters. Design considerations of the flutter-mill are summarized in the light {{of the dynamics of}} the system, in both the basic configuration and various modified configurations. Finally, experiments with cantilevered flexible plates in axial flow are conducted in a vertical-type water tunnel. The experimental observations are compared with the simulation results based on the present theory...|$|R
40|$|Present paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental studies on the <b>self-induced</b> and forced <b>vibrations</b> of loaded cross country skis and presents the discussion on the possible mechanisms causing such vibrations and the ways they can influence the friction between the ski running surface and the snow. Studied vibrations of gliding skis are most probably caused by the frictional effects. Mechanisms involved {{are similar to the}} ones causing the brake disc squeal or the violin string excitation by the bow. Major factors responsible for the development of these vibrations such as micro roughness of the surfaces, nonlinearities in the material properties, thermo-elastic instabilities and instabilities due to decreasing friction with increasing sliding velocity are also common for the case of gliding skis. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the ski vibration pattern both in amplitude and in frequency could influence the ski gliding properties. Though it seems quite feasible that the control of the cross country ski vibrations can improve the gliding performance, further systematic studies are needed to confirm it and to formulate the consecutive strategies of cross country ski design improvement...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent flows over lifting {{surfaces}} exhibiting trailing-edge {{vortex shedding}} often cause adverse and complex phenomena, such as <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> and noise. In this paper, a numerical study on flow past a blunt-edged two-dimensional NACA 0015 section {{and the same}} section with various base cavity shapes and sizes at high Reynolds numbers has been performed using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach with the realisable ?- e turbulence model. The equations are solved using the control volume method of second-order accuracy in both spatial and time domains. The assessment of the application of URANS for periodic trailing-edge flow has shown that reasonable agreement is achieved for both the time-averaged and fluctuating parameters of interest, although some differences exist in the prediction of the near-wake streamwise velocity fluctuation magnitudes. The predicted Strouhal numbers of flows past the squared-off blunt configuration {{with varying degrees of}} bluntness agree well with published experimental measurements. It is found that the intensity of the vortex strengths at the trailing-edge is amplified when the degree of bluntness is increased, leading to an increase in the mean square pressure fluctuations. The numerical prediction shows that the presence of the base cavity at the trailing-edge does not change the inherent Strouhal number of the 2 D section examined. However, it does have an apparent effect on the wake structure, local pressure fluctuations and the lift force fluctuations. It is observed that the size of the cavity has more influence on the periodic trailing-edge flow than its shape does...|$|E
40|$|Polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits {{have yet}} to be {{routinely}} applied to drilling the hard-rock formations characteristic of geothermal reservoirs. Most geothermal production wells are currently drilled with tungsten-carbide-insert roller-cone bits. PDC bits have significantly improved penetration rates and bit life beyond roller-cone bits in {{the oil and gas industry}} where soft to medium-hard rock types are encountered. If PDC bits could be used to double current penetration rates in hard rock geothermal well-drilling costs could be reduced by 15 percent or more. PDC bits exhibit reasonable life in hard-rock wear testing using the relatively rigid setups typical of laboratory testing. Unfortunately, field experience indicates otherwise. The prevailing mode of failure encountered by PDC bits returning from hard-rock formations in the field is catastrophic, presumably due to impact loading. These failures usually occur in advance of any appreciable wear that might dictate cutter replacement. Self-induced bit vibration, or ''chatter'', is one of the mechanisms that may be responsible for impact damage to PDC cutters in hard-rock drilling. Chatter is more severe in hard-rock formations since they induce significant dynamic loading on the cutter elements. Chatter is a phenomenon whereby the drillstring becomes dynamically unstable and excessive sustained vibrations occur. Unlike forced vibration, the force (i. e., weight on bit) that drives <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> is coupled with the response it produces. Many of the chatter principles derived in the machine tool industry are applicable to drilling. It is a simple matter to make changes to a machine tool to study the chatter phenomenon. This is not the case with drilling. Chatter occurs in field drilling due to the flexibility of the drillstring. Hence, laboratory setups must be made compliant to observe chatter...|$|E
40|$|Weirs are {{commonly}} used as spillways to release flows from a reservoir. The free-falling jet on the downstream side of the weir is called the nappe. Under certain hydraulic conditions, determined mainly by the size, design, and construction of the weir, nappe oscillation, otherwise known as nappe vibration, can occur. Characteristics of this dynamic behavior include excessive acoustic energy manifested as sound pressure waves and lowfrequency noise accompanied by horizontal waves or banding on the nappe. Mitigation of this process may be required, especially if the weir operates {{in close proximity to}} occupied structures. Instability of water jets moving through air has been a topic of study for over a century, although studies specific to curvilinear weir nappe flow are less common. The objective of this research is to further the understanding related to the mechanisms that cause nappe vibration, document the occurrence conditions, and investigate mitigation techniques. Research was conducted at the Utah Water Research Laboratory (UWRL) using three physical models: A 6 ft wide x 3. 5 ft tall weir with a quarter round crest (model # 1) A 15. 4 ft wide x 11 ft tall weir with a broad crest (model # 2) A 16 ft wide x 12 ft tall weir with a quarter round crest (model # 3) Testing included confined and unconfined nappe conditions (open air cavity behind the nappe vs. closed air cavity) for model # 1 and model # 3. Vibration frequencies were recorded and analyzed using an accelerometer and microphone. Comparisons were made between the three models of different scale. Testing included modifications to the weir crest and the weir apron to study the effect on the behavior of the nappe. The results of this study are presented, including a review of previous literature and theories. The mechanisms that sustain and amplify the nappe vibration phenomenon varied at the different size-scales, while evidence exists that the root cause of initial instability leading to <b>self-induced</b> <b>vibration</b> {{can be traced to the}} same source. The results of this study should be of practical use to engineers, researchers, and those concerned with dam safety...|$|E
