40|$|Although most {{developing}} countries monitor {{the proportion of}} births attended by skilled birth attendants (SBA), they lack information on the availability and performance of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> by different cadres of health care providers (HCPs). The World Health Organisation <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> are set of key interventions that targets direct obstetric causes of maternal deaths. Seven <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> are required for health facilities providing basic EmOC and nine for facilities providing comprehensive EmOC. Our objectives were to describe cadres of HCPs who are considered SBAs in Tanzania, the EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> they perform and challenges associated with performance of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> We conducted a cross-sectional study of HCPs offering maternity care services at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District in northern Tanzania. A questionnaire and health facility assessment forms were used to collect information from participants and health facilities. A total of 199 HCPs working at eight health facilities in Moshi Urban District met the inclusion criteria. Out of 199, 158 participated, giving {{a response rate of}} 79. 4 %. Ten cadres of HCPs were identified as conducting deliveries regardless of the level of health facilities. Most of the participants (81 %) considered themselves SBAs, although some were not considered SBAs by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW). Only two out of the eight facilities provided all of the required EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> While Assistant Medical Officers are expected to perform all the <b>signal</b> <b>functions,</b> only 38 % and 13 % had performed vacuum extraction or caesarean sections respectively. Very few registered and enrolled nurse-midwives had performed removal of retained products (22 %) or assisted vaginal delivery (24 and 11 %). Inadequate equipment and supplies, and lack of knowledge and skills in performing EmOC were two main challenges identified by health care providers in all the level of care. In the district, gaps existed between performance of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> by SBAs as expected by the MOHSW and the actual performance at health facilities. All basic EmOC facilities were not fully functional.

Readiness of the facilities is essential to provide all the basic and comprehensive <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC to ensure emergency services from the designated facilities. The study assessed population coverage and availability of EmONC services {{in public and private}} facilities in Bangladesh. An assessment was conducted in all the public and private facilities providing obstetric care in to in-patients 24 districts. Data were collected on the performance of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC from the study facilities {{in the last three months}} prior to the date of assessment. Trained data-collectors interviewed the facility managers and key service providers, along with review of records, using contextualized tools. Population coverage of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> was assessed by estimating the number of facilities providing the <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for EmONC compared to the United Nations requirements. Availability was assessed in terms of the proportion of facilities providing the services by type of facilities and by district. Caesarean section (CS) delivery and blood transfusion (BT) services (the two major components of comprehensive EmONC) were respectively available in 6. 4 (0. 9 public and 5. 5 private) and 5. 6 (1. 3 public and 4. 3 private) facilities per 500, 000 population. The <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> for basic EmONC, except two (parental anticonvulsants and assisted vaginal delivery), were available in a minimum of 5 facilities (public and private sectors combined) per 500, 000 population. A major inter-district variation in the availability of <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> was observed in each public- and private-sector facility. Among the various types of facilities, only the public medical college hospitals had all the <b>signal</b> <b>functions.</b> The situation was poor in other public facilities at the district and sub-district levels as well as in private facilities. In the public sector, CS delivery and BT services were available in the minimum required number of facilities. However, to ensure basic EmONC services, participation of the private sector is necessary.

Methods and Findings Key personnel in the Ministries of Health, teaching institutions, referral, regional and district hospitals completed structured questionnaires in nine SSA countries in 2009 – 2011. A total of 21 different cadres of health care providers (HCP) were reported to be SBA. Type and number of EmOC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> reported to be provided, varied substantially between cadres and countries.

40|$|Objective: To provide clear policy {{directions}} for {{gaps in the}} provision of <b>signal</b> <b>function</b> services and sub-regions requiring priority attention using data from the 2010 Ghana Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) survey. Methods: Using 2010 survey data, the fraction of facilities with only one or two <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> missing was calculated for each facility type and EmONC designation. Thematic maps were used to provide insight into inequities in service provision. Results: Of 1159 maternity facilities, 89 provided all the necessary basic or comprehensive EmONC <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> 3 months prior to the 2010 survey. Only 21 % of facility-based births were in fully functioning EmONC facilities, but an additional 30 % occurred in facilities missing one or two basic signal functions—most often assisted vaginal delivery and removal of retained products. Tackling these missing <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> would extend births taking place in fully functioning facilities to over 50 %. Subnational analyses based on estimated total pregnancies in each district revealed a pattern of inequity in service provision across the country. Conclusion: Upgrading facilities missing only one or two <b>signal</b> <b>functions</b> will allow Ghana to meet international standards for availability of EmONC services. Reducing maternal deaths will require high national priority given to addressing inequities in the distribution of EmONC services...|$|R

Males typically weigh 114 - 164 g and females are slightly lighter at 92 - 107 g. The upper parts from the forehead to tail are olive-brown with black streaks, {{especially on the}} shoulders. The sides {{of the head and}} the underparts down to the upper belly are dark slate-blue, except for a blackish area between bill and eye, and brownish sides to the upper breast. The flanks are barred black and white, and the undertail is white with some darker streaks. The long bill and the iris are red, and the legs are flesh-brown. The sexes are similar; although the female averages slightly smaller than the male, with a more slender bill, determining sex through measurements alone is unreliable. The juvenile has a blackish crown and a white chin and throat. The underparts are buff or white with darker bars, and the flank markings are brown and buff, rather than black and white. The undertail is buff, and the eye, bill and leg colours are duller than the adult. The downy chick is all black apart from a mainly white bill. After breeding, the rail has an extensive moult, and is flightless for about three weeks. Individual adults can be identified by the markings on the undertail, which are unique to each bird. Adult males have the strongest black undertail streaks. It has been suggested that the dark barring on the undertail of this species is a compromise between the <b>signalling</b> <b>function</b> of a pure white undertail, as found in open water or [...] species like the common moorhen, and the need to avoid being too conspicuous.|$|E
