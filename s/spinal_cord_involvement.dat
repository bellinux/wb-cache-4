40|$|Abstract. Two 6 -week-old female Rottweiler littermates were {{evaluated}} for regurgitation, diminished growth, progressive ataxia, and pelvic limb weakness. Clinical examination indicated a progressive, diffuse, lower motor neuron disorder and megaesophagus. The pups were killed at 6 and 8 weeks of age. Lesions included central chromatolysis and {{swelling of the}} perikarya in many large motor neurons in the ventral gray matter of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Some <b>involvement</b> of red, oculomotor, trigeminal motor, and ambiguus nuclei of the brainstem was noted. Ultrastructurally, chromatolytic neurons had excess neurofilaments, {{and an increase in}} and enlargement of Golgi complexes. Wallerian-like degeneration was prominent in neuropil of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and in peripheral nerve. Clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings were consistent with a progressive motor neuron disease. Motor neuron diseases are characterized by pro-gressive degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> brainstem, and in some cases the large motor neurons of the cerebral cortex. 13 Skeletal muscle atrophy, decreased segmental spinal reflexes, and mo-tor weakness are results of the diminished motor in-nervation.

40|$|Background: Traditionally, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) {{has been}} {{considered}} to be a predominantly white matter (WM) disease. More recent studies have revealed considerable grey matter (GM) involvement in the brain. However there is a paucity of literature examining GM pathology in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Objectives and methods: We use human post-mortem material to explore various aspects of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> GM pathology in MS including (i) the extent and pattern of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> demyelination, (ii) the relative contributions of GM and WM volume loss to <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> atrophy, (iii) the extent of neuronal pathology within the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and (iv) the sensitivity of post-mortem MRI for detecting <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> GM plaques. Results: Within the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> GM demyelination is more extensive than WM demyelination with many lesions showing a novel morphological pattern whereby the plaque borders maintain a strict respect for the GM/WM boundary. Demyelination is more extensive in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> GM than in other brain regions examined. Post-mortem MR imaging at 4. 7 Tesla is highly sensitive for detecting the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> GM plaques. We demonstrate substantial neuronal loss in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> in MS, observing reductions in both interneuron and motoneuron numbers. This neuronal loss occurs predominantly within GM plaques. We also observe reductions in interneuron size, both within plaques and in the myelinated GM. Despite this, we find no evidence of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> GM atrophy. Conclusions: This study represents the first detailed examination of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> GM <b>involvement</b> in MS. We demonstrate substantial GM pathology in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> further challenging the concept that MS is a predominantly WM disease. A greater understanding of this pathology may provide important insights into MS pathogenesis and mechanisms of disability in the disease.

While arachnoiditis has no consistent pattern of symptoms, it frequently affects the nerves that supply the legs and lower back. Many patients experience difficulty sitting for long (or even short) periods of time due to discomfort or pain, or because of efferent neurological or other motor symptoms, such as difficulties controlling limbs. Difficulty sitting can be problematic for patients who have trouble standing or walking for long periods, as wheelchairs are not always helpful in such cases.|$|E
40|$|Background: Ossification of the {{posterior}} longitudinal ligament (OPLL) {{of the spine}} is a rare disease with unknown pathology among white population. The disease occurs predominantly in the cervical spine and can cause spinal-cord compression. There is {{a wide variety of}} possible neurological signs depending on the amount of pressure on the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> The progress of the disease is slow and often without neurological symptoms. Different surgical approaches are used depends on the type of involvement. This study reports a patient with this rare syndrome in the east Azerbaijan province. Case Report: A 45 -year-old farmer with the diagnosis of disc herniation in the C 3 -C 5 segments had radiculopathy symptoms for many years. Various physical therapy sessions along with drug treatment had no optimal improvement. Ultimately, surgery was performed by aggravation of the disease symptoms and during the surgery it was found that patient had OPLL syndrome.

40|$|In mice, {{intravenous}} inoculation {{of relatively}} avirulent strains of {{herpes simplex virus}} [e. g. P 2 C 6, a mutant of strain CL(101), deficient in thymidine kinase] produced infection in the adrenal gland and mid-spinal cord followed by hind limb paralysis without death. Male mice were less susceptible to paralysis than female mice. Castration of male mice before inoculation increased their susceptibility to that of female animals; treatment with testosterone r versed this change. The differences in susceptibility to paralysis in the various categories of animal were not reflected in differences in growth of virus in the adrenal gland or <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Experiments on herpes simplex virus (HSV) viraemia of mice established by intravenous (i. v.) inoculation have revealed the extreme susceptibility ofthe adrenal gland to infection (Hill et al., 1986). Moreover, infection of the gland provides aroute for entry of virus into the lower thoracic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Such <b>involvement</b> ofthe <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> is associated with demyelination a d hind limb paralysis.

40|$|Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) exerts its {{functions}} through natriuretic peptide receptors. Recently, BNP {{has been}} shown to be involved in a wide range of functions. Previous studies reported BNP expression in the sensory afferent fibers in the dorsal horn of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> However, BNP expression and function in the neurons of the central nervous system are still controversial. Therefore, in this study, we investigated BNP expression in the rat <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> in detail using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR analysis showed that BNP mRNA was present in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and DRG. BNP immunoreactivity was observed in different structures of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> including the neuronal cell bodies and neuronal processes. BNP immunoreactivity was observed in the dorsal horn of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> and in the neurons of the intermediate column and ventral horn. Double-immunolabeling showed a high level of BNP expression in the afferent fibers (laminae I-II) labeled with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), suggesting BNP involvement in sensory function. In addition, BNP was co-localized with CGRP and choline acetyltransferase in the motor neurons of the ventral horn. Together, these results indicate that BNP is expressed in sensory and motor systems of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> suggesting its <b>involvement</b> in several biological actions on sensory and motor neurons via its binding to NPR-A and/or NPR-B in the DRG and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord...</b>|$|R
50|$|Any of the {{components}} of the nervous system can be involved. Sarcoidosis affecting the nervous system is known as neurosarcoidosis. Cranial nerves are most commonly affected, accounting for about 5-30% of neurosarcoidosis cases, and peripheral facial nerve palsy, often bilateral, is the most common neurological manifestation of sarcoidosis. It occurs suddenly and is usually transient. The central nervous system involvement is present in 10-25% of sarcoidosis cases. Other common manifestations of neurosarcoidosis include optic nerve dysfunction, papilledema, palate dysfunction, neuroendocrine changes, hearing abnormalities, hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities, chronic meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Myelopathy, that is <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement,</b> occurs in about 16-43% of neurosarcoidosis cases and is often associated with the poorest prognosis of the neurosarcoidosis subtypes. Whereas facial nerve palsies and acute meningitis due to sarcoidosis tends to have the most favourable prognosis. Another common finding in sarcoidosis with neurological involvement is autonomic or sensory small fiber neuropathy. Neuroendocrine sarcoidosis accounts for about 5-10% of neurosarcoidosis cases and can lead to diabetes insipidus, changes in menstrual cycle and hypothalamic dysfunction. The latter can lead to changes in body temperature, mood and prolactin (see the endocrine and exocrine section for details).|$|E

40|$|Spasticity {{arises from}} {{hyperexcitability}} of the neural stretch reflex arc secondary to injury of the corticospinal tract. In response to injury, {{the density of}} glutamatergic inputs from afferent 1 A fibers to motor neurons increases dramatically and adaptive changes occur in the morphology of microglia cells in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> SUMMARY: <b>Involvement</b> of the endocannabinoid system in pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for spasticity has been demonstrated in animal models of MS. Stimulation of cannabinoid (CB) 1 receptors reduces the hyperglutamatergic drive from sensory afferents to <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> motor neurons and blocks the synaptic effects of activated microglia and pro-inflammatory mediators (e. g. TNF-α) on glutamatergic transmission. Enhancing corticospinal tract excitability through intermittent theta burst stimulation inhibits the stretch reflex and spasticity by promoting long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity that requires stimulation of CB 1 receptors. Evidence indicates that the antispasticity effects of THC:CBD oromucosal spray (Sativex®) are associated with enhanced cortical long-term potentiation. Key Messages: Glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways {{are involved in the}} regulation of muscle tone. CB 1 receptors, which are associated with movement, postural control, and pain and sensory perception, influence glutamatergic pathways. THC:CBD oromucosal spray was shown to reverse motor cortex plasticity from long-term depression through long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission, thereby restoring, at least in part, effective corticospinal inputs to spinal circuits...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES 1. To {{describe}} the epidemiology of patients admitted for cervical spine injuries in Princess Margaret Hospital. 2. To perform epidemiological {{analysis on the}} associated risk factors of cervical <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injuries (cases) amongst cervical spine injuries using data in the Trauma Registry of Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong with cervical spine injuries without <b>cord</b> <b>involvement</b> as controls. 3. To have {{a deeper understanding of}} the impact of cervical <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injuries in terms of hospital length of stay and subsequent discharge status in the community of Kowloon West Cluster in Hong Kong. METHODS A case-control study of 366 patients was conducted using data in the Trauma Registry of Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong during a 6 -year period from January 2008 to December 2013. The cases were patients admitted with cervical <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injuries while the controls were patients admitted with cervical spine injuries only without <b>cord</b> <b>involvement.</b> Risk of cervical spine injuries with or without <b>cord</b> <b>involvement,</b> injury mechanisms, hospital length of stay and other patient characteristics were studied. RESULTS The study identified a trend of increasing number of cervical spine injuries in the Kowloon West Cluster region of Hong Kong from January 2008 to December 2013. Motor vehicle collision (MVC) is the major cause of traumatic cervical spine injuries (47. 3 % of total, n= 173). The second most common injury mechanism was fall (34. 2 % of total, n= 125). The age group with the most cervical spine injuries was 40 - 59 years, n= 166, 45 % of total. There were no relationships between age and cervical <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury; gender and cervical <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury. There were also no relationships between injury mechanisms and cervical <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury, except for the mechanism “fall” (OR: 10. 17, 95 % CI 2. 16 - 47. 97, p< 0. 05) compared to MVC. Patients who were diagnosed of CSI with <b>cord</b> <b>involvement</b> had 17. 5 days longer of hospital length of stay (95 % CI 10. 71 – 25. 56, p< 0. 001) compared with the non-cord injury group. CONCLUSION Although MVC was the major injury mechanism in the region, fall incidents were associated with cervical spine injuries with <b>cord</b> <b>involvement</b> and longer hospital length of stay. A city-wide trauma registry is suggested to enhance the understanding of cervical spine injuries in the perspective of primary and secondary prevention. In addition, more studies should be done to identify the epidemiological characteristics for practice improvement and prevention plan. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Leukoencephalomyelopathy is an {{inherited}} neurodegenerative disorder {{that affects the}} white matter of the spinal cord and brain and is known {{to occur in the}} Rottweiler breed. Due to the lack of a genetic test for this disorder, post mortem neuropathological examinations are required to confirm the diagnosis. Leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement</b> and elevated lactate levels is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder in humans that was recently described to have clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that are similar to the histopathologic lesions that define leukoencephalomyelopathy in Rottweilers. Leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement</b> is caused by mutations in the DARS 2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. The objective of this case report is to present the results of MRI and candidate gene analysis of a case of Rottweiler leukoencephalomyelopathy to investigate the hypothesis that leukoencephalomyelopathy in Rottweilers could serve as an animal model of human leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement.</b> CASE PRESENTATION A two-and-a-half-year-old male purebred Rottweiler was evaluated for generalised progressive ataxia with hypermetria that was most evident in the thoracic limbs. MRI (T 2 -weighted) demonstrated well-circumscribed hyperintense signals within both lateral funiculi that extended from the level of the first to the sixth cervical vertebral body. A neurodegenerative disorder was suspected based on the progressive clinical course and MRI findings, and Rottweiler leukoencephalomyelopathy was subsequently confirmed via histopathology. The DARS 2 gene was investigated as a causative candidate, but a sequence analysis failed to identify any disease-associated variants in the DNA sequence. CONCLUSION It was concluded that MRI may aid in the pre-mortem diagnosis of suspected cases of leukoencephalomyelopathy. Genes other than DARS 2 may be involved in Rottweiler leukoencephalomyelopathy and may also be relevant in human leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement...</b>|$|E

This {{study was conducted}} to identify prevalence of various haplotypes among our MS patients as compared to control population. We also evaluated a possible correlation between haplotypes and disease severity (EDSS). Methods: Patients with confirmed MS were prospectively enrolled from nine centers in Pakistan from January 2009 to September 2010. HLA alleles were identified using polymerase chain reaction and sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP). Control group comprised of a total of 1000 individuals, representing all major ethnic groups in Pakistan, tested for the distribution of HLA class II DRB 1 and DQB 1 alleles. Results: One hundred patients were enrolled in study (Male; 40 %). Age range was 16 - 62 years (Mean 32 years). Out of these 23 patients (23 %) developed severe disability (EDSS 6 or more) within five years of symptoms onset. Most important factors associated with this progression included primary or secondary progressive course and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement.</b> Almost 50 % patients in severe disability group had primary or secondary progressive course while 70 % patients in this group had <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement.</b> Higher disability had a significant correlation with primary and secondary progressive type of MS (P= 0. 001) and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement</b> (P= 0. 03).

40|$|International audienceLeukoencephalopathy {{with brain}} stem and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>involvement</b> and high brain lactate (LBSL) was first defined by {{characteristic}} MRI and spectroscopic findings. The clinical features include childhood or juvenile-onset slowly progressive ataxia, spasticity, and dorsal column dysfunction, occasionally accompanied by learning difficulties. Mutations in, encoding mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, were recently shown to cause LBSL. The {{signs and symptoms}} show some overlap with the most common leukoencephalopathy of young adults, multiple sclerosis (MS) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury {{resulting}} in neurological deficit {{is a rare}} but potentially devastating injury. Compromise to the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> {{may be due to}} trauma, vascular injury or other disease process and can result in immediate or insidious onset of neurological symptoms including loss or reduction of voluntary motor function, sensory impairment, bowel or bladder dysfunction and loss of autonomic function. The incidence in the United Kingdom is estimated at 12 - 16 per million population with about 75 % of cases due to trauma. Appropriate management from the time of diagnosis of cord injury has been shown to have significant effect on the long-term outcome for patients and reduce short and long-term complications. Included Patients: All patients with traumatic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injury {{resulting in}} complete or incomplete para- or tetraplegia. The audit standards apply to those with polytrauma and those with isolated <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> injuries but do not apply to patients with spinal column injury without <b>cord</b> <b>involvement.</b> These audit standards apply to adults and children...|$|R
40|$|Infection of {{the central}} nervous system is a {{life-threatening}} condition in the pediatric population. Almost all agents can cause infection within {{the central nervous system}} and the extent of infection ranges from diffuse involvement of the meninges, brain, or the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> to localized <b>involvement</b> presenting as a space-occupying lesion. Modern imaging techniques define the anatomic region infected, the evolution of the disease, and help in better management of these patients. Acute bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of mortality and long-term neurological disability. Fortunately, the incidence of infection after clean craniotomy is < 5 &#x 0025;, but it leads to significant morbidity as well as fiscal loss. The most significant causative factor in postcraniotomy infections is postoperative CSF leak. Cerebral abscess related to organic congenital heart disease {{is one of the leading}} causes of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics is indicated for contaminated and clean-contaminated wounds...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{most common}} cause of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> disease among {{patients}} with AIDS or those infected with HIV- 1 is AIDS-associated myelopathy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the MR characteristics of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> in this patient popu-lation and to correlate these findings with the clinical severity of myelopathy. METHODS: MR images of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> in 21 patients with documented HIV- 1 infection or AIDS and a clinical diagnosis of AIDS-associated myelopathy were assessed retrospectively for atrophy, intrinsic signal abnormality, and abnormal enhancement. The clinical severity of myelopathy was graded by a neurologist on the basis of physical examination, and a qualitative correlation was made with the MR findings. RESULTS: MR findings were abnormal in 18 of the 21 patients. The most common feature was <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> atrophy (n 5 15), typically involving the thoracic cord with or without cervical <b>cord</b> <b>involvement,</b> followed by intrinsic cord signal abnormality (n 5 6), and normal-appearing cord (n 5 3). Three patients had both cord atrophy and intrinsic cord signal abnormality. The cord signal abnormality was diffuse, without predilection for any specific distribution pattern. Enhancement was not seen in any of the 10 patients who received intravenous contrast material...|$|R
