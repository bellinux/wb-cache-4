40|$|The {{threat to}} US Operations in the Middle East has changed {{significantly}} {{since the end}} of the Cold War, and although counterintelligence methodology has changed with it, additional modifications are needed. This thesis demonstrates the gap that has emerged in the ability of counterintelligence forces to counter the threat. Increased military presence in the Middle East and the removal of the Cold War's checks and balances increase the impact of "rogue states" and non-state actors. Current counterintelligence methodology fails to adequately address the non-state-based threat. Revolutionary information technologies and the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons ensure that non- state actors will pose a counterintelligence threat as great, or greater, than the <b>state-based</b> <b>threat.</b> The implication of this is significant. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), the USAF Agency tasked with counterintelligence support, must restructure itself to meet this emerging threat. A Classified annex to this thesis is published under separate cover. This annex outlines current AFOSI methodology and makes policy recommendations to allow AFOSI to better address the non-state-based threat. U. S. Air Force (U. S. A. F.) author...|$|E
40|$|Cyber-has {{often been}} {{considered}} as a coordination and control, as opposed to collaborative influence, media. This conceptual-design paper, uniquely, builds upon a number of entangled, cross disciplinary research strands - integrating engineering and conflict studies - and a detailed literature review to propose a new paradigm of assurance and deterrence models. We consider an ontology for Cyber-sûréte, which combines both the social trusts necessary for [knowledge &, information] assurance such as collaboration by social influence (CSI) and the technological controls and rules for secure information management referred as coordination by rule and control (CRC). We posit Cyber-sûréte as enabling both a 'safe-to-fail' ecology (in which learning, testing and adaptation can take place) within a fail-safe supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA type) system, e. g. in a nuclear power plant. Building upon traditional <b>state-based</b> <b>threat</b> analysis, we consider Warning Time and the Threat equation with relation to policies for managing Cyber-Deterrence. We examine how the goods of Cyber-might be galvanised so as to encourage virtuous behaviour and deter and / or dissuade ne'er-do-wells through multiple transparencies. We consider how the Deterrence-escalator may be managed by identifying both weak influence and strong control signals so as {{to create a more}} benign and responsive cyber-ecology, in which strengths can be exploited and weaknesses identified. Finally, we consider declaratory / mutual transparencies as opposed to legalistic / controlled transparency. © 2012 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The federal {{government}} is adopting an all-hazards approach to national security—acknowledging that the response to both natural and man-made disasters is often similar and that improving community resilience is {{an important aspect of}} preparedness for disasters, whatever form they take. The forthcoming national security statement is expected to incorporate a more holistic assessment of national security by placing a growing list of transnational risks and pressures including terrorism, organised crime and pandemic disease alongside the more traditional <b>state-based</b> <b>threats.</b> This policy analysis examines current threats to the Australian agricultural sector from either a deliberate or accidental disease outbreak...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} {{incidence of}} attack {{has been identified}} as a major characteristic of the new threat posed by terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. This article considers what such a change means for Western national security systems by examining bow different parts of the system change over time. It becomes evident that Western national security systems are structured on an assumption of comparatively slow <b>state-based</b> <b>threats.</b> In contrast, terrorist franchises operate at a faster pace, are more 2 ̆ 7 lightweight 2 ̆ 7 and can adapt within the operational and capability cycles of Western governments. Neither network-centric warfare nor an improved assessment of the threat, called for by some, offers a panacea in this regard. Rather, it is clear that not only do Western governments need to adjust their operational and capability cycles, but that they also need a greater diversity of responses to increase overall national security resilience and offer more tools for policy-makers...|$|R
40|$|The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), {{released}} by the Department of Defense (DoD) in 2010, announced an unprecedented shift in the U. S. nuclear policy away from <b>state-based</b> <b>threats</b> to nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism concerns. While these issues remain important, the evolving global strategic environment dictates that the next NPR return to a state-centric, strategic focus emphasizing four states: Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. The only strategic peer to the United States, Russia, is actively modernizing all aspects of its nuclear arsenal and has placed nonstrategic nuclear weapons (NSNWs) {{at the center of}} its national security. 1 China has overhauled the structure of its nuclear weapons program and nuclear and missile developments in North Korea are ongoing. Not long ago Iran reached the cusp of nuclear capability before the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The United States must now ensure that this agreement is implemented effectively. All of these developments make it impossible to ignore the importance of nuclear weapons in the U. S. global strategic posture today...|$|R
40|$|This {{comprehensive}} yet concise {{introduction to}} international security explores the constantly changing conditions {{that lead to}} an insecure world. During the Cold War, the Soviet-American nuclear rivalry generated insecurity. Since then, <b>state-based</b> nuclear <b>threats</b> have diminished while the threat of non-state actors wielding {{weapons of mass destruction}} has increased. A global surge in mass-casualty terrorism, persistent and costly intrastate wars, and environmental threats have reshaped our thinking about security threats and how best to respond to them. Now in a thoroughly updated edition, the text considers today 2 ̆ 7 s security agenda, including the threat posed by the spread of infectious disease, drug trafficking and competition for petroleum, ethnic rebellions, transnational criminal and terrorist organizations, and wars in cyberspace and on the ground against elusive individuals and shadowy organizations rather than states. The authors show, in other words, how the quest for security has become far more salient than it was during the euphoric days of the post-Cold War period and far more complicated than it was during the Cold War as threats are increasingly transnational, interconnected, and stateless. Seeking Security in an Insecure World offers a broad overview of both traditional and 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 conceptions of security. With clear and lively prose, compelling examples, and solid scholarship, it engages both students of international relations and general readers who wish {{to gain a better understanding}} of what security means today and how it can best be achieved.
