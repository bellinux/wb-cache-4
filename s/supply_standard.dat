50|$|Microphones, {{amplifiers}} {{and recording}} systems all add some electronic noise to the signals passing through them, generally described as hum, buzz or hiss. All buildings have low-level magnetic and electrostatic fields {{in and around}} them emanating from mains supply wiring, and these can induce hum into signal paths, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz (depending on the country's electrical <b>supply</b> <b>standard)</b> and lower harmonics. Shielded cables help to prevent this, and on professional equipment where longer interconnections are common, balanced signal connections (most often with XLR or phone connectors) are usually employed. Hiss {{is the result of}} random signals, often arising from the random motion of electrons in transistors and other electronic components, or the random distribution of oxide particles on analog magnetic tape. It is predominantly heard at high frequencies, sounding like steam or compressed air.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was to investigate}} the effects of dynamic segmentation of interval nutrient supply phase feeding on the growth performance, carcass characteristics, immune organs indexes and intestinal morphology of broilers. A total of 320 one-day-old broilers were randomly assigned into 4 feeding treatments, which included 4 interval nutrient supply phases as follows. Treatment A: a nutrient <b>supply</b> <b>standard</b> was used for every 14  d. Treatment B: a nutrient <b>supply</b> <b>standard</b> was used for every 7  d. Treatment C: a nutrient <b>supply</b> <b>standard</b> was used for every 3. 5  d except that one nutrient <b>supply</b> <b>standard</b> was used for d 1 to 7. Treatment D: a nutrient <b>supply</b> <b>standard</b> was used for every 3. 5  d including d 1 to 7. Each treatment was represented by 8 replicates with 10 broilers per replicate. The trial lasted for 42 days. Throughout the 42  d trial period, treatment A showed significantly higher average daily gain than treatments B and C (P    0. 05). The crypt depth of duodenum was significantly greater in treatments A and B than in treatment C on day 42 (P    0. 05). In conclusion, this study revealed that the growth and carcass performance of broilers is the best for 14 days segmentation phase feeding, and 3. 5 days segmentation interval phase feeding can promote small intestinal development of broilers. Dynamic segmentation of dietary supply fails to affect the immune function of broilers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The low {{atmospheric}} pressure and low oxygen content in high-altitude environment have great {{impacts on the}} functions of human body. Especially for the personnel engaged in complicated physical labor such as tunnel construction, high altitude can cause a series of adverse physiological reactions, which may result in multiple high-altitude diseases and even death in severe cases. Artificial oxygen supply is required to ensure {{health and safety of}} construction personnel in hypoxic environments. However, there are no provisions for oxygen <b>supply</b> <b>standard</b> for tunnel construction personnel in high-altitude areas in current tunnel construction specifications. As a result, this paper has theoretically studied the impacts of high-altitude environment on human bodies, analyzed the relationship between labor intensity and oxygen consumption in high-altitude areas and determined the critical oxygen-supply altitude values for tunnel construction based on two different standard evaluation systems, i. e., variation of air density and equivalent PIO 2. In addition, it has finally determined the oxygen <b>supply</b> <b>standard</b> for construction personnel in high-altitude areas based on the relationship between construction labor intensity and oxygen consumption...|$|E
