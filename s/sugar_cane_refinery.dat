50|$|This {{stadium is}} one of the oldest in Mexico and its origins can be traced back to 1948. It is located in Zacatepec, Morelos. The {{official}} opening of this stadium was in November 1954. This stadium is nicknamed the Selva Cañera ("Sugar Cane Jungle") because of the tropical weather that distinguish the municipality of Zacatepec. There was a very famous player and later coach named Ignacio Trelles, who ordered to irrigate the field one hour before the football match, leading to a very strong vaporization and an increase of the temperature to near 40 Celsius (more or less 100 Fahrenheit), that was very hard for the visitor squads. Another oddity of this building is that is it located very central in the town of Zacatepec and beside the <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> <b>refineries.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> <b>refinery</b> was {{the largest}} company in Bydgoszcz at the {{beginning}} of the 19th century: raw cane was supplied by water from Gdańsk using Brda river's waterway. The owners of the company, were the Schickler brothers from Berlin, who were also part of the consortium managing Mill Island facilities in 1825. Later the company was taken over by Splittgerber und Daum, one of the oldest Berlin bank. In addition to sugar production, the company also produced clothes for exportation to US (Black Americans market). In 1807, annual sugar production reached 250 tonnes, the company being 20 people strong.In 1818, the sugar production activity stopped and the building was used as storage and selling place for the imported sugar from Berlin refineries. After 1834, buildings refineries complex was sold out.|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsing a synthetised map of biobuilders' vitality, the {{incoming}} nutrient-enriched freshwater impact on benthic communities was assessed. A coral community survey was achieved in one rainy season. Reef water salinity and dissolved inorganic nutrient content were analysed during a rainy and a dry season. A {{high degree of}} coral mortality (90 - 100 %) {{was found on the}} outer reef flat, where the dead substrate was covered up to 80 °h by boring sponges. According to hydrology and biological in- dicators, degradation may be attributed to an ac- cumulation of organic matter, issued presumably from <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> <b>refinery</b> waste water. Inner Scler- actinians are submitted to nutrient-enriched (mainly N) submarine groundwater discharge, but coral degradation (turf-coral concurrence) was only found along the inner edge of the reef flat, which further receives P coming from the necrotized area of the reef flat...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} bagasse (sugar cane fibres) and microbiological exposure among <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> <b>refinery</b> {{workers in}} Costa Rica and its relationships with respiratory, allergy and eye problems. METHODS: Ventilatory lung function and total serum IgE were measured in 104 sugar cane workers in five departments at one refinery before the harvesting season, and repeated for 77 {{of the workers}} {{at the end of}} the season. Information on the prevalence of respiratory and other symptoms was collected with a standardised questionnaire. During the harvesting season, inhalable dust, endotoxin and mould levels were measured among 74 randomly selected sugar cane workers across departments. RESULTS: During the harvesting season, dust levels were relatively high in some departments, while endotoxin and mould levels were around background levels. Workers' ventilatory lung function differed between departments before, but not during the harvesting season or between seasons. During the harvesting season, the prevalence of wheeze and eye problems almost doubled in workers exposed to bagasse and other types of dust, whereas shortness of breath and rhinitis increased only in bagasse-exposed workers. Reporting wheeze and shortness of breath was positively associated with the number of years working at the refinery, suggesting a long-term health effect. CONCLUSION: In this refinery, the differences in workers' ventilatory lung function before the harvesting season are unlikely to be explained by bagasse exposure. However, the increase in reported symptoms (wheeze, shortness of breath, eye problems and rhinitis) over the season is likely due to irritation by dust, in particular bagasse, rather than microbiological agents...|$|E

The Serrallés rum distillery, however, is an expanding and successful company still operating from the same original location, in barrio Vayas, southeast of the intersection of routes PR-10 and PR-52.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to develop a}} pilot-scale process for the {{bacterial}} production of methacrylic acid (MAA) and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) from biomass feedstocks and the subsequent purification steps. The pilot plant will also be located on site at a <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> <b>refinery</b> in Brazil where the feedstock should be inexpensive and readily available. Although these sugar cane refineries only operate for 9 months each year, molasses can be stored so that the pilot plant runs year-round. To obtain useful information about the feasibility and scalability of the process, 30 M kg/yr of each product will be produced. The products will be tested for purity and samples will be sent out to consumers to demonstrate the quality of the product. The MAA and MEK must be of the same purity generated by current commercial processes. The pilot plant will be designed in three major parts. The first part consists of the bacterial fermentors that are used to produce and scale up MAA and MEK production. Relatively little is currently known about the efficiency of production of MAA and MEK by E. coli and this part of the plant will provide critical data about conditions required for the bacteria as well as production rates. The second part of the plant consists of the MAA purification process. Many options will be considered for the purification steps, many of which will have to be modeled in ASPEN because MAA is usually not produced in the aqueous phase. The final section of the plant will be used for MEK purification. To reduce plant costs, the design will try to share equipment between the two purification processes. The main goal of the plant is to obtain data and demonstrate feasibility, not to demonstrate sustainable profitability. Estimates for total capital investment and show that the plant will not be profitable for {{the first five years of}} operation, but the valuable data gained from the operation will be used to design the larger, more efficient, full-scale plant. The total capital investment required for the plant is approximately $ 6. 33 million. Returns generated from sales are minimal compared to the capital investment and operating costs. A full scale plant is expected to be profitable over time because of economies of scale and the price of inputs and outputs of the process...|$|E
