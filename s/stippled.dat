5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar <b>stippled</b> appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Versions of Gill Sans {{were created}} {{in a wide range}} of styles such as {{condensed}} and shadowed weights. An ultra-light version slightly lighter than the normal light style was also not digitally available until the 2015 Nova release. Several shadowed designs were released, including a capitals-only regular shadowed design and a light-shadowed version with deep relief shadows. In the metal type era, a 'cameo ruled' design that placed white letters in boxes or against a <b>stippled</b> black background was available. The shadowed weights were intended to be used together with the regular, printing in different colours, to achieve a simple multicolour effect. Some of the decorative versions may predominantly have been designed by the Monotype office, with Gill examining, critiquing and approving the designs sent to him by post. The long series of extensions, redrawings and conversions into new formats of one of Monotype's most important designs (extending long beyond Gill's death) has left Gill Sans with a great range of alternative designs and releases. A book weight was created in 1993 in between the light and regular weight, suitable for body text, along with a heavy weight.|$|E

25|$|As a {{printing}} technology, lithography {{is different from}} intaglio printing (gravure), wherein a plate is either engraved, etched, or <b>stippled</b> to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and woodblock printing or letterpress printing, wherein ink {{is applied to the}} raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with offset lithography, which has become {{the most common form of}} printing technology since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Design or artwork is {{generally}} prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers {{are able to}} draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or <b>stippled.</b> Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the same}} {{sedimentary}} types {{are present in}} the marls as are in the waterstones but with less arenaceous and more argillaceous material. An irregular rhythm is discernible, each sedimentary cycle is well developed and have banded or <b>stippled</b> beds at the base. It is in this banded stratum that features such as sun cracks are found. Ripple marks are less common but they are evidence of deposition in shallow water. Pitting sometimes found has been linked to rain pitting but may have occurred during the de-gassing of the marls during drying out. The banded strata which may be red or grey pass up into blocky unstratified mudstones (broken up and allowed to resettle before consolidation).|$|E

With our analysis we work toward an understanding of the requirements for digital <b>stippling,</b> with the ultimate goal to provide tools to artists and illustrators that can replicate the <b>stippling</b> process faithfully in the digital domain.

40|$|The {{traditional}} artistic {{technique of}} <b>stippling</b> places small dots of ink onto paper such that their density {{give the impression}} of tone. The artist tightly controls the relative placement of the <b>stipples</b> on the paper to produce even tones and avoid artifacts, leading to long creation times for the drawings. We present two non-interactive techniques for generating <b>stipple</b> drawings from grayscale images using weighted centroidal Voronoi diagrams. An iterative technique acts on input images directly to produce high-quality <b>stipple</b> drawings and a real-time approach uses precomputed dot distributions to <b>stipple</b> images quickly...|$|R
25|$|From the 18th century, English {{lead glass}} became popular {{throughout}} Europe, and was {{ideally suited to}} the new taste for wheel-cut glass decoration perfected on the Continent owing to its relatively soft properties. In Holland, local engraving masters such as David Wolff and Frans Greenwood <b>stippled</b> imported English glassware, a style that remained popular through the eighteenth century. Such was its popularity in Holland that the first Continental production of lead-crystal glass began there, probably {{as the result of}} imported English workers. Imitating lead-crystal à la façon d’Angleterre presented technical difficulties, as the best results were obtained with covered pots in a coal-fired furnace, a particularly English process requiring specialised cone-furnaces. Towards {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, lead-crystal glass was being produced in France, Hungary, Germany, and Norway. By 1800, Irish lead crystal had overtaken lime-potash glasses on the Continent, and traditional glassmaking centres in Bohemia began to focus on colored glasses rather than compete directly against it.|$|E
25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, <b>stippled</b> surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.|$|E
500|$|Goodridge {{completed}} Beauty Revealed in 1828, likely {{from looking}} at herself in a mirror. Several works have been cited as possible inspirations, including John Vanderlyn's Ariadne Asleep on the Island of Naxos and Horatio Greenough's sculpture Venus Victrix. Goodridge sent her portrait to Webster {{when he was a}} new widower, and, based on its miniature format, it was likely intended for his eyes alone. The American art critic John Updike suggests that the artist intended it to offer herself to Webster; he writes that the bared breasts appear to say [...] "We are yours for the taking, in all our ivory loveliness, with our tenderly <b>stippled</b> nipples". Ultimately, however, Webster married another, wealthier woman.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} example-based {{approach}} to synthesizing <b>stipple</b> illustrations for static 2 D images that produces scale-dependent results appropriate for an intended spatial output size and resolution. We show how treating <b>stippling</b> as a grayscale process {{allows us to}} both produce on-screen output and to achieve <b>stipple</b> merging at medium tonal ranges. At {{the same time we}} can also produce images with high spatial and low color resolution for print reproduction. In addition, we discuss how to incorporate high-level illustration considerations into the <b>stippling</b> process based on discussions with and observations of a <b>stipple</b> artist. Also, certain features such as edges can be extracted and used to control the placement of dots to improve the result. The implementation of the technique is based on a fast method for distributing dots using halftoning and can be used to create <b>stipple</b> images interactively. We describe both a GPU implementation of the basic algorithm that creates <b>stipple</b> images in real-time for large images and an extended CPU method that allows a finer control of the output at interactive rates. ...|$|R

[...] Michael's body is also feathered, stopping at the neck, ankles and wrists, a [...] "most exceptional feature" [...] {{often referred to as}} [...] "feather tights", that perhaps borrows from the costumes of liturgical dramas.

2500|$|The Futurist {{painters}} {{were slow}} to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911 they used the techniques of Divisionism, breaking light and color down into a field of <b>stippled</b> dots and stripes, which had been originally created by Giovanni Segantini and others. [...] Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method {{at this time to}} their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art. Severini was the first to come into contact with Cubism and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists. [...] Cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1980s, {{most large}} {{newspapers}} were printed with turn-of-the-century [...] "letterpress" [...] technology using easily smudged oil-based ink, off-white, low-quality [...] "newsprint" [...] paper, and coarse engraving screens. While letterpresses produced legible text, the photoengraving dots that formed pictures often bled or smeared and became fuzzy and indistinct. In this way, even when newspapers used photographs well— a good crop, a respectable size— murky reproduction often left readers re-reading the caption {{to see what}} the photo was all about. The Wall Street Journal adopted <b>stippled</b> hedcuts in 1979 to publish portraits and avoid the limitations of letterpress printing.

2500|$|The {{little known}} about {{his years in}} Rome {{is found in the}} {{autobiography}} of his friend Gino Severini (1883-1966), who recalled their meeting in 1901 and mutual interest in Nietzsche, rebellion, life experiences and socialism.

His critical and rebellious nature, and overall intellectual ability, would contribute substantially {{to the development of the}} Futurism movement. After building a foundation of skills, having studied the classics through Impressionism, both he and Severini became students of Giacomo Balla (1871-1958), a painter focusing on the modern Divisionist technique, painting with divided rather than mixed color and breaking the painted surface into a field of <b>stippled</b> dots and stripes. Severini wrote [...] "It was a great stroke of luck for us to meet such a man, whose direction was decisive of all our careers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harlequin: The base colour is {{pure white}} with black torn patches irregularly and well {{distributed}} {{over the entire}} body; a pure white neck is preferred. The black patches should never {{be large enough to}} give the appearance of a blanket, nor so small as to give a <b>stippled</b> or dappled effect. Eligible, but less desirable, are a few small grey patches (this grey is consistent with a merle marking) or a white base with single black hairs showing through, which tend to give a salt and pepper or dirty effect.Grey merle (Grautiger) dogs are acceptable in conformation shows under the FCI as the grey merle dogs can produce correctly marked black/white harlequin dogs, depending on the combinations. The aim for deleting the colour grey merle as a disqualifying fault is to provide a wider gene pool. Their status is that they are [...] "neither desirable nor to be disqualified". Consequently, this colour must never obtain the highest grading at dog shows.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we present}} an {{automated}} system for creat-ing hedcut illustrations, portraits rendered using small image feature aligned dots (<b>stipples).</b> We utilize edge detection and shading cues from the input photograph to direct <b>stipple</b> placement within the image. Both image edges and isophotes are extracted {{as a means}} of describing the image feature and shading information. Edge features and isophotes are then assigned different priorities, with isophotes being assigned the high-est priority to enhance the depth perception within the hedcut portrait. Priority assignment dictates the <b>stipple</b> alignment and spacing. Finally, <b>stipple</b> size is {{based on the number of}} points and intensity and the gra-dient magnitude of the input image. ...|$|R

[...] "The degree of keratinization and the prominence of <b>stippling</b> appear to be related."

40|$|We {{present a}} fast {{hardware-accelerated}} <b>stippling</b> method {{which does not}} require any preprocessing for placing points on surfaces. The surfaces are automatically parameterized in order to apply <b>stippling</b> textures without major distortions. The mapping process is guided by a decomposition of the space in cubes. Seamless scaling with a constant density of points is realized by subdividing and summarizing cubes. Our mip-map technique enables arbitrarily scaling with one texture. Different shading tones and scales are facilitated by adhering to the constraints of tonal art maps. With our <b>stippling</b> technique, it is feasible to encode all scaling and brightness levels within one self-similar texture. Our method is applied to surfaces extracted from (segmented) medical volume data. The speed of the <b>stippling</b> process enables <b>stippling</b> for several complex objects simultaneously. We consider application scenarios in intervention planning (neck and liver surgery planning). In these scenarios, object recognition (shape perception) is supported by adding <b>stippling</b> to semi-transparently shaded objects which are displayed as context information.
