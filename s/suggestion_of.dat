5|$|At the Lisbon Conference, {{the members}} of NATO agreed to appoint a Secretary General who would direct the organisation's staff and serve as Vice-Chairman of the Atlantic Council. The {{position}} was initially offered to Sir Oliver Franks, but he declined. As such, the allies scrambled to find someone else to take the position.
