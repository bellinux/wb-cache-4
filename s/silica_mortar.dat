40|$|Hydrated lime is a {{historic}} material currently used in conservation. It hardens slowly by carbonation slowing construction however, supplementary cementitious materials accelerate hardening enhancing strength. Hydrated-lime mortars with rice husk ash–RHA-; ground granulated blastfurnace slag–GGBS- and increasing amounts of two aggregates were studied. Increasing aggregate lowered strength as interfacial zones proliferate; it lowered hygric properties and raised water demand. Aggregate content/composition didn’t affect the high water retention. For the higher aggregate contents (90 days), limestone mortars are c. 20 % stronger than <b>silica</b> <b>mortars</b> while the (1 : 1) <b>silica</b> sand <b>mortars</b> are 56 % stronger in flexion. Additions increased strength with little impact on hygric properties. GGBS increased strength c. six times. RHA increased strength with little impact on hygric properties due to its great specific surface and high water-demand increasing porosity. GGBS and RHA properties ruling hydrate production and the kinetics of the pozzolanic reaction are considered partially responsible for the mortar property variation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ferrocement works demand cement mortars of good {{workability}} {{and high}} strength. Reduction in water-cement ratio {{combined with a}} refined pore structure increases the compressive strength {{in addition to the}} enhancement of durability characteristics, but the workability decreases. Workability becomes important, as the mortar has to easily penetrate between the layers of the mesh wires. A reasonably workable high strength cement mortar can be obtained by using a high cement content coupled with the use of superplasticizers. These were also found to retain the cohesiveness and check undesirable bleeding and segregation. An experimental program was conducted to study the functional efficacy of an SNF condensate used as a water reducing superplasticizer. The compressive strength and flow characteristics of the mortars were determined to decide their suitability for ferrocement works. The parameters included the mix proportions, the grade of cement, age of curing and the dosage of superplasticizer. It was concluded from the study that the addition of an optimum dosage of superplasticizer improved the workability and strength characteristics of <b>silica</b> fume <b>mortars.</b> There was a late gain in the compressive strength of <b>silica</b> fume <b>mortars...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{bond and}} anti-abrasion {{performance}} of repair materials {{are the key}} factors for successful repair of hydraulic concrete. Acrylic acid emulsion (AAE) <b>mortar,</b> <b>silica</b> fume (SF) <b>mortar,</b> high strength (HS) mortar, polypropylene (PP) fiber mortar and basalt fiber (BF) mortar were prepared and their direct tensile bond strength, splitting tensile bond strength, abrasion resistance and SEM analysis of bond interface are studied in this paper. The {{results show that the}} highest direct tensile bond strength was recorded for fiber mortar. But compared to homogenous specimen’s tensile strength, AAE mortar showed the highest direct tensile bond strength. The anti-abrasion properties of repair mortars were tested with decreasing performance recorded in the following order: PP fiber mortar, SF mortar, BF mortar, HS mortar and AAE mortar. Compared with the HS mortar without fiber, the wear rate of PP fiber mortar was decreased by 29. 2 % and the anti-abrasion strength was increased by 37. 7 %. This shows that adding fiber can greatly improve the anti-abrasion property. SEM analysis showed that addition of PP fiber and BF into repair mortar did not change the type of hydrates. The interface of AAE mortar was level and dense. The bond interface of SF mortar was uniform without big porosity. Addition of super plasticizer, the bond interface of HS mortar presented a large quantity of fibrous the CSH gel and less porosity which could improve the mortar bond effect effectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the influence of aggregate surface area on the mechanical properties of mortar. This goal was met by performing compression tests on a series of mortars containing different aggregate sizes. By varying the aggregate surface area, the quantity of transition zone is varied. The transition zone paste is known to have different properties than the bulk paste. Increasing the aggregate surface area was found to toughen the mortars. Both the peak stress and strain-to-peak were increased with increase in aggregate surface area. Silica fume was found to lessen the effects of aggregate surface area. The peak strain and strain-to-peak in <b>mortars</b> containing <b>silica</b> fume did increase with aggregate surface area, however, the toughening effect was not observed. The total strain energy for <b>silica</b> fume <b>mortars</b> remained constant with respect to surface area. In addition, SEM studies were performed to aid in the interpretation of the mechanical testing results. The SEM results confirmed some of the conclusions made from the mechanical testing and helped to clarify some inconsistencies in the mechanical test results. The conclusions drawn from this experimental work and their potential for application are discussed in full. ...|$|R

The effect of aggregate size and specific surface of aggregate on the variation of compressive strength has been studied. It has been observed that the early strength development was very significant with the addition of <b>silica</b> fume in <b>mortars.</b> It was also found that the size of the aggregate and its specific surface play a very significant role on the strength of the mortar. The strength of mortar increases initially and then gradually decreases as the grain size and the specific surface of aggregate increases. The modulus of elasticity increases as the compressive strength of the mortar increases. Significant strength losses have been observed in both silica fume and non-silica fume mortars at the age of 180 days...|$|R
40|$|Four {{types of}} {{repairing}} materials are studied as function of either a conventional concrete or a reference-concrete (RefC), these are: polymer-modified cement mortar (PMor), steel fiber concrete (SFco), epoxy <b>mortar</b> (EMor) and <b>silica</b> fume <b>mortar</b> (SFmo), {{to be applied}} in hydraulic structures surfaces subjected to a high velocity water flow. Besides the mechanical requests and wearing resistance of hydraulic concrete dam structures, especially the spillway surfaces, the high solar radiation, the environmental temperature and wet and dry cycles, contribute significantly to the reduction of their lifespan. RefC and the SFco were developed based on a usual concrete mixture used in slabs of spillways. The average RefC mixture used was 1 : 1. 61 : 2. 99 : 0. 376, with Pozzolan-modified Portland cement consumption of 425 kg/m³. EMor and PMor mixtures followed the information given by the manufacturers and lab experience. Tests on concrete samples were carried out in laboratory simulating normally found environmental situations {{in order to control}} the mechanical resistance and the aging imposed conditions, such as solar radiation and humidity. Also, physicochemical characterizing tests were made for all used materials. From the analyzed results, two of them presented a higher performance: the EMor and SFmo. SFco presented good adherence to the RefC and good mechanical performance. However, it also presented apparent metal corrosion in humidity tests, being indicated for use, with caution, as an intermediate layer in underwater repairs.

Cement mortar specimens were exposed to sulphate concentrations of up to 25000 ppm. The sulphate resistance of the selected cements was evaluated by visual examination and measuring expansion and reduction in the compressive strength. Morphological changes in cements, due to sulphate exposure, were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. The mineralogical changes in cements exposed to a solution with 15 000 ppm sulphate were evaluated.

40|$|Copper slag is a {{by-product}} generated during smelting to extract copper metal from the ore. The copper slag obtained may exhibit pozzolanic activity and may therefore {{be used in}} the manufacture of addition-containing cements. In this paper the effect of the incorporation of the copper slag in cement is measured. Blends of copper slag with Portland cement generally possess properties equivalent to Portland cement containing fly ash, but very different to the silica fume incorporation. Copper slag and fly ash reduce the heat of hydration more effectively than <b>silica</b> fume in <b>mortars.</b> The replacement of 30 % cement by copper slag reduces the flexural and compressive strength in a similar way to fly ash; however, after 28 days, the reduction is less than the percentage of substitution. Hydrated calcium aluminate phases were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The pozzolanic activity of copper slag {{is similar to that of}} fly ash and higher than silica fume. In the presence of low water/cement ratios, certain pozzolanic materials produce a very compact cement paste that limits the space available for hydration products, a determining factor in the formation of hydrated calcium aluminates. SEM was found to be a useful analytical technique when aluminates are formed and can be clearly detected by XRD. Copyright © 2008 Society of Chemical IndustryPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Construction {{workers are}} educated at {{vocational}} training centers before they begin their working lives. Future bricklayers and their instructors {{are exposed to}} respirable dust and possibly to hazardous respirable crystalline <b>silica</b> from trial <b>mortar.</b> METHODS: Thirty-six personal air samples were collected at six training centers to estimate exposure to respirable dust for both students and teachers. A selection of 22 samples was analyzed for crystalline silica. RESULTS: Average respirable dust exposures ranged from 0. 59 mg/m(3) for teachers to 1. 45 mg/m(3) for students performing recycling and cleaning tasks. In 45 % of the analyzed samples, respirable crystalline silica was detected. Exposure to silica remained below the Dutch OEL (75 microg/m(3)). Exposure was significantly less for teachers than for students. This effect was found in both types of vocational training centers present in the Netherlands. Dry sweeping, as performed at all locations in this study, contributed considerably to the exposure to respirable dust. A first step in reducing exposure to dust and silica at training centers would therefore be to avoid dry sweeping. The presence of a dust extraction system, although not optimally designed, also significantly lowered exposure. CONCLUSIONS: To assess a construction worker's lifetime exposure to respirable dust and crystalline silica, the vocational training period should also be taken into account. Several epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} time since first exposure can be an important risk factor for chronic health effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{cracking}} {{phenomenon is}} connected mainly to fatigue mechanisms and to thermal actions, which induce high tensile stresses inside the pavement which provoke the arise of cracks, especially {{in areas with}} lower resistance. This process, if not faced at early stage, can develop very quickly up {{to the case of}} a complete unserviceable road superstructure. In order to avoid this limit condition, it is necessary to intervene quickly with the sealing of the cracks, by adopting reliable techniques and materials with high performances. The contribution of this paper is on the execution of a detailed analysis of the rheological properties of different bituminous mastics which can be used to seal the cracks, referring to traditional characterization (penetration, softening point) and rheological tests, such as creep-recovery with DSR at medium temperatures (30 °C) and flexural creep tests with BBR at low temperatures (- 10, - 15 and - 20 °C), before and after PAV ageing. In order to investigate on the activity of the fillers, the experimental phase was firstly focused on mastics prepared with plain 70 / 100 bitumen and with two different percentages (33 and 50 %) of different kinds of filler (<b>silica,</b> limestone, lime, <b>mortar,</b> cement, ladle slag, blast furnace slag). Only afterwards, once discovered the fillers with the best performances, the plain bitumen was changes with the modified one, getting at the end to a merit rheological classification useful for the applicative scopes on site...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was based on}} a two-part basic research investigation studying the effects of cement paste-aggregate interfaces (or interfacial transition zones-HZ) on strength and durability of concrete. Part I dealt with the theoretical study and Part II dealt with the experimental. Part I, the theoretical part, illustrates the effect of ITZ on the concrete properties by assuming its elastic moduli to be varied continuously in the region. A four-phase composite model is employed and three functions are chosen to model the moduli variation in the ITZ. A theoretical solution for an n-layered spherical inclusion model is used to estimate the overall effective moduli of the modified four-phase model. The influence of material and geometric characteristics of the ITZ, {{as well as that of}} the aggregate on the overall effective moduli is investigated. The effects of three different moduli variations in ITZ on the overall moduli are compared. Their potential application is discussed. Finally, by comparing the prediction of the proposed models to a set of data on mortar, it is found that the elastic modulus at the interface is about 20 - 70 % lower than that in the bulk paste for portland cement mortar, and 1040 % lower for <b>silica</b> fume <b>mortar.</b> Part II, the experimental part, illustrates the relationship between the ITZ microstructure and the mechanical properties of the concrete. The mechanical properties studied included the dynamic modulus of elasticity, dynamic shear modulus, and logarithmic decrement of damping, flexural tensile strength, and compressive strength. In addition, the effects of changing the water-to cementitious material ratio by mass, aggregate type, volume fraction of aggregate, and silica fume substitution, on these properties were investigated. A criterion based on water quantity and the specific surface area of aggregate by mass in a mixture was developed to eliminate biased date from the analysis process. This criterion was used to detect mixing and compaction problems that may have resulted in erroneous values of mechanical properties of specimen. In order to realize the compaction condition of the fresh mixture, an index of compaction (called gross porosity) was introduced. The three-phase model of Hashin-Shtrikman bounds was employed, tested, and validated with the experimental data from this research. A modification of this model linked the theory of Hashin-Shtrikman bounds to the results of this research on dynamic moduli of the transition zone. A form of optimal water content is recommended. This optimal water content may be used for a mixture to gain its possibly highest moduli, strengths and density. Thus, the rule of the optimal water content may potentially be applied to optimize the mixture design for conventional and high-strength concrete with consideration of ITZ...|$|R
40|$|Every 1 t {{of china}} clay {{produced}} in the UK generates 9 t of waste material. A limited quantity of the coarser waste has beneficial use as a building stone or secondary aggregate in concrete and asphalt, but there are currently limited uses for the finest waste fraction. ‘Mica’ waste {{is a mixture of}} fine minerals {{and is one of the}} forms of waste with little beneficial use other than the restoration of old quarries. Looking for innovative solutions for the needs of a new Eco-town in the UK and with an aim to find new commercially viable and low environmental impact uses in construction, this PhD introduces the idea of using the china clay waste in alkali-activated binders. First, it was investigated whether the contained mica mineral could be used as an alkali-activated binder. This was done using different MAS NMR and XRD analysis, and mechanical strength tests based on European standards. The material was shown to have low reactivity and some direct trials of alkali-activation of thermally treated mica mineral produced in average weak binders. Later, three series of alkali-activated binders were studied, one based on Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), one based on Fly Ash (FA) and one based on a 50 %GGBS- 50 %FA blend (50 / 50). The china clay waste was incorporated in selected optimum binders from the three series as aggregate to make mortars and concrete. Compared to control specimens, the test specimens using the china clay waste always showed lower strength. It is suggested that the high water demand of the waste is the main problem. When the waste was used in mortars, the impact of the water declined over time, with sand waste from china clay extraction showing approximately equivalent strength to the control <b>silica</b> based <b>mortar</b> after 6 months of curing for the GGBS and 50 / 50 series. For the same series, mica-waste specimens gave about 50 % of the strength of the control mortar on the 7 th day of curing but increased to 70 - 80 % of the control compressive strength at 6 months. In the FA series, the impact of additional water resulted in very low strengths and that series did not proceed in concrete making. The concrete design was accompanied by an environmental analysis to ensure environmentally beneficial outcomes were obtained. Testing in compression shows a similar decreasing strength for the Portland and the alkali-activated series for increasing amounts of waste used. However, the test specimens of the GGBS series showed potential for replacing Portland control specimens. The potential for making blocks and tiles using the new concrete would be greater if the mix design is optimized. Durability testing will be required on an optimized design and final product, but initial analysis of test results and the literature indicate this is unlikely to be a concern. Not using the final product to run durability tests would lead to arbitrary conclusions. The environmental analysis shows that although the carbon emissions would be reduced using alkali-activated concrete, most of the other environmental impact categories would be affected negatively which has to be considered when making the final decision on whether to use this new material in the Eco-town or elsewhere...|$|R
