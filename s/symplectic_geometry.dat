40|$|Any {{canonical}} {{quantum theory}} {{can be understood}} to arise from the compatibility of the statistical geometry of distinguishable observations with the canonical Poisson structure of Hamiltonian dynamics. This geometric perspective offers a novel, background independent non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. We invoke a quantum version of the equivalence principle, which requires both the statistical and <b>symplectic</b> <b>geometries</b> of canonical quantum theory to be fully dynamical quantities. Our approach sheds new light on such basic issues of quantum gravity as the nature of observables, the problem of time, and the physics of the vacuum. In particular, the observed numerical smallness of the cosmological constant can be rationalized in this approach.

These curvatures solve the biconformal field equations whenever the original 4 -dim fields satisfy the 4 -dim YM theory. This gives a 1 - 1 mapping between the gravity and gauge theories.
