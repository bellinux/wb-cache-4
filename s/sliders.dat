5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} to withstand earthquakes, forest fires, and other natural disasters. The 2002 Denali earthquake damaged some of the pipeline <b>sliders</b> designed to absorb similar quakes, and it caused the pipeline to shut down for more than 66 hours as a precaution. In 2004, wildfires overran portions of the pipeline, {{but it was not}} damaged and did not shut down.|$|E
5|$|According to a trade data study, painted turtles {{were the}} second most popular pet turtles after red-eared <b>sliders</b> in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, painted turtle pets, {{although}} Oregon forbids keeping them as pets, and Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than , to limit human contact to salmonella. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold, and illegal trafficking also occurs.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated <b>sliders</b> were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
50|$|The red-eared <b>slider</b> × yellow-bellied <b>slider</b> (Trachemys scripta elegans × Trachemys scripta scripta) is an {{intergradation}} of a red-eared <b>slider</b> and yellow-bellied <b>slider</b> subspecies. On {{the side}} of its head where a normal yellow-bellied <b>slider</b> would have solid yellow, there will be red interposed.

5000|$|A Hall of Fame pitcher {{famous for}} his <b>slider</b> was lefty Steve Carlton. Right-handed pitcher David Cone was {{famous for his}} <b>slider,</b> which {{he was able to}} use many {{different}} ways, as was Bob Gibson of the Cardinals. To right-handed batters, Cone would throw it to hook sharply outside the strike zone, getting hitters to chase and miss it. He threw the pitch from various arm angles to further confuse the hitter. Cone's <b>slider</b> was also a strikeout pitch to left-handed hitters, throwing it to curve back over the outside corner and catch the hitter looking. Cone used the <b>slider</b> effectively during his perfect game on July 18, 1999—the final out was recorded via a <b>slider</b> resembling a wiffle ball. In {{the first game of the}} 1988 World Series, Dennis Eckersley tried to strike out Kirk Gibson with a backdoor <b>slider,</b> but Gibson was sitting on that exact pitch and hit a game-winning home run. Joe Carter ended the 1993 World Series with a home run on a <b>slider</b> thrown by Mitch Williams. A notable <b>slider</b> was John Smoltz's, which would come in looking like a strike and then break out of the strike zone. Brad Lidge featured a <b>slider</b> in his perfect season as a closer in 2008, and used the pitch to strike out the final batter of the 2008 World Series for the Philadelphia Phillies. Closer Francisco Cordero also throws a <b>slider.</b> Other notable pitchers who throw a <b>slider</b> include Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers, who used the pitch to win a Cy Young Award in 1981,and Seattle Mariners and Arizona Diamondbacks starter Randy Johnson, whose <b>slider's</b> lateral movement eventually spawned its own nickname, [...] "Mr. Snappy". At times, Johnson's <b>slider</b> was faster than most pitchers' fastballs. Mike Jackson, who tied Paul Assenmacher with the most games pitched in the 1990s (644), also threw a <b>slider.</b> Ron Guidry threw a <b>slider,</b> which he was taught by Sparky Lyle.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond <b>sliders</b> (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{piezoelectric}} {{flying height}} control <b>slider</b> {{has recently been}} implemented in magnetic recording disk drives to reduce the flying height. This paper has examined the piezoelectric flying height control <b>slider</b> using shear-model deformation of piezoelectric transducer (PZT). A finite element model of the PZT <b>slider</b> using shear-model deformation has been built, and the electromechanical simulation and air-bearing simulation have been performed to investigate {{the effects of the}} shear-model deformation on the static flying attitude of the PZT <b>slider.</b> The results show that the flying height and pitch angle of the PZT <b>slider</b> can be significantly reduced with an increase in the drive voltage on the PZT sheet. However, beyond the drive voltage of 80 V for the proposed PZT <b>slider,</b> the reduction in the flying height of PZT <b>slider</b> is limited owing to the high air bearing stiffness at low flying height region. Furthermore, the PZT <b>slider</b> can be rotated and balanced at a negative pitch angle...|$|R

40|$|Kinematics {{behavior}} of an eccentric reciprocating <b>slider</b> mechanism {{depends on its}} geometrical dimensions. When a shock effect at the <b>slider</b> point is intended for a particular purpose such as in compactor application, an eccentricity of the <b>slider’s</b> axis is required. The kinematics evaluation of the <b>slider</b> considers velocity and acceleration functions at the <b>slider</b> point. This paper provides kinematics sensitivity functions at the <b>slider</b> point based on vector analysis of the eccentric <b>slider</b> mechanism. The functions have three design variables: eccentricity, length of connecting rod and the radius of crank rotation with an additional rotational variable for plotting purpose. The sensitivity functions are coded in SMath to do all calculations and graphical plotting. Validation {{results show that the}} functions calculate correctly of known example problems. For a test case, the kinematics sensitivity functions are employed to obtain a feasible optimum design of eccentricity value to achieve maximum peak of acceleration in a <b>slider</b> mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of <b>slider</b> posture on the <b>slider</b> bearing in a heat-assisted {{magnetic}} recording (HAMR) system with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. In this HAMR system, the heat issues on the <b>slider</b> bearings {{are assumed to be}} caused by a heated spot on the disk and/or <b>slider</b> body itself at various pitch angles. The simulation results show that with a heated spot on the disk, the air bearing pressure and air bearing force that acted on the <b>slider</b> surface will increase when the pitch angle becomes larger. It is also found that the bearing force increases with the heated spot size and {{the effects of}} a heated spot become more obvious at a larger pitch angle. On the other hand, the <b>slider</b> body temperature is observed to have a noticeable effect on air bearing pressure and force. The smaller pitch angle enlarges the tendency of bearing force variations with the <b>slider</b> temperature and makes the <b>slider</b> more sensitive to its temperature changes...|$|R

As a function of the <b>slider</b> speed, we observe dissipation peaks at specific values of the <b>slider</b> speed, whose nature we understand by means of a Fourier analysis of the excited phonon modes.

50|$|The zipper {{is often}} the least durable {{component}} in any garment or type of equipment. Most often the zipper fails to close due to a worn or bent <b>slider</b> {{not being able to}} apply the necessary force to the sides of the teeth to cause them to interlock. This problem can sometimes be redressed by using a small pipe wrench or similar pliers to carefully squeeze the back part of the <b>slider</b> together a fraction of a millimeter. This can compensate for the wear of the <b>slider.</b> The <b>slider</b> is typically made as a magnesium diecast which breaks easily. It is necessary to reduce the force on the pliers before it can be felt that the <b>slider</b> actually gives in. If it is not yet possible to successfully close the zipper, the pressure applied to the <b>slider</b> should only gradually be increased. Another way to reduce the gap of the open end of the <b>slider</b> is by preparing a small block of wood by sawing a slot into one end so that it fits over the upper arm of the <b>slider.</b> Then a hammer can be used to exact a force onto the <b>slider</b> by carefully hitting the wood.|$|R
