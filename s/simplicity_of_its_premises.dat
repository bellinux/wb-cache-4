5000|$|Oggs Cruz of Rappler {{writes in}} a {{positive}} review: Antoinette Jadaone’s That Thing Called Tadhana relishes the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>premise.</b> It never strays towards the unlikely situations that most romantic comedies rely on for pageantry. The film keeps its feet firmly grounded {{within the realm of}} reality.With convincing performances from Angelica Panganiban and JM de Guzman, the film effortlessly evokes both the palpable pain of losing love and the alluring pleasure of gaining it back.|$|R

50|$|An {{argument}} is valid if {{and only if}} the truth <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>premises</b> entails the truth <b>of</b> <b>its</b> conclusion and each step, sub-argument, or logical operation in the {{argument is}} valid. Under such conditions it would be self-contradictory to affirm the premises and deny the conclusion. The corresponding conditional of a valid argument is a logical truth and the negation <b>of</b> <b>its</b> corresponding conditional is a contradiction. The conclusion is a logical consequence <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>premises.</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{argument}} is “valid” {{if it is}} impossible for <b>its</b> <b>premises</b> to be true while its conclusion is false. In other words, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. An argument can be “valid” even if one or more <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>premises</b> are false.|$|R
50|$|The {{truth of}} the {{conclusion}} is independent of the truth <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>premise</b> - it is a 'non sequitur', since Jackson might be a mammal without being human. He might be, say, an elephant.|$|R

50|$|Damon Knight {{wrote of}} the novel:Timeliner, by Charles Eric Maine, is that sort of amateur flight of fancy that takes leave <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>premises,</b> and <b>its</b> senses, in the second chapter. Almost {{anything}} can then happen except the unexpected.|$|R
