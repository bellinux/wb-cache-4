40|$|International audienceIn an ageing world population, {{increasing}} {{the lifetime of}} orthopedic devices is of vital importance for reducing surgical risks for patients and reducing medical costs. Ceramic materials are gaining interest because of their hardness and chemical inertia with respect to metal prosthesis. Wear of the prosthetic couple (femoral head and cup) {{is one of the}} main rationales for using ceramic hip implants, because they induce much lower wear debris. The present study investigates the combined effects of shocks due to microseparation and hydrothermal ageing on the wear of Zirconia Toughened Alumina (ZTA) bearings, which have been under strong development these past ten years. Wear stripe patterns are formed on femoral heads tested on a <b>shock</b> <b>device.</b> 3 D profilometry is used to evaluate the volume of worn material released from the head that averages at 0. 46 mm 3 /year during simulation mimicking about 15 years of ageing. This volume is larger than formerly estimated with hip walking simulators with microseparation, an effect that we tentatively attribute to a larger force (9000 N) applied here than on hip simulators where the force was not specified. The present experiment should allow refining the effect of force on the wear of ceramic femoral head, hence to simulate different patient conditions (weight, activity, accidents, [...] .). Micro Raman spectroscopy reveals significant zirconia phase transformation within wear stripes. ZTA components show minor phase transformation during hydrothermal degradation in an autoclave when compared to changes induced by shocks. Finally, five clinically retrieved bearings are characterized for in vivo comparison, and also reveal phase transformation within wear track areas. The association of phase transformation enhancement with wear areas on in vivo samples indicates that wear is induced by shocks, rather than by hydrothermal ageing. Shock simulations are therefore essential for in vitro experimentation aiming at reproducing wear of ceramic implants and in vivo environment. On a material's point of view, it is shown that the ZTA ceramics can exhibit a beneficial phase transformation under stress, which may limit wear stripes, without suffering from significant ageing...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Evaluate {{the effect}} of {{different}} veneering techniques, Y-TZP core thicknesses, and firing cycles with different heat rates and holding times on the mechanical properties of veneering porcelain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biaxial flexural strength and Thermal shock resistance tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of veneer porcelain. Core material, Y-TZP and two porcelain veneers, IPS e. max Ceram and VITA VM 9, were used in this study. Vita YZ zirconia blocks were sectioned and sintered to provide slabs of 1. 65, 3. 25, and 6. 50 mm in thickness. Two techniques were used to fabricate VITA VM 9 and e. max Ceram porcelain veneer porcelain discs, Hand Layered, mixing powder with manufacturerâ€™s molding liquid, condensed in a mold, and Pressed, pressing powder uniaxially in a mold. A layer of carbon paint {{was applied to the}} zirconia to allow removal of the porcelain discs. For thermal shock test the veneering porcelain fired on the Y-TZP core with a wash layer. After the veneer discs were fabricated, they were sintered: (1) According to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions; (2) Two different cycles with slower heat rate and longer holding than the recommended value. Biaxial flexural strength was determined using a universal mechanical tester. Thermal shock tests were performed using a Pober thermal <b>shock</b> <b>device.</b> Statistical analysis was conducted for all tests using ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test at p= 0. 05. RESULTS: There was significant effect from changes of YZ Core thickness, firing cycle, and veneer technique on the mechanical properties of porcelain veneer. The veneering technique had the largest impact on the mechanical properties of veneer porcelain followed by firing cycle, followed by YZ core thickness. In using different firing cycles with different heat rates and holding times, slowing the heating rate had more influence on the mechanical properties of veneer porcelain. In measuring the surface temperature of the Y-TZP/VITA VM 9 assembly, the specimen surface temperature was coincidental with the furnace programmed firing cycle using a slower heating rate firing cycle. CONCLUSIONS Veneering technique, slower heat rate firing cycle, and Y-TZP core thickness have significant impact on veneering porcelain mechanical properties. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
40|$|With world {{population}} increasing {{the need for}} sustainable food resources grows with it. Therefore growing the seafood industry for both the domestic market as well as exports, in New Zealand is important both {{as a source of}} food, but also for economic gain. In New Zealand, there are 436 species of bivalves, including pipis, cockles, mussels, oysters and scallops (Wassilieff, 2014), this study examines one subset species commonly known as surf clams, a species with export potential. While there has been some limited fishing of these species, the main industry player has identified several impediments to growth. These are, a) the quite low Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) which has limited the ability to create a sustainable business and b) high mortality of live clams that are shipped overseas. This study addresses each of these impediments. First the biomass of commercially caught species was determined along a 26 km stretch of coast in Fishing Management Area 8 (FMA 8, Foxton Beach), to ascertain the biomass of the seven commercially caught species of surf clam, with a view to ascertain how appropriate the current catch limits are, with a view to increase this limit to help drive a growing export business. Only four of the seven species were found with a total of 5. 7 t of surf clams landed in ten days of fishing. One dominant species, Spisula aequilatera (SAE) consisted of 43 % of total catch, followed by Dosinia anus (DAN) 21. 9 %, Mactra murchisoni (MMI) 21. 5 % and Paphies donacina (PDO) 13. 5 %. Upon entry into the quota management system, these four species within FMA 8 was set at 67 t, from the results found in this study, it has seen an increase to 2816 t for the same four species. Secondly was a biomass survey conducted within Fishing Management Area 7 (FMA 7, Golden Bay) with the same view of ensuring the current catch limits are set correctly to ensure sustainability of the species. Only one species (Paphies donacina) was found, and in ten explorative tows, only eight of these tows produced any catch. The total combined weight of these tows was 13. 62 kg. Due to the tough fishing conditions, lack of species and low catch numbers, the decision was made not to conduct any further investigation of this area. Finally, experiments were undertaken on the oxygen consumption, and mortality tests. These tests were to replicate the transportation of live clams to ascertain the high mortality rates the industry partner was finding, when live product was shipped overseas. The results for the leakage test of the chilly bins, used to export the clams showed that when filled with 100 % oxygen, after 30 hours this had leaked to an average of 24. 9 %, suggesting that the cause for the high mortality is not due to oxygen depletion. Clams of various sizes, when placed into an air tight chamber used varying degrees of available oxygen, however after 30 hours oxygen consumption was less then available confirming the previous test that it is not due to lack of oxygen for the high mortality. The test to replicate transportation conditions was inconclusive; we were unable to replicate the high mortality rate seen by the industry partner. Using the same methods and duration the control test produced 0 % mortality rate for the complete 72 hr period, test one had a 0 % mortality rate for the first 24 hrs, then after 48 hrs mortality had raised to. 36 % and after 72 hrs it was. 72 %. Test two had a 0 % mortality rate at re-swim after 24 hrs it was. 34 %, then after 48 hrs mortality had risen to 1. 71 % and stayed at this for the remaining time. Further investigation would need to be carried out to find the root cause of the high mortality seen by the industry partner; two such tests could be measuring temperature inside random chilly bins, as well as some <b>shock</b> <b>device</b> to see if they are being roughly treated and dyeing from shock...|$|E

40|$|As {{urban areas}} {{have become more}} {{congested}} and highway interchanges have becomemore complex, horizontally curved composite steel I girder bridges have become an essentialcomponent in highway infrastructure. These types of bridges are key to providing smoothtransitions from one highway to the next, allowing for a seamless flow of traffic. Unfortunately, bridges with curved configurations may sustain severe damage owing torotation of the superstructure or displacement towards {{the outside of the}} curve due to thecomplex vibrations that occur during serious earthquakes. So how to improve the seismicbehavior of curved viaduct becomes important during strong earthquakes. Stopper installed atboth sides of roller bearing in tangential direction, cable restrainer equipped between adjacentsuperstructures, viscous damper installed at expansion joint and <b>shock</b> absorber <b>device</b> setbetween roller bearing and stopper are all evaluated respectively in this thesis. Traditional steel bearings are very common, but they are easy to be broken in earthquakes. Recently roller bearings equipped with stopper are installed on top of piers. Because stoppercan be easily installed and the price is not expensive, so it has wide application prospect infuture. Therefore, the effect of stopper together with cable restrainer on mitigating curvedviaduct damage during serious earthquake is carried out. The relationship between differentstopper values and the different types of damages is obtained. The advice for the seismicdesign of viaduct based on the appropriate stopper values has been put forward. Recently, cable restrainer installed at curved viaduct can significantly reduce thepossibility of deck unseating damage. In this thesis, the effect of stiffness and slack value ofcable restrainer on curved viaduct damage is presented. According to the evaluation results,the seismic design of curved viaduct based on the cable restrainer with appropriate stiffnessand slack value can be put forward. In addition, a comparison between restrained andunrestrained curved viaduct is also presented. Finally, the use of cable restrainer reducingcurved viaduct damage is proved in this thesis. In addition, application of viscous dampers to viaducts has gained significant attention inrecent years. Due to its large resistance force and energy dissipation capacity, viscousdampers have wide application prospect. The most advantage of viscous dampers is that itshows no resistance forces under slow relative movements of segments results from thermalchanges, creep and shrinkage effects. It is only activated when earthquake happens. Therefore,this thesis analyzes the overall performance of highway viaducts with different kinds ofviscous dampers and different stopper values. Different kinds of viscous dampers havedifferent stiffness and different resistance forces. So the relationships between different kindsof viscous dampers, different stopper values, and curved viaduct damage have been foundrespectively. A comparison between curved viaducts equipped with viscous dampers andwithout viscous dampers is also carried out. The calculation results demonstrated that stoppervalue plays a more important role in piers damage than viscous damper. In recent years, the effects of <b>shock</b> absorber <b>devices</b> installed between adjacent viaductsegments on reducing pounding forces, have been studied by many researchers. But theeffectiveness of <b>shock</b> absorber <b>devices</b> installed between roller bearing and stopper onreducing pounding damage, is lack.

Besides, strain hardening, strainsoftening and elastic <b>shock</b> absorber <b>devices</b> are also analyzed in this thesis.
