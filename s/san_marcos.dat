This included the Mam inhabitants of the area now within the modern department of <b>San</b> <b>Marcos.</b> Quetzaltenango and <b>San</b> <b>Marcos</b> were placed {{under the command of}} Juan de León y Cardona, who began the reduction of indigenous populations and the foundation of Spanish towns. The towns of <b>San</b> <b>Marcos</b> and San Pedro Sacatepéquez were founded soon after the conquest of western Guatemala. In 1533 Pedro de Alvarado ordered de León y Cardona to explore and conquer the area around the Tacaná, Tajumulco, Lacandón and San Antonio volcanoes; in colonial times this area was referred to as the Province of Tecusitlán and Lacandón. De León marched to a Maya city named Quezalli by his Nahuatl-speaking allies with a force of fifty Spaniards; his Mexican allies also referred to the city by the name Sacatepequez. De León renamed the city as San Pedro Sacatepéquez in honour of his friar, Pedro de Angulo. The Spanish founded a village nearby at Candacuchex in April that year, renaming it as <b>San</b> <b>Marcos.</b>|$|E
