5|$|A {{particularly}} rare feature {{found on}} Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> ceramics {{is the so-called}} X-ray style, showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it. All the other representations using this rare style are depicted on Late Classic sculptures at sites with which {{it is known that}} Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> had contact at this time, including Dos Pilas, Machaquila, Tikal and Yaxchilan. This X-ray style has been found on at least nine painted vessels from Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> and is also used {{on the west side of}} Stela 2.|$|E

5|$|Among Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> {{and those that}} have been found were a minor {{component}} in mixed fill deposits. This suggests that Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E

5|$|In the Late Classic period Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> {{was located}} between two {{mutually}} hostile powers, the great city of Tikal {{to the north}} and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbatún to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This {{seems to be the case}} at Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to the politically motivated banqueting that took place in the city. In the 8th century, although Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.|$|E

5|$|Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> is {{an ancient}} Maya site located just north of Lake Petén Itzá in the Petén Basin region of the {{southern}} Maya lowlands. It is a few kilometres from the modern village of <b>San</b> <b>José,</b> in Guatemala's northern department of Petén. A medium-sized civic-ceremonial centre, {{it was an important}} political and economic centre during the Late Classic period (AD650950).|$|E

5|$|The Bayshore Freeway {{begins at}} the Blossom Hill Road {{interchange}} on US 101, where SR 82 begins its northwesterly path along Monterey Highway to <b>San</b> <b>Jose.</b> The freeway curves north and northwest, bypassing downtown <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> to the east, and then curves west-northwest, crossing I-880 and SR 87, the latter {{just north of the}} <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> International Airport. The portion of the highway from <b>San</b> <b>Jose</b> to South San Francisco is relatively straight and flat, running near the west edge of the San Francisco Bay. Junctions here include SR 237 in Sunnyvale, SR 85 in Mountain View, SR 84 in Menlo Park and Redwood City, SR 92 in San Mateo, and the San Francisco International Airport and I-380 in San Bruno. In South San Francisco, the freeway curves northeast around San Bruno Mountain, crossing its east edge at Sierra Point, and then heads north on a causeway across the former Candlestick Cove to the San Francisco city line.|$|E

5|$|The small {{satellite}} site of Chak Maman Tok' several kilometers to {{the southwest}} of Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José,</b> {{appears to have been}} an important centre for the production of chert tools, with only a few other centres within the Maya lowlands manufacturing chert on such a scale. Although very small, Chak Maman Tok' probably played a major part within the economy of the Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> polity.|$|E
5|$|The {{variations}} in artistic style and chemical {{composition of the}} Ik-style ceramics suggests that they were produced {{in a number of}} workshops local to the Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> area. They have been subdivided into five types, four from Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> itself and one from one of its satellite sites. There are also various lower-quality examples that are presumed to have been manufactured in sites of lesser importance within the Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> polity. The Ik-style ceramics are believed to have been produced in the period from 740800 AD. In spite of differences, all the Ik-style ceramics are thought to have been made within a network of allied workshops dedicated to producing vessels for use in the banquets of the aristocracy of Motul de <b>San</b> <b>José</b> and of the petty nobility of the capital's satellites. The ceramics were distributed widely in the Maya region as gifts in order to seal alliances between the elites of various Maya kingdoms.|$|E
