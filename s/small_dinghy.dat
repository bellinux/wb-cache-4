25|$|The destroyer-escort {{returned}} to the United States in early 1946 for shipyard overhaul at San Pedro, California. On 16 May, she once again departed for the South Pacific. Arriving at Kwajalein on 31 May, she provided power to that island until September. During her tenure there, a slight mishap occurred. A group of sailors while on leave left the ship and proceeded to burglarize a large liquor storehouse {{that was on the}} island. They were discovered by Marine MP's that were stationed on the island. None of them were apprehended, but it is known that those who committed the robbery were from the Marsh because a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> belonging to the Marine Detachment was stolen that night as well, and tied up alongside the destroyer. The officer in charge of the division claimed that it was theirs and that the liquor had been stolen by sailors on board the Marsh. The captain of the vessel staunchly denied the claims. No arrests were made and the <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> remained with the Marsh at least until 1947. She then sailed for Guam where she received orders for Tsingtao and Fusan, Korea where the 7th Fleet lent support to the aims of American policy in China and in the United States occupation zone of Korea.|$|E
25|$|While Pierre was jailed, Jean {{operated}} the piracy and smuggling business. Over {{the next few}} months, the British Navy increased patrols in the Gulf of Mexico, and by August they had established a base at Pensacola. On September 3, 1814, the British ship HMS Sophie fired on a pirate ship returning to Barataria. Lafitte's ship grounded in shallow water where the larger British ship could not follow. The British raised a white flag and launched a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> with several officers. Lafitte {{and several of his}} men rowed to meet them halfway.|$|E
25|$|At 5:45pm in {{the early}} evening of 10 April 1941 the Lord Southborough was {{launched}} to search for more downed aircrew who had made a forced landing on Margate Sands 3 miles of shore. A Blenheim bomber had engaged on a bombing raid on Borkum and the plane had been damaged by shell fire which had put the wireless and compass out of action. The lifeboat rescued the three man crew using a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> as the lifeboat could only get to within {{a quarter of a mile}} of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate the number of recreational fishing boats. They {{range in size from}} <b>small</b> <b>dinghies</b> to large charter cruisers, and unlike commercial fishing vessels, are often not dedicated just to fishing.|$|R
50|$|The Flash is an {{artificial}} lake which {{is commonly used}} for sailing and other recreational pursuits. The lake covers just under 50,000 square metres in an area between Gresford and Borras.Gresford Sailing Club based here, training and racing in <b>small</b> <b>dinghys.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{high school}} sailing season {{traditionally}} {{begins with the}} Sea Otter Regatta in October and for most ends with the PCCs in April. Typical fleet racing is sailed in <b>small</b> <b>dinghies</b> called CFJs, although some specialty regattas are held in Lasers.|$|R
500|$|... "The Open Boat" [...] {{is divided}} into seven sections, each told mainly {{from the point of}} view of the correspondent, based upon Crane himself. The first part {{introduces}} the four characters—the correspondent, a condescending observer detached from the rest of the group; the captain, who is injured and morose at having lost his ship, yet capable of leadership; the cook, fat and comical, but optimistic that they will be rescued; and the oiler, Billie, who is physically the strongest, and the only one in the story referred to by name. The four are survivors of a shipwreck, which occurred before the beginning of the story, and are drifting at sea in a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 25 March the men on Seneca heard a loud {{explosion}} within their convoy, and shortly afterward saw distress rockets in the air. They found the British ship Cowslip had been torpedoed and was sinking. Immediately a boat was put over with Third Lieutenant F. W. Brown in charge. [...] They soon returned with 15 of Cowslips men, along with one of Cowslips boats with 19 others. Boatswain P. W. Patterson and a fresh boat crew took Cowslips boat back, while Lieutenant Brown returned with Senecas boat. Patterson's boat took 20 survivors on board and towed seven others in a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy.</b> Brown's boat rescued the last 19 on board the sinking vessel. Only five officers and one enlisted man were lost, and they had been killed in the explosion. This rescue was beyond the call of Senecas duty as the escort vessels were to attack enemy submarines, but it was understood that when a ship was torpedoed the escorts were not expected to expose themselves to a similar fate by stopping to rescue the survivors. However, Captain Wheeler was commended for taking what was considered a [...] "justifiable risk".|$|E

50|$|Nonetheless such <b>small</b> <b>dinghies</b> {{have been}} termed 'gunter rigged' and 'gaff rigged' with free use of each term. It {{is likely that}} the {{fluidity}} of language allows both terms to be used with correctness for these small boats. For larger craft the terms tend to be more rigorously applied.|$|R
50|$|The oars {{used for}} {{transportation}} {{come in a}} variety of sizes. The oars used in <b>small</b> <b>dinghies</b> or rafts can be less than 2 metres long. In classical times warships were propelled by very long oars that might have several oarsmen per oar. These oars could be more than a dozen metres long.|$|R
50|$|Fairey Marine went on {{to produce}} three {{variants}} of the Atalanta, another 26 ft (8.1m) hull with a slightly shorter cockpit and more headroom called the Titania (named after another Fairey flying boat), a larger version -the Atalanta 31 (9.45m)- and the Fulmar a 20 ft(6.1m) version with a single lifting keel. <b>Small</b> <b>Dinghies</b> were built using similar techniques as tenders for the larger boats.|$|R

60|$|It {{was really}} a {{surprisingly}} <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> and it ran to and fro like a water-insect fussing noisily down there with immense self-importance. Within hail of us the hull of the Elbe lightship floated all dark and silent under its enormous round, service lantern; a faithful black shadow watching the broad estuary full of lights.|$|E
60|$|While she {{was trying}} to nerve herself for the {{struggle}} to land, she saw a boat leave the steamer's side. It was a very <b>small</b> <b>dinghy,</b> and there was only one man on board, but he waved his hand as if he understood her peril, and then rowed steadily to intercept her. This needed judgment: if he miscalculated the distance it would be impossible for him to overtake the sloop. And Evelyn could do nothing to help. She must concentrate her attention upon keeping her craft before the wind. If she jibed, bringing the big sail violently over with its head held fast would result in a capsize.|$|E

2500|$|In dinghy sailing, a {{practical}} distinction {{can be made}} between being knocked down (to 90 degrees) which is called a capsize, and being inverted, which is called being turtled. [...] <b>Small</b> <b>dinghies</b> frequently capsize in {{the normal course of}} use and can usually be recovered by the crew. [...] Some types of dinghy are occasionally deliberately capsized, as capsizing and righting the vessel again can be the fastest means of draining water from the boat.|$|R
50|$|The {{boat was}} built by Tim Millward, a physics teacher at Dulwich College, {{over a period of}} nine years and was {{completed}} in 1981. He originally took pupils from the school to sea in <b>small</b> <b>dinghies,</b> but saw the potential to expand his work with a larger, purpose built vessel. She is built of ferro-cement, and originally had wooden keel stepped masts, though the main was replaced with aluminium in the winter of 2015.|$|R

50|$|Cowper {{learned to}} sail on the Upper Thames, hiring catboats with friends {{when he was}} an {{undergraduate}} at Oxford. In 1870, in his final year at university, he spent his summer vacation in Auray, in Brittany in northern France, sailing a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> in the Gulf of Morbihan and out into Quiberon Bay.|$|E
5000|$|In 1897, {{author and}} {{journalist}} Stephen Crane {{was en route}} to cover a brewing revolt against Spanish rule in Cuba, when the ship he was on, the SS Commodore, sank {{off the coast of}} Florida. Crane escaped in a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> with several crewmen, and they eventually sighted and steered for the Mosquito Inlet Light. Crane used this experience in his short story [...] "The Open Boat".|$|E
50|$|Like {{in other}} Danish coastal communities, {{full-time}} fishery has diminished. The last occupationally operated coastal boat stopped by 2010, but boats being operated for fishing tourists remain. Most {{of the fishing}} has traditionally been longline fishing, especially for cod. The <b>smaller</b> <b>dinghies</b> used for part-time fishing remain. Fishery with shallow boats built for dragging on to the open beach was formerly practised at many places in Northern Jutland, but remains only in Vorupør, Lild Strand and, most intensely, in Thorup Strand.|$|R
50|$|Hennerton Backwater is {{a narrow}} {{backwater}} of the River Thames on the reach above Marsh Lock near {{the villages of}} Shiplake, Oxfordshire and Wargrave, Berkshire. Hennerton Backwater leaves the River Thames at the Unnamed Eyot, passing through Willow Marina, and rejoins just below Ferry Eyot. It is navigable by small boats from the downstream end for much of its length, but the bridge carrying Willow Lane over its upstream end has very limited clearance restricting passage to canoes and <b>small</b> <b>dinghies</b> even under favourable conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{sailboat}} {{is particularly}} vulnerable to capsizing or hitting a shoal or rock in the water when the steering fails. In heavy chop {{there is a lot}} of force on the rudder as it is pushed by the water. If the ship is flying a Spinnaker and it loses steering, the boat will most likely broach (head up into wind), which will, on most boats, cause a capsize in heavy weather. It is possible to sail <b>smaller</b> <b>dinghies</b> without a rudder using only sail adjustment.|$|R
50|$|The {{severity}} of a capsize {{depends on the}} size and design of a vessel. A <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> is designed to capsize and be righted by her crew. Yachts are typically built to right themselves even if heeled over beyond 90 degrees. However a large sailing ship will typically lose all stability at a smaller angle of heel, and will be vulnerable to downflooding and sinking if heeled beyond this point.|$|E
5000|$|The Miracle is a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy</b> {{sailboat}} popularized in the United Kingdom, {{and designed}} by Jack Holt — {{one of the}} last for the well-known designer. Holt brought sailing to the masses in the 1960s with his famous Mirror dinghy, and continued to produce designs such as the Enterprise, GP14, Cadet, Hornet, Pacer, Solo, and Streaker — many of which went on to become hugely successful dinghy classes.|$|E
50|$|In June 2013, FIDH {{provided}} {{legal assistance}} to two {{survivors of the}} 'left to die' boat: 72 migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa had left Libya in 2011 in a <b>small</b> <b>dinghy,</b> {{had run out of}} fuel and drifted 'for two weeks along one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world'. A complaint—with FIDH and 3 other NGOs as civil parties—was lodged against the French and Spanish military for failing to 'assist people in danger'.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Instant Boats" [...] {{developed}} by Phil Bolger use simplified framing and stitch-and-glue style plywood sheet joining and bulkhead gluing. Step-by-step building {{books about the}} boats and plans for many were sold by Harold Payson of Thomaston, Maine. They range from very <b>small</b> <b>dinghies</b> to power and sailboats 25 to 30 feet long. They are not necessarily designed for light weight, but like the original Mirror Dinghy, for simple construction. The plans predate CAD panel development software so the shapes are extremely simple in some cases.|$|R
40|$|Sydney's first European colonists {{clung to}} the {{coastline}} and looked to the harbour and the sea for survival. Early recreational sailing {{was a product of}} the city's function as a seaport town. Sailing has since adapted to reflect and contribute Sydney's changing culture and customs. Recreational sailing includes a broad spectrum of activities, from sailing <b>small</b> <b>dinghies</b> in sheltered waters to long distance ocean races and cruises sailed out of and in to Sydney Harbour.

5000|$|The Minto Sailing Dinghy {{began its}} {{life as a}} skiff for a 24 foot sloop built by Hugh Rodd at Canoe Cove on Vancouver Island. The sloop was {{commissioned}} by a Vancouver Island printer who had made some money from an investment in the Minto Mine in British Columbia, and hence he named the sloop [...] "Minto". After returning from World War II in 1946 Rob Wittlesey purchased the Minto and shortly thereafter traded the skiff, with [...] "MINTO RVYC" [...] carved into its transom, to Bob Schoen of Orcas Island for a <b>smaller</b> <b>dinghy.</b>|$|R
