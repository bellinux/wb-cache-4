The effect of spores age, storage time of <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> inoculum, doses of <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> inoculum to prepare culture inoculum, ages of culture inoculum and doses of culture inoculum (concentration of biomass) on citric acid production were evaluated.

Furthermore, the optimum dose of <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> inoculum was 20 % (v/v) to prepare culture (broth) inoculum. The culture inoculum of 48 hrs age with biomass concentration of 0. 82 × 0. 3 g/L showed the highest production of citric acid compared to other percentage of <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> inoculum and culture age for all doses of culture inoculum.

The <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> aliquot was prepared according to the following procedure; agar plates with the sporulation medium (4  g/L dextrose, 20  g/L agar, 4  g/L yeast extract and 10  g/L malt extract) were plated out with the prepared spore solution and incubated at 28  °C for 20 – 25  days. After the black spores were seen to spread on the surface of agar plates, 1  mL of sterilized water was added to the plates to harvest the <b>spore</b> <b>suspension,</b> and preserved in frozen stock (stored in 25  % glycerin at − 20  °C).

Plants were stored (maximum 48  h) at 4  °C until zoospores were released. Zoospores were released from fertile tips into filtered (0.22  µm) artificial seawater (ASW: Tropic Marin). The <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> was filtered into a beaker through 3 layers of nylon mesh (100, 50 and 20  µm) to remove debris. The beaker containing the <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> was plunged into ice, which concentrates the spores (spores swim towards {{the bottom of the}} beaker), which were pipetted into another beaker. This procedure was repeated and then the <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> was filtered through 2 layers of nylon mesh (20  µm pore size). The <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> was kept on a magnetic stirrer and the absorbance at 660  nm measured. The <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> was diluted with filtered (0.22  µm) ASW to a final concentration of 1.3  ×  104 spores/ml for holography, or 1.0  ×  106 spores/ml for standard settlement assays. As only one holographic setup was available, the spores used for the experiments were released at different times. For the FOTS surfaces spores were released 7  h after collection from the seashore, for PEG 21  h and for AWG 30.5  h. One dataset obtained on each of the respective surfaces has been analysed.

40|$|Spores of {{variants}} of Bacillus stearothermophilus {{were subjected to}} activating and lethal temperatures. <b>Spore</b> <b>suspensions</b> which were incubated longer contained {{a higher percentage of}} spores of the rough variant. The effect of sublethal heat on <b>spore</b> <b>suspensions</b> containing mixed variants (rough and smooth) was difficult to measure at sublethal temperatures (110 C), since the rough variant was not as heat-resistant. While the rough variant was activated in a shorter time, the smooth variant was not activated; when the smooth variant was activated, the rough was killed. A higher percentage of the smooth variant was forced into dormancy after being held at 50 C for 30 hr than the rough variant. When mixed populations were subjected to a lethal temperature (120 C), the curves only reflected the smooth variant. Since the curves which represented the smooth variant or mixtures containing the smooth variant were not linear, this was thought to be due to activation overbalancing the lethal effect.

40|$|Abstract. Effectiveness of {{insecticide}} {{protection of}} very early edible potato cultivars against potato beetle was assessed {{in the years}} 2005 - 2006. The research used Prestige 290 FS, Regent 200 SC and Spruzit 04 preparations, as well as Beauveria bassiana entomopathogenic fungus <b>spore</b> <b>suspension.</b> The selection of preparations for potato beetle control significantly diversified the amount and structure of potato tuber yield.

40|$|The {{germination}} of Bacillus cereus T <b>spore</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{is partially}} prevented by several inhibitors of trypsin-like enzymes. Leupeptin, antipain, and tosyl-lysine-chloromethyl ketone are effective inhibitors, whereas chymostatin, elastatinal, and pepstatin are inactive. A synthetic substrate of trypsin, tosyl-arginine-methyl ester, also inhibits germination. Its inhibitory effect decreases {{as a function}} of incubation time in the presence of spores and is abolished by previous hydrolysis with trypsin. Germinating, but not dormant, <b>spore</b> <b>suspensions</b> hydrolyze tosyl-arginine-methyl ester; its hydrolysis is insensitive to chloramphenicol, sulfhydryl reagents, and EDTA. A crude extract of germinated B. cereus spores contains a trypsin-like enzyme whose activity, as measured by hydrolysis of benzoyl-arginine p-nitroanilide, is sensitive to germination-inhibitory compounds such as leupeptin, tosyl-arginine-methyl ester, and tosyl-lysine-chloromethyl ketone. <b>Spore</b> <b>suspensions</b> exposed to the above inhibitors under germination conditions lose only part of their heat resistance and some 10 to 30 % of their dipicolinic acid content. Part of the germinating spore population becomes "phase grey" under phase optics. Based on a study of the inhibition of germination by protease inhibitors and the activity of a protease in germination spores and spore extracts, it is suggested that the activity of a trypsin-like enzyme may be involved in the mechanism of the breaking of dormancy in spores of B. cereus T...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Globally, the foliar {{phase of}} {{anthracnose}} {{is one of}} the most destructive diseases of sorghum. In most cases, anthracnose resistance screening relies on the use of a <b>spore</b> <b>suspension.</b> This method is usually conducted after sundown and when there is the possibility of dew formation the following morning. Using a <b>spore</b> <b>suspension</b> for sorghum anthracnose field evaluation in College Station, Texas over five years (1996, 1997, 1999 - 2001) yielded inconsistent linkage results and failed to identify any closely linked molecular markers. For large scale screening of sorghum germplasm for anthracnose (Colletotrichum sublineolum) resistance, plants are inoculated in the field or in the green house at either 30 d after planting or at the 8 - 10 leaf-stage. In field inoculation, the use of C. sublineolum-colonized sorghum grains was shown to be the most efficient and effective in identifying resistant sources. For effective, efficient, fast and accurate infection, approximately 10 - 20 seeds are placed in each plant leaf whorl and it takes about 16. 7 kg of colonized grains to cover a 0. 4 ha area. In the greenhouse, though colonized grains are equally effective, spray inoculation is preferred for easy and uniform coverage.
