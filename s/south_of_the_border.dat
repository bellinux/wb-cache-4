5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Dundee, Crumley began his {{football}} career with Junior club Harp, {{from where he}} moved into the senior ranks, spending the 1911–12 Scottish League season with Dundee Hibernian. He played in America for two seasons, then returned to Scotland where he kept goal for Central League team Arbroath before serving with the Royal Engineers during the First World War. He resumed his football career with a brief return to Dundee Hibs, then moved <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> to play for Swansea Town, initially in the Southern League and then for three seasons in the English Football League. This {{was followed by a}} year with Bristol City, two seasons with Darlington, whom he helped gain promotion to the Second Division, and three years with Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic where he finished his career.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 29, 1998 and on October 5, an area of convection along the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Lisa. The wave axis continued westward, and after crossing Central America a low-level circulation developed on October 13, about 170miles (275km) <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> between El Salvador and Guatemala. The system drifted northwestward, and as convection increased around the center a banding featured began to develop. At 0000UTC on October 15, the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The depression contained a large envelope of convective activity, and under favorable conditions including warm water, low vertical wind shear and good outflow, it gradually began to intensify. Initially, the exact direction of forward movement was somewhat uncertain, although a northwestward track was predicted. On the morning of October 15, visible satellite imagery suggested that the center of circulation was located northeast of the previous estimates. Thunderstorm activity organized close to the center by 1400UTC, and by 1800UTC the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lester.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy, Scotland invaded Northern England {{and took}} {{much of the}} land north of Durham. In the 1139 peace treaty that followed, Prince Henry of Scotland was made Earl of Northumberland and kept the {{counties}} of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria. These reverted to English control in 1157, establishing {{for the most part}} the modern England–Scotland border. The region also saw violence during the Wars of the Roses, including the decisive Battle of Wakefield, although the modern-day conception of the war as a conflict between Lancashire and Yorkshire is anachronistic – Lancastrians recruited from across Northern England, including Yorkshire, while the Yorkists drew most of their power from Southern England, Wales and Ireland. The Anglo-Scottish Wars also touched the region, and in just 400 years, Berwick-upon-Tweed – now the northernmost town in England – changed hands more than a dozen times. The wars also saw thousands of Scots settle <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> chiefly in the border counties and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Free traders, {{independent}} of the Hudson's Bay Company and outside its jurisdiction, developed extensive commerce with the United States, making Saint Paul the principal entrepôt and link {{to the outside world}} for the Selkirk Settlement. The trade developed by and along the trails connecting Fort Garry with Saint Paul stimulated commerce, contributed to the settlement of Minnesota and North Dakota in the United States, and accelerated the settlement of Canada {{to the west of the}} rugged barrier known as the Canadian Shield. For a time, this cross-border trade even threatened Canada's control of its western territories. The threat diminished after completion of transcontinental trade routes both north and <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> and the transportation corridor through which the trails once ran declined in importance. That corridor has now seen a resurgence of traffic, carried by more modern means of transport than the crude ox carts that once travelled the Red River Trails.|$|E

5|$|Hawkins {{was born}} in Finley, New South Wales to Jack and Jenny Hawkins. He {{grew up in the}} New South Wales region of Finley as the middle child among three other siblings. He {{attended}} Finley High School and played for the Finley Football Club before making the move <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> to begin boarding at Melbourne Grammar School. Hawkins' footballing ability was recognised early on when he was selected to play first XVIII football for the school whilst still in year ten, when many of his teammates were completing their final year of schooling at year twelve. Hawkins kicked four goals on debut for the school and his performances up forward soon received attention from AFL recruiting teams. By the time he had reached his final school year he was rewarded with joint captaincy of the football team alongside Hawthorn draftee Xavier Ellis. He was also selected in the Associated Public Schools (APS) team to play the Associated Grammar School (AGS) selected football team in the traditional annual clash of schools, where he won best on ground honours for his performance.|$|E
5|$|The English {{campaign}} against Scotland was planned {{on a massive}} scale, with a force of around 23,350 men. Edward advanced through Lothian towards Edinburgh, but Robert the Bruce declined to meet him in battle, drawing Edward further into Scotland. Plans to resupply the campaign by sea failed, and the large army rapidly ran out of food. Edward was forced to retreat <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> pursued by Scottish raiding parties. Edward's illegitimate son, Adam, died during the campaign, and the raiding parties almost captured Isabella, who was staying at Tynemouth {{and was forced to}} flee by sea. The King planned a fresh campaign, backed by a round of further taxes, but confidence in Edward's Scottish policy was diminishing. Andrew Harclay, instrumental in securing Edward's victories the previous year and recently made the Earl of Carlisle, independently negotiated a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce, proposing that Edward would recognise Robert as the King of Scotland and that, in return, Robert would cease to interfere in England. Edward was furious and immediately executed Harclay, but agreed to a thirteen-year truce with Robert.|$|E
