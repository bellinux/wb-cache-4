It is a safety feature, {{designed to allow}} systems to continue operating, {{or at least to}} not fail catastrophically, {{in the event of a}} <b>system</b> <b>breach.</b> It does this by stopping or greatly restricting the flow of hydraulic fluid through itself if the flow exceeds a threshold.|$|E
40|$|The cash {{accounting}} system for VAT has been implemented in Romania as of 1 January 2013 and now turns {{one year of}} application in Romania. Since its implementation the system has sparked controversy, being harshly criticised by professional accountants in Romania and elsewhere. Criticisms mainly concerned the following issues: no possibility to choose to apply the <b>system,</b> <b>breach</b> of the VAT neutrality principles, maximum period of 90 days to postpone the chargeability of VAT for unpaid deliveries, while VAT deduction was subject to payment {{of the value of}} goods and services invoiced without specifying any term. In this article we would like to examine {{the extent to which the}} legislative changes that came into effect as of 1 January 2014 improve the {{cash accounting}} system for VAT in Romania. We will also analyse to what extent the system applied in 2013 has brought advantages/disadvantages to the economic entities in Romania based on a survey carried out on a heterogeneous sample of companies in the county of Gorj, regarded as nationally representative. Finally, we intend to compare the cash accounting system for VAT in Romania with its UK counterpart. ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated safety of G 207, a doubly mutated (deletion of both γ 134. 5 loci, insertional inactivation of UL 39) {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) for patients stereotactically inoculated in enhancing portions of recurrent malignant gliomas. We have now determined safety of two inoculations of G 207, before and after tumor resection. Inclusion criteria were histologically proven recurrent malignant glioma, Karnofsky score ≥ 70, and ability to resect the tumor without ventricular <b>system</b> <b>breach.</b> Patients received two doses of G 207 totaling 1. 15 × 109 plaque-forming units with 13 % of this total injected via a catheter placed stereotactically in the tumor. Two or five days later, tumor was resected en bloc with catheter in place. The balance of G 207 dose was injected into brain surrounding the resection cavity. Six patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme were enrolled. Two days after the second G 207 inoculation, one patient experienced transient fever, delirium, and hemiparesis, which entirely resolved on high-dose dexamethasone. No patient developed HSV encephalitis or required treatment with acyclovir. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence suggestive of antitumor activity is reported. Evidence of viral replication was demonstrated. G 207 appears safe for multiple dose delivery, including direct inoculation into the brain surrounding tumor resection cavity...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{is seen as}} {{the future}} {{automobile}} energy storage media due to its inherent cleanliness upon oxidation and its ready utilization in fuel cell applications. Its physical storage in light weight, low volume systems is a key technical requirement. In searching for ever higher gravimetric and volumetric density hydrogen storage materials and systems, it is inevitable that higher energy density materials will be studied and used. To make safe and commercially acceptable systems, {{it is important to understand}} quantitatively, the risks involved in using and handling these materials and to develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies to handle unforeseen accidental events. To evaluate these materials and systems, an IPHE sanctioned program was initiated in 2006 partnering laboratories from Europe, North America and Japan. The objective of this international program is to understanding the physical risks involved in synthesis, handling and utilization of solid state hydrogen storage materials and to develop methods to mitigate these risks. This understanding will support ultimate acceptance of commercially high density hydrogen storage system designs. An overview of the approaches to be taken to achieve this objective will be given. Initial experimental results will be presented on environmental exposure of NaAlH{sub 4 }, a candidate high density hydrogen storage compound. The tests to be shown are based on United Nations recommendations for the transport of hazardous materials and include air and water exposure of the hydride at three hydrogen charge levels in various physical configurations. Additional tests developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials were used to quantify the dust cloud ignition characteristics of this material which may result from accidental high energy impacts and <b>system</b> <b>breach.</b> Results of these tests are shown along with necessary risk mitigation techniques used in the synthesis and fabrication of a prototype hydrogen storage system...|$|E
40|$|The philosopher Hans Kelsen is {{most famous}} for his "pure theory of law", expounded in his book of that name. For most of his {{scholarly}} life, Kelsen argued that, {{as part of the}} pure theory, two norms that contradict one another within the same legal <b>system</b> <b>breach</b> the philosophical principle of exclusion of contradictions and therefore cannot both be valid at the same time. On some occasions he went further and argued that neither of two such norms can be valid. Famously, Kelsen changed to the opposite opinion later in life. Both Kelsen's original and his ultimate positions on the principle of exclusion of contradictions shed light on an area of law that he never considered: general anti-­avoidance rules in income tax law, known as "GAARs". GAARs are increasingly common in tax statutes. One cannot argue that GAARs give rise to what logicians call contradictions. Nevertheless, from a practical and substantive point of view the effect of a GAAR could loosely be described as akin to a contradiction of norms, in logical terms a breach of the principle of exclusion of contradictions. For instance, a GAAR may prevent a taxpayer from relying on a relieving provision in a tax statute, on the grounds that such reliance amounts in the circumstances to tax avoidance. For this kind of reason, people criticise GAARs because they are seen as breaching the principle of certainty, one of the foundations of the rule of law. General principles in Kelsen's work shed light on the way in which GAARs operate and on {{the way in which they}} fit into the legal systems of which they form part. Although the effect of a GAAR has something in common with the effect of a breach of the principle of exclusion of contradictions, the unusual nature of tax law justifies the existence of GAARs.

50|$|The petitioners contend, {{among other}} things, {{that the state}} laws {{requiring}} or permitting use of the Regents' prayer must be struck down {{as a violation of}} the Establishment Clause because that prayer was composed by governmental officials {{as a part of a}} governmental program to further religious beliefs.
