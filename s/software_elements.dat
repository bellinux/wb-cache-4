50|$|Diamond v. Diehr, , was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{which held}} that controlling {{the execution of}} a physical process, by running a computer program did not preclude patentability of the invention as a whole.

Diehr was the third member of a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions on the patent-eligibility of computer software related inventions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-This {{paper was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the post buckling behaviour of moderately thick-walled filament-wound carbonâ€“ epoxy composite cylinders under external hydrostatic pressure through finite element analysis for under water vehicle applications. The winding angles were [Â± 30 / 90] FW, [Â± 45 / 90] FW and [Â± 60 / 90] FW. Finite <b>element</b> <b>software</b> ANSYS 14. 0 were used to predicted the buckling pressure of filament-wound composite cylinders. For the finite element modeling of the composite cylinder, an eight-node shell element is used.
