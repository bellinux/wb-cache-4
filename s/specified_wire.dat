40|$|Abstract. Accurate {{high-frequency}} interconnect {{models are}} needed for the precise estimation of signal delays, crosstalk, and energy losses in complex on-chip communication structures, such as hierarchical bus ar-chitectures and networks-on-chip. In this chapter we introduce a com-putationally-efficient wide-bandwidth characterization method based on an incremental extrapolation of S-parameters for arbitrary interconnect structures. Our method defines a systematic set of a priori parameter ex-tractions and performs on-demand multistep extrapolations for intercon-nect segments with <b>specified</b> <b>wire</b> length, widths, spacings, metal layer, and neighboring routing information. Experimental evaluations show a maximum absolute error of less than 2 · 10 − 2 (magnitude) and 7 degrees (angle) between our model and an industry-standard full-wave field sim-ulator for a 90 -nm CMOS process. We consistently enforce the passivity of the admittance matrices for each set of measured or generated pa-rameters to eliminate the possible errors introduced during parameter measurements and extrapolation. Circuit-level simulations with the ex-trapolated model show a maximum signal delay error of less than 12. 5 % across multiple metal layers and wire configurations. ...|$|E

The combination of both concepts allows <b>specifying</b> <b>wiring</b> on basis of logical units and their relations. Hence, the concepts overcome general wiring problems that currently exist in cloud orchestration tools. In addition to that, the introduction of facets improves the re-use of components across different applications...|$|R
50|$|Unlike earlier Ethernet {{standards}} using broadband and coaxial cable, such as 10BASE5 (thicknet) and 10BASE2 (thinnet), 10BASE-T {{does not}} specify the exact type of wiring to be used, but instead specifies certain characteristics that a cable must meet.

This dynamic early binding is realized by Data Mapping Template (DMT), which is specified by extended context free grammar and implemented by pushdown automaton with output.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a fast and {{accurate}} delay estimation method for buffered interconnects. The interconnect wire is modeled by the transmission line model which is more accurate and efficient than lumped circuit model. For the interconnect <b>wire,</b> we <b>specify</b> the <b>wire</b> shape {{to be of the}} form f(x) = ae−bx. Note that if we let b = 0, our work is reduced to uniform wire case. By using first three poles in the transfer function, we derive analytical expressions for calculating delay at any threshold voltage under a finite ramp input. The expressions involved in calculating coefficients in the transfer function are also analytical. We use k-factor equations to estimate delays for buffers. Since the k-factor equations require a loading capacitance for delay computation, we use the effective capacitance technique introduced in [17] to calculate the effective capacitance for each interconnect wire which is connected to a buffer. Therefore, our delay calculation for buffered interconnects is analytical and thus very efficient. Our experiments show that signal waveforms estimated by our method are very close to SPICE’s results. I...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{networks}} are <b>specified</b> by unique <b>wiring</b> patterns, however, {{it is not}} clear how these patterns are encoded into topographic maps of synaptic connections. We found networks in vitro and in vivo, where multiple-neurites converge and intersect at single sites non-randomly. At these sites, the density and activity of axonal terminals increased exponentially with the number of converging neurites. Multiple-neurite intersections were formed by a directed growth of neurites toward neurite intersections, they facilitated target switching by axons, and their frequency was elevated by activity through NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. Thus, clustering and strengthening of synaptic connections by activity-reinforced multiple-neurite convergence may serve to imprint information onto wiring patterns and synaptic maps...|$|R

Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still <b>specified</b> for point-to-point <b>wiring</b> and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of reflow soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} continuous wire-sizing optimization for delay minimization and ringing control. The optimization {{is based on}} a fast and accurate delay estimation method under a finite ramp input, where an analytical expression is also derived to estimate overshoot/under shoot voltage. In this paper, we <b>specify</b> the <b>wire</b> shape to be of the form 99 9999 the Elmore delay model suggest that exponential wire shape is effective for delay minimization. The relevant transmission line equations are solved by using Picard-Carson method. The transient 	 	 the actual delay (delay) is minimized, or the wiring area is minimized subject to a delay bound. At the same time, the overshoot /undershoot voltage is bounded to prevent false switching. Our method for delay estimation is very efficient. In all the experiments we performed, it is far more accurate than the Elmore delay model and the estimated delay values are very close to SPICE's results. We also find that in determining the optimal shape which minimizes delay, the Elmore delay model performs as good as the our method in terms of the minimum actual delay it achieves, i. e. the Elmore delay model has high fidelity. However, in determining the optimal shape which minimizes area subject to a delay bound, the Elmore delay model performs much worse than our method. We also find that the constraint for overshoot/undershoot control does affect optimization results for both delay and area minimization objectives. 1...|$|R
40|$|Requirements for {{development}} of a Transformerless Power Conditioning Subsystem (TPCS) that will meet utility, manufacturer, and customer needs are detailed. Issues analyzed include current utility guidelines, safety and grounding issues that appear as local codes, various kinds of TPCS connections that can be developed, dc injection, and a brief survey of TPCS circuit topologies that will meet requirements. The major result is that a finite time exists for control operation before dc injection into the distribution transformer causes customer outage (on the order of seconds). This time permits the control system to sense a dc injection condition and remove the TPCS from the utility system. Requirements for such a control system are <b>specified.</b> A three <b>wire</b> connection will ensure balanced operation for customer loads and two wire connections caused average value dc to be injected into single phase loads. This type of connection also allows for the lowest array voltage. The conclusion is that requirements for a TPCS can be determined {{and that there are}} not showstopping issues preventing implementation. The actual design and topology of the TPCS was left for further study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Wire ropes {{are used}} world wide for various applications. However all sizes {{and types of}} {{construction}} require an effective method for attaching the ropes to other structures. One popular termination technique, particu-larly for larger diameter ropes, consists of using a steel conical socket into which a polyester resin mix is poured, creating a joint which secures the individual wires of the rope. The UK Health and Safety Laboratory were contracted by the UK Health and Safety Executive- Offshore Safety Division {{to carry out a}} series of large scale impact tests on 25 mm compacted stranded wire rope (this rope size is commonly used for offshore cranes and diving bell handling equipment) to determine if rope's performance was affected by strain rate. It was noted early in the testing programme that under dynamic loading, the rope socket often failed, whilst under static loading the wire rope always failed. The experimental data showed that the force and energy absorbed when the socket failed was considerably lower than the minimum <b>specified</b> for the <b>wire</b> rope. This has particular significance for the offshore industry where the launch/recovery of diving bells often results in large dynamic forces being applied to the rope and ancillary equipment. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} and durability of reinforced, hollow-fill concrete block work is mandated by design codes, which are interpreted by designers and implemented {{on the site}} by the trades. The eventual performance of the block work is dependent upon an appropriate combination of specification, and on-site execution and quality control, and any inadequacy in these steps will result in suboptimal performance, be {{it in terms of}} wall strength or longevity. The accuracy with which reinforcements bars are located both in relation to each other, and to the faces of the wall is a major determinant in this regard. Traditionally, reinforced block work is <b>specified</b> using conventional <b>wire</b> tying wherever continuity or proximity is required. A new product called Blockaid has been developed to replace wire tying. The author was commissioned to determine the effect that the use of Blockaid would have upon both the speed of erection and quality control during construction of a reinforced concrete block retaining wall. The research revealed that the use of Blockaid resulted in a completed wall structure that met the requirements of AS 3700 - 2001 Masonry Structures in terms of achieving correct reinforcement positioning, consistently achieving greater accuracy than conventional best practices. Moreover it achieved a construction speed comparable with commonly encountered, low quality practices, and resulted in construction times 20 % faster than best practice, wire tied techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A novel {{framework}} for non-Manhattan channel routing considering crosstalk and wire length reduction is proposed. To handle crosstalk and wire length reduction problem, an improved non-Manhattan router in the gridded routing model is developed, and a novel rerouting algorithm based on segment-rerouting technique and layer reassignment is presented. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves very good results. Key words crosstalk; wire length; track; channel routing; non-Manhattan; layer reassignment With the {{recent advances in}} VLSI fabrication technology, the device sizes have shrunk blow 0. 1 μm. Due to the scaling down of device geometry in deep-submicron technologies, the crosstalk between adjacent nets {{has become a major}} concern in high performance VLSI circuit design. Increased crosstalk can cause signal delays, logic hazards, and even malfunctioning of circuits, and thus controlling the level of crosstalk in a chip has become an important task for IC designers. It’s well known that channel routing {{plays an important role in}} VLSI design automation at the physical design level of VLSI circuits. In order to generate the non-rectilinear routing structure, Burman [1] et al. introduces the concepts of λ-geometryP P.

40|$|Finally, {{to obtain}} a long network {{lifetime}} without sacrificing crucial aspects of quality of service (area coverage, sensing reliability, and network connectivity) in wireless sensor networks, we present sensibility-based sleeping configuration protocols (SSCPs) with two sensing models: Boolean sensing model (BSM) and collaborative sensing model (CSM). (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Furthermore, we extend the traditional reliability analysis. Wireless networks inherit the unique handoff characteristic which leads to different communication structures of various types {{with a number of}} components and links. Therefore, the traditional definition of two-terminal reliability is not applicable anymore. We propose a new term, end-to-end mobile reliability, to integrate those different communication structures into one metric, which includes not only failure parameters but also service parameters. Nevertheless, it is still a monotonically decreasing function of time. With the proposed end-to-end mobile reliability, we could identify the reliability importance of imperfect components in wireless networks. The emerging mobile wireless environment poses exciting challenges for distributed fault-tolerant (FT) computing. This thesis develops a message logging and recovery protocol on the top of Wireless CORBA to complement FT-CORBA <b>specified</b> for <b>wired</b> networks. It employs the storage available at access bridge (AB) as the stable storage for logging messages and saving checkpoints on behalf of mobile hosts (MHs). Our approach engages both the quasi-sender-based and the receiver-based message logging techniques and conducts seamless handoff in the presence of failures. Then we extend the analysis of the program execution time without and with checkpointing in the presence of MH failures from wired to wireless networks. Due to the underlying message-passing communication mechanism, we employ the number of received computational messages instead of time to indicate the completion of program execution at an MH. Handoff is another distinct factor that should be taken into consideration in mobile wireless environments. Three checkpointing strategies, deterministic, random, and time-based checkpointing, are investigated. In our approach, failures may occur during checkpointing and recovery periods. Chen Xinyu.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an introductory freshman experience course, “Introduction to Building Systems” that {{was seven years}} in the making and meets several critical goals for this engineering department. As one of their very first courses, this two-unit course is taken in the Fall quarter by every incoming freshman, which translates into an annual enrollment of 50 to 120 students, depending on the year. Meeting twice a week, the first meeting is in a large lecture format where all of the students are together and are introduced to the topic for the week which includes structural systems, timber, concrete, steel, earth/foundations, building envelopes, electrical systems, and mechanical systems. The second meeting is a two-hour activity where the students are sub-divided into separate sections of not more than 24 students. During these hands-on activities, students place and test concrete anchor bolts, build and test wooden connections, weld steel plates and test their strength, complete an exercise using funicular shapes, use the digital fabrication lab and 3 -D printers to create and test a truss structure, create a video on a past building system failure or disaster, measure slopes and follow the drainage of a <b>specified</b> area, <b>wire</b> an electrical circuit, and tour the electrical/mechanical systems of a major building. The course is team-taught by a tenured faculty member and the department head. Industry support from Hilti and Simpson StrongTie provides materials and expertise for two of the activities. University support assists with the welding, digital fabrication, and building tour activities. Some of the activities become round-robin stations to further sub-divide the students into 8 or 12 person groups to allow every student to physically participate. The culminating exercise involves the design and construction of a structure using K’nex toys where students experience the design-bid-build project delivery method by role playing the architect, project manager and contractor. The course provides the opportunity to introduce engineering ethics and professional responsibility to the freshman. The students participate in a learning-style inventory to better understand how they learn, thus introducing the goal of life-long learning. The course deliberately tries to develop the camaraderie of a cohort at the earliest possible stage and allows students to feel that {{they are part of the}} department and the major. It also provides motivation and excitement for the profession that lies ahead while the students are working their way through calculus, physics and architecture studios. A review of the literature addresses how this course aligns with and differs from other existing introductory experience courses. Refinements in the course have been made based on formalized student assessment data. Over time, the effect of the course will be assessed through retention data...|$|R
