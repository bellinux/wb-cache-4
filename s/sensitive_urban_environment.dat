The underground passes under the scarp perpendicular in the area of Dynasy Street 6, in Down-town district. The electrical resistivity imaging was performed for recognition of the geological structure and a potential land slide surface or zone. The gradient system was used during the prospection. In these analyses, the longitudinal section was 40 m long, and the depth of survey amounted to 6 m. In the case of the 200 m long transverse section, the resulted depth of survey was 30 m. The geophysical image of the longitudinal section,does not contain loosening soil zones,which could indicates lip surface. Next, total station measurements, which were tied to the archival geodetic observations’ results, were carried out. The aim of the measurements was to verify the activity of the horizontal and vertical displacements. The TBM excavation process led to summary vertical displacements up to approx. 24 mm and horizontal displacements amounting to approx. 13 mm. To sum up, the current land surveys reveals minor under ground line’ s construction impact on the scarp displacement. Nevertheless, the <b>sensitive</b> <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> requires further monitoring, especially that the operation loads can result in displacement rate change...|$|E

40|$|The pre-injection method, or {{injections}} {{ahead of}} the excavation face in underground construction can in many situations offer significant advantages. This is particularly the case in difficult ground conditions like water ingress or mechanically poor ground or soil, in which pre-injections can contribute to avoid mishaps and serious delays. In <b>sensitive</b> <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> the need to manage water ingress into tunnels under construction as well as avoiding collapses are crucial factors for the successful completion of a project. Modern pre-injection technology involves the design of methods adapted to the encountered situation. This includes proper drilling techniques and drilling geometry for the best delivery of the grout into the ground, determination of relevant production criteria during the injection, {{as well as the}} employment of state-of-the-art injection products like special microcements and colloidal silica. Modern cost-effective material technology for pre-injections in underground construction aims to achieve the desired as fast as possible, hence reducing the down time during the excavation as much as possible In recent years several difficult tasks in tunnelling have been resolved by using modern microcement technology in combination with liquid colloidal silica. Improvement of the technical performance of rapid curing microcements, by using controlled and precise addition of accelerators have made the microcement injection technology far more versatile than before.

40|$|The Australian water {{industry}} is facing two major challenges: {{a rise in}} water demand due to a growing population {{and a decrease in}} rainfall availability due to a drying climate. This situation has triggered a re-evaluation of traditional water schemes and promoted consideration of alternatives for sustainable urban water management. One possibility is to replace drinking water usage in garden and outdoor irrigation with non-potable groundwater. This could save almost half of the water supplied in the residential sector, which is the biggest consumer of scheme water in most Australian cities. A major hurdle for the success of such fit-for-purpose groundwater schemes can be the lack of the resident’s participation and support. Currently there are uncertainties about the dynamic nature of individual’s attitudes in terms of satisfaction and accepting behaviours towards the fit-for-purpose water use. This can cause ambiguity in planning and implementation of such projects. The main purpose of this thesis is to address the following specific research questions: What are the factors that determine residential satisfaction with and behaviours towards the fit-for-purpose groundwater system? and What are the implications of such water system for community, water utilities and urban planners? These questions have been addressed through a quasi-experimental study utilizing two northern suburbs in Perth metropolitan: Ridgewood and “The Green”. “The Green” is selected as an experimental suburb and Ridgewood is selected as a control suburb, which is a standard metropolitan suburb having the usual main drinking water system. The use of non-drinking groundwater through the dual water supply system in “The Green” began in 2008 alongside the main water scheme. A broad spectrum of parallel literature from many disciplines was drawn upon to inform the research. Concurrent preliminary informal conversations with local residents and a number of field observations were helpful in refining and contextualising the research hypotheses regarding the determinants of residential satisfaction with the fit-for-purpose groundwater supply system in the context of water sensitive urban development. An exploratory mixed method approach was adopted starting with qualitative preliminary interviews with local residents to inform the development of a survey instrument. This was followed by the administration of the survey questionnaires at household level to collect quantitative data to measure the relationship among variables and test a model of residential satisfaction. The survey data and the secondary data about residential water consumption were analysed to develop a workable model for residential satisfaction with and behaviour towards the dual water supply system and water <b>sensitive</b> <b>urban</b> <b>environment.</b> Finally, qualitative information during stakeholder interviews, meetings, and seminars was used to interpret the planning implications of the model and behavioural responses towards the water system and urban development. The research results indicated that the majority of residents (70 %) are satisfied with the nondrinking groundwater supply system in their home and neighbourhood. In “The Green”, the household drinking water consumption was reduced by 40 % compared to the metropolitan average; however, excessive garden watering exemptions for new garden establishment caused 30 % more water usage in “The Green” than the metropolitan average. This study found that the major components of residential environment satisfaction were the neighbourhood, neighbours, and home. Home satisfaction in “The Green” was determined mainly by home attributes and the garden satisfaction, which in turn was dependent upon garden attributes and satisfaction with the groundwater system. In this way, groundwater satisfaction had an indirect impact on home satisfaction mediated by garden satisfaction. The major determinants of groundwater satisfaction were: positive perceptions of operational issues, and risk of groundwater use (negative relationship), and preference for continuation of the groundwater system after its trial period. The major research findings are explained in Chapter Six, Seven, and Eight. The dynamic nature of community attitudes and community behaviours towards the fit-for-purpose water projects at urban settings were explored, and the planning and development consequences of the implementation of the alternative water systems were explained. The results of this study are highly applicable for water providers, urban planners, and community developers in promoting the successful implementation as well as improvement of fit-for-purpose water systems from a policy perspective. This thesis equally contributes to building knowledge and understanding of residential satisfaction and its relationship to innovative dual water systems in water sensitive urban environments. It facilitates the sustainable management and planning of urban water resources. The research also demonstrates the need to integrate general models of community satisfaction with specific water system attitudes to provide an indication of the role of water supply systems in the overall success of water sensitive developments...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{drainage}} {{infrastructure is}} generally designed to rapidly export stormwater {{away from the}} <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> to minimize flood risk created by extensive impervious surface cover. This deficit is resolved by importing high-quality potable water for irrigation. However, cities and towns at times face water restrictions in response to drought and water scarcity. This can exacerbate heating and drying, and promote the development of unfavourable urban climates. The combination of excessive heating driven by urban development, low water availability and future climate change impacts could compromise human health and amenity for urban dwellers. This paper draws on existing literature to demonstrate the potential of Water <b>Sensitive</b> <b>Urban</b> Design (WSUD) to help improve outdoor human thermal comfort in urban areas and support Climate <b>Sensitive</b> <b>Urban</b> Design (CSUD) objectives within the Australian context. WSUD provides a mechanism for retaining water in the urban landscape through stormwater harvesting and reuse while also reducing urban temperatures through enhanced evapotranspiration and surface cooling. Research suggests that WSUD features are broadly capable of lowering temperatures and improving human thermal comfort, and when integrated with vegetation (especially trees) have potential to meet CSUD objectives. However, the degree of benefit (the intensity of cooling and improvements to human thermal comfort) depends on a multitude of factors including local environmental conditions, the design and placement of the systems, {{and the nature of}} the surrounding urban landscape. We suggest that WSUD can provide a source of water across Australian <b>urban</b> <b>environments</b> for landscape irrigation and soil moisture replenishment to maximize the urban climatic benefits of existing vegetation and green spaces. WSUD should be implemented strategically into the urban landscape, targeting areas of high heat exposure, with many distributed WSUD features at regular intervals to promote infiltration and evapotranspiration, and maintain tree health. status: publishe...|$|R

The urban fringe is a complex and uncertain environment in which to manage threatened species with the intersection of fragmented natural habitats, built environments and human populations generating novel, poorly understood interactions. In this context, management frameworks must incorporate ecological processes {{as well as social}} considerations. Here, we explore how biodiversity <b>sensitive</b> <b>urban</b> design might improve the fate of the golden sun-moth, and threatened species generally, in <b>urban</b> fringe <b>environments.</b> We: (i) developed an expert-informed Bayesian Belief Network model that synthesizes the current understanding of key determinants of golden sun-moth population viability at sites experiencing urbanizing pressure; (ii) quantified the nature and strength of cause-effect relationships between these factors using expert knowledge; and (iii) used the model to assess expectations of moth population viability in response to different combinations of management actions. We predict that adult survival, bare ground cover and cover of resource plants are the most important variables affecting the viability of golden sun-moth populations. We also demonstrate the potential for biodiversity <b>sensitive</b> <b>urban</b> design as a complementary measure to conventional management for this species. Our findings highlight how expert knowledge may be a valuable component of conservation management, especially in addressing uncertainty around conservation decisions when empirical data are lacking, and how structured expert judgements become critical in supporting decisions that may help ameliorate extinction risks faced by threatened species in <b>urban</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological {{studies have}} found that {{individuals}} who live in urban areas are at increased risk of developing psychosis. However it is unknown whether exposure to <b>urban</b> <b>environments</b> exacerbates psychotic symptoms in people who have a diagnosed psychotic disorder. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the psychological and clinical effects of exposure to one specific deprived <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> on individuals with persecutory delusions. It was predicted that the <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> would affect emotional and reasoning processes highlighted in a cognitive model of persecutory delusions and would increase paranoia. METHOD: Thirty patients with persecutory delusions were randomised to exposure to a deprived <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> or to a brief mindfulness relaxation task. After exposure, assessments of symptoms, reasoning, and affective processes were taken. Thirty matched non-clinical participants also completed the study measures to enable interpretation of the test scores. RESULTS: In individuals with persecutory delusions, exposure to the <b>urban</b> <b>environment,</b> rather than participation in a mindfulness task, increased levels of anxiety, negative beliefs about others and jumping to conclusions. It also increased paranoia. The individuals with persecutory delusions scored significantly differently from the non-clinical group on all measures. CONCLUSIONS: For individuals with psychosis, spending time in an <b>urban</b> <b>environment</b> makes them think more negatively about other people and increases anxiety and the jumping to conclusions reasoning bias. Their paranoia is also increased.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>environments</b> are {{challenging}} to model {{because they are}} both very large and very diverse. The size of the environment makes capturing the details of every structure prohibitive, leaving us with only sparse information. Photogrammetric reconstruction attempts to build 3 D structures but is often not robust and requires manual input, thus {{making it difficult to}} scale to large areas. Procedural modeling of <b>urban</b> <b>environments</b> provides a means for quickly creating architecture, but it does not address populating the database of urban features and it does not use real-world information to mimic actual urban areas.
