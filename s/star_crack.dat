40|$|Realizing and {{understanding}} {{the effects of the}} near-Earth space environment on a spacecraft during its mission lifetime is becoming more important with the regeneration of America's space program. Included among these potential effects are the following: erosion and surface degradation due to atomic oxygen impingement; ultraviolet exposure embrittlement; and delamination, pitting, cratering, and ring formation due to micrometeoroid and debris impacts. These effects may occur synergistically and may alter the spacecraft materials enough to modify the resultant crater, <b>star</b> <b>crack,</b> and/or perforation. This study concentrates on modelling the effects of micrometeoroid and debris hypervelocity impacts into aluminum materials (6061 -T 6). Space debris exists in all sizes, and has the possibility of growing into a potentially catastrophic problem, particularly since self-collisions between particles can rapidly escalate the number of small impactors. We have examined the morphologies of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) impact craters and the relationship between the observed impact damage on LDEF versus the existing models for both the natural (micrometeoroid) and manmade (debris) environments in order to better define these environments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{range of}} glass-based {{structures}} of various constructions and thicknesses {{have been subjected}} to impact loading by stone chippings similar to those found on the roadside. The failure modes have been examined in an attempt to elucidate the failure mechanisms and processes in these systems. Initial tests generated radial and lateral cracking at velocities well above that required to initiate damage; this form of cracking was not observed again since attention was focused on the critical velocity for damage initiation. Thinner structures were found to fail primarily by <b>star</b> <b>cracking,</b> a flexure induced rear surface failure. Thicker structures generally failed by partial cone cracking, a contact induced front surface failure. The addition of a polymeric layer to the glass monolith had no effect on the failure mechanisms, while the addition of an inner layer of glass (yielding a laminated construction) had a secondary influence on the impact resistance of the structure. This was clearly apparent for intermediate outer glass thicknesses, where an increase in the inner glass thickness causes the stiffness of the panel to increase sufficiently to alter the failure mode and thus cause an increase in the critical velocity for damage initiation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{relatively}} unexplored types of surface defects on silicon nitride balls – ‘star’ type defects and ‘missing material’. The main {{objective of this}} research is to determine failure modes and the critical or tolerable defect sizes for rolling bearing applications. This is achieved by means of both experimental and numerical techniques (for finding crack initiation location). A modified four-ball machine is used for the rolling contact fatigue experiments on star features and missing material defects (both during manufacturing process and artificially produced) on the surface of silicon nitride balls. Experiments are conducted at different loads (3. 8 - 4. 8 GPa), lubrication types, specific speed (7500 rpm) and temperature conditions (75 °C) to find rolling contact fatigue limitations in relation to these defects. Laser micromachining is used to produce precise holes and trenches to simulate missing material. Two different types of bearing grade silicon nitride are tested to determine tolerance and failure modes in rolling contact fatigue. Scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy and white light interferometry are used for surface analysis and topography. Post-experiment analysis in the star feature experiments has shown that <b>star</b> like radial <b>cracks</b> are prone to develop into missing material by internal fracture over the extent of the star in lubricated rolling contact. Lubrication quality or film thickness and orientation of the pre-existing cracks to the rolling direction influenced the damage process and severity. In the case of missing material experiments, samples with different diameters (50 - 100 μm), depths (5 - 50 μm) and shape (right cylindrical, conical and oblique cylindrical) were tested. It has been confirmed that, apart from the main experimental parameters like applied pressure, cavity diameter and depth, parameters such as cavity base profile, shape and cavity location and orientation on the contact track are important for rolling contact fatigue of silicon nitride material. Replica produced cavity base profiles to investigate failure reasons. Cross-sectioning also gave very good insight of surface and subsurface features both before and after testing (including un-failed specimens). Incipient spalls on tested samples provided the information to understand the failure mechanism (mainly spalling) in the material. FEM is used for finding stress fields at surface and sub-surface positions and ultimately predicting the location and position of crack initiation. 2 D (Axi-symmetric and plane strain) and 3 D models are developed to compare the results, whereas static versus quasi static analysis is presented to examine the effect of rolling. Models are verified using classical contact theory. Hydrostatic pressure effects are also successfully modeled using the finite element analysis approach. Fluid elements modeling on the solid interface of the cavity produced a different stress field and have indicated the location of crack initiation...|$|R
