5|$|Admiral Hipper {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine from the Blohm & Voss {{shipyard}} in Hamburg. Her keel was laid on 6 July 1935, under construction number 246. The ship was launched on 6 February 1937, and was completed on 29 April 1939, {{the day she was}} commissioned into the German fleet. The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder, who had been Franz von Hipper's chief of staff during World War I, gave the christening speech and his wife Erika Raeder performed the christening. As built, the ship had a <b>straight</b> <b>stem,</b> though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow. A raked funnel cap was also installed.|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a <b>straight</b> <b>stem</b> and a rounded stern, but her hull was {{otherwise}} unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, as {{was done in the}} earlier , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost less than that of any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly a knot slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Hellmuth Heye {{was given}} {{command of the}} ship at her {{commissioning}}. After her commissioning in April 1939, Admiral Hipper steamed into the Baltic Sea to conduct training maneuvers. The ship also made port calls to various Baltic ports, including cities in Estonia and Sweden. In August, the ship conducted live fire drills in the Baltic. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the ship was still conducting gunnery trials. She was briefly used to patrol the Baltic, {{but she did not}} see combat, and was quickly returned to training exercises. In November 1939, the ship returned to the Blohm & Voss dockyard for modifications; these included the replacement of the <b>straight</b> <b>stem</b> with a clipper bow and the installation of the funnel cap.|$|E

25|$|The Napoleon III was {{originally}} {{built as a}} paddle steamer by Thames Ironworks, London (engines by Ravenshill & Salked, London) in late 1865 for the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (French Line). She was a 3,950 gross ton ship, length 365.9ft with 45.9ft beam, <b>straight</b> <b>stem,</b> two funnels, two masts, iron construction, paddle wheel propulsion and a cruising speed of 11.5 knots.|$|E
25|$|To {{address these}} issues, Grampus, {{although}} similar in design {{to the traditional}} New England schooner, also differed in significant ways. She had a hull about two feet (0.6 meter) deeper than traditional schooners of similar length, giving her greater stability. She had a <b>straight</b> <b>stem,</b> rather than a raking one, and her stern was narrower and more raked, with her after portion approximating a V-shape, all changes which increased her hull length at the waterline. Her foremast was considerably shorter than her mainmast, and her rigging was designed {{so that she could}} carry a double-headed rig forward that allowed her to use a smaller jib that could be furled upon the approach of heavy weather and a fore staysail running from the foremast to near her stem. The result was a ship able to achieve higher sailing speeds, able to make more efficient use of her sails, with no need for crew members to work on her bowsprit during bad weather, and less likely to capsize in heavy seas.|$|E
500|$|Blücher {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine from the Deutsche Werke {{shipyard}} in Kiel. Her keel was laid on 15 August 1936, under construction number 246. The ship was launched on 8 June 1937, and was completed slightly over two years later, on 20 September 1939, {{the day she was}} commissioned into the German fleet. The commanding admiral of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Naval Station), Admiral Conrad Albrecht, gave the christening speech. Frau Erdmann, widow of Fregattenkapitän Alexander Erdmann, former commander of , performed the christening. As built, the ship had a <b>straight</b> <b>stem,</b> though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow increasing the overall length to [...] A raked funnel cap was also installed.|$|E

500|$|The German navy {{considered}} the ships {{to be poor}} sea boats; they were bow-heavy when fully equipped and very [...] "wet" [...] {{as high as the}} bridge. This problem was mitigated to some extent by replacement of the <b>straight</b> <b>stem</b> with an [...] "Atlantic bow" [...] to both Gneisenau and Scharnhorst in January and August 1939 respectively, though use of the [...] "A" [...] turret remained restricted in heavy seas. The ships had rear problems as well; their stern was also frequently [...] "wet" [...] and the ships were very slow entering a turn. They always required assistance from tugboats in shallow waters. With the rudder hard over, the ships lost over 50% speed and heeled over more than 10°. During trials, the ships heeled as much as 13° at hard rudder.|$|E
500|$|Bismarck {{was ordered}} {{under the name}} Ersatz Hannover ("Hannover {{replacement}}"), a replacement for the old pre-dreadnought , under contract [...] "F". The contract was awarded to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, where the keel was laid on 1 July 1936 at Helgen IX. The ship was launched on 14 February 1939 and during the elaborate ceremonies was christened by Dorothee von Löwenfeld, granddaughter of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the ship's namesake. Adolf Hitler made the christening speech. Fitting-out work followed the launch, during which time the original <b>straight</b> <b>stem</b> was replaced with a raked [...] "Atlantic bow" [...] {{similar to those of}} the s. Bismarck was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940 for sea trials, which were conducted in the Baltic. Kapitän zur See Ernst Lindemann took command of the ship at the time of commissioning.|$|E
500|$|Prinz Eugen {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine from the Germaniawerft {{shipyard}} in Kiel. Her keel was laid on 23 April 1936, under construction number 564 and cover name Kreuzer J. She was originally to be named after Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the Austrian victor of the Battle of Lissa, though considerations over the possible insult to Italy, defeated by Tegetthoff at Lissa, led the Kriegsmarine to adopt Prinz Eugen as the ship's namesake. She was launched on 22 August 1938, in a ceremony attended by the Governor (Reichsstatthalter) of the Ostmark, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who made the christening speech. Also present at the launch were Adolf Hitler, the Regent of Hungary, Admiral Miklós Horthy (who had commanded the battleship [...] from 24 November 1917 to 1 March 1918), and his wife Magdolna Purgly, who performed the christening. As built, the ship had a <b>straight</b> <b>stem,</b> though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow. A raked funnel cap was also installed.|$|E

500|$|Gneisenau {{was ordered}} as Ersatz Hessen as a {{replacement}} for the old pre-dreadnought , under the contract name [...] "E." [...] The Deutsche Werke in Kiel was awarded the contract, where the keel was laid on 6 May 1935. The ship was launched on 8 December 1936, after which fitting-out work was begun. The ship was completed in May 1938 and commissioned for sea trials on the 21st, under the command of Kapitän zur See (KzS) Erich Förste. The trials revealed a dangerous tendency to ship considerable amounts of water in heavy seas. This caused flooding in the bow and damaged electrical systems in the forward gun turret. As a result, {{she went back to the}} dockyard for extensive modification of the bow. The original <b>straight</b> <b>stem</b> was replaced with a raised [...] "Atlantic bow." [...] A diagonal cap was fitted to the smoke stack to keep the main mast free of smoke. The modifications were completed by September 1939, by which time the ship was finally fully operational.|$|E
500|$|Scharnhorst {{was ordered}} as Ersatz Elsass as a {{replacement}} for the old pre-dreadnought , under the contract name [...] "D." [...] The Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven was awarded the contract, where the keel was laid on 16 July 1935. The ship was launched on 3 October 1936, witnessed by Adolf Hitler, Minister of War Generalfeldmarschall Werner von Blomberg, and the widow of Kapitän zur See Schultz, the commander of the armored cruiser , which had been sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands during World War I. Fitting-out work followed her launch, and was completed by January 1939. Scharnhorst was commissioned into the fleet on 9 January for sea trials, which revealed a dangerous tendency to ship considerable amounts of water in heavy seas. This caused flooding in the bow and damaged electrical systems in the forward gun turret. As a result, {{she went back to the}} dockyard for extensive modification of the bow. The original <b>straight</b> <b>stem</b> was replaced with a raised [...] "Atlantic bow." [...] A raked funnel cap was also installed during the reconstruction, along with an enlarged aircraft hangar; the main mast was also moved further aft. The modifications were completed by November 1939, by which time the ship was finally fully operational.|$|E

40|$|Nine Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trials, {{situated}} {{north of}} latitude 6 I 0 N, were studied. The frequency of trees with <b>straight</b> <b>stems</b> {{and one or}} more spike knots was evaluated at a tree age of 27 - 29 years. A model was developed describing geographical variation and was based on 19 provenance trials {{from different parts of}} Sweden. North of latitude 6 I 0 N, an average of 30 per cent of the <b>stems</b> were <b>straight</b> enough to produce a first-class bottom log of sawtimber. In addition, 47 per cent of the trees had no spike knots up to 5 m height. Significant variation between provenances was found in stem straightness and spike knot frequency in most trials. Provenances transferred southwards were straighter and had fewer spike knots than the corresponding local provenance. The frequencies and numbers of <b>straight</b> <b>stems</b> and trees without spike knots were higher at 1. 25 m spacing than at 2. 0 m spacing. The general models for geographical variation indicate that the highest number of <b>straight</b> <b>stems</b> without spike knots may be found between latitudes 58 " and 65 "N and at altitudes below 250 m...|$|R

2500|$|Vowels are {{constructed}} from {{only a handful}} of basic symbols, but they can be combined with other vowel forms and semi-vowels to represent the full repertoire of diphthongs and triphthongs used in the language. Vowels cannot stand alone or begin a syllable, so the silent consonant, ອ, which can function as a vowel in its own right, is used as a base when spelling a word that begins with a vowel sound. The names of the vowels are just as easy as saying sala (ສະຫລະ, [...] ) before the vowel sign. Some vowels have unique names, and these are ໃ- (ໄມ້ມ້ວນ, , rolled stem), ໄ- (ໄມ້ມາຽ, , unwound stem), [...] -ົ (ໄມ້ກົງ, [...] , <b>straight</b> <b>stem),</b> -ັ (ໄມ້ກັນ, [...] , ear stem), -ຽ (ວິຣາມ, [...] ), and -ໍ (ນິກຄະຫິດ, [...] ). [...] Although a short dash is used on this page to represent the consonant, in standard Lao orthography a small x symbol is used for this purpose. Traditionally this was a simple, stylized, sans-serif x and it was included in Lao fonts before unicode became widespread. Unicode does not make it available as part of the Lao alphabet set, and a lower-case sans-serif x is often used instead.|$|E
