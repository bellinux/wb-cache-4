2500|$|Major {{efforts were}} made to improve access to housing and health care, while the {{government}} also attempted to tackle working-class under-achievement in schools by reinforcing the comprehensive system, modernising the curriculum and reducing streaming. As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for [...] "solidarity contracts" [...] whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken. In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance. In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>funds,</b> which had been elimated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{describe}} the process used by French experts {{for developing the}} entire scope of healthcare benefits to {{be covered by the}} health insurance fund. This procedure was presented to the high-level management of the National <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fund</b> in Dar es-Salaam in June 2003. Method: This study was undertaken in Tanzania in June 2003 and modeled the cost of health insurance in the National <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fund</b> (its ambulatory component exclusively) by using all the local demographic, epidemiologic and economic data available. Results: Since 1993, Tanzania has transferred the cost of healthcare from the state towards some of the beneficiaries of the public medical sector. The National <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fund,</b> a mandatory public agency of <b>social</b> <b>security,</b> has decided to implement a health insurance program. According to our model and our assumptions, the cost of the ambulatory component of health insurance would utilize approximately 20 to 60 % of available resources. Conclusion: The National <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fund</b> has to make clear choices concerning the scope of healthcare benefits it wants to cover: only outpatient care or both outpatient and inpatient coverage? Capitation or fee for service? The National <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fund</b> also needs to develop reliable databases in order to better understand the population it covers and the behavior of those who use the care. By instituting health insurance, the National <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fund</b> will help break the vicious circle of "disease-poverty" and contribute to improving the level of Tanzania’s development...|$|R

40|$|China’s {{pension system}} {{is facing a}} large gap {{of more than one}} {{trillion}} RMB. The investment efficiency of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>fund</b> therefore receives widespread attention in academic circles. We collected data of stocks held by the Chinese National Council for <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Fund</b> (CNCSSF) from 2004 to 2012 to research the stocks’ investment efficiency, distinguishing between direct investment by the CNCSSF and entrusted investment by fund companies. The results indicate that both components of the Chinese <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Fund</b> investment have efficiency drawbacks. Direct investment by the CNCSSF does not obtain excess returns, while entrusted investment reaches an annual excess return of 4. 32 percent because more private information is available to fund companies than to the CNCSSF during asset allocation. Further analyses of this paper find, however, that the Chinese <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Fund</b> has a significant market-stabilizing effect, which is almost three times stronger than the market-stabilizing effect of entrusted investment. In general, entrusted investment performs better than direct investment with regard to investment efficiency, while direct investment performs better in terms of market stabilization...|$|R
