5|$|Following Jardine's appointment, {{a meeting}} was {{arranged}} with Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr {{and his two}} fast bowlers Larwood and Voce at London's Piccadilly Hotel. Jardine explained his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl accurately on leg stump and make the ball rise up into the body of the batsman. The bowlers agreed that they could, and that it might prove effective, but Jardine stressed that bowling accurately was vitally important, or Bradman would dominate the bowling. Larwood believed that Jardine saw Bradman as his main target and wished to attack him psychologically as well as in a cricketing <b>sense.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, other Australian batsmen were also discussed. Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with mixed success. Jardine also visited Frank Foster who had toured Australia in 1911–12 to discuss field placings appropriate to Australian conditions. Foster had bowled leg theory on that tour with his fielders placed close in on the leg-side, as had George Hirst in 1903–04. During the second half of the season, the team to tour Australia was announced. The selection of four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers was very unusual at the time, and it was commented on by the hosts' media, including Bradman. The selection of Eddie Paynter, who did not have a strong record, to replace the ill Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji was very likely a choice of Jardine. He had a history of good performances against Yorkshire, and Jardine considered that a player's record against northern counties was a good indication of his potential at international level.|$|E

30|$|From the {{two cases}} above, one can notice that it is {{necessary}} to assist spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> TSU with additional spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> RSU based on BER measurement.

30|$|In {{regard to}} the {{assessment}} of rangeland productivity, remote-sensing products provide large areal cover, having higher temporal return frequencies, and greater spectral resolution compared to traditional rangeland field sampling. Measuring productivity {{is one of the}} most commonly used applications of remote <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> global to regional scales in rangeland studies. Using remote <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> global scales can provide insights into potential trajectories of change into the future (Reeves et al. 2015).|$|R

25|$|At first, {{autonomous}} navigation {{was based}} on planar sensors, such as laser range-finders, that can only <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> one level. The most advanced systems now fuse information from various sensors for both localization (position) and navigation. Systems such as Motivity can rely on different sensors in different areas, depending upon which provides the most reliable data at the time, and can re-map a building autonomously.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the transmission ca-pacity of wireless networks when packet retransmissions are al-lowed. We consider networks modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process operating under different {{medium access control}} schemes, namely unslotted and slotted ALOHA, and CSMA with carrier <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> the transmitter and with carrier <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> the receiver. For these scenarios, we derive analytical expressions to compute {{the maximum number of}} retransmissions attempts that leads to the optimal transmission capacity. Numerical results based on our formulation show that CSMA with carrier <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> the receiver (asynchronous transmissions) reaches the highest maximum transmission capacity when traffic intensity is low, while slotted ALOHA (synchronous transmissions) is the best choice when traffic intensity is high.

25|$|The {{discussion}} was apparently intended to improve upon {{the account of}} Aristotle's friend and teacher Plato in his Socratic dialogue, the Theaetetus. But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing koina is an active thinking process in the rational {{part of the human}} soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this sensus communis, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} reasons why some {{families}} feel {{that it would be}} more beneficial for the father to be the primary caregiver while the mother works outside the home. The decision to use a stay-at-home dad arrangement is most commonly due to economic reasons. At the same time, women are progressing into higher-paying jobs. There are now financial ramifications in deciding whether the mother or father should become the stay-at-home parent. In cases where the woman is the higher-paid parent, it makes more economic sense for her to continue to work while the man takes on the caregiver role. It also makes <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> times the mother's job offers health benefits for the family whereas the father's does not.

The original last scene was dropped, and a new one was written so it would make <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> that point in the series.
