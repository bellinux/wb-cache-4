5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen, slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most enemies, whom serve to deter Crash's progress. Enemies with deadly topsides cannot be jumped on, while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam. Enemies with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> them.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a modernized {{version of}} Thumbelina {{appears in the}} Disney Junior series, Goldie and Bear. In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink and <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't {{wait for the next}} time she babysits.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{version of the}} Pickett-Hamilton fort {{consists}} of two cylinders of pre-cast concrete each with one end closed. The slightly smaller of the two cylinders <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the larger and they are kept apart by small guard rollers on the moving part that engaged with grooves. The structure is buried so that the overhanging top of the smaller cylinder lies flush with the ground. Closed in this position the pillbox is inconspicuous and allows aircraft and other vehicles to safely drive straight over it.|$|E
25|$|Some ambush predators build traps {{to capture}} their prey. Lacewings are a flying insect {{in the order}} Neuroptera. In some species, their larval form, known as the antlion, is an ambush predator. Eggs are laid in the earth, often in caves or under a rocky ledge. The {{juvenile}} creates a small, crater shaped trap. The antlion hides under a light cover of sand or earth. When an ant, beetle or other prey <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the trap, the antlion grabs the prey with its powerful jaws.|$|E
25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate pressure chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary valve seat as the piston <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the intermediate pressure chamber. The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the medium pressure chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E

5000|$|Many female players use [...] "sliding shorts", {{otherwise}} known as compression shorts in other sports. These shorts help to protect the upper thigh when <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> a base. [...] "Sliders" [...] may also be worn for similar protection. These are somewhat padded shinguards that extend usually from the ankle to the knee of the wearer and wrap {{all the way around}} the leg(s). They protect the shin, calf, etc. from getting bruised or damaged while <b>sliding</b> <b>into</b> homeplate and make it much more comfortable to <b>slide</b> <b>into</b> the plate. Most male players use long, baseball-style pants. However, some female players now wear a shorter version of baseball pants.|$|R

500|$|... "Touch My Body" [...] rides a {{relatively}} restrained slow-dance groove, with some light, orchestral-synth flourishes thrown in. The rhythm is almost completely carried by an effortless keyboard bump, the easygoing repetitiveness of which eventually wears the listener down, and {{sets up a}} delicate frame for Carey to sing around. She pulls back when the song picks up the pace, and Carey keeps it simple here, playing with tempos rather than range. Indeed, she almost quietly <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the chorus. [...] "If you run around and brag about this secret rendezvous, I will hunt you down", she sings, letting the last line trail off. But you don't necessarily believe her, as the feel is more playful that sinful.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar {{in this respect}} to [...] "Crazy in Love".

[...] As the song opens, Beyoncé introducing the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, {{which is the first}} instrument to enter, <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.|$|E
500|$|Creator Arthur Miller {{described}} the role as {{one for a}} large character in a small physical body and noted he had difficulty finding the right actor at first. Loman's Brooklyn accent {{is part of the}} challenge of the role. In 1950, Miller described Loman as a man who upon hearing society's [...] "thundering command to succeed" [...] found himself staring at a failure in the mirror. The Amazon.com editorial review by Ali Davis states that [...] "Willy Loman is a salesman desperately hustling for a living even as he <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> old age." [...] Rovi Corporation's Matthew Tobey describes him as an everyman who has to cope with the sudden realization that he is over the hill and does so with a fantasy world in which he remains important. The Huffington Posts theater critic, Wilborn Hampton, describes the role as [...] "one of the most complicated characters in dramatic literature", making it a draw for the great actors.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} aspect of Johnson's recordings was his mastering of the bottleneck guitar technique, which was immediately influential on Robert Johnson and Howlin' Wolf. He punctuated his selections with tonal control and sense of timing, often using the guitar {{as a part of}} his harmonic phrasing, particularly on [...] "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground". By most accounts, including one by the reputable blues guitarist Blind Willie McTell, Johnson used a knife as a slide, but other claims by Harris and the bluesman Thom Shaw also state he used a thumb pick or brass ring on his recordings. The music historian Steve Halt said of Johnson's style: [...] "opposed to other bottleneck artists he varies the speed of his vibrato drastically, often speeding up as he <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> a note. He {{is also one of the}} few bottleneck artists with the ability to consistently sound 3 or 4 discreet melody notes upon striking a string once, a skill that reflects uncanny left-handed strength, accuracy and agility".|$|E
500|$|The UK {{edition of}} Are You Experienced opened with [...] "Foxy Lady", a track that, with the {{exception}} of a few overdubs, was recorded in one session at CBS. Hendrix wrote the song about Heather Taylor, a highly desirable London socialite who later married the Who's Roger Daltrey. It begins with the fade-in of an F note that Hendrix is bending-up to F while applying generous finger vibrato. Using his guitar's control knob, he slowly increases volume until an audio feedback loop develops and he <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the song's dominant Fm7 chord. Hendrix used a combination of natural amplifier overdrive and fuzz box effects units to create the song's razor-sharp guitar tone. Its blues–inspired solo—his fourth since arriving in England—used pentatonic scales while showcasing his innovative approach to melody; by exploiting the increased sustain created by overdriving his amplifiers, he moved seamlessly between the middle and high registers with a fluid, singing tone. While author Peter Doggett compared its slow beat to Memphis soul, David Stubbs described the track as a prototype for heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.|$|E
2500|$|The {{removal and}} fitting of {{cylinder}} liners in large engines requires {{the use of}} dry ice to chill and thus shrink the liner so that it freely <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the engine block. When the liner then warms up, it expands, and the resulting interference fit holds it tightly in place. [...] Similar procedures may be used in fabricating mechanical assemblies with a high resultant strength, replacing the need for pins, keys or welds.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the myths}} tested involve purported {{household}} scenarios, so all episodes begin with a disclaimer against attempting the experiments seen on the series; most episodes also feature a second warning halfway through the running time. These disclaimers are not broadcast on SBS in Australia, in the Netherlands, Discovery Mix in Sweden, the Discovery Channel in Denmark, or on the Prime and Sky Discovery Channels in New Zealand. Often, they are presented with an element of humor, such as Savage wearing a padded suit as Hyneman hits {{him in the chest}} with a baseball bat, or Hyneman explaining that he and Savage are professionals before Savage <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> view and crashes into a barrier while saying, [...] "Don't try this at home!".|$|E
2500|$|Wentzel {{was often}} {{asked how he}} managed to put his {{subjects}} at such ease while photographing them. [...] He observed that he read as many ethnographic studies of a region as possible, to avoid making culturally insensitive errors. He also tried {{to pick up a}} few words of the local language, and be as courteous as possible. He said that he often made friends with the people he was photographing. [...] "After we got to be friends, I would just back up and take the picture. That was a good part of my technique," [...] he said. He also brought a small musical box along with him, which helped to ease suspicion and win friends (especially among children). His choice of equipment also influenced his style. Wentzel told an interviewer in 1999 that, while in Africa, he used only lightweight 35 mm film cameras such as a Nikon or an Olympus OM-2. For more formal portraits, however, he used an 85mm portrait lens and Kodachrome film. When printing his photographs, he preferred the Ilfochrome process (which turned photographic <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> prints) and the gelatin silver print process.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was some}} {{disagreement}} over Wilfork's role in causing the fumble. In the Patriots' postgame press conference, Wilfork recalled: [...] "I was just fighting pressure with pressure—knowing, seeing the ball went that way. I'm just taught to fight pressure with pressure, so I just started fighting back and knocked him into Sanchez and {{it created a}} fumble." [...] In NBC's television broadcast, immediately following the play, color commentator Cris Collinsworth said that [...] "Vince Wilfork just threw Brandon Moore into Mark Sanchez," [...] a view simultaneously echoed on the Patriots radio call by color analyst Scott Zolak. Moore disagreed with Collinsworth: [...] "when somebody <b>slides</b> <b>into</b> the back of you, you're going to fall. That happens a lot in general. You don't know what's going on (behind you)." [...] Responding to Moore, Collinsworth qualified his description {{in a phone interview}} with ESPN, saying that Wilfork could see the play develop, so [...] "instead of trying to go around Moore, he pushed him back into the play and made the whole thing happen." [...] A New York Daily News columnist sided with Moore, stating that [...] "A second look at the play shows Moore holding his own against Wilfork and moving, if anything, mostly forward." ...|$|E
