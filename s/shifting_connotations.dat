In The House of the Seven Gables (1851) and The Blithedale Romance (1852) Nathaniel Hawthorne {{uses the}} symbol of mesmerism in varied and often {{contradictory}} ways {{not only as a}} lens for examining the <b>shifting</b> <b>connotations</b> of the pseudoscience but also as a way of interrogating and, at times, reconfiguring gender roles and social hierarchies within the nineteenth-century. Using a variety of primary and secondary source materials as the basis of a nuanced analysis of mesmerism within Hawthorne???s texts, this thesis contends that Hawthorne ultimately uses the pseudoscience not only as a site of reflection and re-envisioning of the concepts of masculinity and female agency, but also problemizes the availability of truth not only to the author figure, but to the reader and society as a whole.

The article continues by echoing Chauncey's observation that a subsequent <b>shift</b> in <b>connotation</b> occurred later on. The pre-1950s focus was on entrance into [...] "a new world of hope and communal solidarity" [...] whereas the post-Stonewall Riots overtone was an exit from the oppression of the closet. This change in focus suggests that [...] "coming out of the closet" [...] is a mixed metaphor that joins [...] "coming out" [...] with the closet metaphor: an evolution of [...] "" [...] specifically referring to living a life of denial and secrecy by concealing one's [...] sexual orientation. The closet metaphor, in turn, is extended to the forces and pressures of heterosexist society and its institutions.|$|R

Being able to find out what people feel about a specific topic, be it a marketed product, a public person or a political issue, represents a very interesting application for a large class of actors, from the everyday product and service consumers, to the marketing and political analysts or decision-makers. In this paper we will diverge from the standard goal of subjectivity analysis i. e. computing the polarity of an opinionated sentence. Instead, we will try to detect those sentences of a given text that might have different connotations when put in different contexts. We describe a system called CONAN, initially designed to be a subjectivity analyzer, but recently extended towards detecting possible <b>connotations</b> <b>shifts.</b> ...|$|R

It is {{not only}} in the mode which has now been pointed out, namely by gradual {{inattention}} to a portion of the ideas conveyed, that words in common use are liable to <b>shift</b> their <b>connotation.</b> The truth is, that the connotation of such words is perpetually varying; as might be expected from the manner in which words in common use acquire their connotation. A technical term, invented for purposes of art or science, has, from the first, the connotation given to it by its inventor; but a name which is in every one’s mouth before any one thinks of defining it, derives its connotation only from the circumstances which are habitually brought to mind when it is pronounced. Among these circumstances, the properties common to the things denoted by the name, have naturally a principal place; and would have the sole place, if language were regulated by convention rather than by custom and accident. But besides these common properties, which if they exist are certainly present whenever the name is employed, any other circumstance may casually be found along with it, so frequently as to become associated with it in the same manner, and as strongly, as the common properties themselves. In proportion as this association forms itself, people give up using the name in cases in which those casual circumstances do not exist. They prefer using some other name, or the same name with some adjunct, rather than employ an expression which will call up an idea {{they do not want to}} excite. The circumstance originally casual, thus becomes regularly a part of the connotation of the word.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a sociolinguistic {{study of the}} {{phenomenon}} of 'fanspeak', the use of Japanese words by English-speaking fans of Japanese manga and anime, in computer mediated communication. The internet has enabled fans {{from all over the}} world to communicate with each other and form an online subculture of sorts. The abundant use of loanwords from Japanese in this online discourse is striking. Using data collected from various manga and anime related websites and message boards, and interviews with the fans who use this kind of language, this thesis aims examine the characteristics of fanspeak from multiple angles. First its origins and social functions are discussed; why does fanspeak exist? Next, the semantics of fanspeak are analyzed; are the borrowed words used in the same meaning as in Japanese, or have their meanings and <b>connotations</b> <b>shifted</b> in the adaptation for use in English? Lastly, the morphological properties of fanspeak are addressed; what kind of grammatical transformations do Japanese words undergo in their adaptation? By addressing these issues I hope to clarify to what extent Japanese fanspeak has been incorporated into English internet discourse, and why and how this is diversifying the subcultural language of English speaking manga and anime fans...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} loyalty {{is the central}} pillar of Germanic heroic society has so often been put forward by generations of {{well-known}} scholars that it is considered a truism. Aside from few statements tracing {{the origin of the}} principle back to Tacitus’s time, definitions from this concept and its implications are taken for granted a rarely made explicit. Nevertheless it has always been held that the value of Germanic heroic society are reflected, unchanged since Tacitus time, in the whole body of Old English poetry in spite of the admixture of Christian elements. It has been illustrated how Anglo Saxon poets use Christian elements in their poems. Pre-Christian elements or Germanic concepts are shaped differently in the various poems so that their original meaning is destroyed and major <b>connotations</b> <b>shift</b> to fit in with Christian teaching. Still the opinion that the heroic code of conduct with its pre-Christian values based on the concept of loyalty has survived unchanged since Tacitus time in what it is commonly called Anglo-Saxon secular heroic poetry has hardly been contested. Although the presence of Christian elements has been recognised, scholar have persistently emphasised the Germanic elements of this body of literature, treating it also as a homogeneous entity of writing. Here again the various way in which Old English poets have handled the Germanic heroic concept of loyalty in an essentially Christian background have failed to be shown. This discussion will go through an introduction to the concept of loyalty, its nature, and its development from the sources, its use in literature, and the criticism that has been going on around this theme...|$|R

D University of Connecticut [2014] Abstract Algerian history, falsified and {{distorted}} by different Algerian regimes, obscured {{the nature of}} many contemporary problems, while creating a climate of confusion about the present and anxiety about the future. Beneath Algeria’s relative calm during the uprisings of the “Arab Spring”, violence and social dissociation, continue to threaten the society, showing that deep-seated historical conflicts in Algeria remain unsolved. While historians and political scientists attempt to clarify the contemporary situation from a scientific perspective, Francophone Algerian novelists have addressed these issues by drawing on mythological paradigms. Through the rewriting of Greco-Latin, Judo- Christian and Islamic mythology, they attempt to provide an alternative {{point of view on}} the nature of contemporary social and political conflicts and to uncover hidden facts of the past that have had an impact on today’s situation. However, during the process of rewriting in a new historical and cultural environment, the structure and meaning of myth is transformed dramatically. These transformations increase, on one hand, the semantic uncertainty of a text by transcending clear-cut distinctions between concepts. On the other hand, they put into question well-established truths, thus allowing novelists to raise new themes tormenting Algerian society today. The question asked by this study concerns the relationship between the process of mythological transformation in Algerian writing and the new representations which emerge of Algerian history and its Mythological contemporary reality. The main hypothesis of this research is that the transformation of myth is due to the fusion in the literary text with other narrative elements, such as popular beliefs, cults, legends and rites. The interaction of sometime contradictory systems of value provided by these elements increases the complexity of mythological structure and extends the interpretative potential of the myth, while infusing its symbols with new power. Using the theory of bricolage, elaborated by Lévi-Strauss and taken up by R. Bastide and A. Mary, this study will examine the modes of transformation of myth in the novels of three Francophone Algerian authors, Rachid Mimouni, Malika Mokaddem and Mohamed Dib. It will explore how the <b>shift</b> in the <b>connotations</b> of concepts such as “violence” and “the return to origins” allows the authors to raise taboo questions and reverse the official version of Algerian history...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{claims that}} modernity has {{developed}} an increased sensibility to spatial experience: we have learned to attend to it in new ways. It suggests, however, that the pre-conditions for this existed in the changing spatial concepts of the 19 th century and can be traced, {{as well as in}} that century’s new perceptual sciences, in its popular entertainments, and in particular, in the novel spatial manipulations that became characteristic of magical entertainments during the period of the study (1850 - 1930). These, which harnessed natural phenomena for their effects, made no claim to supernatural agencies to explain them and yet created a sense of wonder in their time. Today the manipulation of fascinating visual and visceral experience forms part of art and design practice. Spatial experience, which can be delightful, or make us laugh, or make us fall into a meditative silence, has become a medium through which something more can be said. The ways in which such experiences may be felt today as poetic, significant, joyful or moving still draw on many of the spatial concepts that informed the imagination of the later 19 th century. The thesis identifies some of the factors that shaped these concepts, traces how their <b>connotations</b> <b>shifted</b> and regrouped during the years of the study, and discusses some of the different ways in which they are received today. The spatial concepts are considered in relation to today&# 039;s discipline of interior design; a discipline which today is differentiated from interior decoration or from architecture by being a discipline of performance and experience, rather than of composition or style. Performance and experience, in this context, refer to the nuanced totality of the entanglement of these things in this place with these people at this moment in time, rather than any designed &# 039;experience&# 039; or spectacular event. The project focuses on the years 1850 - 1930, since these were both the &# 039;golden age&# 039; of stage magic, and also the period from which interior design emerged as a distinct profession. The thesis examines the proposition that the practice of interior design could be described as &# 039;the practice of natural magic, an attempt to arrange life for maximum emotional and practical power&# 039;. Since the 19 th century stage illusionist was also a practitioner of natural magic, I compare examples from both disciplines, suggesting that when these examples are considered as &# 039;spatial entertainments&# 039;, they offer insights into both the practical mechanisms that made them work, and also into the ideas, desires, pleasures and uneasinesses of a spatial nature that made them potent and fascinating to their contemporary audiences. By opening a different set of histories from the ones that are more usually considered relevant to design students or scholars today, the thesis offers other ways in which &# 039;interiors&# 039; - their histories, their construction, their existence - may be considered, and suggests different antecedents and different futures for interior design, beyond current popular understandings of it as a discipline that is primarily para-architectural...|$|R
