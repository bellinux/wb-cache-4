5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} organized into a tropical depression {{off the coast}} of Nicaragua on October 9. After drifting to the southeast, it turned to the north-northwest and organized into a tropical storm on October 10. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>to</b> crossing western Cuba, Floyd accelerated to the northeast, and attained hurricane status late on October 12. It passed through the Florida Keys before entraining cooler, drier air from a stationary frontal boundary. Its convection became very disorganized, and Floyd weakened back to a tropical storm early on October 13 to the southeast of Miami; the storm crossed the Bahamas, and becoming an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by the frontal boundary on October 14.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 12. It tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection, and <b>subsequent</b> <b>to</b> moving through the southern Windward Islands it crossed northern Central America. Convection increased on June 20 as the wave entered the southwestern Caribbean. Under the influence of southeasterly flow from developing Hurricane Celia in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the south-southwesterly flow from a mid- to upper-level trough over the Gulf of Mexico, the area of disturbed weather tracked generally north-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea while spreading across Cuba and southern Florida. On June 24, a mid-level circulation developed near the Yucatán Channel, and shortly thereafter satellite image loops indicated deep convection with some cyclonic rotation near the western tip of Cuba. A reconnaissance aircraft flight was dispatched late on June 24 into the system to determine if it developed into a tropical cyclone, though the flight did not observe evidence of a closed low-level circulation. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>to</b> the flight, satellite imagery indicated a low-level circulation was forming, and on June 25 ship and buoy data confirmed the system developed into Tropical Depression One while located about 235miles (375km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center incorrectly classified the system as Tropical Depression Two due to an earlier subtropical storm.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to organize, and <b>subsequent</b> <b>to</b> {{the development of a}} low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Virginia, Jeanne transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by September 29 near Washington, D.C. In Wilmington, Delaware, {{the storm}} spawned an F2 tornado. Across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, {{moisture from the}} storm produced light to heavy rainfall, with totals of over 7inches (175mm) near Philadelphia and Nantucket. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>to</b> becoming extratropical, the remnants of Jeanne turned eastward, exited into the Atlantic Ocean, and merged with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2. Continuing northward, it struck Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa early on September 3 as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall, and <b>subsequent</b> <b>to</b> turning to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over Sierra Madre Occidental. The remnants entered southern Arizona on September 4 and tracked around an upper-level low. After entering Nevada on September 5, the remnants of Isis passed into Oregon before dissipating in Idaho on September 8.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, <b>subsequent</b> <b>to</b> which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E

5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} persecution, and prebendalism {{have affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and <b>subsequent</b> <b>to</b> independence in 1960.

Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E
