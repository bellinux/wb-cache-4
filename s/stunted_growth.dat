5|$|Within-crop diversity, a {{specific}} crop {{can result from}} various growing conditions, for example a crop growing in nutrient-poor soil {{is likely to have}} <b>stunted</b> <b>growth</b> than a crop growing in more fertile soil. The availability of water, soil pH level, and temperature similarly influence crop growth.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere with}} the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, <b>stunted</b> <b>growth,</b> anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E

Particularly efficacious in plants infested early, gall formations block shoot development on the apical growing points, <b>stunting</b> <b>growth,</b> distorting adjacent stems, associated foliage {{and in some cases}} causing death.|$|R
50|$|While {{the adult}} weevil does visible {{damage to the}} foliage of the gorse plant by feeding on it, this is not {{significant}} enough to <b>stunt</b> <b>growth</b> in any measurable way; instead, this agent is effective because its larva are hatched within the gorse seed pod and feed on the seeds, destroying them.|$|R
5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} {{developing}} world are deficient in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or <b>stunted</b> <b>growth.</b> However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or <b>stunted</b> <b>growth</b> and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{nutrient}} deficiencies {{can cause}} a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants {{to a lack of}} head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause <b>stunted</b> <b>growth</b> and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E

50|$|Linden Porco (born 29 August 1996) is a Canadian dwarf child actor. He is 32 inches (81 centimeters) {{tall and}} {{is best known}} for his role as a body double in the 2006 American film Little Man. He was born with cartilage-hair hypoplasia, a form of {{dwarfism}} that <b>stunts</b> <b>growth,</b> but allows for proportional development.|$|R
50|$|The larva feeds in a mine in {{the leaves}} of the tree, {{damaging}} the leaves and <b>stunting</b> <b>growth.</b> Infected leaves are covered in small brown patches which spread rapidly across the entire tree, giving an autumnal appearance. Eventually the leaves die and drop off; when new ones grow they are again infected. This cycle can repeat itself several times in one season.|$|R

5000|$|Wettenhall {{built his}} {{international}} reputation in paediatrics {{on the use}} of estrogen to <b>stunt</b> the <b>growth</b> of Australian girls. It is widely agreed that he did more than any other doctor worldwide to popularise the treatment, and it is estimated that he personally treated over 1200 Australian girls from approximately 1962 to 1985.For many years he prescribed pre-pubescent girls high doses of diethylstilbestrol (DES) in an attempt to bring on early puberty, and as such <b>stunt</b> <b>growth.</b> DES was later shown to have disastrous long-term effects on his patients such as infertility and cancer. [...] In the mid 1970s, when the ill effects of DES became widely known and accepted, Wettenhall altered to prescribing ethinylestradiol; however, this has also demonstrated similar long-term detrimental effects.|$|R
25|$|Many {{strains of}} corn have been {{developed}} {{in recent years to}} combat the spread of Maize dwarf mosaic virus, a costly virus that causes <b>stunted</b> <b>growth</b> which is carried in Johnson grass and spread by aphid insect vectors.

25|$|Hemp {{plants can}} be {{vulnerable}} to various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes, viruses and other miscellaneous pathogens. Such diseases often lead to reduced fiber quality, <b>stunted</b> <b>growth,</b> and death of the plant. These diseases rarely affect the yield of a hemp field, so hemp production is not traditionally dependent {{on the use of}} pesticides.|$|E
25|$|Children are {{particularly}} affected by aflatoxin exposure, {{which leads to}} <b>stunted</b> <b>growth,</b> delayed development, liver damage, and liver cancer. Adults have a higher tolerance to exposure, but are also at risk. No animal species is immune. Aflatoxins {{are among the most}} carcinogenic substances known. After entering the body, aflatoxins may be metabolized by the liver to a reactive epoxide intermediate or hydroxylated to become the less harmful aflatoxin M1.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} severe side effects can occur if {{adolescents}} use AAS. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through {{increased levels of}} estrogen metabolites), resulting in <b>stunted</b> <b>growth.</b> Other effects include, {{but are not limited}} to, accelerated bone maturation, increased frequency and duration of erections, and premature sexual development. AAS use in adolescence is also correlated with poorer attitudes related to health.|$|E
25|$|Along with collectivization, {{the central}} {{government}} decreed several changes in agricultural techniques based on the ideas of Soviet pseudoscientist Trofim Lysenko. One of these ideas was close planting, whereby the density of seedlings was at first tripled and then doubled again. The theory was that plants {{of the same species}} would not compete with each other. In practice they did, which <b>stunted</b> <b>growth</b> and resulted in lower yields.|$|E
25|$|Cannas {{are remarkably}} free of diseases, {{compared}} to many genera. However, they may {{fall victim to}} canna rust, a fungus resulting in orange spots on the plant's leaves, caused by over moist soil. They are also susceptible to certain plant viruses, {{some of which are}} Canna-specific, which may result in spotted or streaked leaves, in a mild form, but can finally result in <b>stunted</b> <b>growth</b> and twisted and distorted blooms and foliage.|$|E
50|$|Bergenia are hardy {{plants that}} can grow in climates with extreme {{temperature}} ranges from about -35 F to 115 F. They prefer sun but will grow in shady areas as well. Plants can grow to about 24 in tall and 24 in wide. They {{do well in}} most soils, but moist, humus-rich soil is preferable. Exposure and dry soils tend to <b>stunt</b> <b>growth,</b> but can enhance the winter leaf colours. In areas with cold, strong winter winds, protection from the wind may be required. They are propagated by division or rooted rhizome sections.|$|R
50|$|Downy mildew is an {{extremely}} fast-developing disease in the onion. Studies have observed up to 40% of a field being infected {{in less than three}} days. The first symptoms of the disease are white and purple growths {{on the surface of the}} plant leaves. Eventually these leaves die. This in turn destroys the plant's photosynthetic abilities, <b>stunting</b> <b>growth</b> and sometimes killing the plant. Untreated downy mildew can reduce yields by 65%. Downy mildew is controlled with the same foliar fungicides as leaf blight: azoxystrobin, copper, mancozeb, maneb, and mefenoxam.|$|R
