50|$|While the {{mechanics}} and concepts of <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> {{are still being}} studied, the power source has been implemented in several different locations. Most of these are experimental, but thus far they have been predominantly successful. The various companies that have utilized this power have also done so {{in many different ways}} as there are several concepts and processes that harness the power from salinity gradient.|$|E
50|$|Osmotic power, <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> or {{blue energy}} is the energy {{available}} from {{the difference in the}} salt concentration between seawater and river water. Two practical methods for this are reverse electrodialysis (RED) andpressure retarded osmosis (PRO). Both processes rely on osmosis with membranes. The key waste product is brackish water. This byproduct is the result of natural forces that are being harnessed: the flow of fresh water into seas that are made up of salt water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> is a {{specific}} renewable energy alternative that creates renewable and sustainable power by using naturally occurring processes. This practice does not contaminate or release carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (vapor pressure methods will release dissolved air containing CO2 at low pressures—these non-condensable gases can be re-dissolved of course, but with an energy penalty). Also as stated by Jones and Finley within their article “Recent Development in Salinity Gradient Power”, there is basically no fuel cost.|$|E
40|$|Beyond {{the most}} common {{renewable}} energy sources today exploited {{for the production of}} clean energy, <b>salinity</b> <b>gradients</b> <b>power</b> (SGP) has been attracting the increasing interest of scientists and companies involved in the field. This chapter provides an introduction to SGP, reporting a brief history of the technological developments throughout the years, from the beginning to present. A number of different SGP technologies have been developed in the last decades, all based on the concept of harvesting the energy from the controlled mixing of two solutions at different salinities. A theoretical analysis of the energy potential for SGP places this renewable source of energy among those capable of playing {{a significant role in the}} energy sector in the next decades. A classification of all SGP processes is also reported on the basis of: mixing process, energy conversion, and transported species. Finally, an outline of all book chapters is presented...|$|R
40|$|Similar to a {{difference}} in elevation, potential energy is also associated with {{a difference}} in salt concentration so that electric power can eventually be produced by exploiting the <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> between freshwater of rivers and seawater. Unfortunately, exploiting the <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> for <b>power</b> production {{is not so easy}} as waterfalls. The potential energy implied in this salinity difference is of the same order of a hundred meter high water drop. The present technology advancement is still far from any commercial application.

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{from the}} ocean called ‘blue energy’ began in the 1970 's and should have reached its peak by today, but due to varying interests {{in the field and}} the growing potentials of other sources, its development was delayed. Recently, it receives more interest and a number of institutes has deployed their pilot plant. Blue energy is a type of renewable energy based on <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> where <b>power</b> is generated from different salt concentration in saltwater (the ocean) and freshwater (river). When the mixing of seawater and freshwater occurs, an increase in the entropy of this system is observed and free energy is dissipated. This research aims to identify and compare existing techniques or methods of blue energy harvesting developed over time. Five different techniques were reviewed, looking at their principle of operation, configuration and performance. Based on the review, capacitive mixing method was selected for further analysis. Experiment was conducted to evaluate different factor including the concentration of sea water, volumes and type of electrodes.

The canal could also be used to generate hydroelectric power because of surface difference and maybe by <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power,</b> and desalinate water by reverse osmosis.|$|E
5000|$|Brackish {{water or}} briny water is water {{that has more}} {{salinity}} than fresh water, {{but not as much}} as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root [...] "brak". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms).|$|E
5000|$|Differing <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> generations exist {{but one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} discussed is pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO). Within PRO seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber where the pressure is lower than the difference between fresh and salt water pressure. Fresh water moves in a semipermeable membrane and increases its volume in the chamber. As the pressure in the chamber is compensated a turbine spins to generate electricity. In Braun's article he states that this process is easy to understand in a more broken down manner. Two solutions, A being salt water and B being fresh water are separated by a membrane. He states [...] "only water molecules can pass the semipermeable membrane. As a result of the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions, the water from solution B thus will diffuse through the membrane in order to dilute solution A". The pressure drives the turbines and power the generator that produces the electrical energy. Osmosis might be used directly to [...] "pump" [...] fresh water out of The Netherlands into the sea. This is currently done using electric pumps.|$|E

40|$|A {{major source}} of energy exists where there is mixing between aqueous {{solutions}} of different salinities. This energy source is particularly concentrated where fresh water rivers flow on to the ocean. The power, represented by the osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and salt water, may be called <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power.</b> In this study the pressure retarded osmosis method for the extraction of salinity gradients’ energy is investigated, main problems and difficulties are pointed out and finally the whole subject is justified with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|<b>Salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> (or blue energy) is a {{renewable}} energy source mentioned in the literature since the 1950 s. It refers {{to the production of}} electricity by mixing of two solutions with different salt concentrations, for example river and sea water. The global potential of salinity power has been estimated in the 1970 s as substantial, but the state of membrane technology at that time - crucial for energy recovery - did not permit the practical use of this resource. More recently, the interest in salinity power has been growing because of the need for carbon neutral, renewable sources of electricity. This study aims to assess the potential of salinity-gradient power for reducing emissions of CO 2 and non-CO 2 greenhouse gases. First, we discuss the global technical potential for blue energy, i. e. the maximum amount of energy that could be retrieved at the current state of technology. We focus on rivers as source of fresh water and seas as source of saline water. The analysis is based on global datasets of annual river discharges for more than 5000 world rivers. The resulting estimates of global and regional potentials for <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> are used to estimate the potential for reducing greenhouse gases, assuming that salinity power would reduce the need for fossil fuels. The results are shown for global totals, regional totals and selected rivers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> (SGP) is {{the energy}} that can be {{obtained}} from the mixing entropy of two solutions with a different salt concentration. River estuary, as a place for mixing salt water and fresh water, has a huge potential of this renewable energy. In this study, this potential in the estuaries of rivers leading to the Persian Gulf and the factors affecting it are analysis and assessment. Since most of the full water rivers are in the Asia, this continent with the potential power of 338 GW is a second major source of energy from the <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> in the world (Wetsus institute, 2009). Persian Gulf, with the proper salinity gradient in its river estuaries, has Particular importance for extraction of this energy. Considering the total river flow into the Persian Gulf, which is approximately equal to 3486 m 3 /s, the amount of theoretical extractable power from salinity gradient in this region is 5. 2 GW. Iran, with its numerous rivers along the coast of the Persian Gulf, has a great share of this energy source. For example, with study calculations done on data from three hydrometery stations located on the Arvand River, Khorramshahr Station with releasing 1. 91 M/ energy which is obtained by combining 1. 26 m 3 river water with 0. 74 m 3 sea water, is devoted to itself extracting the maximum amount of extractable energy. Considering the average of annual discharge of Arvand River in Khorramshahr hydrometery station, the amount of theoretical extractable power is 955 MW. Another part of parameters that are studied in this research, are the intrusion length of salt water and its flushing time in the estuary that have a significant influence on the <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power.</b> According to the calculation done in conditions HWS and the average discharge of rivers, the maximum of salinity intrusion length in to the estuary of the river by 41 km is related to Arvand River and the lowest with 8 km is for Helle River. Also the highest rate of salt water flushing time in the estuary with 9. 8 days is related to the Arvand River and the lowest with 3. 3 days is for Helle River. Influence of these two parameters on reduces the amount of extractable energy from <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> as well {{as can be seen in}} the estuaries of the rivers studied. For example, at the estuary of the Arvand River in the interval 8. 9 days, <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>power</b> decreases 9. 2 %. But another part of this research focuses on the design of a suitable system for extracting electrical energy from the salinity gradient. So far, five methods have been proposed to convert this energy to electricity that among them, reverse electro-dialysis (RED) method and pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) method have special importance in practical terms. In theory both techniques generate the same amount of energy from given volumes of sea and river water with specified salinity; in practice the RED technique seems to be more attractive for power generation using sea water and river water. Because it is less necessity of salinity gradient to PRO method. In addition to this, in RED method, it does not need to use turbine to change energy and the electricity generation is started when two solutions are mixed. In this research, the power density and the efficiency of generated energy was assessment by designing a physical method. The physical designed model is an unicellular reverse electro-dialysis battery with nano heterogenic membrane has 20 cmx 20 cm dimension, which produced power density 0. 58 W/m 2 by using river water (1 g NaCl/lit) and sea water (30 g NaCl/lit) in laboratorial condition. This value was obtained because of nano method used on the membrane of this system and suitable design of the cell which led to increase the yield of the system efficiency 11 % more than non nano ones...|$|E

By partially blocking the back focal plane of the objective lens, the schlieren microscope produces an image with patterns that correspond to spatial derivative of refractive index in the specimen. Since salinity variation leads to change in refractive index, the fluid mixing of an aqueous salt solution of a known concentration and water in a T-microchannel is used to establish the relation between <b>salinity</b> <b>gradients</b> and grayscale readouts. This relation is then employed to map the <b>salinity</b> <b>gradients</b> in the target microfluidic device from the grayscale readouts of the corresponding micro-schlieren image. For saline solution with salinity close to that of the seawater, the grayscale readouts vary linearly with the <b>salinity</b> <b>gradient,</b> and the regression line is independent of the flow condition and the salinity of the injected solution.

The present work uses CFD to investigate the dependence of concentration polarization and pressure drop on flow rate, feeds concentration, current density and spacer features. Concentration polarization effects were found to be significant at low feed solution concentration (river water), but only secondary at higher concentrations (seawater and brine), thus suggesting that different optimization strategies should be employed depending on the feeds concentration.

Challenges exist in the selection of appropriate membrane materials in order to reduce the capital cost of membrane manufacturing and in the design of proper RED membranes to optimize the energy-producing process. This work presents the synthesis of hybrid cation exchange membranes by incorporating two well-known inexpensive organic polymers with great film-forming ability. Sulfonated poly (2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide) (sPPO) polymer mixed with sulfated polyvinyl alcohol (sPVA) has been proved to have great potential as a candidate for RED membranes. The prepared membranes with 2 to 10 wt% sPVA have improved the permselectivity up to 87 % and reduced area resistance down to 1. 31 ohm cm- 2, which is comparable to the commercially available FKS (Fumasep®, Germany) membranes. The best performance was achieved with hybrid membrane containing 5 wt% of sPVA which resulted in a gross power density at 0. 46 W/m 2.
