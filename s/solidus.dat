5|$|The Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty 2007 {{comic book}} {{adaptation}} by Alex Garner retells Raiden's {{role in the}} series, with few changes made to the story. His relationship with <b>Solidus</b> is explored when he remembers his past; when about to be killed by <b>Solidus,</b> Raiden is saved by Snake. The game's novelization by Raymond Benson provides minor modifications to Raiden's history, except for the moment he receives Olga's sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills <b>Solidus</b> he cuts the rope on Federal Hall National Memorial's flagpole, causing an American flag to fall over his enemy's body. This scene was deleted from the original game due to the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Kojima Productions have {{compared}} Raiden and Solid Snake {{as to their}} experiences and ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against <b>Solidus</b> Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating <b>Solidus,</b> Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation {{to make a new}} sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{gold coin}} weighed on average 2.5-2.8grams and was 15–21mm in {{diameter}} {{at the start}} of issue, in 270-300. This would make it half an Aureus which weighed 4.62-6.51grams at the time of Probus. The issue of Israel (570-600) weighed 1.5grams and was 17mm in diameter. The Roman <b>solidus</b> of Maurice Tiberius was 4.36-4.47grams. A majority of these coins were found in South Arabia and not Aksum. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an AU Unit.|$|E
5|$|The soldier's sole {{substantial}} {{disposable income}} {{came from the}} donativa, or cash bonuses handed out periodically by the emperors, as these were paid in gold solidi (which were never debased), or in pure silver. There was a regular donative of 5 solidi every five years of an Augustus reign (i.e. one <b>solidus</b> p.a.) Also, on the accession of a new Augustus, 5 solidi plus a pound of silver (worth 4 solidi, totaling 9 solidi) were paid. The 12 Augusti that ruled the West between 284 and 395 averaged about nine years per reign. Thus the accession donatives would have averaged about 1 <b>solidus</b> p.a. The late soldier's disposable income would thus have averaged at least 2 solidi per annum. It is also possible, but undocumented, that the accession bonus was paid for each Augustus and/or a bonus for each Caesar. The documented income of 2 solidi was {{only a quarter of}} the disposable income of a 2nd-century legionary (which was the equivalent of c. 8 solidi). The late soldier's discharge package (which included a small plot of land) was also minuscule compared with a 2nd-century legionary's, worth just a tenth of the latter's.|$|E
5|$|Constantine ignored {{those parts}} of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of {{preserving}} a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold <b>solidus</b> became the empire's primary currency instead. Diocletian's persecution of Christians was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Constantine would claim {{to have the same}} close relationship with the Christian God as Diocletian claimed to have with Jupiter. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s. The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy {{had been set}} as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard's work preceded this date. It was thus written Boletus edulis Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' work, the Species Plantarum. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Early alternate names include Boletus <b>solidus</b> by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray's Leccinum edule. Gray's transfer of the species to Leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was unfamiliar with the earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.|$|E
5|$|Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties overall debased the currency, {{particularly}} the denarius, under {{the pressures of}} meeting military payrolls. Sudden inflation {{during the reign of}} Commodus damaged the credit market. In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300. Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency, general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian, and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government. Despite Diocletian's introduction of the gold <b>solidus</b> and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Byzantine {{production}} of silk {{starting in the}} 6th century AD, Chinese varieties were still considered to be of higher quality. This theory {{is supported by the}} discovery of a Byzantine <b>solidus</b> minted during the reign of Justin II found in a Sui-dynasty tomb of Shanxi province in 1953, among other Byzantine coins found at various sites. Chinese histories offer descriptions of Roman and Byzantine coins. The Weilüe, Book of the Later Han, Book of Jin, as well as the later Wenxian Tongkao noted how ten ancient Roman silver coins were worth one Roman gold coin. The Roman golden aureus was worth about twenty-five silver denarii. During the later Byzantine Empire, twelve silver miliaresion was equal to one gold nomisma. The History of Song notes that the Byzantines made coins of either silver or gold, without holes in the middle, with an inscription of the king's name. It also asserts that the Byzantines forbade the production of counterfeit coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} gold <b>solidus</b> coins {{from the}} Eastern Roman Empire found in China {{date to the}} reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450 AD) and altogether only forty-eight {{of them have been}} found (compared to 1300 silver coins) in Xinjiang and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in Turfan persisted long after the Tang campaign against Karakhoja and Chinese conquest of 640 AD, with a gradual adoption of Chinese bronze coinage during the 7th century AD. Hansen maintains that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with Sasanian Persian silver coins and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans, confirming the pre-eminence of Greater Iran in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome. Walter Scheidel remarks that the Chinese viewed Byzantine coins as pieces of exotic jewellery, preferring to use bronze coinage in the Tang and Song dynasties, as well as paper money during the Song and Ming periods, even while silver bullion was plentiful. Ball writes that the scarcity of Roman and Byzantine coins in China, and the greater amounts found in India, suggest that most Chinese silk purchased by the Romans was from maritime India, largely bypassing the overland Silk Road trade through Iran. Chinese coins from the Sui and Tang dynasties (6th–10th centuries AD) have been discovered in India; significantly larger amounts are dated to the Song period (11th–13th centuries AD), particularly in the territories of the contemporary Chola dynasty.|$|E
5|$|It appears, however, {{that direct}} {{trade with the}} Sogdians {{remained}} limited {{in light of the}} small amount of Roman and Byzantine coins found in Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites belonging to this era. Although Roman embassies apparently reached Han China from 166 AD onwards, and the ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk while the Han-dynasty Chinese imported Roman glasswares as discovered in their tombs, Valerie Hansen (2012) wrote that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic (507–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC – 330 AD) era of the Roman Empire have been found in China. However, Warwick Ball (2016) upends this notion by pointing to a hoard of sixteen Roman coins found at Xi'an, China (formerly Chang'an), dated to the reigns of various emperors from Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD). The earliest gold <b>solidus</b> coins from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to thirteen-hundred silver coins) in Xinjiang and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in Turfan persisted long after the Tang campaign against Karakhoja and Chinese conquest of 640, with a gradual adoption of Chinese bronze coinage {{over the course of the}} 7th century. The fact that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with Sasanian Persian silver coins and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans confirms the pre-eminent importance of Greater Iran in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome.|$|E
25|$|One {{abbreviation}} for shilling is s (for <b>solidus,</b> see £sd). Often it {{was represented by}} a <b>solidus</b> symbol ("/"), which may have originally stood for a long s or ſ, thus 1/9 would be one shilling and ninepence (and equivalent to 21d; the shilling itself was equal to 12d). A price with no pence was sometimes written with a <b>solidus</b> and a dash: 11/–.|$|E
25|$|Temperature ranges for <b>solidus</b> and {{liquidus}} (the {{boundaries of}} the mushy state) are listed as solidus/liquidus.|$|E
25|$|The <b>solidus</b> symbol {{is still}} {{used for the}} {{shilling}} currency unit in former British East Africa, rather than sh.|$|E
25|$|The <b>solidus</b> {{temperatures}} of most rocks (the temperatures below {{which they are}} completely solid) increase with increasing pressure {{in the absence of}} water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its <b>solidus</b> temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3°C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the <b>solidus</b> temperatures increase by 3°C to 4°C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical {{in the evolution of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of total solidification is the <b>solidus</b> of the alloy, the temperature at which all components are molten is the liquidus.|$|E
25|$|The sol, {{later the}} sou, both also {{derived from the}} Roman <b>solidus,</b> were the {{equivalent}} coins in France, while the (nuevo) sol (PEN) remains the currency of Peru.|$|E
25|$|The slash ('/', or <b>solidus)</b> is {{sometimes}} used {{to separate the}} letters in a two-letter acronym, as in N/A (not applicable, not available), c/o (care of) and w/o (without).|$|E
25|$|Forging {{temperatures}} above 550°C are {{too close}} to the <b>solidus</b> temperature of the alloys and lead in conjunction with varying effective strains to unfavorable workpiece surfaces and potentially to a partial melting as well as fold formation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people even}} {{claim that the}} word soldier itself comes from the Latin sal dare (to give salt), but {{mainstream}} sources disagree, noting that the word soldier more likely derives from the gold <b>solidus</b> introduced by Diocletian in 301 CE.|$|E
25|$|The gold <b>solidus</b> or nomisma {{remained}} {{a standard of}} international commerce until the 11th century, when it began to be debased under successive emperors beginning in the 1030s under the emperor Romanos Argyros (10281034). Until that time, the fineness of the gold remained consistent at about0.9550.980.|$|E
25|$|Byzantine currency, money {{used in the}} Eastern Roman Empire {{after the}} fall of the West, {{consisted}} of mainly two types of coins: the gold <b>solidus</b> and a variety of clearly valued bronze coins. By the end of the empire the currency was issued only in silver stavrata and minor copper coins with no gold issue.|$|E
25|$|At {{any given}} {{pressure}} and {{for any given}} composition of rock, a rise in temperature past the <b>solidus</b> will cause melting. Within the solid earth, the temperature of a rock {{is controlled by the}} geothermal gradient and the radioactive decay within the rock. The geothermal gradient averages about 25nbsp&°C/km with a wide range from a low of 5–10nbsp&°C/km within oceanic trenches and subduction zones to 30–80nbsp&°C/km under mid-ocean ridges and volcanic arc environments.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} what is viewed as Byzantine {{currency}} by numismatics began with the monetary reform of Anastasius in 498, who reformed the late Roman Empire coinage system which consisted of the gold <b>solidus</b> and the bronze nummi. The nummus was an extremely small bronze coin, at about 8–10mm, weight of 0.56 g making it at 576 to the Roman pound which was inconvenient because {{a large number of}} them were required even for small transactions.|$|E
25|$|In igneous petrology, geologists {{attempt to}} learn more about {{volcanic}} systems through the record in igneous rocks. Most magma is generated in the mantle through a process called decompression melting. As material rises and the pressure decreases, <b>solidus</b> declines until part of the mantle can melt. At or near the surface, the magma cools and crystallizes. Depending on the conditions, it may have time to cool uniformly, or fractional crystallization can occur if parts of the magma are removed after they crystallize.|$|E
25|$|Revolver Ocelot is a {{recurring}} character in Konami's Metal Gear series. Throughout the series' continuity, he {{takes on a}} variety of roles: a henchman of Liquid Snake, the right-hand man of <b>Solidus</b> Snake, a friendly rival to Big Boss, and a major nemesis to Solid Snake. The character has been well received by video game publications for his role as a central villain and antihero in the franchise and has often been considered one of its most important characters for his connections with various characters.|$|E
25|$|A good destrier was expensive. 7th century Salic law gives a {{price of}} 12 solidi as weregild, or reparational payment, for a war horse, {{compared}} to 3 solidi for a sound mare or 1 <b>solidus</b> for a cow. In later centuries destriers became even more expensive: the average value {{of each of the}} horses in a company of 22 knights and squires in the county of Flanders in 1297 compares to the price of seven normal coursers. The price of these destriers varied between 20 and 300 livres parisis (parisian pounds), compared to 5 to 12 livres for a normal courser.|$|E
25|$|The Duchy of Alemannia {{fell under}} Frankish {{rule in the}} 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the Bishopric of Basel. Based on the {{evidence}} of a third <b>solidus</b> with the inscription Basilia fit, Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century. Under bishop Haito, the first cathedral {{was built on the}} site of the Roman castle, later replaced by a Romanesque structure consecrated in 1019. At the partition of the Carolingian Empire, Basel was first given to West Francia, but passed to East Francia with the treaty of Meerssen of 870.|$|E
25|$|Standardized Roman {{currency}} {{was used}} throughout the Roman Empire. Important Roman gold and silver coins were continued into the Middle Ages (see Gold dinar, <b>Solidus,</b> Aureus, Denarius). Ancient and early medieval coins in theory had {{the value of their}} metal content, although there have been many instances throughout history of the metal content of governments inflating their currencies by debasing their coinage, so that the inferior coins were worth less in metal than their face value. Fiat money first arose in medieval China, with the jiaozi paper money. Early paper money was introduced in Europe in the later Middle Ages, but some coins continued to have the value of the gold or silver they contained throughout the Early Modern period. The penny was minted as a silver coin until the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek {{architectural}} {{models and}} styles to create {{its own unique}} type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art {{can be seen in}} the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include St Mark's Basilica in Venice, the basilicas of Ravenna, and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian florin, the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the <b>solidus</b> of Diocletian becoming the bezant prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its city walls were much imitated (for example, see Caernarfon Castle) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used.|$|E
25|$|Several promotional DVDs {{have been}} {{released}} detailing the Metal Gear series. Metal Gear Saga vol. 1 was released in 2006 as a pre-order disc for MGS3: Subsistence. It is divided into five chapters, each dealing with one game of the then five-part Metal Gear series in chronological order (beginning with MGS3), and each include discussions by Hideo Kojima. Metal Gear Saga vol. 2 was first shown at the 20th Metal Gear Anniversary Party, and then released as a pre-order disc for MGS4. In this, the video {{is presented as a}} pseudo-documentary about Solid Snake and is divided into a prologue and four chapters: Naked Snake-the birth of Snake (chronicling the events of MGS3, MG1, and MG2), Liquid Snake-the second snake (MGS), <b>Solidus</b> Snake-the third Snake (MGS2) and Solid Snake-the first Snake (setting the stage for MGS4).|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} {{of carbon dioxide}} is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the {{addition of}} water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas {{has been attributed to}} the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions. In the presence of carbon dioxide, experiments document that the peridotite <b>solidus</b> temperature decreases by about 200°C in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70km. At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450°C to 600°C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide. Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, carbonatite, and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70km.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} rock {{composition}} {{most responsible for}} the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the <b>solidus</b> temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800°C in the presence of excess water, but near or above about 1,500°C in the absence of water.O on mantle wedge melting. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 249, p. 74-89 Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. Hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, {{an important part of the}} continental crust.|$|E
25|$|Increase in {{temperature}} {{is the most}} typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle. Temperatures can also exceed the <b>solidus</b> of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary. The plate boundary between the Indian and Asian continental masses provides a well-studied example, as the Tibetan Plateau {{just north of the}} boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick, roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust. Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases {{in temperature}}. Temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known English coins are gold pieces, modelled {{on contemporary}} Merovingian Frankish coinage, and consisting largely of tremisses: {{one third of}} a gold <b>solidus,</b> originally weighing 4.5g, but in the Anglo-Saxon context apparently based on a revised standard of 3.9g implemented in Gaul from around the 580s. Frankish coins played an increasingly important role as currency in England as the 6th century went on, and the earliest Anglo-Saxon gold tremisses (sometimes referred to by numismatists as thrymsas) were struck to circulate alongside these Frankish issues: all of the forty gold tremisses found in the burial at ‘mound one’ at Sutton Hoo (deposited c. 630), for instance, were Frankish. The earliest coins struck in England can be roughly dated to around the year 600: they include one gold tremissis struck by a moneyer named Eusebius working at Canterbury (Dorovernia), and the Liudhard medalet, a gold medallion (though in fabric very like a coin) found in Canterbury and bearing {{the name of a}} bishop Liudhard, almost certainly the same bishop of that name whom Bede’s Historia ecclesiastica described as coming to England with Bertha, the Frankish bride of Æthelberht I of Kent.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{considered}} the vision in a solar context (e.g. as a solar halo phenomenon called a sun dog), which may have preceded the Christian beliefs later expressed by Constantine. Coins of Constantine depicting him as the companion of a solar deity were minted as late as 313, the year following the battle. The solar deity Sol Invictus is often pictured with a nimbus or halo. Various emperors portrayed Sol Invictus on their official coinage, {{with a wide range}} of legends, only a few of which incorporated the epithet invictus, such as the legend SOLI INVICTO COMITI, claiming the Unconquered Sun as a companion to the emperor, used with particular frequency by Constantine. Constantine's official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/6. A <b>solidus</b> of Constantine as well as a gold medallion from his reign depict the Emperor's bust in profile jugate with Sol Invictus, with the legend INVICTUS CONSTANTINUS. The official cults of Sol Invictus and Sol Invictus Mithras were popular amongst the soldiers of the Roman Army. Statuettes of Sol Invictus, carried by the standard-bearers, appear in three places in reliefs on the Arch of Constantine. Constantine's triumphal arch was carefully positioned to align with the colossal statue of Sol by the Colosseum, so that Sol formed the dominant backdrop when seen from the direction of the main approach towards the arch.|$|E
500|$|Symbols for derived units {{formed by}} {{division}} are joined with a <b>solidus</b> (/), or given {{as a negative}} exponent. E.g., the [...] "metre per second" [...] can be written m/s, ms−1, m·s−1, or [...] Only one <b>solidus</b> should be used; e.g., kg/(m·s2) and kg·m−1·s−2 are acceptable, but kg/m/s2 is ambiguous and unacceptable.|$|E
