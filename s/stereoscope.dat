5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to ten yards (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five <b>stereoscope</b> views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids who require long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E
25|$|Stereopsis {{was first}} {{described}} by Wheatstone in 1838. In 1840 {{he was awarded}} the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the <b>stereoscope.</b> He showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by both of our eyes from different points of view. Thus, in the <b>stereoscope,</b> an arrangement of lenses or mirrors, two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect. Sir David Brewster improved the <b>stereoscope</b> by dispensing with the mirrors, and bringing it into its existing form with lenses.|$|E
25|$|Until 1998, asteroids were {{discovered}} by a four-step process. First, {{a region of}} the sky was photographed by a wide-field telescope, or astrograph. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films or plates of the same region were viewed under a <b>stereoscope.</b> Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the <b>stereoscope,</b> {{the image of the}} body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations.|$|E

25|$|The 'pseudoscope' (Wheatstone {{coined the}} term from the Greek ψευδίς σκοπειν) was {{introduced}} in 1852, and is in some sort the reverse of the <b>stereoscope,</b> since it causes a solid object to seem hollow, and a nearer one to be farther off; thus, a bust {{appears to be a}} mask, and a tree growing outside of a window looks as if it were growing inside the room. Its purpose was to test his theory of stereo vision and for investigations into what would now be called experimental psychology.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of student media at St Andrews. The university's two newspapers are The Saint, a fortnightly publication and The Stand, an online publication founded in 2011. There is also the Foreign Affairs Review ran by the Foreign Affairs Society. There are also a number of smaller student publications including The Tribe, a student-run magazine and The Regulus, a student magazine focusing on politics and current affairs. In addition to this there are several student-led academic journals, most notably, <b>Stereoscope</b> Magazine which is focused on student photography and raising awareness of the university's historic photographic collection, Ha@sta, an annual journal {{for those interested in}} art history, Aporia, the journal of the Philosophy Society, and the Postgraduate Journal of Art History and Museum Studies.

25|$|During the Edo period (1603–1868) {{there was}} a flourishing of the visual and {{performance}} arts particularly through proliferation of ukiyo-e ("pictures of the floating world"). Etoki once again became popular during the later eighteenth century as storytellers began to set up on street corners with an unrolled scroll hanging from a pole. In the Meiji Period (1868–1912) tachi-e ("stand-up pictures"), {{similar to those in}} the Edo period, were told by performers who manipulated flat-paper cut-outs of figures mounted on wooden poles (similar to the shadow puppets of Indonesia and Malaysia). The Zen priest Nishimura is also credited to have used these pictures during sermons to entertain children. Another form of etoki was the Japanese modified <b>stereoscope</b> imported from the Netherlands. Much smaller in size, six engravings of landscapes and everyday scenes would be placed one behind the other on top of the device and lowered when required so that the viewer, who looked at them through a lens, could experience the illusion of space created by this device. The artistic and technological developments of the Edo and Meiji periods can be linked to the establishment of kamishibai.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} for the The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "It {{is rather}} {{difficult to understand}} by what magic the two signatures are made {{to appear in the}} court room without human agency. They come and go in anything but legal fashion. Evidently their appearance is to be taken symbolically - not realistically." [...] The final part of the review is difficult to infer because the film is lost, but the synopsis states that a stereopticon was used. A stereopticon, {{not to be confused with}} a <b>stereoscope,</b> is a type of slide projector that projects an image. According to the synopsis, the production employs one, or possibly two, stereopticon's to display the two different signatures to compare and reveal the forgery. The reviewer seems to state that the appearance as unnatural, perhaps referencing a dissolve effect. The ability to project with a dissolve was a known ability of more advanced stereopticons. According to another reviewer the film included shots of Long Island Sound.|$|E

2500|$|Ōkyo {{was born}} into a farming family in Ano-o, in present-day Kameoka, Kyoto. As a teenager, he moved to Kyoto and joined the townspeople (chōnin) class. He apprenticed for a toy shop, where he painted the faces onto dolls. The shop began selling European stereoscopes, {{novelties}} that when looked into presented the illusion of a three-dimensional image. It was Ōkyo's first look at Western-style perspective, and in 1767 he tried his hand at one of the images. He created Harbour View, a small picture in single-point perspective. Ōkyo soon mastered the techniques of drawing <b>stereoscope</b> images ( [...] , eyeglass pictures).|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{worked in}} {{multiple}} camera and plate sizes, under conditions that were often incredibly difficult. His photography {{was based on}} the collodion process invented in 1848 and published in 1851 by Frederick Scott Archer. [...] Jackson traveled with as many as three camera-types—a stereographic camera (for <b>stereoscope</b> cards), a [...] "whole-plate" [...] or 8x10" [...] plate-size camera, and one even larger, as large as 18x22". [...] These cameras required fragile, heavy glass plates (photographic plates), which had to be coated, exposed, and developed onsite, before the wet-collodion emulsion dried. Without light metering equipment or sure emulsion speeds, exposure times required inspired guesswork, between five seconds and twenty minutes depending on light conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The company {{took the}} first steps towards {{developing}} the View-Master <b>stereoscope</b> after a chance meeting, at the Oregon Caves in 1938, between Graves and William Gruber, an organ maker of German origin trained by Welte & Sons and an avid photographer, living in Portland. The View-Master used disk-shaped [...] "reels" [...] which are thin cardboard disks containing seven stereoscopic 3-D pairs of small color photographs on film, and its individual eyepieces immersed the viewer into the scene more fully than previous stereoscopes. [...] Mayer and Gruber had both developed devices for viewing stereo images, but Gruber had developed the idea of mounting tiny pieces of Kodachrome color transparency film into reels made from heavy paper stock, for viewing in a stereo slide viewer designed for the reels. [...] Gruber partnered with the owners of Sawyer's to develop the invention.|$|E

2500|$|Ōkyo {{decided to}} pursue a career as an artist. He first studied under Ishida Yūtei, a member of the Kanō school and {{ultimately}} a bigger influence on Ōkyo than the <b>stereoscope</b> images. During these formative years, Ōkyo studied Chinese painting as well. He particularly admired the works of Ch'ien Hsüan, a 13th-century painter known for his detailed flower drawings, and Qiu Ying, a 16th-century figure painter. In fact, the [...] "kyo" [...] in Ōkyo's name was adopted in tribute to Ch'ien Hsüan. Ōkyo even briefly adopted the Chinese practice of signing his name with one character, so for a time he was known as Ōkyo En. He studied the works of Shen Quan, a Chinese artist who lived in Nagasaki from 1731 to 1733 and painted images of flowers. However, Ōkyo did not like the artist's treatment of proportion, preferring the works of Watanabe Shikō. He also studied Ming and Qing paintings. Perhaps most significantly, Ōkyo eagerly studied any Western paintings or prints he could find.|$|E
2500|$|Binocular rivalry was {{discovered}} by Porta (1593, as cited in Wade, 1996). Porta put one book {{in front of one}} eye, and another in front of the other. He reported that he could read from one book at a time and that changing {{from one to the other}} required withdrawing the [...] "visual virtue" [...] from one eye and moving it to the other. According to Wade (1998), binocular colour rivalry was first reported by Le Clerk (1712). Desaguiliers (1716) also recorded it when looking at different colours from spectra in the bevel of a mirror. The clearest early description of both colour and contour rivalry was made by Dutour (1760, 1763; see translations by O'Shea, 1999a, b). To experience colour rivalry Dutour either crossed his eyes or overdiverged his eyes (a form of free fusion commonly used also at the end of the 20th century to view Magic Eye stereograms) to look at differently coloured pieces of cloth (Dutour, 1760) or differently coloured pieces of glass (Dutour, 1763). To experience contour rivalry Dutour again used free fusion of different objects or used a prism or a mirror in front of one eye to project different images into it. The first clear description of rivalry in English was by Charles Wheatstone (e.g., 1838). Wheatstone invented the <b>stereoscope,</b> an optical device (in Wheatstone's case using mirrors) to present different images to the two eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{theories}} were {{proposed to}} account for binocular rivalry. Porta and Dutour took it as evidence for an ancient theory of visual perception {{that has come to}} be known as suppression theory. Its essential idea is that, despite having two eyes, we see only one of everything (known as singleness of vision) because we see with one eye at a time. According to this theory, we do not normally notice the alternations between the two eyes because their images are too similar. By making the images very different, Porta and Dutour argued, this natural alternation can be seen. Wheatstone, on the other hand, supported the alternative theory of singleness of vision, fusion theory, proposed by Aristotle. Its essential idea is that we see only one of everything because the information from the two eyes is combined or fused. Wheatsone also discovered binocular stereopsis, the perception of depth arising from the lateral placement of the eyes. Wheatstone was able to prove that stereopsis depended on the different horizontal positions (the horizontal disparity) of points in the images viewed by each eye by creating the illusion of depth from flat depictions of such images displayed in his <b>stereoscope.</b> Such stereopsis is impossible unless information is being combined from each eye. Although Wheatstone's discovery of stereopsis supported fusion theory, he still had {{to account for}} binocular rivalry. He regarded binocular rivalry as a special case in which fusion is impossible, saying [...] "the mind is inattentive to impressions made on one retina when it cannot combine the impressions on the two retinae together so as to occasion a perception resembling that of some external object" [...] (p.264).|$|E
