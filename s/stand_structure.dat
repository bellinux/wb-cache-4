In addition, the winter season of 1987–1988 was drier than usual, with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31% of the normal snowpack. However, April and May 1988 were very wet and the abundant moisture greatly aided grass and understory development. By June, the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months. By July, the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry tinder. Relative humidity levels fell further, desiccating the forest. Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5%. By mid-August, humidity levels were averaging below 20% and were recorded as low as 6% on one occasion. To compound the lack of rainfall, the majority of Yellowstone's soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention. A series of strong but dry storm fronts also led to the rapid spread of a number of the largest fires.|$|E

These <b>stand</b> <b>structures</b> can be differentiated using ? 13 C and ? 15 N analysis (mean tall ? 13 C = - 28 ?, mean tall ? 15 N = 0 ?; mean dwarf ? 13 C = - 25 ?, mean dwarf ? 15 N = - 10 ?), which may also prove useful in examining past mangrove <b>stand</b> <b>structures</b> from sediment cores. 15 N label was traced in R. mangle leaves in a laboratory and field experiment over three months. The 15 N label was examined to determine distribution of nitrogen in various biochemical fractions of the leaf and to verify if nitrogen is fractionated in a predictable manner over time. This information could be beneficial in examining past mangrove <b>stand</b> <b>structures.</b> Experimental data indicate that nitrogen is mobile within each biochemical fraction of the R. mangle leaf over time and a measurable amount of nitrogen exists in each fraction after 3 months of incubation. Nitrogen immobilization was evident in each experiment, as the ? 15 N values decreased ~ 200 ? in each of the labeled fractions of the laboratory experiment, which was mirrored by an increase in ? 15 N in the control samples. The amount of nitrogen in the biochemical fractions of the field experiment varied over time either increasing or decreasing, which {{may be due to the}} various environmental conditions such as tidal fluctuation, temperature, oxygen concentrations and microbial activity. The ? 15 N signature of the residual nitrogen fraction (? 15 N = 87 ?) reflected that of the bulk fraction (? 15 N = 133 ?) in the laboratory experiment as well as in the field experiment (residual nitrogen ? 15 N = 759 ?, bulk ? 15 N = 770 ?). To use isotope analysis to examine past mangrove <b>stand</b> <b>structures</b> it is essential that the original signature be maintained over time. The results of this study indicated that the simple interpretation of nitrogen isotopes may not be useful in examining past mangrove <b>stand</b> <b>structures</b> due to the variation over time, although this type of analysis may be considered if coupled with additional proxies and diagenetic factors are taken into account...|$|R

50|$|Partly as {{a result}} of such confusion, the term Plenterwald, which is the German term for {{selection}} cutting, is being more commonly used as the standard term in English.

30|$|At {{a broader}} level, our {{overview}} provides some general insights that suggest opportunities for more coordinated efforts. It appears obvious {{that in this}} context, efforts that allow foresters {{to take advantage of}} the widest possible array of silvicultural tools to accommodate a wide variety of local ecological, economic, and social conditions are especially useful. This would be facilitated by a more formal shift of alternative silvicultural approaches away from the focus on desired or acceptable <b>stand</b> <b>structures,</b> often defined as specific diameter distributions or other visual targets, such as photos or sketches of desired <b>stand</b> <b>structures</b> (Larsen and Nielsen 2007) (Figure  2). Instead, a more targeted focus on the suite of desired ecosystem goods and services will allow foresters to integrate a broader set of disturbances, stand dynamics, and successional trends into their management practices. Such a focus will allow more flexibility in the future and encourage practices to be “customized” to optimally fit specific ecological, economic, and social settings without the confining restrictions of labels.|$|R
30|$|Of the {{analyzed}} factors, timber price caused most {{uncertainty in}} the calculation of the net present value of a certain management schedule.

30|$|Each type {{of model}} {{has its own}} {{benefits}} and drawbacks. Whole-stand models often provide well-behaved outputs at the stand level, but these outputs lack information on <b>stand</b> <b>structures.</b> Detailed information from individual-tree models and size-class models, on the other hand, typically results in stand-level outputs that are not as accurate or precise because they suffer from accumulation of errors (Garcia [2001], Qin and Cao [2006]).|$|R
50|$|Selection cutting is the {{silvicultural}} {{practice of}} harvesting trees {{in a way}} that moves a forest stand towards an uneven-aged or all-aged condition, or 'structure'. Using stocking models derived from the study of old growth forests, '"Selection cutting"', also known as 'selection system', or 'selection silviculture', manages the establishment, continued growth and final harvest of multiple age classes (usually three, but 5 or even 10 are possible) of trees within a stand. A closely related approach to forest management is Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF), which makes use of selection systems to achieve a permanently irregular <b>stand</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{indicator}} of the pressures these threats can have {{is evident in the}} presence of bell miner associated dieback which is known to occur in several locations throughout the park. [...] While the specific factors that cause bell miner associated dieback are unclear, it is considered to be related to stress on the forest community and to such things as forest disturbance, changes in tree <b>stand</b> <b>structure,</b> an absence of regular burning, development of a dense understory, increase in foliar nutrients, infestation of tree crowns by psyllids, and colonisation by the bell miner.

The lack of disturbance in these areas and longevity of individual trees allows ample time for this slow-growing decay fungus to cause significant decay. There is a growing interest in acquiring methods to promote earlier development of stem decays in second-growth stands to achieve wildlife and other non-timber objectives.|$|E

Advantageous stand conditions for the spread of dwarf mistletoes include an uneven-aged <b>stand</b> <b>structure</b> with severely infected hosts in dominant and codominant crown classes, species composition dominated by the primary host, and tree densities that are between 175 - 500 trees/ha.|$|E
50|$|Before, {{the most}} common type of {{inventory}} is one that uses a random sampling technique which groups similar forests into one category based on age, <b>stand</b> <b>structure,</b> species, and location. The next step would be to begin from a random place and measure circular plots that are equidistant from one another. Inventory undertaken in conjunction with wildlife surveys has a regularized distance between plots. When taking inventory, a decision has to be made about which types of plots to measure. There are several different types of plots. The two most common types are fixed radius and variable radius, also known as prism radius. In a fixed radius plot, the forester finds the center of a plot and every tree within a certain fixed distance away from that point is measured. Variable radius plots are used more for inventory of volume. During this method, an angle is created and projected from the plot center and all trees that are larger than the projected right angle are measured with a ruler called a Tunagmetor.|$|E

5000|$|CCF is an {{approach}} to forest management which respects the characteristics and processes inherent to the site, and will normally involve a mixture of tree species and ages. In French, it {{is referred to as}} sylviculture irrégulière, continue et proche de la nature (SICPN) (i.e., continuous, irregular and close to nature silviculture), and in German as Dauerwald, or naturgemässe waldwirtschaft (close to nature forestry). [...] Management is based on the selection and promotion of individual trees, of all sizes, rather than the creation of areas with trees of uniform size. Any monitoring of the development of irregular stand structures will be achieved through periodic re-measurement of stem diameters in sample plots or across whole stands. Repeated interventions, typically at intervals of between 3 and 7 years, focus on the removal of trees which are interfering with the growth of trees with greater potential, the harvesting of crop trees at their optimum size, and the promotion of regeneration and small trees, such that an irregular <b>stand</b> <b>structure</b> is maintained in perpetuity.|$|E
50|$|Following Roman Abramovich's takeover, Chelsea have {{examined}} expanding their current home at Stamford Bridge to {{a capacity of}} over 50,000.

A further stumbling block is that the club's naming rights are owned by the Chelsea Pitch Owners, which also owns the Stamford Bridge freehold. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge. A move to a new stadium could mean the club having to change their name.
