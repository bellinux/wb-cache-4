5|$|Also {{beginning}} in 2012, <b>sighted</b> guides became eligible to receive medals in certain events; <b>sighted</b> goalkeepers in 5-a-side football, along with guides and pilots in athletics and cycling and boccia assistants were {{now able to}} receive medals for their contributions. Previously {{in the case of}} tandem cycling, where a visually-impaired rider takes the rear of the bike with a <b>sighted</b> pilot in front, only the visually-impaired rider actually received a medal.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinand Magellan {{may have}} <b>sighted</b> Caroline Island on February 4, 1521.|$|E
50|$|Iron <b>sights</b> are {{typically}} {{composed of two}} component <b>sights,</b> formed by metal blades: a rear <b>sight</b> mounted perpendicular {{to the line of}} <b>sight</b> and a front <b>sight</b> that is a post, bead, or ring. Open <b>sights</b> use a notch of some sort as the rear <b>sight,</b> while aperture <b>sights</b> use some form of a circular hole. Civilian, hunting, and police firearms usually feature open <b>sights,</b> while many military battle rifles employ aperture <b>sights.</b>|$|R
2500|$|To {{increase}} shooting accuracy {{they employ}} shooting support {{devices such as}} [...] the holographic weapon <b>sight,</b> AMT reflex <b>sights,</b> Schmidt & Bender 1.5 - 6 x 42 daylight <b>sights,</b> Simrad KN250F night vision <b>sights,</b> Zeiss Diavari daylight <b>sights,</b> Varo AN/PVS-4 night vision <b>sights,</b> EDS laser <b>sights</b> and Sure-Fire flashlights.|$|R
50|$|Any type of <b>sight</b> can be used, except laser <b>sights.</b> Many {{competitors}} use iron <b>sights,</b> but {{the recent}} trend has been towards red dot <b>sights,</b> which many shooters find easier to use. Telescopic <b>sights,</b> while legal, are rare, as magnification is not considered an advantage. Iron <b>sights</b> are usually adjustable Patridge type <b>sights,</b> carefully treated to reduce glare that might impact <b>sight</b> alignment.|$|R
5|$|Humpback whales {{have been}} <b>sighted</b> {{in the lower}} region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island. For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good {{locations}} to see humpback whales {{from a safe distance}} of about a quarter mile. Other marine whales <b>sighted</b> are grey, minke, fin, and killer whales (orcas).|$|E
5|$|A later {{claim of}} a live {{individual}} <b>sighted</b> in 1852 on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has been accepted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Amchitka {{is said to}} {{have been}} seen and named St. Makarius by Bering in 1741, was <b>sighted</b> by Billings in 1790, and visited by Shishmaref in 1820.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sight</b> {{distance}} {{allows the}} driver to assess developing situations and take actions appropriate for the conditions. <b>Sight</b> distance relies on drivers being aware of and paying attention to their surroundings and driving appropriately for conditions presented. For the purposes of design, <b>sight</b> distance is considered in terms of stopping <b>sight</b> distance, passing <b>sight</b> distance, and decision <b>sight</b> distance. For additional information, see the following chapters: Chapter Subject 1250 <b>Sight</b> distance at railroad crossings 1310 <b>Sight</b> distance at intersections at grade 1320 <b>Sight</b> distance at roundabouts 1340 <b>Sight</b> distance at driveways 1515 <b>Sight</b> distance for shared-use path...|$|R
40|$|The {{driver of}} a vehicle needs to see far enough ahead to assess {{developing}} situations and take actions appropriate for the conditions. For the purposes of design, <b>sight</b> distance is considered in terms of stopping <b>sight</b> distance, passing <b>sight</b> distance, and decision <b>sight</b> distance. For additional information, see the following chapters: Chapter Subject 1250 <b>Sight</b> distance at railroad crossings 1310 <b>Sight</b> distance at intersections at grade 1320 <b>Sight</b> distance at roundabouts 1340 <b>Sight</b> distance at road approaches 1515 <b>Sight</b> distance for shared-use path...|$|R
50|$|The {{complementing}} rear <b>sight</b> element {{may be an}} open type iron <b>sight</b> or an aperture <b>sight</b> as used in ghost {{rings and}} target aperture <b>sights</b> such as a target shooting diopter <b>sight.</b>|$|R
5|$|Land mammals <b>sighted</b> in Glacier Bay are: blue bears (glacier), moose, Sitka black-tailed deer, {{mountain}} goat, wolf, coyote, lynx, wolverine, marmots, {{land and}} river otters, weasels, ermine, mink, squirrels, beaver and red fox. Porcupines, voles, shrews, hares, and bats are also found.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} {{including}} treepies, bulbuls, babblers, mynahs and crows were noted. In 2010, {{the first ever}} bird survey was conducted in the Sathyamangalam forests. A total of 230 species of birds were recorded in the survey. In 2010, a small population of critically endangered Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and three other species of vultures were discovered to be thriving in the Moyar river valley. 20 nests were <b>sighted</b> and the population was estimated to consist up of 40 adults. Last <b>sighted</b> in {{the region in the}} 1970s, the rediscovery of the vulture, a bird rapidly disappearing from India, has been significant. Diclofenac, which caused the decline of vulture population was banned in 2006 and since then, vulture numbers have started to grow back.|$|E
5|$|Migration {{patterns}} are poorly understood. Each summer, the same individuals appear off {{the coasts of}} British Columbia and Washington. Despite decades of research, where these animals go {{for the rest of}} the year remains unknown. Transient pods have been <b>sighted</b> from southern Alaska to central California.|$|E
2500|$|The iron <b>sight</b> {{line was}} {{redesigned}} and featured a rear receiver aperture battle <b>sight</b> calibrated for [...] {{with an additional}} ladder aperture <b>sight</b> that could be flipped up and was calibrated for [...] in [...] increments. This <b>sight</b> line like other aperture <b>sight</b> lines proved to be faster and more accurate than the typical mid-barrel rear <b>sight</b> elements <b>sight</b> lines offered by Mauser, previous Lee–Enfields or the Buffington battle <b>sight</b> of the 1903 Springfield.|$|R
50|$|A tang <b>sight</b> is {{the rear}} <b>sight</b> {{of a pair}} of iron <b>sights</b> used to aim or align a rifle so the bullet fired will hit the target. The <b>sight</b> is {{attached}} to the tang: a steel plate extending toward the butt from a rifle receiver for attachment of the receiver to a wooden buttstock. A tang <b>sight</b> often offers the maximum <b>sight</b> radius, or distance between the front and rear <b>sights</b> attached to the rigid receiver and barrel assembly of a rifle. Large <b>sight</b> radius decreases bullet placement errors caused by <b>sight</b> misalignment.|$|R
5000|$|... {{replacing}} the Russian <b>sight</b> with a Pak 38 style anti-tank <b>sighting</b> block that could mount the standard ZF3x8 <b>sighting</b> telescope or an emergency fold out iron <b>sight.</b> Like the Pak 40 and Pak 97/38, the <b>sight</b> mount had provision for attaching an indirect <b>sighting</b> device - the Aushilfsrichtmittel 38 (ARM38).|$|R
5|$|On 1 April, Triton spotted Mactan Island, {{and shortly}} before noon, <b>sighted</b> the {{monument}} (pictured) commemorating {{the death of}} Ferdinand Magellan at that site, thereby reaching the midpoint of her circumnavigation.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940 the Germans {{launched}} Operation Weserübung. Poor visibility enabled {{most of the}} German invasion fleet {{to evade}} detection {{until it was too}} late. Reconnaissance aircraft of Coastal Command had <b>sighted</b> and reported movements of the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau on 7 April. However, they were believed to be on exercise and not operations. They were <b>sighted</b> again the next day by No. 204 Squadron RAFs Sunderlands. Coastal Command was now ordered to carry out extensive reconnaissance operations in the North Sea and around the Norwegian Coast. It was the Command's reconnaissance operations that located the German cruiser Königsberg in Bergen fjord. Blackburn Skuas of No. 800 and 803 Squadrons FAA sank the vessel.|$|E
5|$|On Easter Sunday, 17 April, Triton <b>sighted</b> the Cape of Good Hope and {{subsequently}} re-entered the South Atlantic Ocean, {{returning to the}} command authority of Rear Admiral Lawrence R. Daspit (COMSUBLANT).|$|E
50|$|The SUIT <b>sight</b> is a 4× {{telescopic}} <b>sight</b> with tritium-powered illumination, utilised at dusk or dawn. The {{full name}} is the L2A2 <b>Sight</b> Unit Infantry Trilux. The <b>sight</b> is not {{designed as a}} sniper <b>sight,</b> but was issued to designated marksmen. The <b>sight</b> was mounted on the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle or GPMG.|$|R
50|$|The carbine {{also has}} a {{different}} <b>sighting</b> arrangement than the Tantal rifle, with a newly designed rear <b>sight.</b> The open-type flip <b>sight</b> with both 100-200 and 400 m settings is installed {{at the rear of}} an extended <b>sight</b> rail protected by ears, which is riveted to the rear <b>sight</b> base. The <b>sight</b> has two settings, “1 i 2” and “4” (that correspond to firing ranges from 100 to 200 m and 400 m respectively). The flip <b>sight</b> locks in position with a spring detent. The adjustable front <b>sight</b> post is screwed into the front <b>sight</b> base that is installed in the gas block. The Onyks can be fitted with tritium night <b>sights,</b> similar to those used in the wz. 88 Tantal. Recesses cut into both sides of the <b>sight</b> rail are used to mount optical <b>sights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Optical <b>sights</b> {{are fairly}} common {{for use on}} airsoft rifles; mostly red dot <b>sights</b> for {{short-range}} use, and telescopic <b>sights</b> for longer-range use. These range from inexpensive <b>sights</b> designed for use on pellet guns and [...]22 rifles, to mid-range <b>sights,</b> usually inexpensive replicas of actual rifle <b>sights</b> (such as replicas of the M68 Aimpoint, Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG), and imitation holographic weapon <b>sights</b> that are actually just red dot <b>sights),</b> to actual <b>sights</b> designed for use on rifles, including the EOTech holographic <b>sights,</b> and the Trijicon ACOGs. Replica (or [...] "clone") <b>sights</b> are much cheaper than their real counterparts, but are usually unlicensed, much less durable and reliable, {{and should not be}} used with real firearms where violent recoil may damage them or throw the <b>sight</b> off zero. Most optical <b>sights</b> are mounted on a MIL-STD-1913 rail, while other guns, including replicas of Kalashnikovs, MP5s and G36s may have specific proprietary mounts.|$|R
5|$|Only {{birds that}} are {{considered}} to have established, self-sustaining, wild populations are included on this list. This means that birds {{that are considered}} probable escapees, although {{they may have been}} <b>sighted</b> flying free, are not included.|$|E
5|$|The Dutchman Willem Barentsz {{made the}} first indisputable {{discovery}} of the archipelago in 1596, when he <b>sighted</b> its coast while searching for the Northern Sea Route.|$|E
5|$|The only {{fish species}} ever <b>sighted</b> in the lake, and {{on just one}} occasion, is Pagothenia borchgrevinki, though it is {{commonly}} found in the vicinity in the coastal areas and fjords of the Vestfold Hills.|$|E
50|$|The {{fire control}} system {{includes}} a gunner's day <b>sight,</b> PNK-6 commander's panoramic <b>sighting</b> system, PTT-2 thermal imaging <b>sight,</b> anti-aircraft <b>sight</b> and {{anti-aircraft machine gun}} control system. Detection range of targets for thermal <b>sighting</b> system is up to 8 km.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Patridge's <b>sighting</b> {{system has}} become a {{standard}} for many American handguns. His arrangement replaced the thinner front blade <b>sight</b> coupled with a u-notch rear <b>sight</b> that many earlier revolvers employed {{in favor of a}} front post <b>sight</b> with parallel vertical sides and a flat top and a rear <b>sight</b> with a rectangular rear notch. The walls of the rear <b>sight</b> are parallel {{to each other and to}} those of the blade providing a superior <b>sight</b> picture to the older <b>sighting</b> system. This [...] "front post, rear notch" [...] <b>sight</b> is familiar to most modern shooters.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} Model 1916 night (Luminous) <b>sights</b> were issued during World War I. The rear night <b>sight</b> {{is a small}} brass plate that is placed {{underneath}} the rear <b>sight</b> leaf. The front <b>sight</b> clamps around the rifle's front <b>sight</b> base.|$|R
5|$|Visual Impairment – Athletes {{with visual}} {{impairment}} ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment {{of one or more}} component of the visual system (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex). The <b>sighted</b> guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete {{with visual impairment}} and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides (along with <b>sighted</b> goalkeepers in 5-a-side football became eligible to receive medals of their own.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh calls were made when a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' calls were given when a bird <b>sighted</b> a human near the enclosure.|$|E
5|$|According {{to various}} organisations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, Russian State Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic, among others), ships captained by three men <b>sighted</b> Antarctica or its ice shelf in 1820: von Bellingshausen (a {{captain in the}} Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut).|$|E
50|$|The trigger {{action is}} single action and {{completely}} adjustable. The <b>sights</b> {{are of a}} square-section type, with fixed front <b>sight</b> and a rear <b>sight</b> with lateral and vertical adjustment. The <b>sight</b> radius is 218 mm (from rear to front <b>sight).</b>|$|R
