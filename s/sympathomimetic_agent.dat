Material and methods. 40 patients with persistent BA of various severities with respiratory insufficiency and <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> overdose were investigated.

Mean QTc dispersion correlated with asthma severity and was 76, 8 ± 5, 9 ms 1 / 2, 87, 9 ± 5, 1 ms 1 / 2, 87, 8 ± 3, 1 ms 1 / 2 in patients with mild, moderate and severe BA, respectively. Significant correlation between QTc dispersion and BA duration was found. QTc dispersion level was directly connected with duration of use of β-agonists and their overdose. Average QTc dispersion in patients who used more than 20 daily doses of inhaled β-agonists was 89, 0 ± 5, 8 ms 1 / 2. Conclusion. Increase in QTc dispersion directly depends on BA duration and severity. β-agonist overdose results in growth of QTc dispersion, which has arrhythmogenic potential. </p...|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} case reports of ephedra-associated {{myocarditis}} [49 – 51]. Ephedra {{is a potent}} <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> with direct and indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. An adverse effect of adrenergic stimulation is myocyte toxicity [52]. Naik et al. [52] described two men, aged 19 and 21  years respectively, who were admitted on separate occasions with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to ephedra. Methamphetamine is a <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> that causes sympathetic stimulation by excessive release of noradrenaline and blockade of re-uptake at the sympathetic synaptic receptors. Several case reports have documented reversible dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to methamphetamine use [53, 54]. A case report by Lopez et al. [55] evaluated the CMR appearances in a patient presenting with cardiomyopathy secondary to methamphetamine. CMR demonstrated a reduced ejection fraction of 37 % but no evidence of LGE, indicating no acute myocardial inflammation. The patient improved following treatment and repeat CMR showed improved ejection fraction to 64 %. In our institution, we have recently encountered a patient with mephedrone-associated myocarditis. Mephedrone is a cathinone derivative that is purchasable legally on the Internet or in ‘head-shops’. This substance bears similar pharmacological and structural similarities to amphetamine. This is {{also referred to as}} ‘meow’, ‘meph’, ‘rush’ and ‘roxy’. People presenting to hospital after taking mephedrone describe a number of cardiovascular signs, agitation and sometimes a drug-induced psychosis [56].

40|$|Background Resveratrol is a cardioprotective {{agent with}} known {{antiarrhythmic}} effects that {{has recently been}} shown to inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme activity. Thus, {{it is possible that}} resveratrol increases the inotropic effect of <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agents,</b> as PDE inhibitors do but, unlike other PDE inhibitors, its effect may not be accompanied by proarrhythmia due to its antiarrhythmic action. This work is aimed to test this hypothesis. Methods This is an “in vitro” concentration-response relationship study. The effects of noradrenaline, tyramine and isoproterenol, alone or in combination with either resveratrol or with the typical PDE inhibitor 3 -isobutylmethylxantine (IBMX), were studied in electrically driven strips of right ventricle or in the spontaneously beating free wall of the right ventricle of rat heart in order to investigate inotropic or proarrhythmic effects respectively. Also, the effects of resveratrol or IBMX on the sinoatrial node rate were examined in the isolated right atria of rat heart. Results Resveratrol (10 µM and 100 µM) produces a leftward shift in the concentration-response curves for the contractile effects of noradrenaline, tyramine or isoproterenol and reduces the –log EC 50 values of these three agents. IBMX produces similar effects. The spontaneous ventricular beating rate was increased by all three compounds, an effect that was further enhanced by the addition of IBMX. In contrast, resveratrol (100 µM) abolished the effects of these <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> on the ventricular rate. Resveratrol (1 – 100 µM) had no effect on the sinoatrial node rate, while IBMX produce a concentration dependent sinoatrial tachycardia. Discussion Taken together, the finding, indicate that resveratrol, like the PDE inhibitor IBMX enhances the contractile effects of <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> but, in contrast to IBMX, it does not enhance their proarrhythmic effect or produce sinoatrial tachycardia. This is most probably consequence of the antiarrhythmic effect of resveratrol which protect against the proarrhythmic effects resulting from PDE inhibition...|$|R

40|$|In {{patients}} with COPD bronchodilators improve lung function {{to some extent}} and relieve dyspnoea. Within short-acting bronchodilators, ipratropium (anticholinergic agent) is as effective as salbutamol (<b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agent)</b> with fewer adverse effects. Presently, maintenance therapy is based on long-acting inhaled bronchodilators. Tiotropium (anticholinergic agent) once a day has a better efficacy to adverse effects ratio than salmeterol or formoterol (sympathomimetic agents) twice a day. Inhaled steroids (fluticasone, budesonide) are also able to improve lung function slightly and to relieve symptoms, but have no beneficial effect on the accelerated rate of decline in lung function that characterizes COPD.

40|$|Accommodation is {{controlled}} by the action of the ciliary muscle and mediated primarily by parasympathetic input through postganglionic fibers that originate from neurons in the ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia. During accommodation the pupil constricts to increase the depth of focus of the eye and improve retinal image quality. Researchers have traditionally faced the challenge of measuring the accommodative properties of the eye through a small pupil and thus have relied on pharmacological agents to dilate the pupil. Achieving pupil dilation (mydriasis) without affecting the accommodative ability of the eye (cycloplegia) could be useful in many clinical and research contexts. Phenylephrine hydrochloride (PHCl) is a <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> that is used clinically to dilate the pupil.

In Group 2, infusion thera py and <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> were prescribed depending {{on the results of}} TPTD. Results. Patients in both groups did not differ in the examined clinical and laboratory indicators. On day 1 of intensive therapy, in Group 2 (a TPTD controlled intensive treatment group) the prescription of sympathomimetic drugs was virtually twice more active than in Group 1; and the value of positive hydrobalance was, twice less. In 5 days, the frequency of use of <b>sympathomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> had no intergroup differences and, in 7 days became less in Group 2 patients. After the therapy patients in Group 2 did not require substantial amounts of infusion and great positive hydrobalance, resulting in lower central venous pressure (CVP) values.
