5|$|The lone {{surviving}} Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, {{has been}} a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can <b>shine</b> <b>on</b> Henry I's judicial system, {{as well as on}} the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two {{entrance}}s and exits. The main station entrance and ventilation building {{consists of four}} escalators and an elevator {{on the west side}} of Hudson Boulevard between 33rd and 34th Streets. The main entrance has a turtle shell-shaped glass canopy above it that allows light to <b>shine</b> <b>on</b> the upper mezzanine. The elevator is located south of 34th Street in Hudson Park, while the escalator entrance is located further east, closer to the boulevard. At the time of construction, the ventilation building was designed so developers could built on top of it later. The 55 Hudson Yards skyscraper, whose structure is partially atop the ventilation tower, started construction in January 2015, and pictures in May 2016 showed that the skyscraper had so far been constructed to the height of the ventilation tower.|$|E

25|$|Matthew Hoggard was a {{specialist}} orthodox swing bowler, and usually took the new ball for England in Test cricket. Hoggard's primary {{role in the}} team was to utilise the <b>shine</b> <b>on</b> the new ball to test the technique of top-order batsmen against the swinging delivery. If, due to pitch or atmospheric conditions, the new ball did not swing he could be ineffective. Hoggard {{was seen as the}} consistent bowler in the team. Hoggard also had a sound defensive batting technique, but was not known for scoring runs, averaging only 7.40 with the bat. He could block up an end for the batsman at the other end to score, and was also used as a nightwatchman.|$|E

25|$|The topmost {{portion of}} the {{memorial}} consists of a larger-than-life figure of a woman representing the South. The orientation of the figure and its face is toward the south, in part to honor the Confederacy but also so that the sun may <b>shine</b> <b>on</b> {{the face of the}} figure at all times (which is symbolic of being favored). The figure's head is crowned with an olive wreath, which is both sacred to Minerva (Roman goddess of war and wisdom) and a symbol of peace. The figure's left hand extends a laurel wreath toward the south in acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by the South's men in arms and {{as a symbol of the}} past. The figure holds a pruning hook in its right hand, which in turn rests on a plow. This represents peace and reconciliation as well as the hope that the labor of the South will lead to new glory.|$|E
