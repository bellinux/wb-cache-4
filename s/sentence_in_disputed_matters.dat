The Exchanges may, as they develop, afford facilities for washing, clothes-mending, and for non-alcoholic refreshments to persons who are attending them.

Boy labour will be dealt with in conjunction with the local Education Authorities; and travelling expenses may be advanced on loan, if the management of the Exchange think fit, to persons for whom situations have been found.|$|R

In 1701 he became Archdeacon of Totnes and received a prebend in Exeter Cathedral.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This thesis {{argues that}} {{in the second half}} of the 19 th century, the Iraqi provinces of the Ottoman Empire {{constituted}} a frontier of imperial contestation between the Ottoman and British empires. The Ottoman Empire sought establish political hegemony over these far-flung provinces through military conquest and a program of developmentalist and colonialist policies in order to defend against the expansion of British strategic interests in the Persian Gulf. Simultaneously, a network of British commercial and diplomatic interests in Iraq sought to create conditions favorable to British economic expansion into this region, adopting strategies of "informal empire. " This contestation is visible <b>in</b> repeated <b>disputes</b> over <b>matters</b> of commercial shipping and the public health policies of quarantine in the face of plague and cholera. Through records of incidents involving the Baghdad-based and British-owned Lynch Brothers shipping firm, I argue that neither the Ottoman nor the British empires achieved the level of dominance that they sought in the region...|$|R

It is concerned with discussing this anticipation and in what way does Syari’ah offer the way-out to resolve such a <b>dispute</b> <b>in</b> <b>matters</b> relating to financial contract. The paper argues that the ability of such system as Syari’ah to resolve problems and offer solution for disputes can be an indicator whether the system can be judged as an ideal or not.

The Yogyakarta people undoubtedly perceive religion practices as more than cultural practices. The article will demonstrate that <b>dispute</b> <b>in</b> religious <b>matters</b> have never become the main trigger of conflict between religious groups.
