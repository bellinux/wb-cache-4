50|$|The {{mechanics}} of the car remained much the same with 1.1 and 1.4 petrol engines and Hydragas suspension, but there was now the option of a Peugeot-sourced 1.5 diesel rather than the previous 1.4. The exterior was altered {{in an attempt to}} disguise the car's age, meet the increased cooling requirements of the Peugeot motor and offer a reduced-format Rover family grille. This was achieved through fitment of new front and rear bumpers, <b>sill</b> <b>covers,</b> rear boot handle and headlamps, bonnet and grille.|$|R
5000|$|The updated Coupé, {{introduced}} {{after the}} German industrial holidays {{in the autumn}} of 1984, was given new, slightly sloped radiator grille and headlights, a large wrap-around bumper with integrated spotlights and turn signals, plastic <b>sill</b> <b>covers,</b> and the large rear spoiler from the Audi Quattro. These changes brought the drag coefficient down to 0.36. A new dashboard was also introduced, as was a new interior. GL and standard versions were cancelled for model year 1987 and all FWD Coupés were from then referred to as [...] "Coupé GT".|$|R
50|$|The Red Line had a {{standard}} torque-sensing limited-slip differential, standard StabiliTrak stability control, and an enhanced sport suspension over the standard Sky (available as a dealer-add on for regular Skys). Other exterior enhancements included dual exhausts, 18-inch wheels, and a specific front fascia modeled for the Red Line. On the inside the Red Line {{had a special}} leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, special embroidery on the seats and floormats, metallic door <b>sill</b> <b>covers</b> and stainless steel pedals, special tachometer and gauges, and a digital boost gauge in the Driver Information Center. The Red Line model started shipping {{in the third quarter}} of 2006, with a retail price starting at $29,795.|$|R

5000|$|Option X83 (Japan), X84 (non-USA) and X85 (USA), the Turbo S Flachbau, was {{available}} in the US as a $60,179 USD option {{on top of the}} base price $99,000 USD Turbo 3.6. The flachbau option {{was available}} when ordering the no charge '36S' option '1994 Turbo [...] "S" [...] Model' at a price of $60,179. In addition to the slantnose fenders, it also included the 'X88' option which included the 'Turbo S' motor, the 'X92' Exclusive front spoiler, 'X93' Exclusive rear spoiler and 'X99' Exclusive rear fender vents. The flachbau option was designed around the model 968 front end, and the 930 style Turbo S front end for Japan (right down to the <b>sill</b> <b>covers</b> on the fenders). 39 Models were made for US markets, 27 for international market and 10 for Japan, all in Polar Silver (http://flachbau.com).|$|R
5000|$|To {{produce a}} faster {{version of the}} Fastback Rapier, Rootes {{developed}} the H120. Based on the Rapier, the H120 had a more powerful version of the [...] engine specially developed by Holbay Engineering. It produced [...] (gross) at 5,200 rpm and was fitted with a special cylinder head, high lift camshaft, tuned length four-branch exhaust manifold, special distributor and twin Weber 40DCOE carburetters. The H120 had a close ratio gearbox, a heavy duty overdrive and a high ratio rear axle. To add to its sporty image, the H120 had wider Rostyle wheels, broad side flashes, polished <b>sill</b> <b>covers,</b> a matt black radiator grille and a new boot lid incorporating a faired-in spoiler. To further distinguish the model from others in the range, it had H120 badges on the front wings and in {{the centre of the}} grille.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the church was changed in the later 18th century, in French Neoclassical style. [...] created the stucco designs. He added Corithian columns, a Neoclassical <b>sill</b> and <b>covered</b> the Gothic vaulting rib with stucco garlands. Walls and ceiling were covered by white and yellow stucco. Stucco reliefs show scenes {{from the life of}} Jesus (nave) and from the life of Bernard of Clairvaux (choir). Oil paintings {{on the walls of the}} side aisles show saints or beatified members of the Cistercian order.|$|R
40|$|During the {{investigation}} of the interior of Hagia Sophia Cathedral in Istanbul in search of Cyrillic inscriptions, Russian epigraphists discovered an inscrip­tion that was later identified as comprised of Scandinavian runes. In 2011, the present author had the opportunity to study it herself. The inscription is lo­cated on a marble windowsill in the eastern wall of the northern first floor gallery, a <b>sill</b> <b>covered</b> with many Cyrillic (mostly of {{the second half of the}} twelfth to the mid-thirteenth century) and Greek graffiti. The c. 27 cm long line of runes reads a͡rịṇba͡rþrr͡aṣṭruna͡rþasi, Old Norse Arinbárðr rеist rúnar þessar [older: þā(ʀ) si], ‘Arinbárðr cut these runes’. The inscription appears to be cut fairly regularly but demonstrates some paleographic idio­syncrasies, e. g. all r-runes (also in a͡r) have sharply pointed tops. Some distinctive features in­clude the consistent usage of the bind-rune a͡r whenever a combination of a and r is employed (four times, once for r͡a) and the absence of the ʀ-rune in older rūnaʀ. Though neither peculiarity provides firm grounds for dating the in­scrip­tion, it was most probably produced in the second half of the eleventh or first half of the twelfth century and most likely carved by a Scandi­navian merce­nary in the service of the Byzantine emperor...|$|R
500|$|Uplift {{eventually}} {{exposed the}} crystalline complex to erosion. Arkose conglomerate and mudstone {{of the lower}} Crystal Spring Formation were created from muddy debris derived from stream erosion of these uplands. A warm shallow sea spread over the area as the Amargosa aulacogen slowly subsided; thick sequences of lime-rich ooze with abundant colonies of algae called stromatolites were then laid down. Dolomite and limestone resulted, forming the middle part of the Crystal Spring Formation. The upper part was formed after silt and sand destroyed the algal mat, forming siltstone and sandstone. Laterally extensive diabase sills of molten rock later intruded {{above and below the}} carbonate rock layers; commercial grade talc was formed from thermal decay of carbonate rock at its contact with the lowest <b>sill,</b> which <b>covers</b> hundreds of square miles (many hundreds of km²). Today the formation is [...] thick.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sedimentary}} rocks within the Paleozoic Parnaiba basin in NE Brazil were intruded by voluminous tholeiitic diabase <b>sills</b> and <b>covered</b> by coeval basaltic flows. This paper presents lithogeochemical data of borehole samples obtained from wells {{located in the}} eastern portion of the Parnaiba basin. The diabases are subalkaline tholeiitc rocks comprising three high-TiO 2 and three low-TiO 2 suites that are unrelated by differentiation processes. Fractional crystallization of olivine and augite was the predominantly evolutionary processes within individual high- and low-TiO 2 suites as depicted by trace element geochemical modelling, exception being made for one low-TiO 2 suite that evolved by AFC. Parental compositions for both low- and high-TiO 2 suites are related with variably enriched, spinel harzburgitic sources likely to represent the heterogeneous subcontinental lithospheric mantle underneath the sedimentary basin. The geochemical provinciality of the Parnaiba tholeiitic magmatism seems unrelated with the Transbrasiliano Lineament but {{may be due to}} lithospheric mantle amalgamation and remobilization occurred during previous tectonic events...|$|R

The strong marine currents and the different nature of the waters (Mediterranean and Atlantic) that meet in the Strait play a main {{role in the development of}} the deep mounds because they are responsible for the elongated shape and Hthification that affect both coral mounds and hardgrounds between them. The term lithoherm, already used in the Strait of Florida, is adopted for these kinds of biogenic sediment...|$|R
50|$|A long {{rectangular}} cream-painted building, with {{a striking}} red trim picking {{out a number}} of element (posts, window <b>sills,</b> fascias and <b>cover</b> strips), the theatre is sheltered by a gable roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting crowned with a barrel-roofed ventilation ridge. The roof is concealed from the street by a three-part timber framed parapet with curved fibreboard panels. A bull nosed awning supported by bevelled timber posts with decorative Y-shaped brackets projects out from the building sheltering the footpath. The building is clad with chamferboards and stands on low concrete stumps. Metal screens run on rails along {{the north side of the}} building shading the large web lattice screen to the restaurant.|$|R
50|$|This {{building}} is located about 40m north {{west of the}} winder and compressor house. Its overall dimensions are approximately 13m by 6.5m. It is a large shed with a wooden frame, gable roof and corrugated iron cladding; the roof line runs east-west. There are door openings at {{the east and west}} elevations and window openings along the long, north and south elevations. All window and door openings are shaded by narrow strips of sheet metal, the windows have wooden <b>sills.</b> Many are <b>covered</b> with sheets of corrugated iron. Some are metal framed sash windows; others have no window frames or glazing. Remnants of wooden boards run along the tops of the north and south elevations. The west elevation has an unpainted wooden barge board. There is no guttering on the roof.|$|R
5000|$|Sills {{parallel}} beds (layers) and foliations in {{the surrounding}} country rock. They can be originally emplaced in a horizontal orientation, although tectonic processes may cause subsequent rotation of horizontal sills into near vertical orientations. Sills can be confused with solidified lava flows; however, there are several differences between them. Intruded sills will show partial melting and incorporation of the surrounding country rock. On both contact surfaces of the country rock into which the sill has intruded, evidence of heating will be observed (contact metamorphism). Lava flows will show this evidence only on the lower side of the flow. In addition, lava flows will typically show evidence of vesicles (bubbles) where gases escaped into the atmosphere. Because sills generally form at shallow depths (up to many kilometers) below the surface, the pressure of overlying rock prevents this from happening much, if at all. Lava flows will also typically show evidence of weathering on their upper surface, whereas <b>sills,</b> if still <b>covered</b> by country rock, typically do not.|$|R
5000|$|Magmatism was {{suggested}} {{as a cause}} of the Late Devonian extinction in 2002.The end of the Devonian Period was a time of extremely widespread trap magmatism and rifting in the Russian and Siberian platforms, which were situated above the hot mantle plumes and suggested {{as a cause of}} the Frasnian/Famennian and end Devonian extinctions.The Viluy and Pripyat-Dniepr-Donets large igneous provinces were suggested to correlate with the Frasnian/Famennian extinction and the Kola and Timan-Pechora magmatism {{was suggested}} to correspond to the end Devonian-Carboniferous extinction. Most recently, scientists have confirmed a correlation between Viluy traps (in the Vilyuysk region) on the Siberian Craton and the Kellwasser extinction by Ar/Ar dating.The Viluy Large igneous province covers most of the present day north-eastern margin of the Siberian Platform. The triple-junction rift system was formed during the Devonian Period; the Viluy rift is the western remaining branch of the system and two other branches form the modern margin of the Siberian Platform. Volcanic rocks are covered with post Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous sediments.Volcanic rocks, dyke belts, and <b>sills</b> that <b>cover</b> more than 320 × 103 km2, and a gigantic amount of magmatic material (more than 1000 × 103 km3) formed in the Viluy branch.Ages show that the two volcanic phase hypotheses are well supported and the weighted mean ages of each volcanic phase are 376.7 ± 3.4 and 364.4 ± 3.4 Ma or 373.4 ± 2.1 and 363.2 ± 2.0 Ma, which the first volcanic phase is in agreement with the age of 372.2 ± 3.2 Ma proposed for the Kellwasser event. However, the second volcanic phase is slightly older than Hangenberg event which place at 358.9 ± 1.2 Ma. Viluy magmatism may inject enough [...] and [...] into the atmosphere to generate a destabilised greenhouse and ecosystem, such as rapid global cooling, sea-level falls and marine anoxia occur during Kellwasser black shale deposition.|$|R
40|$|In the Yangliu Mine in Huaibei Coalfield, violent magma {{intrusion}} {{produced two}} layers of the igneous <b>cover</b> <b>sills</b> and the annular dike and caused the ejection of gas and water in the bed splitting from the surface well that destroyed the gas extraction system on the surface. The source, flow characteristics and hazard of the gas in bed splitting under igneous sills were researched via laboratory experiments, theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} shorter the distance from the igneous sill and the larger the thickness of the igneous sill, the greater will be the amount of the thermal evolution, the pyrolysis stoma, the coal adsorption and desorption ability and the risk of outburst, six coal samples collected at different distances from the igneous sill. The first breaking length of the igneous sill, the volume of the bed splitting, the gas pressure and flow rate in the bed splitting and the accumulative volume of the gas ejected from the surface well # 2 were theoretically calculated. The laws of the bed splitting development under the igneous sills were simulated, consistent with the theoretical calculation results. The regional control and prevention technologies for coal seam gas under igneous sills were proposed and applied. Then the safety of the first-mining seam production and the gas extraction in the adjacent seam and bed splitting via the surface well was ensured, and no accidental gas and water ejection occurred...|$|R
