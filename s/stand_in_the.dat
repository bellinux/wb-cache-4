Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact.

5|$|On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. This {{operation}} preempted Britain's own {{plans to}} invade Norway. Denmark surrendered immediately, and, after a short-lived {{attempt by the}} British to make a <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{northern part of the}} country, Norway also fell. The invasion of Norway was a combined forces operation in which the German war machine projected its power across the sea; this German success would come to be seen by the British as a dire portent.|$|E

It was a TV documentary, and a separate radio documentary.

5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on 5 July, the first encounter between American and North Korean forces. For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th made a final <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Taejon, where it was almost completely destroyed but delayed North Korean forces until July 20. By that time, the 8th Army′s force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.|$|E
5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain {{about their ability to}} withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E

5|$|Defoe {{was finally}} imprisoned on 21 May 1703, after {{avoiding}} his summons and evading capture. He was fined, made to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pillory on three occasions and remained in prison till November; in the meantime, his business affairs sank into ruin. The whole affair left {{a lasting impression}} on him, which can be felt in his writings. In the years following his arrest and release, Defoe made several attempts to explain The Shortest Way and his own viewpoint. Amongst the series of explanatory pamphlets doing this are An Explanation of a Late Pamphlet, Entituled, The Shortest Way… (1703) and A Dialogue Between a Dissenter and the Observator (1703). The suspected involvement of the Tory Speaker of the House, Robert Harley, in obtaining the release of Defoe is credited {{as the beginning of}} their professional relationship, in which Defoe worked as a propagandist for Harley, after he succeeded Nottingham as Secretary of State in 1704.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} phases of registration, 150 parties were {{registered}} with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission. This reduction from the 48 parties that stood in the 1999 legislative election was largely attributed to new an election law that allowed only parties that had won two percent of seats in the DPR, or three percent of seats in provincial and regental legislatures in half of the provinces to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004 election. Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganize into a new party.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Needham (died 3 May 1731), {{also known}} as Mother Needham, was an English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th-century London, who has been {{identified}} as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first plate of William Hogarth's series of satirical etchings, A Harlot's Progress. Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded of her life, and no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran afoul of the moral reformers of the day and {{died as a result of}} the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pillory.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, the Kop {{had been}} {{redesigned}} and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all standing. At the time, the Kop {{was the biggest}} football <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds. The increase in spectators did not fully restore Liverpool's fortunes; they scored 90 goals during the 1928–29 season, striker Gordon Hodgson scoring thirty of them, yet finished in fifth place. McQueen was unable to replicate his early triumphs with the club, and retired in 1928 after his leg was amputated following a road accident. He was replaced as manager by club secretary George Patterson. The club's fortunes did not improve under Patterson's leadership; they generally finished midtable. Their results were inconsistent; in September 1930, they lost 7–0 at West Ham United, yet nine days later they beat Bolton Wanderers 7–2 at Anfield.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{when the}} Crown {{prosecutor}} for Prince Albert resigned {{to become the}} Conservative Party's legislative candidate, Diefenbaker took his place as prosecutor. Diefenbaker did not <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1934 provincial election, in which the governing Conservatives lost every seat. Six days after the election, Diefenbaker resigned as Crown prosecutor. The federal government of Bennett was defeated the following year and Mackenzie King returned as Prime Minister. Judging his prospects hopeless, Diefenbaker had declined a nomination to stand again against Mackenzie King in Prince Albert. In {{the waning days of}} the Bennett government, the Saskatchewan Conservative Party President was appointed a judge, leaving Diefenbaker, who had been elected the party's vice president, as acting president of the provincial party.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, {{three months}} after the work was {{originally}} scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light. The sports minister signed off on £31million to complete the project. The redevelopment finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013–14 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. The work is due to be completed in 2015. On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after cracks in the structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium redevelopment had been ongoing behind the <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known if that was directly related. Originally planned for refurbishment as part of the redevelopment, it was later decided that the West Stand would be demolished and eventually replaced.|$|E
