5|$|On 21 April 1914, President Woodrow Wilson {{ordered the}} {{occupation}} of Veracruz. MacArthur joined the headquarters staff that {{was sent to the}} area, arriving on 1 May 1914. He realized that the logistic support of an advance from Veracruz would require the use of the railroad. Finding plenty of railroad cars in Veracruz but no locomotives, MacArthur set out to verify a report that {{there were a number of}} locomotives in Alvarado, Veracruz. For $150 in gold, he acquired a handcar and the services of three Mexicans, whom he disarmed. MacArthur and his party located five engines in Alvarado, two of which were only <b>switchers,</b> but the other three locomotives were exactly what was required. On the way back to Veracruz, his party was set upon by five armed men. The party made a run for it and outdistanced all but two of the armed men, whom MacArthur shot. Soon after, they were attacked by a group of about fifteen horsemen. MacArthur took three bullet holes in his clothes but was unharmed. One of his companions was lightly wounded before the horsemen finally decided to retire after MacArthur shot four of them. Further on, the party was attacked a third time by three mounted men. MacArthur received another bullet hole in his shirt, but his men, using their handcar, managed to outrun all but one of their attackers. MacArthur shot both that man and his horse, and the party had to remove the horse's carcass from the track before proceeding.|$|E
25|$|Queues is {{the term}} for social groups of A. ocellaris. This is because these fish form social hierarchies, or social rank, by “outliving” the more {{dominant}} members of the group. The dominant pair of each queue reproduces more compared to the subordinate fishes. This {{is the reason for}} why these individuals should adopt various tactics in which they increase their probability of attaining social dominance. There are two types of A. ocellaris, settlers and <b>switchers.</b> Settlers prefer shorter queues, while <b>switchers</b> will usually move after settlement. However, studies show that there is no difference in the characteristics between <b>switchers</b> and non-switchers, and there is no data demonstrating that A. ocellaris utilize the switching tactic for dominance. Although settlement preferences increase the likelihood of gaining social dominance, switching could have the function of increasing social dominance benefits after social dominance has been acquired.|$|E

50|$|A road <b>switcher</b> {{is a type}} of {{railroad}} locomotive which was originally employed for delivering or picking up railcars outside of a railroad yard. Both type and term are North American in origin, although similar types have been used elsewhere. Since the road <b>switcher</b> must work some distance away from a yard, it must be able to operate at road speeds, it must also have high-visibility while it is switching, and it must have the ability to run in both directions. Additionally, a road <b>switcher</b> must have the power rating and cooling capacity of a traditional road engine, and a road <b>switcher</b> must have high-speed (i.e., road) trucks, not low-speed (i.e., <b>switcher)</b> trucks. Modern road trucks are always equipped with (frictionless) roller bearings; <b>switcher</b> trucks were almost always equipped with (friction) plain bearings, until such bearings were outlawed in interchange service on railcars and locomotives.|$|R

Between 1954 and 1957 a total of 66 diesel-electric locomotives were purchased, including 25 Fairbanks-Morse H-24-66 Train Masters, and 40 H-16-44 smaller road <b>switchers,</b> two with steam generators to haul passenger trains.

25|$|Train crews favored #2450 {{due to the}} {{superior}} riding qualities of its Blomberg trucks, which ran more smoothly than the original AAR Type-A switcher trucks; being several tons heavier than a typical GP7 imparted a higher tractive effort, which was helpful when switching long cuts of cars. The Beep spent many years in lease service performing switching duties for the Port Terminal Railroad Association in Houston. In August, 1974 the unit was re-designated as #1160 {{as part of a}} general locomotive renumbering scheme. It was again renumbered along with the Santa Fe's few remaining EMD <b>switchers</b> and assigned #1460 in January, 1977.|$|E
25|$|The 0-6-0 {{configuration}} was {{the most}} widely used wheel arrangement for both tender and tank steam locomotives. The type was also widely used for diesel <b>switchers</b> (shunters). Because they lack leading and trailing wheels, locomotives of this type have all their weight pressing down on their driving wheels and consequently have a high tractive effort and factor of adhesion, making them comparatively strong engines for their size, weight and fuel consumption. On the other hand, the lack of unpowered leading wheels have the result that 0-6-0 locomotives are less stable at speed. They are therefore mostly used on trains where high speed is unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} striking features of a steam locomotive is its wheel arrangement which is largely a function of its intended application and purpose. The fundamental principle of design for 19th century steam locomotives was tractive force which relies on adhesion. A switching locomotive for example, is relatively low-powered but with a high starting tractive effort for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. These locomotives are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. <b>Switchers</b> are rail analogs to tugboats. For higher speeds, larger boilers were required which in turn {{led to the development}} of lead trucks.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{family of}} models of a {{bacterial}} population {{in a time}} vary-ing environment in which cells can transit between dormant and active states is constructed. It consists of a linear system of ordinary differ-ential equations for active and dormant cells with time-dependent co-efficients reflecting an environment which may be periodic or random, with alternate periods of low and high resource levels. The focus is on computing/estimating the dominant Lyapunov exponent, the fitness, and determining its dependence on various parameters and the two strategies – responsive and stochastic – by which organisms switch between dormant and active states. A responsive <b>switcher</b> responds to good and bad times by making timely and appropriate transitions while a stochastic <b>switcher</b> switches continuously {{without regard to the}} environmental state. The fitness of a responsive <b>switcher</b> is exam-ined and compared with fitness of a stochastic <b>switcher,</b> and with the fitness of a dormancy-incapable organism. Analytical methods show that both switching strategists have higher fitness than a dormancy-incapable organism when good times are rare and that responsive <b>switcher</b> has higher fitness than stochastic <b>switcher</b> when good times are either rare or common. Numerical calculations show that stochas-tic <b>switcher</b> can be most fit when good times are neither too rare or too common...|$|R
50|$|The hood unit {{evolved from}} the <b>switcher</b> locomotive. A <b>switcher's</b> long hood is {{normally}} low enough that the crew can see over it, and there typically is no short hood. Alco introduced the road <b>switcher</b> concept with the RS-1, which was an enlarged <b>switcher</b> with a short hood ahead of the cab. This was added to provide protection for the crew {{in case of a}} collision. The low long hood was retained, though its increased length made visibility over it useless. Later, EMD introduced the GP7, which had a similar layout, though both hoods were as high as the cab roof. The high long hood became standard for virtually all hood unit locomotives thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Although the GP20D is {{marketed as}} a <b>switcher,</b> {{it has a}} top speed of 70 mph, and is usually fitted with dynamic brakes, making it {{suitable}} for road <b>switcher</b> duties as well. The similar appearing EMD GP15D does not have dynamic brakes.|$|R
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} required regular and, {{compared to}} a diesel-electric engine, frequent service and overhaul (often at government-regulated intervals in Europe and the US). Alterations and upgrades regularly occurred during overhauls. New appliances were added, unsatisfactory features removed, cylinders improved or replaced. Almost {{any part of the}} locomotive, including boilers, was replaced or upgraded. When service or upgrades got too expensive the locomotive was traded off or retired. On the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad two 2-10-2 locomotives were dismantled; the boilers were placed onto two new Class T 4-8-2 locomotives and the residual wheel machinery made into a pair of Class U 0-10-0 <b>switchers</b> with new boilers. Union Pacific's fleet of 3-cylinder 4-10-2 engines were converted into two-cylinder engines in 1942, because of high maintenance problems.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 GE {{combined}} {{for the first}} time an internal combustion engine with electric traction motors. Impetus for wider adoption of this technology was provided by improved control systems introduced around 1920 and the State of New York's Kaufman Act, which banned the use of steam locomotives within the New York metropolitan area. A consortium consisting of ALCO, GE and Ingersoll Rand started series production of the ALCO-Boxcabs in 1925. ALCO dropped out of the arrangement in 1928, after acquiring their own diesel engine manufacturer in McIntosh & Seymour and went on to start its own line of diesel <b>switchers.</b> GE and Ingersoll Rand went on with the production of the former ALCO boxcabs, but without ALCO. The locomotives were built in the GE plant in Erie, Pennsylvania, except the unit for Canadian National Railway (CN), which was built by the railroad itself in their workshop. In total 17 were built.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} x86 {{architecture}} allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, {{and opens}} {{the possibility of using}} the Wine package to run Windows executables directly. Some fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since Mac OS X users can use a dual-boot setup or a Wine variant (such as CrossOver Mac or Darwine) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to <b>switchers,</b> since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of Mac OS X being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X. The OSx86 Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the Extensible Firmware Interface, it would not be run on Intel-based Macs. Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that Windows Vista will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.|$|E
