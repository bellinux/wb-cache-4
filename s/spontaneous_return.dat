40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} author and not of USAID. 2 This paper discusses the challenge of contemporary repatriation, which has been transformed from relatively small voluntary repatriations that are safe and follow fundamental changes to large returns to troubled countries where repatriation is often violent, compelled, and premature. Because the nature of return has a direct effect {{on the nature of the}} reintegration program, the paper discuss issues such as protracted complex emergencies; reintegration of returnees and restoration of civil society; coordination and closure of assistance; and rehabilitation, development, and funding shortfalls. This decade has seen a great variety of refugee repatriation and return. Although virtually all of the individual numbers and totals are suspect, they do reveal a broad pattern. Of the 14 million refugees who have returned home in the 1990 s, almost 90 percent are <b>spontaneous</b> <b>returns,</b> refugees making their own decision to go home without waiting for significant international assistance. In addition, they are not returning to post-conflict societies, they are returning during conflict to societies where there is no peace to keep or it is a fragile peace at best...|$|R

50|$|According to The World Factbook, in 2015 {{there were}} about 1 million {{registered}} and between 1.5 and 2.0 million undocumented refugees in Iran. The majority of these refugees were born in Iran {{during the last three}} and a half decades, however they are still considered citizens of Afghanistan. In 2016, there was a decrease of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>returns</b> from Iran by 21 per cent (316,430 in 2015 to 248,764 in 2016) and a decrease of deportations by 14 per cent (from 227,601 to 194,763) compared to 2015 figures.  Iran's initial response towards Afghan refugees, driven by religious solidarity, was an open door policy where Afghans in Iran had freedom of movement to travel or work in any city in addition to subsidies for gas, food and health coverage (Koepke, 2011),. Starting in the early 2000s when the Bureau for Aliens and Foreign Immigrants Affairs (BAFIA) of Iran started registration of all foreigners, including refugee, and issued temporary residence cards. In 2000, the Iranian government also initiated a joint repatriation program with the UNHCR. Since the 2000s, there have been laws passed in order to encourage the repatriation of Afghan refugees, such as limits on employment, areas of residence, and access to services including education.|$|R

40|$|Background. There {{have been}} few studies {{comparing}} the response to asphyxia {{and the effectiveness of}} typical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using exogenous epinephrine administration and manual closed-chest compression between total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational anaesthesia. Methods. Twenty pigs were randomly assigned to two study groups anaesthetized using either 2 % end-tidal iso¯urane (n= 10) or propofol (12 mg kg ± 1 h ± 1) ±fentanyl (50 mg kg ± 1) (n= 10). Asphyxia was induced by clamping the tracheal tube until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased to 40 % of the baseline value (40 % MAP time). The tracheal tube was declamped at that point, and CPR was performed. Haemodynamic parameters and blood samples were obtained before the induction of asphyxia, at 1 -min intervals during asphyxia, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 30 and 60 min after asphyxia. Results. TIVA maintained the MAP against hypoxia±hypercapnia stress signi®cantly longer than iso¯urane anaesthesia (mean (SD) 40 % MAP time 498 (95) and 378 (104) s respectively). In all animals in the iso¯urane group, <b>spontaneous</b> circulation <b>returned</b> within 1 min of the start of CPR. In six of the TIVA animals, <b>spontaneous</b> circulation <b>returned</b> for 220 (121) s; spontaneous circulation did not return within 5 min in the remaining four animals. Conclusions.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} traumatic aortic dissection associated with cardiac compression in a patient with anaphylactic cardiac arrest who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A 54 -year-old man who was scheduled to undergo surgery for gastric cancer went into cardiac arrest caused by an anaphylactic reaction to prophylactic antibiotics in the operating room. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was performed. CPR, including chest compressions, was performed for 35 minutes, and the patient {{was transferred to the}} intensive care unit (ICU) after <b>spontaneous</b> circulation <b>returned.</b> The patient received ECMO for 9 hours until confirmation of normal cardiac function on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Twenty days after cardiac arrest, an aortic dissection and fractures in the left fourth and fifth ribs due to chest compression were detected by abdominal computed tomography. The DeBakey type III aortic dissection extended from the distal arch of the thoracic aorta to the proximal level of the renal artery, involving the celiac trunk.

40|$|Multiple endotracheal {{intubation}} (ETI) attempts {{increase the risk}} of airway-related adverse events.

A 77 -year-old obese male suffered cardiopulmonary arrest after choking at a rehabilitation facility. <b>Spontaneous</b> circulation <b>returned</b> after chest compressions and foreign-body removal. After multiple failed direct laryngoscopies, the patient was transferred to our hospital.

Autopsy revealed severe oropharyngeal; laryngeal; and left lung lower lobe injury. The likely mechanisms of diffuse emphysema were: 1) oropharyngeal injury associated with multiple ETI attempts and excessive ventilation pressures and 2) left lung lower lobe injury associated with chest compressions and other resuscitative procedures. Multiple laryngoscopies can cause severe upper-airway injury, worsen respiratory status, and make ETI more difficult—a vicious circle that can be prevented by limiting ETI attempts. This is particularly important in unfavorable environments, in which backup devices and personnel are not easily obtained.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that active compression-decompression would improve resuscitation success in human subjects after cardiac arrest. Background. Active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a new method that improves cardiopulmonary hemodynamic function in animal models and humans after cardiac arrest. Methods. We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Patients were assigned to receive standard manual or active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The primary study end points were <b>spontaneous</b> <b>return</b> of circulation, 24 -h survival and survival to hospital discharge. Results. Fifty-three consecutive patients after cardiac arrest undergoing 64 resuscitation attempts were studied (30 women, 23 men; mean [± SD] age 71 ± 13 years, range 38 to 96). <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>return</b> of circulation was observed in 24 (47 %) of 53 patients and was increased in patients receiving active compression-decompression compared with those receiving standard manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (15 [60 %] of 25 vs. 9 [32 %] of 28, respectively, p = 0. 042); 24 -h survival was increased (12 [48 %] of 25 vs. 6 [21 %] of 28, respectively, p = 0. 041); and there was a trend toward improved survival to hospital discharge (6 [24 %]of 25 vs. 3 [11 %]of 28, respectively, p = 0. 198) when active compression-decompression was compared with standard manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Conclusions. Active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation improves return of spontaneous circulation and 24 -h survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

40|$|The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>return</b> of {{sensation}} in autologously reconstructed breasts, {{especially in the}} Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, generated the belief that sensory reinnervation by nerve repair of the flap would be superfluous. This study compares the sensation of the following non-reconstructed and reconstructed breasts: (I) non-operated breasts; (2) flaps of patients reconstructed with the Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap with sensory nerve repair; (3) flaps of patients reconstructed with the Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap without nerve repair; and (4) flaps of patients reconstructed with the free TRAM flap without nerve repair. Statistically significant lower pressure thresholds were found for DIEP flaps with nerve repair through Semmes-Weinstein testing. More segments of the DIEP flaps with nerve repair reacted to cold, warm and vibratory stimuli compared to flaps without nerve repair. Delayed but satisfactory sensory evoked potential responses were obtained for all reconstructed breasts, but in 46 % of TRAM flaps no response could be registered compared with 23 % and 0 % for DIEP flaps without and with nerve repair, respectively. Questionnaires confirmed the objective data and showed return of erogenous sensation in 30 % of the patients with DIEP flaps with nerve repair. Our data reconfirm the possibility of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>return</b> {{of sensation}} in pedicled and/or free lower abdominal flaps without nerve repair. Nerve repair in free DIEP flaps nevertheless does restore sensation earlier postoperatively, increases {{the quality and quantity}} of sensation in the flap and has a higher chance of providing erogenous sensation.

40|$|Background: <b>Spontaneous</b> {{circulation}} <b>returns</b> to {{less than}} half of adult cardiac arrest victims who received in-hospital resuscitation. One clue for this disheartening outcome arises from the prognosis that asystole invariably takes place, after a time lag, on diagnosis of brain stem death. The designation of brain stem death as {{the point of no return}} further suggests that permanent impairment of the brain stem cardiovascular regulatory machinery precedes death. It follows that a crucial determinant for successful revival of an arrested heart is that spontaneous circulation must resume before brain stem death commences. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that maintained functional integrity of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a neural substrate that is intimately related to brain stem death and central circulatory regulation, holds the key to the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation. Methodology/Principal Findings: An animal model of brain stem death employing the pesticide mevinphos as the experimental insult in Sprague-Dawley rats was used. Intravenous administration of lethal doses of mevinphos elicited an abrupt cardiac arrest, accompanied by elevated systemic arterial pressure and anoxia, augmented neuronal excitability and enhanced microvascular perfusion in RVLM. This period represents the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation in our experimental model. Animals with restored spontaneous circulation exhibited maintained neuronal functionality in RVLM beyond this critical time-window, alongside resumption of baseline tissu...|$|R

SpO 2 was 97 % on room air, and oxygen was delivered by a facemask at 7  L/min in the operating room. During anesthesia that was induced with incremental administration of propofol (total dose of 170  mg), spontaneous ventilation was manually assisted and was followed by manual positive pressure ventilation without any airway obstruction. However, complete airway obstruction occurred immediately after a size 4 LMA (LMA Supreme™, Teleflex Co., NC, USA) was inserted. Maneuvers including changing the LMA position and increasing and decreasing the volume of cuff air did not improve the difficult airway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spontaneous rhythmic and oxytocin-induced contractile activities of gravid rat myometrium in the presence and absence of Cl- (in the bathing medium) were studied in a tissue bath system. The effects of niflumic acid (a Cl- channel blocker) on spontaneous and oxytocin-induced contractile activities were also delineated. RESULTS: Replacement of Cl [...] containing Tyrode solution with Cl [...] free medium caused transient increase in myometrial contractile tone for about 15 min (possibly due to rapid efflux of Cl-) after which gradual failure of the spontaneous contractions led to myometrial quiescence within 1 h. Normal <b>spontaneous</b> contractions <b>returned</b> after replacing Cl [...] free medium with Tyrode solution. In Cl [...] free medium, oxytocin-induced contractions of the myometrium were significantly reduced by 44 &#x 00 B 1; 9 &#x 0025;. Niflumic acid (30 &#x 00 B 5;M) caused an increase in myometrial contractile tone for about 10 min followed by time-dependent inhibition of spontaneous contractions of the rat myometrium.

Of 22 men who underwent urodynamic investigation, only five had bladder outflow obstruction, who subsequently had successful prostatectomy; 15 showed either a low pressure-low flow system (seven) or complete detrusor failure (eight) and two showed pelvic parasympathetic nerve damage. With intermittent self catheterisation <b>spontaneous</b> voiding <b>returned</b> {{in all but one}} man within a median of 8 weeks (range 6 - 32 weeks). Recovery of bladder function took significantly longer in men with detrusor failure than in those with an underactive bladder (median 10 weeks (range 6 - 32 weeks) v median 8 weeks (range 6 - 8 weeks); p = 0. 05). Three months later all patients had re-established their own normal voiding pattern with minimal residual urine on ultrasonography and satisfactory flow rates. CONCLUSIONS [...] Postoperative urinary retention in elderly men is not an indication for prostatectomy; a normal pattern of micturition can be re-established by intermittent self catheterisation in most men...|$|R
