25|$|The {{automatic}} diluent valve (ADV) {{is used in}} a rebreather to add gas to {{the loop}} to compensate automatically for volume reduction due to pressure increase with greater depth or to make up gas lost from the system by the diver exhaling through the nose while clearing the mask or {{as a method of}} flushing the loop. They are often provided with a purge button to allow manual flushing of the loop. The ADV is virtually identical in construction and function to the open circuit demand valve, but does not have an exhaust valve. Some passive <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers</b> use the ADV to add gas to the loop to compensate for a portion of the gas discharged automatically during the breathing cycle as a way of maintaining a suitable oxygen concentration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers</b> {{used for}} diving may use active or passive gas {{addition}}, {{and the gas}} addition systems may be depth compensated. They use a mixed supply gas with a higher oxygen fraction than the steady state loop gas mixture. Usually only one gas mixture is used, {{but it is possible}} to switch gas mixtures during a dive to extend the available depth range of some SCRs.|$|E
50|$|As {{the divers}} {{penetrated}} {{deeper into the}} cave, the need for penetration below 9 m (the safe limit of oxygen diving) became more urgent, and the first attempt with an early aqualung nearly ended in tragedy. Following this incident, the group concentrated {{on the use of}} <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers</b> with oxygen/nitrogen mixtures (nitrox) suitable for the depth. In 1960 the way forward at Wookey Hole was found at a depth of 21 m, using 60/40 O2/N2. Rebreathers were also used successfully in South Wales, Derbyshire and Yorkshire.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{variants}} of rebreather [...] - [...] <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers,</b> and fully closed circuit rebreathers, which include the subvariant of oxygen rebreathers. Oxygen rebreathers have a maximum safe operating depth of around 6 m, but several types of fully closed circuit rebreathers, when using a helium-based diluent, can be used deeper than 100 m. The main limiting factors on rebreathers are {{the duration of the}} carbon dioxide scrubber, which is generally at least 3 hours, increased work of breathing at depth, reliability of gas mixture control, and the requirement to be able to safely bail out at any point of the dive.|$|E

5000|$|Jablonski {{has been}} setting records for cave {{penetration}} for many years. In 1995 he and Geologist Todd Kincaid pushed the Manatee Springs cave system to 11,074 feet. On April 25, 1997, Jablonski along with George Irvine and Brent Scarabin {{set a new}} penetration record of 11,000 feet in Wakulla Springs. They utilized Halcyon <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers</b> at an average depth of 285 feet. In July 1998 Jablonski, again diving with Irvine and Scarabin traveled 18,000 feet in Wakulla Springs O-Tunnel. Jablonski and his regular dive buddy WKPP director Casey McKinlay currently hold the world record for the longest ever penetration on a cave dive, at 26,000 feet while exploring [...] "Q" [...] tunnel of Wakulla Springs.|$|E

50|$|In 1940, Christian J. Lambertsen {{demonstrated}} his <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreather,</b> the Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit (LARU), for the U.S. Navy {{in connection}} with his proposal {{for the formation of}} military teams of underwater swimmers.|$|R
50|$|The fist Interspiro rebreather was the ACSC - the {{alternating}} {{closed and}} <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreather</b> which {{was developed and}} marketed in the 1980s. In the 1990s this design was developed further to become the DCSC, also intended for mine countermeasures.|$|R
50|$|Later the {{standard}} helmet was modified {{for use with}} helium mixtures for deep work. This incorporated a carbon dioxide scrubber attached {{to the back of}} the helmet, with a venturi powered circulation system to recycle the gas, making it effectively a <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreather,</b> much like the Dräger bubikopf helmet rebreather system.|$|R
50|$|The Halcyon RB80 is a non-depth-compensated passive {{addition}} <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreather</b> {{of similar}} external dimensions {{to a standard}} AL80 scuba cylinder (11-litre, 207-bar aluminium cylinder, 185 mm diameter and about 660 mm long). It was originally developed by Reinhard Buchaly (RB) in 1996 for the cave exploration dives conducted by the European Karst Plain Project (EKPP).|$|R
50|$|The DCSC is {{an active}} {{addition}} <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreather,</b> but has {{more in common with}} the passive addition systems, in that the amount of feed gas supplied {{is a function of the}} breathing rate of the diver. Unlike most passive addition rebreathers, the gas feed mass flow rate is independent of depth, and unlike most active addition systems, it is not constant mass flow.|$|R
5|$|An M24x2 {{male thread}} {{cylinder}} valve was supplied with some Dräger <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> recreational <b>rebreathers</b> (Dräger Ray) {{for use with}} nitrox mixtures. The regulator supplied with the rebreather had a compatible connection.|$|R
5|$|Closed-circuit or <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreather</b> scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|R
50|$|A <b>semi-closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreather</b> {{may have}} an {{endurance}} of about 3 to 10 {{times that of the}} equivalent open circuit dive, and is less affected by depth; gas is recycled but fresh gas must be constantly injected to replace at least the oxygen used, and any excess gas from this must be vented. Although it uses gas more economically, the weight of the rebreathing equipment means the diver carries smaller cylinders. Still, most semi-closed systems allow at least twice the duration of open circuit systems (around 2 hours) and are often limited by scrubber endurance.|$|R
