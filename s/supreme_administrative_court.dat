The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. Bulgaria's judiciary, along with other institutions, remains one of Europe's most corrupt and inefficient.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} July 2012, Libor Michálek {{accepted}} the Czech Pirate, Green, and Christian Democrat Party senatorial nominations for District 26. The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its transparency and accountability platforms.

In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech <b>Supreme</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> found the claims unfounded. He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office, the 81-seat Czech Senate. His senatorial term is 2012–2018.|$|E
5|$|The issues {{regarding}} {{the development of}} the park's coastline remain open. The Master Plan of Tsarevo Municipality adopted in 2008 and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Water envisages the construction of vacation complexes with 75,000 beds on the territory of the park and Natura 2000 network. As a result, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Bulgaria that forced the Ministry to withdraw the positive environmental assessment of the Master Plan in 2010 but the decision was rejected by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court.</b> The Strandzha Nature Park Management Plan drafted in 2003 has not yet meet with approval by the Ministry of Environment and Water.|$|E

5|$|The main {{threat to}} the park comes from the {{uncontrolled}} tourist development which has plagued the Bulgarian Black Sea coast since the early 1990s. So far, {{the coast of the}} Strandzha Nature Park has remained almost intact. The most notable example is the case of the Golden Pearl hotel complex near the village of Varvara, whose construction commenced in 2006 on the territory of the part, supported by Tsarevo Municipality without ecological evaluation. After protests the construction was declared illegal later that year but the mayor of Tsarevo and the investor appealed to the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Court</b> of Bulgaria. In June 2007 the Court revoked the protected status of Strandzha Nature Park with order № 6794/29.06.2007. After mass protests the National Assembly adopted legislation prohibiting the right to appeal to court orders of the government establishing protected areas. In 2008 the Court declared the Golden Pearl hotel complex illegal and in 2012 the construction site was demolished.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{does not}} propose to explore {{once again the}} {{comprehensive}} high intellectual history of the Prussian Rechtsstaat so exhaustively traced by Krieger. Instead, by scrutinizing the structure and practice of the Prussian <b>Supreme</b> <b>Administrative</b> Law <b>Court</b> from 1876 to 1914, its aim is to test both his very critical account and the diametrically-opposed adulation heaped upon the Rechtsstaat by many legal historians. It seeks to trace more precisely {{the contours of the}} rule of law in Prussia by weaving together two separate strands of scholarship that have hitherto had little influence upon each other, to describe briefly the intellectual currents that led to the creation of an <b>administrative</b> law <b>court</b> system in Prussia and the structure that emerged, and to explore a few examples of the jurisprudence of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Administrative</b> Law <b>Court.</b> It will argue that the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Administrative</b> Law <b>Court</b> formalized a meaningful rule of law in Prussia that provided greater protection for individual rights than Krieger’s cramped and stunted assessment imagined. This rule of law combined the concerns for the rights of property and for the procedural conception of justice that bind together legal thought and the ideology of the liberal middleclass with the judicial/legal conception of how to control arbitrary administrative actions. Therefore, while the Prussian rule of law was real and meaningful, like that elsewhere in Europe, in Britain, and in the United States, it also embodied the fundamental limitations of bourgeois rule of law ideology...|$|R

After an initial reform of the administrative justice system, the Minister of the interior has now announced a proposal that will abolish two of the <b>supreme</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>courts.</b> Finally, the boundaries between private law and public law are shifting. Cases are redistributed over the various courts, both in the recent Act on compensation for acts of administrative bodies and in the proposal for <b>administrative</b> <b>court</b> reform. The new distribution of competence is not based on a dogmatic distinction between private and public law, but on pragmatic considerations about the expertise of the various courts...|$|R
