40|$|Estimation of nitrate {{leaching}} from agricultural systems {{is critical to}} environment impact studies. Simulation models can help to assess and understand the dynamics of nitrates in the soil and in relation to fertilizer types and agronomical management. The main hypothesis {{of this study was}} that the long term annual application of mineral and organic N fertilizers, in irrigated sandy soil areas increases dramatically the quantity of NO 3 − in the soil for potential {{nitrate leaching}}. The main objectives of this research were then to quantify inorganic N concentration in soil layers affected by mineral and organic N (manure and slurry) fertilizers; and to test the SALUS crop simulation model to identify the best N management strategy able to minimize NO 3 − leaching without compromising crop growth and yields. A first set of rotational simulations were carried out for the 2007 and 2008 experiments, with the goal of comparing measured and simulated results. A second set of rotational simulations were carried out for a long term assessment (50 years) of the two treatments in comparisons. Additional long term rotational simulation runs were carried out considering two different fertilization strategies based on the maize crop uptake in 2007 (276 kg N ha − 1) and on the PUA (“Best Nitrogen Management with manures”) which defines the fertilization practices adopted in the nitrate vulnerable zones (no more than 170 kg N ha − 1 year − 1). Measured data showed that in the manure treatment, the highest nitrate-N concentration was 627. 3 mg kg− 1 at 0. 10 m depth on August 2008, while the lowest was 2. 50 mg kg − 1 at 1. 40 m depth on July 2007. In the <b>slurry</b> <b>treatment,</b> the maximum nitrate N concentration was 344. 6 mg kg − 1 at 0. 10 m depth on August 2008 and the minimum was 8. 9 mg kg − 1 at 0. 60 cm depth on September 2007.

Soil contaminated with 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and spiked with [14 C]- and [15 N 3]-TNT {{was subjected to}} an anaerobic–aerobic soil <b>slurry</b> <b>treatment</b> and subsequently analyzed by radiocounting and solid-state 15 N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This treatment led to a complete disappearance of extractable radioactivity originating from TNT {{and almost all of}} the radioactivity was recovered in the insoluble soil fraction. As revealed by solid-state 15 N NMR, a major fraction of partially reduced metabolites of TNT was immobilized into the soil during the early stage of the anaerobic treatment, although some of the compounds (i. e., aminodinitrotoluenes and azoxy compounds) were extractable by methanol. Considerable 15 N intensity was assigned to condensation products of TNT metabolites. A smaller signal indicated the formation of azoxy N. This signal and the signal for nitro groups were not observed {{at the end of the}} anaerobic phase, revealing further reduction and/or transformation of their corresponding compounds. An increase of the relative proportion of the condensation products occurred with increasing anaerobic incubation. Aerobic incubation resulted in a further decrease of aromatic amines, presumably due to oxidative transformations or their involvement in further condensation reactions.

Odorant samples in ambient air {{were collected from}} five different paired sampling sites: (1) in- and outside of windowless pig barn, (2) in- and outside of open pig barn, (3) before/after <b>slurry</b> <b>treatment</b> (via liquid fertilization), (4) before/after composting, and (5) two reference background sites on a pig confinement facility. A total of 47 compounds consisting of key offensive odorants (such as reduced sulfur and volatile organic compounds) were measured from each selected site. When the results are compared in terms of odor intensity, a list of odorants (sulfur compounds, volatile fatty acids, phenols, and indoles) were generally seen at enhanced levels on most sites. In two types of pig barn facilities (windowless (&# 39;W&# 39;) and open (&# 39;O&# 39;)), butyric and valeric acid were the predominant species. The removal efficiency of odorants was quite different between the two <b>slurry</b> <b>treatment</b> approaches of composting and liquid fertilization. Although the efficiencies of odor removal in the former were not sufficient, that of the latter was fairly significant in terms of odor intensity. However, some odorants like hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol, p-cresol, and butyric acid were still retained above the odor threshold level. Accordingly, odorant emissions from animal housing facilities can be characterized most effectively by key odorants such as volatile fatty acids and reduced sulfur species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{study was}} set up to {{investigate}} the environmental effects of anaerobic digestion and separation of slurry. Volatilisation of odour and ammonia from treated and untreated slurry were compared both during storage and following land application. It was found that ammonia volatilisation was higher from uncove-red stores of anaerobically digested and separated slurry than from untreated slurry, however, when slurry stores were covered efficiently, the loss rate was low and equal for treated and untreated slurry. Ammonia volatilisation following land application was found to be lower from both anaerobically digested and sepa-rated slurry compared to untreated <b>slurry.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of slurry by anaerobic digestion and separation did not reduce odour nuisances during storage, however, odour nuisance from slurry stores was found to be effi-ciently reduced by an artificial crust cover of the slurry stores. During land application the odour nuisan-ces were found to be lower for anaerobically digested and separated slurry than for untreated slurr...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic {{application}} in plant agriculture is primarily {{used to control}} fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora in pome fruit orchards. In order to facilitate environmental impact assessment for antibiotic applications, we developed and validated culture-independent quantitative real-time PCR multiplex assays for streptomycin (strA, strB, aadA and insertion sequence IS 1133) and tetracycline (tetB, tetM and tetW) resistance elements in plant and soil samples. The qPCR were reproducible and consistent whether the DNA was extracted directly from bacteria, plant and soil samples inoculated with bacteria or soil samples prior to and after manure <b>slurry</b> <b>treatment.</b> The genes most frequently identified in soils pre- and post-slurry treatment were strB, aadA, tetB and tetM. All genes tested were detected in soils pre-slurry treatment, {{and a decrease in}} relative concentrations of tetB and the streptomycin resistance genes was observed in samples taken post-slurry treatment. These multiplex qPCR assays offer a cost-effective, reliable method for simultaneous quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in complex, environmental sample matrices...|$|E
40|$|Slurry {{is known}} as a source of ammonia (NH 3), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{emissions}}. NH 3 emissions depend on the pH value of the slurry and previous studies show that emissions could be reduced by lowering the pH. In order to estimate the influence of stirring on the pH and the NH 3 emission potential of cattle <b>slurry,</b> three <b>treatments</b> (A not stirred, B stirred for 1 x 60 min and C stirred for 6 x 10 min per day) were compared. The results show that no positive effects of stirring cattle slurry, neither in economic nor in ecological terms, can be expected...|$|R
40|$|Pig slurry is a {{valuable}} nutrient resource but constitutes a waste disposal problem in areas of high animal density. In the semiarid area of Pla d’Urgell, in the Ebro Valley, North-East Spain, irrigated crops receive large amounts of nutrients {{in the form of}} manure and mineral fertilizers. We studied the effect of pig slurry and additional side-dress mineral fertilizers on irrigated wheat, Triticum aestivum L., on a coarse loam soil, with high soil P and K levels. Yields increased by 62. 3 % when using pig slurry. The application of ammonium sulfate nitrate sidedress did not significantly increase wheat production. The average apparent recoveries were higher for potassium (88. 7 %) than for nitrogen (51. 3 %) and phosphorus (36. 3 %). Greater amounts of soil NO 3 -N were measured over the four growing seasons, which was consistent with the amount of N applied. Macronutrient and micronutrient uptake was significant higher for pig <b>slurry</b> <b>treatments,</b> but only small {{differences were found between the}} pig slurry and pig slurry plus ammonium sulfate nitrate treatments. The unfertilized treatment showed significantly lower soil P, K, Cu and Zn content than pig slurry treatments; 34 %, 21 %, 34 %, and 26 % respectively. These findings could be used to develop a nutrient management plan based on knowledge of soil test results and crop nutrient removal. This could help to improve the use of pig slurry and mineral fertilizers on limited available land areas and prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic elements in soils and the export of nutrients through agricultural drainage...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{agriculture}} {{is a significant}} source of atmospheric ammonia. Ammonia (NH 3) volatilization represents a loss of plant available N to the farmer and a potential contributor to eutrophication in low-nitrogen input ecosystems. This research evaluated on-farm <b>slurry</b> <b>treatments</b> of alum or zeolite and compared three diets for lactating dairy cows in their effectiveness to reduce NH 3 emissions. NH 3 emissions were compared using a group of mobile wind tunnels. The addition of 2. 5 % alum or 6. 25 % zeolite to barn-stored dairy slurry reduced NH 3 volatilization by 60 % and 55 %, respectively, compared to untreated slurry. The alum conserved NH 3 by acidifying the slurry to below pH 5, while the zeolite conserved ammonia by lowering the solution-phase nitrogen through cation exchange. The use of alum or zeolite also reduced soluble phosphorus in the slurry. NH 3 loss from fresh manure collected from lactating dairy cows was not affected by three diets containing the same level of crude protein but differing in forage source (orchardgrass silage vs. alfalfa silage) or neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content (30 % vs. 35 % NDF). NH 3 losses from the freshly excreted manures occurred very rapidly and included the urea component plus some unidentified labile organic nitrogen sources. NH 3 conservation strategies for fresh manures will have to be active within the first few hours after excretion in order to be most effective. The use of alum or zeolites as an on-farm amendment to dairy slurry offers the potential for significantly reducing NH 3 emissions...|$|R
