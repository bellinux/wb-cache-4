5|$|On State's {{first play}} after the punt, fullback Mal Crite {{ran for a}} 40-yard gain, pushing State's offense to the Tech 46-yard line with just over four minutes left. State pushed forward another seven yards, but failed to gain another first down and {{prepared}} to punt the ball back to Tech with 3:14 remaining in the game. Rather than punt the ball, however, State punter Kelly Hollodick instead received the <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> fourth down and ran for a first down. Because State retained possession, {{it was able to}} continue to run down the clock after the fake punt. Tech stopped the clock once by calling a timeout and prevented State from gaining another first down. With 2:01 remaining in the game, State punted the ball into Tech's end zone for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{secured a}} spot on the active roster behind Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs with a strong preseason performance. In the game against the Chicago Bears, he had one carry for a 97-yard touchdown. Against the New England Patriots, Scott took a <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> a fake punt, which he ran 65yards for a touchdown. He made his regular season debut in Week 1 against the Washington Redskins, but {{recorded}} no statistics. Scott only recorded five carries for 15 yards in 11 games played. He {{was a member of the}} Super Bowl XLVI champion team that defeated the New England Patriots by a score of 21–17.|$|E
5|$|The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of {{the mining}} town of Frank, Northwest Territories, Canada at 4:10 am on April 29, 1903. Over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it {{in a constant state of}} instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> the night of the disaster.|$|E

5|$|On Indianapolis' {{first drive}} of the game, {{defensive}} back Chris Harris intercepted a deep, third-down pass from quarterback Peyton Manning {{and returned it}} 6 yards to the Bears' 35-yard line. However, Chicago could not gain a first down on their ensuing possession and {{they were forced to}} punt. After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears' defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, cutting the Bears' lead to 7–6. The touchdown occurred because of a mental error on the Bears' secondary. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Reggie Wayne onto safety Danieal Manning. However, Manning chose to follow tight end Ben Utecht over the middle, leaving Wayne all alone. The score remained the same, at 7–6, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> the point-after-touchdown (PAT) attempt. On the ensuing kickoff, Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff while being tackled by Robert Mathis; Colts linebacker Tyjuan Hagler recovered the loose ball. However, on the next play, Indianapolis gave the ball back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled the handoff and Bears defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.|$|E
5|$|Playing in a torrential downpour, the Buccaneers {{scored the}} first shutout in {{franchise}} history to clinch their first playoff berth and the NFC Central title. The Chiefs were held to a franchise-low 80 yards of total offense. Despite the rain, Ricky Bell claimed that the field had better traction than the dry field they had played on the week previously in San Francisco. Bell carried the ball 39 times for 137 yards in such bad weather that the game had to be played under lights. The Buccaneers lost four previous scoring opportunities to a fumble, two interceptions, and a fumbled <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> a field goal attempt. Shut out {{of the end zone}} on three tries with first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, the Buccaneers brought Neil O'Donoghue in to kick what would be the winning field goal with 8:50 remaining. Tampa Bay would hold the ball for all but four plays {{for the rest of the}} game. The Chiefs players gave the Buccaneers little credit after the victory, saying that the AFC was superior to the NFC and that the Buccaneers would never have won the AFC West.|$|E

25|$|Delhomme {{entered the}} Texans' season finale against the Titans after Yates {{suffered}} a bruised throwing shoulder. He {{would go on}} to lead his team on a potential game-winning drive, completing 18 of 28 passes for 211 yards and a touchdown. But the Texans would lose 23-22 after a botched <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> a two-point attempt play. After the season ended, Delhomme told media that he would most likely retire.|$|E

25|$|This nationally-televised contest was {{the first}} Thursday night game played at Scott Stadium and marked Florida State's first loss in an ACC game (after winning its first 29). In arguably the {{greatest}} victory in Virginia football history, FSU running back Warrick Dunn was stopped inches from the south end zone goal line after taking a direct <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> the game's final play.

25|$|Cutler {{took his}} first NFL <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> December 3 (Week 13), and after some initial jitters (0-3 with sack and fumble) {{completed}} his first touchdown to tight end Stephen Alexander in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, he threw a memorable 71-yard touchdown to fellow-rookie Brandon Marshall {{to tie the game}} 20–20. It was one of the longest TD passes for a debut in NFL history and was also the second-longest pass play between two rookies in Broncos history. He also had two interceptions and took three sacks in the loss.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys {{countered with}} a 73-yard drive to score on Aikman's 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to fullback Daryl Johnston, but they failed on the two-point conversion attempt and the Panthers lead was only cut to 14–9. They later got to 14-11 when a bad <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> a Carolina punt attempt {{went out of the}} end zone to give the Cowboys a safety. But then Panthers safety Chad Cota intercepted a pass from Aikman and returned it 49 yards to set up kicker John Kasay's 24-yard field goal with three seconds in the half, giving Carolina a 17–11 halftime lead.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} drive {{of the second}} half, New England linebacker Tedy Bruschi {{recovered}} a fumbled <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> the Steelers 35-yard line. But the Patriots gained only two yards on their next four plays and ended up turning the ball over on downs. Pittsburgh subsequently drove 52 yards to the 16-yard line to set up Brown's second field goal attempt, but this time his kick was blocked by defensive tackle Brandon Mitchell and Troy Brown recovered the ball. After returning it 11 yards, Brown threw a lateral pass to Antwan Harris, who took the ball the remaining 45 {{yards for a touchdown}} to increase New England's lead to 21–3.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, Tampa Bay got another scoring chance when Warren Sapp forced and {{recovered}} a fumble from Levens on the Green Bay 30-yard line. The Bucs then moved {{the ball to the}} 12, only to come up empty again when Walsh fumbled a bad <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> their field goal attempt. Later on, Packers receiver Robert Brooks' 28-yard punt return and 21-yard reception set up a field goal by Ryan Longwell. Then on the first play of the Bucs ensuing drive, defensive back Tyrone Williams intercepted a pass from Dilfer and returned it 14 yards, setting up Longwell's second field goal with six seconds left in the half, making the score 13–0.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the game}} as a 17-point underdog, UCF opened an early 14–0 lead midway through the first quarter. The Bears scored two touchdowns but botched a <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> an extra point to come within one point with eight {{minutes left in the}} second. UCF entered halftime up 28–20. Baylor scored quickly after the break, tying the game on a {{two-point}} conversion. The Knights responded with a nine-play, 76-yard drive to retake the lead. UCF would not relinquish the lead, growing it to 17-points with 4:44 left in regulation. Baylor quarterback Bryce Petty led the Bears down the field to bring the game within ten points with a minute left, but the Bears failed to recover an onside kick.|$|E

25|$|The Wolverines {{defeated}} the Nittany Lions 27–25 on the game's final play to hand Penn State its {{first and only}} loss of the season. It would cap a wild fourth quarter where the two teams would combine for 39 points and four lead changes. Down 10–3 in the fourth, the Lions would quickly strike twice, the first would be a Michael Robinson two yard keeper set up by a Tony Hunt 61-yard run. On the Wolverines next drive, Alan Zemaitis would strip Michigan quarterback Chad Henne during the tackle and returned it 35yards for the score. Kicker Kevin Kelly would put Penn State up 18–10 after a picking up a bad <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> the extra point and running it in for the two-point conversion.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{was forced}} to a three and out on their opening drive, and the kick from quarterback Danny White (who also served as the team's punter) went just 26 yards before John Sciarra {{returned}} it to the Cowboys 42-yard line. One play later, Montgomery scored on a 42-yard rushing touchdown. The Eagles earned themselves chances to score on their next two drives. However, they were stopped both times and their special teams unit failed to capitalize. First, they drove to the Dallas 23-yard line, only to have Tony Franklin's field goal attempt blocked by Dallas cornerback Aaron Mitchell. Then they drove to the Cowboys 16-yard line, where Harvey Martin sacked Jaworski on third down and a high <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> the field goal try sailed right through Jaworski's hands.|$|E
25|$|Tampa Bay {{responded by}} moving {{the ball to the}} Oakland 9-yard line on their ensuing drive, {{featuring}} a 24-yard run by Pittman, but they came up empty after Tupa fumbled the <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> a field goal attempt. A few plays later, Gannon threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Rice with 6:06 left in the game, cutting the Raiders deficit to 34–21. Rice became the first player to catch a touchdown pass in 4 different Super Bowls, and third overall to have TDs in 4 Super Bowls (Thurman Thomas and John Elway). The two-point conversion failed when Jerry Porter caught the ball and was forced out of bounds; while the official did not judge it to be a force-out, (judgement call) hence, that part of the play was non reviewable.|$|E
