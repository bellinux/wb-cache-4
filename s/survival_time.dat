5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he looked around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended <b>survival</b> <b>time</b> by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E

Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average <b>survival</b> <b>time</b> after infection is 11years.|$|E

Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted.

Improved median <b>survival</b> <b>time</b> and response indicates that docetaxel slows metastatic cancer progression and can lead to disease-free survival.

40|$|Chronic {{administration}} of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) at 72 hour intervals {{for a total}} of 14 doses resulted in a {{reduction in the number of}} central muscarinic receptors in mice as measured by the specific binding of [3 H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) to cortical tis sue homogenates (pmole/mg protein). The number of cholinergic receptors were reduced significantly by 12 % in DFP treated animals (0. 687 + 0. 018 pmoles/mg) as compared to vehicle treated controls (0. 781 + 0. 016 pmoles/ mg) after the sixth dose of DFP (Day 17). The decrease in the number of central cholinergic receptors was maximal after the 8 th dose of DFP (Day 23), and central cholinergic receptor number remained significantly depressed through the 14 th dose of DFP. DFP administration was termina ted after the 14 th dose (Day 40), and the number of central cholinergic receptors increased to 0. 853 + 0. 013 pmole/mg after 6 days and returned to pretreatment levels (0. 934 + 0. 019 pmoles/mg) 13 days after the last dose of DFP. This study demonstrated that the number of central musca rinic receptors could be reduced by chronic DFP treatment, and binding could return to control levels after drug treatment was terminated. Hypoxia <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> were used to assess central cholinergic ac tivity. Therefore the next study was designed to examine the relation ship between DFP-induced alterations in central muscarinic receptor number and hypoxia <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> in mice during and following chronic administration with DFP at 72 hour intervals. At the first time point examined (Day 5, after the second dose of DFP) hypoxia <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> were significantly increased in DFP treated mice while receptor numbers were not significantly altered. <b>Survival</b> <b>times</b> of mice in hypoxic conditions were significantly increased after the 6 th (Day 17), 12 th (Day 35) and 14 th doses (Day 41) of DFP, whereas the number of central cholinergic receptors was significantly reduced. The data from these three time points demonstrated that there is an inverse relationship between hypoxia <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> and the number of central muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Hypoxia <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> were not significantly altered 20 days (Day 60) after the last dose of DFP was administered, but the number of muscarinic receptors remained significantly depressed. On Days 5 and 60 the inverse relationship between hypoxia <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> and the number of central muscarinic receptors was not apparent. These studies demonstrate that the number of central cholinergic receptors can be altered during and following chronic DFP administra tion, but that hypoxia <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> were not a clear indicator of the number of central muscarinic receptors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original approach for jointly fitting <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> and classifying samples into subgroups. The Coxlogit {{model is a}} generalized linear model with {{a common set of}} selected features for both tasks. <b>Survival</b> <b>times</b> and class labels are here assumed to be conditioned by a common risk score which depends on those features. Learning is then naturally expressed as maximizing the joint probability of subgroup labels and the ordering of survival events, conditioned to a common weight vector. The model is estimated by minimizing a regularized log-likelihood through a coordinate descent algorithm. Validation on synthetic and breast cancer data shows that the proposed approach outperforms a standard Cox model or logistic regression when both predicting the <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> and classifying new samples into subgroups.

40|$|Simulation {{studies are}} {{essential}} for understanding and evaluating both current and new statistical models. When simulating <b>survival</b> <b>times,</b> one often assumes an exponential or Weibull distribution for the baseline hazard function, with <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> generated using the method of Bender, Augustin, and Blettner (2005, Statistics in Medicine 24 : 1713 – 1723). Assuming a constant or monotonic hazard can be considered too simplistic and can lack biological plausibility in many situations. We describe a new user-written command, survsim, which allows the user to simulate <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> from two-component parametric mixture models, providing much more flexibility in the underlying hazard. Standard parametric distributions can also be used, including the exponential, Weibull, and Gompertz. Furthermore, <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> can be simulated from the all-cause distribution of cause-specific hazards for competing risks by using the method of Beyersmann et al. (2009, Statistics in Medicine 24 : 956 – 971). A multinomial distribution is used to create the event indicator, whereby the probability of experiencing each event at a simulated time t is the cause-specific hazard divided by the all-cause hazard evaluated at time t. Baseline covariates can be included in all scenarios. We also describe the extension to incorporate nonproportional hazards in standard parametric and competing-risks scenarios.

40|$|Because of censoring, {{standard}} {{methods of}} plotting individual <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> are invalid. Therefore, graphic display of time-to-event data usually {{takes the form}} of a Kaplan-Meier survival plot. Kaplan-Meier plots, however, make differences between groups seem larger than they really are. To overcome these limitations, we developed a technique for producing scatter plots with survival data and applied it to data from a randomized trial of patients with renal cancer. As of June 21, 2001, 25 of the 347 patients with kidney cancer in the Medical Research Council RE 01 randomized treatment trial for whom data were available had been censored, and the remainder had died. Values of the censored <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> were imputed by assuming a log-normal distribution in <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> and by drawing a random sample given that that each patient with censored data survived at least to the point of censoring. The combined original and imputed data were then examined by use of dot plots and scatter plots. In the RE 01 trial, median survival of patients treated with interferon was 3. 0 months (95 % confidence interval = 0. 3 to 5. 5 months) longer than that in patients treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed clear separation between treatment groups and between prognostic groups. In contrast, comparisons of individual observed and imputed <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> between groups of patients showed considerable overlap and gave a more realistic idea of the modest between-group differences than Kaplan-Meier comparisons.
