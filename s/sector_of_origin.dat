For the campaign, the ATR- 42 was equipped to study the aerosol physical, chemical, hygroscopic and optical properties, as well as cloud microphysics. For the 22 research flights, retroplume analyses along the flight tracks were performed with FLEXPART in order to classify air masses into five <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> allowing for a qualitative evaluation of emission influence on the respective air parcel. This study shows that the extensive aerosol parameters (aerosol mass and number concentrations) show vertical decreasing gradients and in some air masses maximum mass concentrations (mainly organics) in an intermediate layer (1 – 3 km). The observed mass concentrations (in the boundary layer (BL) : between 10 and 30 μg m − 3; lower free troposphere (LFT) : 0. 8 and 14 μg m − 3) are high especially in comparison with the 2015 European norms for PM 2. 5 (25 μg m − 3) and with previous airborne studies performed over England (Morgan et al., 2009; McMeeking et al., 2012). Particle number size distributions show a larger fraction of particles in the accumulation size range in the LFT compared to BL. The chemical composition of submicron aerosol particles is dominated by organics in the BL, while ammonium sulphate dominates the submicron aerosols in the LFT, especially in the aerosol particles originated from north-eastern Europe (~ 80 %), also experiencing nucleation events along the transport. As a consequence, first the particle CCN acting ability, shown by the CCN/CN ratio, and second the average values of the scattering cross sections of optically active particles (i. e. scattering coefficient divided by the optical active particle concentration) are increased in the LFT compared to BL...|$|R

40|$|As {{domestic}} exports usually require imported inputs, {{the value}} of exports differs from the domestic value added contained in exports. The higher the domestic value added contained in exports, the higher the domestic national income created by exports will be. In this case, exports will expand the domestic market. Therefore, exports will push economic growth in two ways: through their direct effect on aggregate demand, and through their effect on the domestic market. For these reasons, the estimate {{of the magnitude of}} the domestic value added contained in exports helps explain the capacity of exports to lead economic growth. Domestic exports may be classified as direct and indirect exports. Direct exports are the goods sold to other countries; indirect exports are the domestically produced inputs incorporated in direct exports. The distinction between direct and indirect exports leads to a distinction between direct and indirect domestic value added contained in exports. The income of the factors directly involved in the production of exports constitutes direct domestic value added; the income contained in domestically produced inputs incorporated into exports constitutes the indirect domestic value added. Therefore, the magnitude of indirect value added depends on the density of the domestic intersectorial linkages. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an estimation of the domestic indirect value added contained in Mexico's manufacturing exports in two ways. The first derives from the fact that a direct exporting sector may be the vehicle through which other sectors export in an indirect way; this leads us to estimate the indirect value added contained in exports by <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The second refers to the destination of this indirect value added - that is, to the direct exporting sectors in which the value added contained in indirect exports of each sector appears. Based on the input-output table for Mexico (National Institute of Statistics and Geography-INEGI 2008), we estimate the domestic value added contained in inputs used to produce Mexican manufacturing exports. We show separately the domestic value added from maquiladora exports and from exports produced by the rest of the manufacturing sector. In order to distinguish the indirect value added in exports by <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and destination of the intermediate inputs, we work with square matrices of indirect domestic value-added multipliers...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} uneven development in the computer service sector in Britain by using results from a four-county interview survey of 173 firms. The research adds constructively to the large literature on producer services by providing detailed empirical evidence on the key regional variations within a leading growth sector. First, analysis of the survey data illustrates that new-firm formation processes, which vary both quantitatively and qualitatively across Great Britain, underlie the highly uneven spatial distribution of computer service employment. In particular, rates of entrepreneurship, the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> and the mode of start-up appear to vary regionally, with growth becoming relatively self-generating in the South East where the computer {{industry as a whole}} has traditionally been well represented. Second, through an examination of the backward (supplier), horizontal (joint venture), and in particular the market linkages of the surveyed computer service firms, the evidence gained suggests that, although regional, status, and subsectoral variations in the nature of market linkages both are indicative of, and contribute to, uneven development in this sector, backward and horizontal linkages are of less importance. ...|$|E
40|$|In South Africa, ‘‘black’’ and ‘‘coloured’’ farmers {{engaged in}} several {{occupational}} activities are often considered as being ‘‘not interested in farming’’ or ‘‘not serious’’. However, in Namaqualand {{the large majority}} of ‘‘coloured’’ farmers and especially the most successful ones are pluriactive and have off-farm incomes. Investigations were therefore carried out in that region to better understand the role of pluriactivity. Observations focus on middle-income households from the mining sector entering into small-scale commercial farming. Based on surveys in both non-farm and farm sectors, the results show that, for many households, access to sufficient farm assets depends strongly on the employment situation of the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and requires a level of investment which can be reached only progressively. This obliges these households to rely on off-farm incomes and communal land at least during the early transitional stage. These results stress the importance of taking into account the diversity of paths and of differentiating the various stages in the transitional period between two occupational activities. Finally, the paper emphasises the importance of taking these specific situations into consideration in the management of the commons...|$|E

For the campaign, the ATR- 42 was equipped in order to study aerosol physical, chemical and optical properties, as well as cloud microphysics. During the campaign, continental air masses from Eastern and Western Europe were encountered, along with polar and Scandinavian air masses. For the 22 research flights, retroplume analyses along the flight tracks were performed with FLEXPART in order to classify air masses into five <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> which allows for a qualitative evaluation of emission influence on the respective air parcel. In the polluted boundary layer (BL), typical concentrations of particles with diameters larger than 10 nm (N 10 ) are of the order of 5000 – 6000 cm− 3 , whereas N 10 concentrations of clean air masses were lower than 1300 cm− 3 . The detection of the largest particle number concentrations occurred in air masses coming from Polar and Scandinavian regions for which an elevated number of nucleation mode (25 – 28 nm) particles was observed and attributed to new particle formation over open sea. In the free troposphere (FT), typical observed N 10 are of the order of 900 cm− 3 in polluted air masses and 400 – 600 cm− 3 in clean air masses, respectively. In both layers, the chemical composition of submicron aerosol particles is dominated by organic matter and nitrate in polluted air masses, while, sulphate and ammonium followed by organics dominate the submicron aerosols in clean air masses. The highest CCN/CN ratios were observed within the polar air masses while the CCN concentration values are the highest within the polluted air masses. Within the five air mass sectors defined and the two layers (BL and FT), observations have been distinguished into anticyclonic (first half of May 2008) and cyclonic conditions (second half of May 2008).

40|$|A clinal {{range of}} {{morphological}} variation between two coastal endemic {{species of the}} Genus Armeria in Portugal (A. pseudoarmeria and A. welwitschii) was investigated {{to test the hypothesis}} of hybrid advantage in contact zones between species. The putative F 1 hybrids morphotypes could be submitted to endogenous selection as most of them show deficiencies in pollen fertility and seed setting in comparison with the parental species. Reciprocal transplant experiments in three sectors along the cline revealed that the intermediate F 1 morphotypes are less productive in biomass than the parents even in their <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> These data do not show evidence for the Hybrid Bound Superiority Model. Rather they are in favour of the Tension Zone Model where a dynamic balance is obtained between the continuous production of hybrids and the selection against them. Nevertheless the Tension Zone Model postulates similar fitness for the parents along the cline, which is not the case as the parents are clearly differentiated for nutrient uptake. Soil and plant leaf elemental analysis revealed that, in transplantation, some of the hybrids correspond to a geochemical specialisation diverging from that of the parents suggesting a local adaptation. Owing the high frequency and the healthy developmental aspect of the intermediate morphs in central and northern sector selection must be weak against hybrids. It is concluded that in natural situations the two models could not be strictly exclusive. © 2008 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{data from}} GOES {{geosynchronous}} satellites were applied for statistical {{study of the}} low-latitude dayside magnetopause under a strong interplanetary magnetic field of southward orientation when the reconnection at the magnetopause was saturated. From minimum variance analysis, we determined the magnetopause orientation and compared it with predictions of a reference model. The magnetopause shape {{was found to be}} substantially distorted by a duskward shifting such that the nose region appeared in the postnoon sector. At equatorial latitudes, the shape of magnetopause was characterized by a prominent bluntness and by a trench formed in the postnoon <b>sector.</b> The <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> distortions was regarded {{in the context of the}} storm-time magnetospheric currents and the large-scale quasi-state reconnection at the dayside magnetopause.
