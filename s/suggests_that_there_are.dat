5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E

5|$|Wisemore's {{character}} introduces {{feelings about}} the London community and criticises various problems. However, his reflections are portrayed as both correct and lacking, {{and that he is}} focused only on the bad aspects of life. His ideas result from removing himself from society in preference to the company of classical books. Although he does not realise it, the play <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> virtuous people. Merital, in response to Wisemore, believes that Wisemore's philosophical inclinations are foolish. As the play later reveals, Wisemore's views are only a mask to hide from his own feelings and views on love.|$|E
5|$|Advaita {{literally}} means non-duality, {{and it is}} a monistic {{system of}} thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada {{was the first person to}} expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads. Gaudapada's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> clear differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a number of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E

5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to satisfy their basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments. Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E

One component of this model, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, {{is said to be}} responsible for the temporary storage, maintenance, and manipulation of both visual and spatial information.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of Rover and Powertrain, Caterham started the process of phasing out the Rover K-series engine and {{replacing}} them with Ford engines; the Sigma engine for Roadsports and the 2.0 litre and 2.3 litre Duratec engines for the more powerful Superlight and CSR ranges. Although Caterham's website <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a few models (such as the Superlight R300) still available with a K-series engine, this migration is largely complete.|$|E
25|$|When a Polistes instabilis nest is attacked, the wasps {{defend their}} nests by {{responding}} {{in two different}} ways: First they perform a threat response by wagging their gaster and vibrating their wings, and second, some wasps may attack by leaving the nest and physically touching the attacker. There {{seems to be no}} relationship between the amount of investment the wasps have put into their nest and the defense response. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a fixed number of wasps that are semi specialized for nest defense, and such defensive tasks may be assigned {{in the same way as}} other tasks such as foraging.|$|E

25|$|Kenneth Spence {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} of Hull’s graduate students. He developed and extended Hull's neo-behaviorist theory into what came to be called the Hull-Spence theory of conditioning, learning, and motivation. This theory states that people learn stimulus-response associations when a stimulus and response occur together, and reinforcement motivates the person to engage in the behavior and increases the occurrence of the learned behavior. Spence contributed to the study of incentive motivation and developing mathematical formulation and equations to describe learning acquisition. Spence attributed improvement in performance to motivational factors rather than the habit factors of Hull’s theory. He believed that reinforcement was not always necessary for learning to occur and that people can learn through latent learning. He also developed a discrimination learning theory. His discrimination theory <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> gradients of excitatory and inhibitory potential that are generated around the values of the stimulus that are either reinforced or not.|$|E
25|$|Whiplash {{and other}} neck pain. There is no {{consensus}} {{on the effectiveness of}} manual therapies for neck pain. A 2013 systematic review found that the data <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> minimal short- and long-term treatment differences when comparing manipulation or mobilization of the cervical spine to physical therapy or exercise for neck pain improvement. A 2013 systematic review found that although there is insufficient evidence that thoracic SM is more effective than other treatments, it is a suitable intervention to treat some patients with non-specific neck pain. A 2011 systematic review found that thoracic SM may offer short-term improvement for the treatment of acute or subacute mechanical neck pain; although the body of literature is still weak. A 2010 Cochrane review found low quality evidence that suggests cervical manipulation may offer better short-term pain relief than a control for neck pain, and moderate evidence that cervical manipulation and mobilization produced similar effects on pain, function and patient satisfaction. A 2010 systematic review found low level evidence that suggests chiropractic care improves cervical range of motion and pain in the management of whiplash.|$|E

[...] Zagor also comments on the irony that the supposedly legalistic conclusion reached by the majority {{is at odds with}} a prior High Court decision led by Australia's most prominent legalist, Chief Justice Owen Dixon, in which he implied a temporal limit onto World War II era legislation which also included a scheme of executive detention.|$|E

[...] As for the latter, he notes that the moon is the only planetary body besides Earth on which extensive seismic observations have been made. [...] These observations have constrained the thickness of the moon's crust, mantle and core, suggesting it could not be hollow.|$|E
