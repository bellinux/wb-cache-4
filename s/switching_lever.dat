50|$|Otto engines were {{equipped}} {{with a number of}} different mechanism designs to trigger sparking. The Otto {{is one of the first}} engines to use a spark plug, which is a device that produces a small electric spark to ignite the fuel charge. This usually consisted of a pivoting trip-arm that briefly grabs a power <b>switch</b> <b>lever</b> and gives it a quick pull. The <b>switch</b> <b>lever</b> is then released and allowed to snap back to its original position in preparation for the next cycle. This system requires an external electric battery, ignition coil, and electric charging system similar to modern automobile engines.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} {{traditional}} physical interface components such as <b>switches,</b> <b>levers,</b> knobs and touch screens {{can be easily}} modified to identify who is activating each control. This allows us to change the function performed by the control, and the sensory feedback provided by the control itself, dependent upon the user. An auditing function is also available that logs each user's actions. We describe a number of example usage scenarios for our technique, and present two sample implementations...|$|R
5000|$|A switch {{should be}} {{designed}} to make its transition as swiftly as possible. This is achieved by the initial operation of the <b>switch</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism storing potential energy, usually as mechanical stress in a spring. When sufficient mechanical energy is stored, the mechanism in the switch [...] "breaks over", and quickly drives the contacts through the transition from open to closed, or closed to open, without further action by the switch operator. This quick-break action of the switch is essential to a long life for the switch contacts, as described in Holmes' 1884 patent.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{dynamical}} system, bistability {{means the}} system has two stable equilibrium states. Something that is bistable can be resting in either of two states. These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to stored energy. In terms of potential energy, a bistable system has two local minima of potential energy separated by a peak (local maximum). An example of a mechanical device which is bistable is a light <b>switch.</b> The <b>switch</b> <b>lever</b> is designed {{to rest in the}} [...] "on" [...] or [...] "off" [...] position, but not between the two.|$|R
50|$|Active adult {{housing is}} often {{designed}} for complete single-floor living, with features like laundry facilities and {{the master bedroom}} and bathroom on the first floor. Active adult homes have few, if any, steps {{to get into the}} home, and often boast details like toggle/rocker light <b>switches,</b> <b>lever</b> handles, shower stalls with seats, wide doorways, and other features that make life easier for people who are experiencing the pains associated with aging (like arthritis). Home exteriors are planned to require little or no maintenance, and often a monthly association fee includes landscaping, yard maintenance, and snow removal.|$|R

50|$|The DIP <b>switch</b> with sliding <b>levers</b> {{was granted}} US Patent 4012608 in 1976. It {{was applied for}} 1974 and was used in 1977 in an ATARI Flipper game.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{equivalent}} of a ground frame, with <b>switches</b> instead of <b>levers,</b> is called a Ground Switch Panel (GSP). Points or signals worked from a ground switch panel are usually electrically operated.|$|R
50|$|The switch {{mechanism}} {{is designed to}} have two stable states that are {{a mirror image of}} each other, with the contact actuator always resting at one stable state or the other. Movement of the <b>switch</b> control <b>lever</b> applies tension to a spring, until the control lever crosses the tipping or equilibrium point of the contact actuator. The spring then pushes the actuator to the opposite state, releasing the spring tension.|$|R
50|$|The T140RV was {{an export}} {{version of the}} T140V with engine {{modifications}} {{to meet the requirements}} of the US market, and the gear change <b>lever</b> <b>switched</b> to the left-hand side to comply with 1974 regulations.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Nim is {{an early}} {{computer}} game. The [...] "game board" [...] is a simple Digi-Comp digital computer with memory <b>switches</b> (the three-lobed <b>levers)</b> that [...] "remember" [...] earlier game actions. Their starting positions form the program that plays Nim.|$|R
50|$|In either case, the {{standard}} method for minimizing arc formation and preventing contact damage {{is to use}} a fast-moving switch mechanism, typically using a spring-operated tipping-point mechanism to assure quick motion of switch contacts, regardless of the speed at which the switch control is operated by the user. Movement of the <b>switch</b> control <b>lever</b> applies tension to a spring until a tipping point is reached, and the contacts suddenly snap open or closed as the spring tension is released.|$|R
5000|$|Supervisory control {{often takes}} {{one of two}} forms. In one, the {{controlled}} machine or process continues autonomously. It is observed {{from time to time}} by a human who, when deeming it necessary, intervenes to modify the control algorithm in some way. In the other, the process accepts an instruction, carries it out autonomously, reports the results and awaits further commands. With manual control, the operator interacts directly with a controlled process or task using <b>switches,</b> <b>levers,</b> screws, valves etc., to control actuators. This concept was incorporated in the earliest machines which sought to extend the physical capabilities of man. In contrast, with automatic control, the machine adapts to changing circumstances and makes decisions in pursuit of some goal which {{can be as simple as}} switching a heating system on and off to maintain a room temperature within a specified range. Sheridan [...] defines supervisory control as follows: [...] "in the strictest sense, supervisory control means that one or more human operators are intermittently programming and continually receiving information from a computer that itself closes an autonomous control loop through artificial effectors to the controlled process or task environment." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{different}} designs for the six switch models, so named for the six prominent aluminium <b>switch</b> <b>levers</b> present on the control panel. Both designs incorporate a switch board and a motherboard which were connected by a 12-pin ribbon cable. Both designs were originally sold in North America with or without an additional switch accessible via {{a hole in the}} bottom which can toggle the console's TV output to either channel 2 or channel 3. Those without the switch can output only on channel 3, which was the VHF channel originally least used in the most populous broadcast regions. [...] In addition to the traditional [...] "Atari" [...] branded consoles, Sears, Roebuck and Co. purchased the rights to sell Atari consoles in their stores under their Tele-Games store brand, with the console itself labeled as the Sears [...] "Video Arcade." [...] Sears released several versions of the 2600 as the Sears Video Arcade series from [...] to [...] These include the [...] "Heavy Sixer" [...] model in 1977, the [...] "Light Sixer" [...] model in 1978, the [...] "4 switch" [...] model in 1980, and an analog to the [...] "Atari 2600 Junior" [...] model.|$|R
50|$|The user is {{required}} to manually select a magazine by <b>switching</b> a three-position <b>lever,</b> located behind the pistol grip. The middle position of the switch blocks the feed from both magazines and allows the user to chamber a single round manually. <b>Switching</b> the <b>lever</b> to one side brings the respective magazine into the feed cycle. Once one magazine is depleted, the user manually switches to the second magazine by pushing the magazine selection lever toward it, or the user can load each magazine with {{a different type of}} load, and use the selector to choose the desired load when required. For example, one magazine can be loaded with buckshot, the second with slugs. The selector can be used to switch between the two types (although this will require the user to either fire the round already chambered, or to eject it unfired in order to chamber the new type, unless the chamber is already empty).|$|R
5000|$|A large {{percentage}} of the Eye of the North story takes place in the [...] "dungeons" [...] that delve deep underground. Each dungeon has one to five levels, and completing some levels requires the players to acquire keys, use <b>switches</b> or <b>levers,</b> defeat bosses or interact with NPCs. The final level of the dungeon has a boss that must be defeated to clear the dungeon. Defeating the dungeon boss will cause a chest to appear, yielding loot for each party member.|$|R

50|$|MAB 38, in {{its first}} variants, was a fine weapon by any standard, crafted with high quality {{materials}} and flawlessly finished, carefully machined parts. Although successive models 38/42 and 38/44 were easier and faster to build, sacrificing finish to gain speed, {{the overall quality of}} production remained high.Its mechanism was a traditional simple blowback recoil, but featured notable mechanical solutions, such as a floating firing pin, an automatic safety on open bolt (both later removed to save production costs), a recoil compensator on the muzzle, a bolt cocking handle with sliding dust cover, and a striking trigger gear with no fire selector, but with two triggers instead: the fore trigger for semiautomatic fire and rear trigger for full-auto fire. This was meant to allow the shooter to shift quickly through both firing modes, without <b>switching</b> <b>levers</b> or safety catches, and proved to be very useful in combat.The full-auto trigger had also a dedicated safety catch on left side, since 1942 eliminated; rear sight was adjustable up to 500 meters, in MAB 38 and 38A models (38/42 and 38/44 variants had more simple fixed rear sights).Fully automatic or single-shot fire was selectable by the use of two triggers. The MAB 38 had a wooden stock, was about 800 millimeters in length, and weighed about 5 kilograms when loaded, with an effective range of about 200 meters.|$|R
2500|$|The Selectric II was {{available}} with a Dual Pitch option {{to allow it}} to be <b>switched</b> (with a <b>lever</b> at the top left of the [...] "carriage") between 10 and 12 characters per inch, whereas the Selectric I was ordered with one [...] "pitch" [...] or the other. Separate typeballs were available for each pitch.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present an {{inductance}} measurement method, and an electromechanical model of the pinion-engaging mechanism for the starter motors. The pinionengaging mechanism is the system of components (solenoid <b>switch,</b> pinion-engaging <b>lever,</b> and overrunning clutch with drive pinion) that engages the drive pinion of the starter motor with the ring gear of the internal combustion engine. The actuator of the pinion-engaging mechanism consists of two concentric iron core coils. The coils are excited by relatively high currents. The electromechanical model of the pinion-engaging mechanism requires inductance of the solenoid and its derivative depending on the position of the iron core...|$|R
