25|$|The {{previous}} derivation for {{the equation}} of the Mohr Circle using Figure 4 follows the engineering mechanics <b>sign</b> <b>convention.</b> The engineering mechanics <b>sign</b> <b>convention</b> {{will be used for}} this article.|$|E
25|$|Once a <b>sign</b> <b>convention</b> {{has been}} chosen, {{it has to}} be {{maintained}} for the whole structure. The traditional engineer's <b>sign</b> <b>convention</b> is not used in the calculations of the moment distribution method although the results can be expressed in the conventional way. In the BMD case, the left side moment is clockwise direction and other is anticlockwise direction so the bending is positive and is called sagging.|$|E
25|$|Positive shear {{stresses}} are plotted downward, i.e., the -axis is inverted (Figure 5, <b>sign</b> <b>convention</b> #2).|$|E

50|$|Engineering {{descriptions}} of the computation of bending moments can be confusing because of unexplained <b>sign</b> <b>conventions</b> and implicit assumptions.

25|$|In the Mohr-circle-space <b>sign</b> <b>convention,</b> normal {{stresses}} {{have the}} same sign as normal stresses in the physical-space sign convention: positive normal stresses act outward to the plane of action, and negative normal stresses act inward to the plane of action.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitions}} given {{below are}} valid for both Riemannian manifolds and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, {{such as those}} of general relativity, with careful distinction being made between upper and lower indices (contra-variant and co-variant indices). The formulas hold for either <b>sign</b> <b>convention,</b> unless otherwise noted.|$|E

25|$|We then plot {{two points}} A(50,40) and B(-10,-40), {{representing}} {{the state of}} stress at plane A and B as show in both Figure 8 and Figure 9. These points follow the engineering mechanics <b>sign</b> <b>convention</b> for the Mohr-circle space (Figure 5), which assumes positive normals stresses outward from the material element, and positive shear stresses on each plane rotating the material element clockwise. This way, the shear stress acting on plane B is negative and the shear stress acting on plane A is positive.|$|E

In addition, within each of the two set of sign conventions, the engineering mechanics (structural engineering and mechanical engineering) literature follows a different <b>sign</b> <b>convention</b> from the geomechanics literature.
