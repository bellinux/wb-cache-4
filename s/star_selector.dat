40|$|Aerospace {{mechanism}} engineering {{success stories}} often, if not always, consist of overcoming developmental, test and flight anomalies. Many times {{it is these}} anomalies that stimulate technology growth and more reliable future systems. However, one must learn from these to achieve an ultimately successful mission. It is not often that a spacecraft engineer is able to inspect hardware that has flown in orbit for several years. However, in February 1997, the Fine Guidance Sensor- 1 (FGS- 1) {{was removed from the}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and returned to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) during the second Servicing Mission (SM 2). At the time of removal, FGS- 1 had nearly 7 years of service and the bearings in the <b>Star</b> <b>Selector</b> Servos (SSS) had accumulated approximately 25 million Coarse Track (CT) cycles. The main reason for its replacement was due to a bearing torque anomaly leading to stalling of the B <b>Star</b> <b>Selector</b> Servo (SSS-B) when reversing direction during a vehicle offset maneuver, referred to herein as a Reversal Bump (RB). The returned HST FGS SSS bearings were disassembled for post-service condition assessment to better understand the actual cause of the torque spikes, identify potential process/design improvements, and provide information for remedial on-orbit operation modifications. The methods and technology utilized for this inspection are not unique to this system and can be adapted to most investigations at varying stages of the mechanism life from development, through testing, to post flight evaluation. The systematic methods used for the HST Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) SSS and specific findings are the subjects presented in this paper. The lessons learned include the importance of cleanliness and handling for precision instrument bearings and the potential effects from contamination. The paper describes in detail, the analytical techniques used for the SSS and their importance in this investigation. Inspection analytical data and photographs are included throughout the paper...|$|E
40|$|The fine {{pointing}} {{information required}} for the extraordinary pointing stability of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{is provided by the}} fine guidance sensor (FGS), which is capable of measuring extremely small pointing errors, of the order of 3 milliarcseconds. The FGS provides this fine pointing information over a relatively large, continuous range of angles of guide stars relative to the optical axis of the telescope. The FGS accomplishes this task by a judicious design involving the following: a two-axis high precision <b>star</b> <b>selector</b> servo system; an optical deflection system that provides high reduction from shaft angle to optical angle; a unique interferometer using Koester prisms and extremely sensitive photomultiplier tubes that enable the FGS to lock onto guide stars whose magnitude may be any value over a wide range of brightness (including 14. 5 Mv and fainter); and the use the large aperture of the telescope itself to advantage. This paper describes the FGS control systems involved in achieving this performance, supported by test data...|$|E
40|$|A {{demonstrator}} of the multi-conjugate {{adaptive optics}} concept is under construction at ESO and will be installed on the Nasmyth focus of the VLT. This demonstrator called MAD will have two different wavefront sensor channels: Shack-Hartmann and Layer-Oriented; {{in this article we}} only describe the Layer-Oriented one. The Layer-Oriented wavefront sensor can select eight reference stars in the two arc-minutes corrected field of view {{in order to have a}} maximum of two references in each quarter of the field. XY stages will remotely adjust the position of each reference <b>star</b> <b>selector.</b> The starlight will be fed onto two detectors and two completely independent loops will drive the deformable mirrors, one conjugated to the ground and the other to an altitude of approximately 8 km. The Layer-Oriented wavefront sensor will use the same CCDs than the Shack-Hartmann channel and the pupil will be divided into 9 Ã— 9 subapertures both for the high and for the ground layer. The spatial sampling of the subapertures will be different for the two CCDs and their integration time will be tuned to typical values of the conjugated altitudes characteristic wind speed. The overall status of the instrument with respect to optics, mechanics, electronics and software is given hereafter. We also summarize the progress on the procurement phase and give the time schedule for the assembling, integration and testing phases...|$|E
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Fine Guidance System has set new {{standards}} in pointing control capability for earth orbiting spacecraft. Two precision pointing control modes are {{implemented in the}} Fine Guidance System; one being a Coarse Track Mode which employs a pseudo-quadrature detector approach and the second being a Fine Mode which uses a two axis interferometer implementation. The Coarse Track Mode was designed to maintain FGS pointing error to within 20 milli-arc seconds (rms) when guiding on a 14. 5 Mv star. The Fine Mode was designed to maintain FGS pointing error to less than 3 milli-arc seconds (rms). This paper addresses the HST FGS operating in the Coarse Track Mode. An overview of the implementation, the operation, and both the predicted and observed on orbit performance is presented. The discussion includes {{a review of the}} Fine Guidance System hardware which uses two beam steering <b>Star</b> <b>Selector</b> servos, four photon counting photomultiplier tube detectors, as well as a 24 bit microprocessor, which executes the control system firmware. Unanticipated spacecraft operational characteristics are discussed as they impact pointing performance. These include the influence of spherically aberrated star images as well as the mechanical shocks induced in the spacecraft during and following orbital day/night terminator crossings. Computer modeling of the Coarse Track Mode verifies the observed on orbit performance trends in the presence of these optical and mechanical disturbances. It is concluded that the coarse track pointing control function is performing as designed and is providing a robust pointing control capability for the Hubble Space Telescope...|$|E
