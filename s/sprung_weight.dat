2500|$|Honda {{increased}} the vehicle's fuel efficiency using aluminum and plastic extensively {{to reduce the}} vehicle's weight. The basic structure is a new, lightweight aluminum monocoque, reinforced in key areas with aluminum extrusions joined at cast aluminum lugs. Stamped aluminum panels are welded onto this structure to form an extremely light and rigid platform for the drivetrain and suspension. The Insight has a body weight {{less than half that}} of the contemporary Civic 3-door, with increased torsional rigidity by 38% and bending rigidity by 13%. Honda built the Insight with aluminum front brake calipers and rear brake drums, and with a largely aluminum suspension, in addition to standard aluminum wheels; reducing the ratio of un-sprung to <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> as well as the total weight. The fuel tank is plastic; the engine mounts were aluminum; and the exhaust is a small, thin wall pipe. Its compact spare is also aluminum. The Insight weighed [...] in manual transmission form without air conditioning, [...] with manual transmission and air conditioning, or [...] with CVT and air conditioning.|$|E
50|$|The {{roll axis}} {{is the line}} through {{the front and rear}} roll centers that the vehicle rolls around during cornering. The {{distance}} from this axis to the sprung center of gravity height is the roll moment arm length. The total <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> transfer is equal to the G-force times the <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> times the roll moment arm length divided by the effective track width. The front <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> transfer is calculated by multiplying the roll couple percentage times the total <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> transfer. The rear is the total minus the front transfer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{transfer}} is the weight transferred by only {{the weight of}} the vehicle resting on the springs, not the total vehicle weight. Calculating this requires knowing the vehicle's <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> (total weight less the unsprung weight), the front and rear roll center heights and the sprung center of gravity height (used to calculate the roll moment arm length). Calculating the front and rear <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> transfer will also require knowing the roll couple percentage.|$|E

50|$|The {{larger the}} ratio of <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> to {{unsprung}} weight, the less the body and vehicle occupants are affected by bumps, dips, and other surface imperfections such as small bridges. However, a large <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> to unsprung weight ratio can also be deleterious to vehicle control.|$|E
50|$|In {{a vehicle}} with a suspension, {{such as an}} automobile, {{motorcycle}} or a tank, sprung mass (or <b>sprung</b> <b>weight)</b> is {{the portion of the}} vehicle's total mass that is supported above the suspension, including in most applications approximately half of the weight of the suspension itself. The <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> typically includes the body, frame, the internal components, passengers, and cargo, but does not include the mass of the components suspended below the suspension components (including the wheels, wheel bearings, brake rotors, calipers, and/or Continuous tracks (Also called caterpillar tracks), if any), which are part of the vehicle's unsprung weight.|$|E
50|$|Unsprung weight {{transfer}} is calculated {{based on the}} weight of the vehicle's components that are not supported by the springs. This includes tires, wheels, brakes, spindles, half the control arm's weight and other components. These components are then (for calculation purposes) assumed to be connected to a vehicle with zero <b>sprung</b> <b>weight.</b> They are then put through the same dynamic loads. The {{weight transfer}} for cornering in the front would be equal to the total unsprung front weight times the G-Force times the front unsprung center of gravity height divided by the front track width. The same is true for the rear.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{there is}} a minimum {{momentum}} required to operate a recoil-operated firearm's action, the cartridge must generate sufficient recoil to provide that momentum. Therefore, recoil-operated firearms work best with a cartridge that yields a momentum approximately equal to that for which the mechanism was optimized. For example, the M1911 design with factory springs is optimized for a [...] bullet at factory velocity. Changes in caliber or drastic changes in bullet weight and/or velocity require modifications to <b>spring</b> <b>weight</b> or slide mass to compensate.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with motor cars was the large variation in <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> between lightly loaded and fully loaded, especially for the rear springs. When heavily loaded the springs could bottom out, and apart from fitting rubber 'bump stops', there were attempts to use heavy main springs with auxiliary springs to smooth the ride when lightly loaded, which were often called 'shock absorbers'. Realising that the spring and vehicle combination bounced with a characteristic frequency, these auxiliary springs were designed with a different period, but were not {{a solution to the problem}} that the spring rebound after striking a bump could throw you out of your seat. What was called for was damping that operated on the rebound.|$|E
5000|$|As a car {{approaches}} {{the end of}} a straightaway, the downforce generated by the body of the car should increase the <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> until the coil springs compress until they bind and the suspension can no longer travel (hence the name). [...] The goal of coil bind is to keep the air dam (or splitter if applicable) {{at the front of the}} car as low to the ground as possible to create an area of low pressure under the car. The result is similar to ground effects. Under braking, weight transfer causes more weight to shift forward as the vehicle decelerates. This helps to maintain the low-pressure area below the car by keeping the front of the car low to the ground. While coil bind setups do yield faster lap times, the cars are more sensitive to turbulence generated by nearby cars.|$|E
50|$|Ignoring the flexing {{of other}} components, a car can be modeled as the <b>sprung</b> <b>weight,</b> {{carried by the}} springs, carried by the {{unsprung}} weight, carried by the tires, carried by the road. Unsprung weight is more properly regarded as a mass {{which has its own}} inherent inertia separate {{from the rest of the}} vehicle. When a wheel is pushed upwards by a bump in the road, the inertia of the wheel will cause it to be carried further upward above the height of the bump. If the force of the push is sufficiently large, the inertia of the wheel will cause the tire to completely lift off the road surface resulting in a loss of traction and control. Similarly when crossing into a sudden ground depression, the inertia of the wheel slows the rate at which it descends. If the wheel inertia is large enough, the wheel may be temporarily separated from the road surface before it has descended back into contact with the road surface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{weight of}} the vehicle is going on {{increasing}} due to additional luxurious and safety features. The increasing {{weight of the}} vehicle affects the fuel efficiency and overall performance of the vehicle. Therefore the weight reduction of the vehicle is the real need of today’s automotive industry. Steering knuckle is one of critical component of vehicle.

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringThis master thesis {{concerns}} {{the design and}} analysis of the suspension for the Formula Student Team UiS racing car for the Formula Student 2013 student competition. To analyze how parameters such as track width, wheelbase, weight distribution, CoG height and total weight affected the overall performance a virtual racetrack was constructed. Calculations were then done to find the cars lap time as the various parameters were altered. Results showed that reduced weight and CoG height and increased track width and wheelbase all improved the performance of the car. The analysis do not incorporate the necessary weight increase to increase track width and wheelbase, thus, further calculations are needed to determine the full effect of changing these parameters. Nevertheless the rear track was increased from 1188 mm to 1240 mm to improve cornering ability. The analysis revealed an increase in performance with increased rearwards weight distribution as high as 70 / 30 rear/front. This weight distribution causes the cornering ability to deteriorate but gave sufficient improvement for acceleration and braking to reduce the total lap time. The car was still designed with a 50 / 50 weight distribution due to all the complicating effects of reduced cornering ability such as over/understeer but this is a recommended area for further analysis. Bump stiffness was designed based on required ground clearance during maximum acceleration. Since the track width is smaller than the wheelbase the car is inherently softer during lateral acceleration as opposed to longitudinal (e. g. braking) but the use of ARBs effectively increased the lateral stiffness (i. e. roll stiffness) without too much increase in bump stiffness. The use of adjustable ARBs also allows the roll stiffness and the <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> transfer distribution to be adjusted. The suspension geometry was designed to minimize scrub and jacking while having good camber gain and roll center height. The camber gain front and rear is 0. 0369 °/mm and 0. 0426 °/mm respectively corresponding to a camber loss fraction of 0. 58 and 0. 54 respectively. The roll center front and rear is 58. 3 mm and 61 mm above the ground respectively. This height ensures that jacking and scrub are kept low while there is a large roll moment giving a large amount of <b>sprung</b> <b>weight</b> transfer which can be distributed between the front and rear track depending on chosen ARB stiffness’s...|$|E

Weight is a body's relative mass or the quantity of matter contained by it, giving rise to a downward force. A <b>weighting</b> <b>spring</b> balance is a machine used to measure the weight of an object. Some weighing balances are manual weighing balance and the others are digital weighing balance. Computer based reverse engineering of the weighing spring balance is a systematic reconstruction of a manual <b>spring</b> <b>weighting</b> balance to include a digital hardware circuit that can interfaces the spring balance to the computer. This research work shows the benefits of interfacing a weighting balance to a digital computer. Weights of objects can be read directly off the computer and the records of transactions kept in the computer. Computer based reverse engineering of a manual <b>weighting</b> <b>spring</b> balance involves a systematic study of the existing weighting balance, the design and development of the hardware interface and the development of the software to read from the manual spring balance.

Modularization research methodology is used in this research work were the research work is broken down into modules; the different modules were designed, developed, tested and integrated.
