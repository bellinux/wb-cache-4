2500|$|In {{addition}} to his early forays into full interior strip art, and his later focus on covers, Bolland has also produced a number of short – often <b>single</b> <b>pages</b> – strips, numerous pin-ups {{and a pair of}} ongoing 'occasional' humour strips. These latter feature Bolland as writer-artist, his now-preferred method of working. Most notable are Bolland's two 'personal projects', Mr. Mamoulian and The Actress and the Bishop, all appearances of which strips were collected in the book Bolland Strips! (Palmano-Bennet/Knockabout Comics, 2005). Bolland Strips! stemmed from a suggestion by Josh Palmano (owner of Gosh Comics in London, and also involved in publishing company Knockabout Comics) to collect all instances of Bolland's two strips and Steve Moore's [...] "Zirk" [...] story. Bolland had other thoughts, and suggested including an undrawn 20-page story called [...] "The Actress & the Bishop and the Thing in the Shed" [...] (written 18 years previously), and two stories written and illustrated by him for Vertigo Comics. After negotiations with DC, the two stories – [...] "Princess & the Frog" [...] (from Heartthrobs) and [...] "The Kapas" [...] (from Strange Adventures) were included alongside six limited edition Éditions Déesse prints.|$|E
