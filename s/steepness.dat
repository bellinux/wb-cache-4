These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s as base camps, and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level Onizuka Center for International Astronomy telescope support complex is derived. The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964, making the peak itself accessible to larger numbers of people.|$|E
5|$|The most {{challenging}} {{stage of the}} takeoff is carrying the speed from the inrun with sufficient height over the 'knoll', and achieving the correct trajectory down the hill. The knoll is the highest point of the hill itself, from which it begins to slope downwards. On modern ski flying hills the table is placed considerably far back from the knoll, so as to reduce the <b>steepness</b> of the flight curve. A skilled athlete is able to aggressively 'snap' into the transition so as to clear the knoll with ease, thereby allowing them to focus completely on using their specialised aerodynamic flying technique to maximise distance further down the hill. Athletes of the highest skill level can consistently compensate for any lack of inrun speed with perfect timing {{off the table and}} an excellent transition.|$|E

The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s <b>steepness.</b> Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the issue}} was brought up again, this time as a pontoon bridge. The depth and <b>steepness</b> of the fjord would make it {{impossible}} to fasten the bridge to the sea bottom.

It was estimated to cost between NOK 19.5 and 26 million. Norwegian expatriate Leif J. Sverdrup, co-founder of Sverdrup & Parcel of the United States, inspected the fjord in 1965 and was later hired to plan the bridge in cooperation with Oslo-based civil engineering consultants Prosjektering. Municipal engineers started measuring currents in 1966. Prosjektering and Sverdrup & Parcel recommended a pontoon bridge with a movable section to allow passage of ship traffic. In 1967, a new proposal was launched, in which a seaway tunnel would be blasted out in the rock on the Bergen side.|$|E
5|$|The moat was {{situated}} {{at a distance}} of about 20m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20m wide and as much as 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top {{so as not to be}} used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the <b>steepness</b> of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.|$|E

40|$|Overwash is {{the process}} in which waves force water {{onto the surface of}} a body that is {{otherwise}} not fully submerged. It occurs in wave interactions with thin oating plates due to their small freeboards. For example, when experimentally investigating water wave transmission by an array of thin oating plates, Bennetts & Williams (2015) reported overwash in laboratory experiments of regular incident waves interacting with an array of thin oating wooden disks. They noted shallow overwash for relatively moderate incident amplitudes, and deeper and more energetic overwash for larger incident amplitudes. Moreover, they showed that the occurrence of strong overwash was correlated to the array transmitting signi cantly less wave energy than predicted by linear potential ow theory. Skene et al. (2015) proposed a 2 D (one horizontal dimension and one depth dimension) mathematical model of overwash of a thin oating plate. They separated the overwash domain from the surrounding water and plate domain; applying linear potential ow theory to the latter domain, and the nonlinear shallow water equations to the former. The potential ow model prediction of the wave elevation above the plate and velocity there was used to force the shallow water equations. Further, they compared the model predictions to measurements made during laboratory experiments. In these experiments, thin oating plastic plates were subjected to regular incident waves with <b>steepnesses</b> ranging from ka = 0 : 04 to 0 : 15 and wavelength to plate length ratios from 0 : 56 to 1 : 51. A depth gauge placed at the centre of the upper surface of the plate was used to measure the overwash depth. The motion of the plate was also measured, and Meylan et al. (2015) had earlier shown that linear potential ow theory accurately predicts this motion. Skene et al. (2015) 's model accurately predicted the overwash depth signals for relatively low incident <b>steepnesses</b> and short wavelengths, for which the mathematical model predicted a mean overwash depth of less than approximately 2 mm. However, for higher incident <b>steepnesses</b> and longer incident wavelengths, the model became inaccurate and overpredicted the overwash depth by a factor of up to three. The likely causes of the loss of accuracy were hypothesised to be that: (i) the shallow water equations neglect turbulence, which was visible in the experiments for the largest incident amplitudes; (ii) the model lacks back-coupling from the overwash to the plate and surrounding water; and (iii) the shallow water equations do not model the wave breaking that occurred in the experiments when bores created at the leading and trailing plate edges collided. Here, the model is applied to the problem of overwash of a step that has the height of the undisturbed water depth. The simpli ed geometry removes any errors created by (iii), and thus provides a direct means to test the impacts of (i) and (ii). The model predictions are compared to data from computational uid dynamics (CFD) models of the problem. David Skene, Luke Bennetts, Michael Meylan, Michael Wright, and Kevin Mak...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} dual cut-off, dc-tunable {{low-pass}} microwave filter on a superconducting Nb microstrip with uniaxial asymmetric nanogrooves. The frequency {{response of the}} device was measured in the range 300 KHz to 14 GHz at different temperatures, magnetic fields, and dc current values. The microwave loss is most effectively reduced when the Abrikosov vortex lattice spatially matches the underlying washboard pinning landscape. The forward transmission coefficient S_ 21 (f) of the microstrip has a dc-tunable cut-off frequency f_d which notably changes under dc bias reversal, due to the two different slope <b>steepnesses</b> of the pinning landscape. The device's operation principle relies upon a crossover from the weakly dissipative response of vortices at low frequencies when they are driven over the grooves, to the strongly dissipative response at high frequencies when the vortices are oscillating within one groove. The filter's cut-off frequency is the vortex depinning frequency tunable by the dc bias as it diminishes the pinning effect induced by the nanopattern. The reported results unveil an advanced microwave functionality of superconducting films with asymmetric (ratchet) pinning landscapes and are relevant for tuning the microwave loss in superconducting planar transmission lines...|$|R

The work is motivated by numerical model validation. Innovative techniques are used to ensure the experimental configuration is consistent with the model. This demands linear motions, time-harmonic conditions, homogeneity of the plate and the restriction of horizontal motions of the disc or discs. An optical remote sensing device is employed to record the deflection of the discs accurately.

40|$|Flow past {{a single}} small planar or {{three-dimensional}} roughness {{mounted on a}} smooth surface is investigated theoretically for various edge <b>steepnesses,</b> the oncoming pla-nar motion being within a boundary layer or other near-wall shear.

In particular, it is predicted that with a severe edge (e. g. a 90 forward-facing step) {{the ratio of the}} upstream separation distance over the roughness edge height is a constant times Re 1 = 4 W in two dimensions, the constant being approximately 0 : 142 and the Reynolds number ReW being based on the roughness edge height and the incident velocity slope at the sur-face.
