5|$|The video's {{first scene}} {{is set in}} a desert at night. Rihanna, wearing a {{garrison}} cap, sunglasses, and a stylized white top, stands in front of an army. This scene is intercut with scenes of Rihanna in a bunker; she wears an army hard hat, pink lace up boots, and a skin-colored top with small black rectangles covering her breasts. Halfway through the first verse, the scene changes to a daytime desert scene in which Rihanna wears a low cut, short black dress with spiked <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads,</b> and walks through the location as small explosions occur around her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene, Gaga and her eye-patch wearing boyfriend are reading {{magazines}} {{on a sofa}} in a tea room. Gaga wears a yellow jumpsuit with circular glasses and <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads.</b> The Guardian compared this look with that of Minnie Mouse. She finally takes her revenge on her boyfriend by discreetly poisoning his drink with white powder concealed in her ring. As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that she just killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone corkscrew wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame. The video ends with Gaga posing for mug shots like a fashion model while wearing a tulip shaped metallic dress similar to the single cover.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E
5|$|The {{tickets were}} first {{available}} {{to members of}} Gaga's social network website, Littlemonsters.com. They were provided with a unique code for ordering tickets from online, but were limited to four tickets per member. According to Live Nation, the first batch of tickets for the tour went on sale from December 9, 2013, and sell-out shows were reported from Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Los Angeles and Edmonton within hours. This led to two new dates being added to the itinerary: June 26 at Milwaukee's Marcus Amphitheater, and June 28 at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall. On January 29, 2014, Gaga released the dates for the European leg of the tour, which would begin September 23, 2014, from Belgium. The singer partnered with British mobile network O2, for a deal which would enable the company's customers to avail tickets for the tour three days prior to the general release. The deal included Gaga being featured in a new advertisement, for promoting the UK leg of the tour and showed her wearing a dress with large, glittering <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> while running towards a concert stage. This {{was the second time}} Gaga partnered with O2, first in November 2013, for exclusive access to the tracks from Artpop, ahead of its UK release. Upon release, Ticketmaster reported that the UK venues sold out within five minutes, prompting the singer to add another two dates in London. In April and May 2014, she released more floor tickets for sale, after ensuring larger crowd capacity for all the UK venues and a total of eight new dates.|$|E
25|$|The {{television}} {{prime time}} shows Dallas and, in particular, Dynasty influenced increasingly oversized <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads.</b> <b>Shoulder</b> <b>pads,</b> popularized by Joan Collins and Linda Evans from {{the soap opera}} Dynasty were popular from the mid 1980s to the early 1990s. Dallas, however, promoted displays of wealth involving jewelry and sparkling clothing. Meanwhile, women's fashion and business shoes revisited the pointed toes and spiked heels that were popular in the 1950s and early 1960s. Some stores stocked canvas or satin covered fashion shoes in white and dyed them to the customer's preferred color, preferably bright colors.|$|E

50|$|The <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> sign is an {{enlargement}} of the anterior shoulder due to amyloid deposition in periarticular soft tissue. This type of infiltration is not common, but it is pathognomonic for AL amyloidosis.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1940s to about 1951, some dresses {{featured}} a soft, smaller <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> {{with so little}} padding as to be barely noticeable. Its function {{seems to have been}} to slightly shape the shoulder line.|$|R

25|$|For the 2007 season, {{all members}} of the Patriots wore a black No.91 decal on the backs of their helmets. A friend of Hill's since high school, fellow Patriots {{defensive}} lineman Jarvis Green supported Hill's fiancée Inell Benn and son Ma’Shy financially following Hill's death. Green also wore Hill's old <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> for the Patriots' October 14 game against the Cowboys, which Benn attended.|$|E
25|$|During a Week 11 {{loss to the}} Washington Redskins, Young {{suffered}} a torn flexor tendon in his right thumb, and was held {{out of the game}} after he prepared to reenter. Following the game, Young threw his <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> into the crowd as he left the field, had an altercation with Coach Fisher in the locker room, and stormed out. Fisher then declared that Rusty Smith would become the Titans' starting quarterback.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, after Nike {{took over}} the NFL uniform {{supplier}} from Reebok, the Bears uniform received changes. One of the changes include moving {{the numbers on the}} sleeves onto the <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad,</b> as well as enlarging the GSH on the stripes.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel stopped mechanically. Its {{unexpected}} appearance {{there had}} served {{to break the}} current of his meditations. He stood staring at it, while the roustabouts passed and repassed, noisily carrying great logs of wood on <b>shoulders</b> <b>padded</b> by their woollen caps.|$|R
50|$|The {{skeletonized}} wooden {{stock is}} a more rounded version of that provided on the SVD rifle; it has a rubber <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> and can be removed when the rifle is dismantled for compact storage. The forward handguard is made from a high-impact polymer.|$|R
25|$|From 1987 {{until the}} early 1990s, the short skirt was the only length {{supported}} by fashion designers. Although skirts of any length were acceptable to wear in the years before, all attention {{was given to the}} short skirt, especially among teenage girls and young women. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> became increasingly smaller. Accessories popular in Britain, France and America included bright-colored shoes with thin heels, narrow multicolored belts, berets, lacy gloves, beaded necklaces, and plastic bracelets.|$|E
25|$|Since men's {{ice hockey}} {{is a full}} contact sport, body checks are allowed so {{injuries}} are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet (cage worn if certain age or clear plastic visor can be worn), <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads,</b> elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.|$|E
25|$|Hawk and Animal next {{appeared}} as Legion of Doom 2000, billed as {{an updated version}} of the Road Warriors “for the new millennium”, at WrestleMania XIV during a tag team Battle Royal. The duo sported a new look, including new <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> and helmets (the helmets wouldn't last long, as Hawk got rid of his by throwing it to the crowd) and a new manager in Sunny. LOD 2000 won the battle royal and earned a shot at the tag team titles, but did not manage to win the gold.|$|E

25|$|The Shoulders: the Neapolitan jacket has no <b>{{shoulder}}</b> <b>padding.</b> Neapolitan tailors {{removed the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>padding</b> from their jackets {{in order to}} provide more freedom of movement. For this reason, the Neapolitan shoulder on informal jackets is sewn like a shirt sleeve (“spalla a camicia”) and it follows the natural curve of the human body rather than give it shape. This type of sleeve is cut about 10 cm larger than the armhole, and it can be finished with the “repecchia” – that visually interesting shirring the tailor creates with the extra fabric. This little flair, which supposedly allows for even more freedom of movement, is known as “manica a mappina”, and it gives the jacket a beautiful “rugged” appearance. For formal occasions, the Neapolitan shoulder features a “rollino” – a little roll of padding that raises the sleeve head to drape more cleanly.|$|R
25|$|The {{sport has}} four major {{versions}} that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: men's field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field (outdoor) and box (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads,</b> and elbow pads. The women's game {{does not allow}} body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. The only protective gear required for all field players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Intercrosse is a mixed gender sport and uses a stick that can be all plastic, a softer ball, and is non-contact.|$|E
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
25|$|Men's field {{lacrosse}} protective equipment {{contains a}} pair of gloves, elbow pads, <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads,</b> helmet, and mouthguard. Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads {{to protect themselves from}} checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.|$|E
50|$|The HK416 has an {{adjustable}} multi-position telescopic butt stock, offering six different lengths of pull. The <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> {{can be either}} convex or concave and the stock features a storage space for maintenance accessories, spare electrical batteries or other small kit items. It can also be switched out for other variations like Magpul stocks.|$|R
50|$|The R4 has a side-folding tubular stock, which folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver. The rifle's handguard, pistol grip, magazine, stock arms and <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> are all made from a {{synthetic}} material, making it lighter in weight than the equivalent original Galil model which uses heavier metal and wood in these components.|$|R
50|$|Kamali {{designed}} the red one-piece bathing suit worn by Farrah Fawcett in the iconic 1976 poster. The suit was {{donated to the}} Smithsonian National Museum of American History in 2011. She is also credited with popularizing the <b>shoulder</b> <b>pad</b> in womenswear in the 1980s. Her work {{is included in the}} collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|R
25|$|On the March 3, 2006, {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Animal {{teamed up with}} Matt Hardy to face MNM. After he and Hardy lost the match, Animal turned heel {{for the second time}} in his career by attacking and {{injuring}} Hardy's knee. Animal reasoned that he had realized that Hardy and Heidenreich were screw-ups and that Road Warrior Hawk was the only tag team legend and partner for him. After the heel turn, Animal, once again known simply as The Road Warrior, would drop many aspects of the well-known Road Warrior gimmick, losing the face paint, and <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads.</b> Animal's look at this time was similar to his old Road Warrior gimmick in the early 1980s he had prior to teaming up with Hawk.|$|E
25|$|Laurinaitis' son, James Laurinaitis, played linebacker for Ohio State University. As a sophomore, James won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, {{given to}} the best {{defensive}} player in the country, and was {{a finalist for the}} Butkus Award, which is awarded to the best linebacker in the country. In 2007, James won the Butkus Award. In fact, Sports Illustrated made a joke about borrowing his father's <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads</b> and later did an interview with him that included a picture of him wearing them. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the 2nd round as the 35th overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and played with the Rams through the team's final season in St. Louis in 2015, after which he moved to the New Orleans Saints.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Hawk and Animal quietly turned {{heel and}} finally won the NWA World Tag Team Championship on October 29, 1988 in New Orleans, Louisiana {{at a house}} show against the Midnight Express, In November of that year the Road Warriors {{played a role in}} ending Dusty Rhodes' tenure as head booker for the promotion. During the November 26 episode of World Championship Wrestling, which was under strict {{instructions}} from TBS television executives prohibiting blading, the Road Warriors attacked Rhodes, removed a spike from their <b>shoulder</b> <b>pads,</b> and attempted to gouge his eye out. Rhodes was fired for that episode shortly after Starrcade '88. Before Rhodes was fired, Animal beat him at the Clash of the Champions, so the Road Warriors were allowed to pick a new partner to hold the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team titles; they picked AJPW superstar Genichiro Tenryu but the titles were quickly abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|A young Malcolm X {{described}} the zoot suit as: [...] "a killer-diller coat with a drape shape, reet pleats and <b>shoulders</b> <b>padded</b> like a lunatic's cell". Zoot suits usually featured a watch chain {{dangling from the}} belt to the knee or below, then back to a side pocket. Zoot suit wearers' dates often wore flared skirts and long coats.|$|R
