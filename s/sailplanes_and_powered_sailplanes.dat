50|$|The LBA issued type {{certificate}} No. 868 on 11 July 1995, certificating the Nimbus-4DM glider {{in the standard}} class, utility category. The certification basis listed on the {{type certificate}} is Joint Airworthiness Requirements (JAR) 22 for <b>Sailplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>Powered</b> <b>Sailplanes,</b> effective 27 June 1989, inclusive of Change 4 and amendments 22/90/1, 22/91/1, and 22/92/1. Exemptions to the JARs on the type certificate included 22.201(f)(5)(ii), 22.153, 22.173(b), 22.175(a), and 22.207(a). A special compliance was established {{on the basis of}} an equivalent level of safety with JAR 22.1093(b).|$|E
40|$|Requirements for certijication of {{composite}} {{materials used in}} <b>sailplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>powered</b> <b>sailplanes,</b> as issued by the LBA (Lujlfahrtbundesamt), the airworthiness authority of the Federal Republic of Germany, are reviewed. As {{an example of the}} certification procedure the fatigue life test of a CFRP Nimbus wing conducted at the DFVLR (German Aerospace Research Establishment) is outlined. Considering the fact that the certijicated lifetime of 6000 hours for gliders is not long enough, a possible way is shown for getting more comprehensive general information about the fatigue behaviour of composites and for achieving higher design allowables in an acceptable time by means of structural tests. ...|$|E
40|$|Requirements {{for control}} systems in <b>sailplanes</b> <b>and</b> <b>powered</b> <b>sailplanes</b> to be {{equipped}} with servo-powered transmission and control elements have been analyzed to provide information regarding airworthiness of such controls. A flight dynamics dataset was acquired in flight tests and {{used to create a}} six degree-of-freedom simulation in which various potential actuator failure scenarios were investigated. An exemplary functional hazard analysis was conducted. To demonstrate a servo-boosted control system for the airbrakes, a system based on an electric actuator was designed, built, and evaluated in flight. The system kept the hand force below a specified level and allowed controlled deployment of the airbrakes over the whole speed range...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} types of {{radio-controlled}} aircraft. For beginning hobbyists, there are park flyers and trainers. For more experienced pilots there are glow plug engine, electric <b>powered</b> <b>and</b> <b>sailplane</b> aircraft. For expert flyers, jets, pylon racers, helicopters, autogyros, 3D aircraft, and other high-end competition aircraft provide adequate challenge. Some models are made to look and operate like a bird instead.

40|$|Thermal {{and dynamic}} soaring are two {{techniques}} commonly used by birds to extract {{energy from the}} atmosphere. This enables them to reduce, energy used during flight and increases their endurance. The thermal soaring technique involves extraction of energy from thermal updrafts and in dynamic soaring energy is extracted from wind shear. These techniques are investigated in this thesis using point mass and non-linear 6 DoF models of an unmanned <b>powered</b> <b>sailplane.</b> The key challenges of autonomous thermal soaring are the ability to identify remote thermal activity using on-board sensors and to position correctly in a thermal. In dynamic soaring, a real-time fuel saving trajectory generation technique along with a trajectory following control system is needed. A hand held IR camera {{was used to assess}} the feasibility to observe hot spots associated with thermals. The thermal positioning capability was demonstrated in a 6 DoF model using a positioning algorithm. The inverse Dynamics Virtual Domain (IDVD) technique was used to generate real-time trajectories for dynamic soaring applications using a point mass model of a <b>powered</b> unmanned <b>sailplane</b> <b>and</b> the fuel saving trajectories were validated using a high fidelity 6 DoF model and a classical controller. An important outcome of the research is the fact that energy saved during dynamic soaring flight was also realized due to a sinusoidal manoeuvre using reduced thrust. In this manoeuvre the kinetic energy is converted into potential energy by gaining altitude and by reducing airspeed. Then initial values of altitude and speed are gained by loosing the altitude. In this process a horizontal distance is travelled by using reduced thrust. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
