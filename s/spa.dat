40|$|The {{suspended}} plate antennas (<b>SPAs)</b> with shorting {{strips and}} slots are presented numerically and validated experimentally. Effects of narrow shorting strips on the impedance and radiation {{performances of the}} <b>SPAs</b> are studied. The symmetric use of shorting and feeding strips makes the <b>SPAs</b> structurally symmetrical, which is conducive to the radiation performance of the <b>SPAs.</b> Also, effects of narrow rectangular slots cut in the center or {{the edges of the}} plates are investigated. Cutting the slots reduces size, realizes dual-band operation, and improves radiation performance of <b>SPAs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that children's self-perceptions of their abilities predict their school achievement even after one accounts for their tested cognitive ability (IQ). However, {{the roles of}} nature and nurture in the association between school achievement and self-perceived abilities (<b>SPAs),</b> independent of IQ, is unknown. Here we reveal that there are substantial genetic influences on <b>SPAs</b> {{and that there is}} genetic covariance between <b>SPAs</b> and achievement independent of IQ. Although it has been assumed that the origins of <b>SPAs</b> are environmental, this first genetic analysis of <b>SPAs</b> yielded a heritability of 51 % in a sample of 3, 785 pairs of twins, whereas shared environment accounted for only 2 % of the variance in <b>SPAs.</b> Moreover, multivariate genetic analyses indicated that <b>SPAs</b> predict school achievement independently of IQ for genetic rather than environmental reasons. It should therefore be possible to identify "SPA genes" that predict school achievement independently of "IQ genes. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1908 the Women's Civic Improvement Club petitioned for the {{creation}} of community space along Ashland Creek, which became Ashland Canyon Park. The discovery of lithia water near Emigrant Lake around the same time led to a plan to establish a mineral <b>spa</b> at the park. Voters approved bonds to pay for the project, which included piping the mineral water from its source to Ashland. The town engaged John McLaren, landscape architect of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to Lithia Park. Although the park was popular, the mineral <b>spa</b> plans proved too expensive for local taxpayers and were abandoned in 1916. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs took to bottling and selling mineral waters from the area's springs.|$|E

40|$|The Bonelli’s eagle (BE) is {{considered}} by the European Union as a high-priority species for conservation in the Valencian Community (East of Spain). However, in 2006 the European Union opened a legal procedure against the Spanish Kingdom, accused of lacking of an adequate network of special protected areas (<b>SPAs)</b> to preserve the BE in the region. Here we evaluate whether important bird areas (IBAs) and <b>SPAs</b> network is enough to preserve this species, {{on the basis of}} a thorough analysis of habitat preferences. A GAP analysis is performed to conduct a revision of current <b>SPAs</b> and BirdLife proposed IBAs. Our results suggest that the current network of <b>SPAs</b> becomes insufficient to protect the BE. The IBAs network, although improves the current network of <b>SPAs,</b> increasing the percentage of BE potential habitat included, also results inadequate. We propose a new <b>SPAs</b> network according to the potential suitable habitat for the species. Given the trade-off between financial investment and the conservation of biodiversity, we propose to maximize the surface of potential habitat included in the protected network minimizing the surface of the region that would be necessary to protect, thus avoiding an unnecessary expense and otherwise unrealistic results.
