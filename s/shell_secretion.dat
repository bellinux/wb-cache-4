40|$|Ramonalina n. gen. {{is a large}} thick-shelled bivalve {{abundant}} in mounds preserved in the Gevanim Formation (late Anisian, Middle Triassic) of southern Israel. This bivalve was an edgewise-recliner with a flattened anteroventral (functionally basal) surface and partially fused valves. It {{is the basis of}} a new family, the Ramonalinidae, which is descended from the myalinids through adaptation to edgewise positioning. Ligamental attachment was inadequate to hold valves together on large adults, resulting in valve displacement followed by <b>shell</b> <b>secretion</b> in the apical area that fused valves together and caused irregular growth on abapical areas. The ramonalinids formed large, nearly monospecific mounds on firm mud substrates in shallow marine waters. These are the largest Middle Triassic bivalve mounds known...|$|E
40|$|Three {{processes}} by which a bivalve shell can preserve soft-bodied organisms during its secretion are described. These are: a) bioimmuration by the attachment area of a cementing bivalve, b) bioimmuration by a growth lamella and, c) deformation of the periostracal sheet. Examples of all three are provided by the Late Jurassic gryphaeid Deltoideum delta (Smith, 1817); Recent examples are also given. Extrapallial cement - here termed the Harper layer - is shown to have been produced throughout growth in this species, which allowed accurate lamellar bioimmuration as well as facultative recementation of the left valve.

The present study employed a multidisciplinary approach using histology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, proteomics and gene expression to investigate this process. Thirty seven proteins were identified via proteomic extraction of the nacreous shell layer, including two not previously found in nacre; a novel T-rich Mucin-like protein and a Zinc-dependent metalloprotease. In situ hybridisation of seven candidate biomineralisation genes revealed discrete spatial expression patterns within the mantle tissue, hinting at modular organisation, which is also observed in the mantle tissues of other molluscs. All seven of these biomineralisation candidates displayed evidence of multifunctionality and strong association with vesicles, which are potentially involved in <b>shell</b> <b>secretion</b> in this species...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{operculum}} {{is a novel}} {{structure in}} gastropod molluscs. Because the operculum shows notable similarities to the shell plate, we asked whether there were an evolutionary link between these two secretory organs. We found {{that some of the}} genes involved in shell-field development are expressed in the operculum, such as dpp and grainyhead, whereas engrailed and Hox 1 are not. Specific knockdown of dpp by injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) resulted in malformation of the shell plate. The shell plate was smaller due to failure of activation of cell proliferation in the shell-field margin. The expressions of grainyhead and chitin synthase 1 in the shell field margin were suppressed by dpp-dsRNA. However, matrix secretion was not completely abolished, and the expressions of ferritin, engrailed or Hox 1 were not affected by dpp-dsRNA, indicating that dpp is partly involved in the developmental pathway for <b>shell</b> matrix <b>secretion.</b> We also present evidence that dpp performs a key role in operculum development. Indeed, dpp-dsRNA impaired matrix secretion in the operculum as well as expression of grainyhead. Based on these observations that dpp is important for development of both the shell plate and operculum, we conclude that co-option of dpp to the posterior part of the foot contributed to the innovation of the operculum in gastropods...|$|R

Vascularity peaked during gravidity and was correlated with maximal plasma progesterone concentrations. The vascular increase in the oviducal tissue was attributed exclusively to increased capillary densities. The greatest change occurred in the anterior uterus where incubation and egg <b>shell</b> <b>secretion</b> occur. Similar patterns of change in vascularity occurred in the infundibulum, although not as extreme as that seen in the anterior uterus, whereas no significant alterations were noted in the posterior uterus. These modifications mimic the pattern of vascular change occurring in viviparous lizards during simple placentation.

40|$|The {{secretory}} epithelium {{that faces}} {{the shell of}} the clam Anomalocardia brasiliana is electrically excitable. It was found that two types of action potentials could be elicited by electrical stimulation. In mantles showing signs {{of being in the}} phase of <b>shell</b> <b>secretion,</b> cardiac-like action potentials were observed. They had an overshoot of 48 - 4 ± 8 - 8 mV (±S.

Mantles of clams resorbing the shell had spike-like action potentials with an overshoot of 38 - 7 ± 5 - 5 mV, a rate of rise of 52 - 7 ± 16 - 8 Vs " ', and a single phase of repolarization of 12 - 4 ± 2 - 5 Vs" 1. Their duration was 11 - 1 ± l- 4 ms. It is suggested that the presence of a plateau may be related to <b>shell</b> <b>secretion.</b> Significant differences were also found in the resting potentials: — 54 - 8 ± 5 - 4 mV in cells of mantles with cardiac-like responses and — 62 - 5 ± 4 " 9 mV in cells of mantles with spikes. In both types of mantles the action potentials were propagated throughout the epithelium and both exhibited a refractory period. Lowered Ca or increased frequency of stimulation reduced the plateau of cardiac-like action potentials without any marked alteration in the resting potential, rate of rise, or overshoot. The action potential was elicited by outward (depolarizing) current across the basolateral membrane, and not by similarly-directed current across the apical membrane, so we conclude that the basolateral membrane is the excitable one...|$|E
40|$|A fine {{hexagonal}} {{network of}} microscopic ridges {{has been discovered}} on the internal shell surface of the cosmopolitan Lower Palaeozoic inarticulate genus Lingulella. The micro-ornamentation has been recognised on all well-preserved specimens examined, from Cambrian and Ordovician successions in Ireland, North America, Gt. Britain, Spitzbergen, and China. Examination of the mantle of the related Recent genus Lingula revealed that the outer epithelial cells are arranged in a hexagonal close-packed pattern comparable in size and form to the micro-ornamentation in the fossil shells. This fact, along {{with the discovery of}} a polygonal pattern on some organic layers in the Lingula shell, suggests that the micro-ornamentation in fossil Lingulella is the mould of the outer epithelium responsible for <b>shell</b> <b>secretion.</b> No trace of epithelial moulds has yet been found in specimens of Lingula from younger Palaeozoic successions.

The genotoxic effect of xenoestrogens in terms of DNA damage was also studied. The results showed that the endothelial cell proliferation, H 3 thymidine incorporation, wound healing, CAM formation were increased following xenoestrogen exposure, but the intensity of angiogenesis was dependent on the structural homol. of these xenoestrogens to endogenous estrogen. Moreover, lindane was the most potent angiogenesis stimulator followed by propoxur and Endosulfan. Further studies were undertaken to examine lindane for its possible carcinogenicity.

40|$|The surface {{membrane}} is a lamellar structure exclusive of gastropods that is formed during the <b>shell</b> <b>secretion.</b> It protects {{the surface of}} the growing nacre and it is located between the mantle epithelium and the mineralization compartment. At the mantle side of the {{surface membrane}} numerous vesicles provide material, and at the nacre side, the interlamellar membranes detach from the whole structure. Components of nacre (glycoproteins, polysaccharides and calcium carbonate) cross the structure to reach the mineralization compartment, but the mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown. In this paper we have investigated the ultrastructure of the surface membrane and the associated vesicle layer by means of Transmission Electron Microscopy. Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy and Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy were used for elemental analysis.

40|$|Exceptionally {{preserved}} carbonate- and shale-hosted Mickwitzia muralensis {{from the}} Lower Cambrian Mural Formation, southern Canadian Rocky Mountains, complement {{one another to}} yield an unusually complete account of its ontogeny, ecology and phylogenetic relationships. The shell of M. muralensis is composed of dense phosphatic layers interspersed with porous organic-rich layers. At the insertion of shell-penetrating tubes, shell layers deflect inwards to produce inwardly pointing cones. The tubes are interpreted as having hosted setae that were secreted by outer-epithelial follicles. Follicular setae also occurred at the mantle margin, where they were oriented within {{the plane of the}} shell as in modern brachiopods. During ontogeny, the initial setae oriented in the plane of the shell occurred before the first shell-penetrative setae. In the juvenile and early-mature stages of <b>shell</b> <b>secretion,</b> a posterior opening was present between both valves and was used for the protrusion of an attachment structure. In the late-mature shell, this opening became fixed in the ventral valve. Based on the posterior margin and the shell microstructure, a close relationship between Mickwitzia and the paterinids is proposed with differences interpreted as heterochronic. The shell-penetrative setal apparatus of M. muralensis is distinct from that previously described of Micrina, though both types are conceivably homologous to adult and juvenile setae of modern brachiopods...|$|E
40|$|Marine macroinvertebrates {{are ideal}} {{sentinel}} organisms to monitor rapid environmental changes associated with climatic phenomena. These organisms build up protective exoskeletons incrementally by biologically-controlled mineralization, which is {{deeply rooted in}} long-term evolutionary processes. Recent studies relating potential rapid environmental fluctuations to climate change, such as ocean acidification, suggest modifications on carbonate biominerals of marine invertebrates. However, the influence of known, and recurrent, climatic events on these biological processes during active mineralization is still insufficiently understood. Analysis of Peruvian cockles from the 1982 – 83 large magnitude El Niño event shows significant alterations of the chemico-structure of carbonate biominerals. Here, we show that bivalves modify the main biomineralization mechanism during the event to continue <b>shell</b> <b>secretion.</b> As a result, magnesium content increases to stabilize amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), inducing a rise in Mg/Ca unrelated to the associated increase in sea-surface temperature. Analysis of variations in Sr/Ca also suggests that this proxy {{should not be used}} in these bivalves to detect the temperature anomaly, while Ba/Ca peaks are recorded in shells in response to an increase in productivity, or dissolved barium in seawater, after the event. Presented data contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of abrupt climate change on shell biomineralization, while also offering an alternative view of bivalve elemental proxy reconstructions. Furthermore, biomineralization changes in mollusk shells can be used as a novel potential proxy to provide a more nuance...|$|E
40|$|Members of the Myidae {{family are}} ecologically and {{economically}} important, {{but there is}} currently very little molecular data on these species. The present study sequenced and assembled the mantle transcriptome of Mya truncata from the North West coast of Scotland and identified candidate biomineralisation genes. RNA-Seq reads were assembled to create 20, 106 contigs in a de novo transciptome, 18. 81 % of which were assigned putative functions using BLAST sequence similarity searching (cuttoff E-value 1 E − 10). The most highly expressed genes were compared to the Antarctic clam (Laternula elliptica) and showed {{that many of the}} dominant biological functions (muscle contraction, energy production, biomineralisation) in the mantle were conserved. There were however, differences in the constitutive expression of heat shock proteins, which were possibly due to the M. truncata sampling location being at a relatively low latitude, and hence relatively warm, in terms of the global distribution of the species. Phylogenetic analyses of the Tyrosinase proteins from M. truncata showed a gene expansion which was absent in L. elliptica. The tissue distribution expression patterns of putative biomineralisation genes were investigated using quantitative PCR, all genes showed a mantle specific expression pattern supporting their hypothesised role in <b>shell</b> <b>secretion.</b> The present study provides some preliminary insights into how clams from different environments – temperate versus polar – build their shells.

Without {{a clear understanding of}} how environments have changed over time, it is difficult to interpret any changes currently occurring, or make predictions regarding the future. Geochemical analysis of bivalve shells has been employed in several studies to try and understand past environmental conditions and has proved to be very useful for this purpose. When using bivalve shells to interpret environmental parameters, it is useful to have a basic understanding of the process of <b>shell</b> <b>secretion.</b> Initially, the animal secretes the periostracum, an organic substance that forms an external protective coating on the shell. A layer of crystalline CaCO 3 is then deposited against this protein rich layer. As the animal grows, Ca and CO 3 ions are taken from the water and transported through the organism to the extrapallial fluid, between the mantle and the inner shell surface. Additional periostracum material is secreted into the extrapallial fluid, which forms the organic matrix for the nucleation of additional CaCO 3 crystals, in the form of either calcite or aragonite (Langston and Bebianno 1998; Westbroek and De Jong 1983). This CaCO 3 comprises the bulk of the shell. These growth cycles are seasonal, with CaCO 3 being deposited during periods of growth, and organic material secreted during dormant periods. These can be seen in shell cross sections as light and dark layers respectively...|$|E
40|$|Owing to {{the fact}} that low-Mg calcite fossil shells are so {{important}} in paleoceanographic research, 249 brachiopod, cement and matrix specimens from two neighboring localities (Jemez Springs and Battleship Rock), of the Upper Pennsylvanian Madera Formation were analyzed. Of which, about 86 % of the Madera brachiopods are preserved in their pristine mineralogy, microstructure and geochemistry. Cement and matrix samples, in contrast, have been subjected to complete but variable post-deposition~ 1 alteration. It is confirmed that the stable isotope data of brachiopods are much better than that of matrix material in defining depositional parameters. Because there is no uniform or constant relationship between the two data bases (e. g., from 0. 1 to 3. 0 % 0 for 0180 and from 0. 2 to 6. 7 % 0 for 013 C in this study), {{it is not possible to}} make corrections for the matrix data. Regarding the two stratigraphic sections, elemental and petrographic analyses suggest that Jemez Springs is closer to Penasco Uplift than Battleship Rock. Seawater at Jemez Springs is more aerobic, and the water chemistry is more influenced by continental sources than that at Battleship Rock. In addition, there is a relatively stronger dolomitization in the mid-section of the Battleship Rock. Results further suggest that no significant biogenic fractionation or vital effects occurred during their <b>shell</b> <b>secretion,</b> suggesting that the Madera brachiopods incorporated oxygen and carbon isotopes in equilibrium with the ambient seawater.

Analysis of biota can reflect many facets of an ecosystem or habitat, and can be a valuable complement to purely physical and geochemical methods. Studies have shown that molluscs, bivalves in particular, can be very useful bioindicators of pollution as metals can accumulate in both the soft tissue of the mollusc and their hard calcium carbonate shells. Indeed, {{in some cases the}} chemistry of shells can reflect the impact of anthropogenic activity upon their ecosystem (Carell et al. 1987).

40|$|The {{northwest}} {{coast of}} Bohai Bay supports {{large areas of}} Holocene Crassostrea gigas (oyster) reefs. Their huge size {{and the fact that}} the shells are composed of consecutive microgrowth layers, consisting of primary calcite, make them an ideal object for a stable isotope study. The delta(18) O and delta(13) C compositions of the oysters reveal a number of interesting features. The most important are annual cycles related to seasonal variations, the regional delta(18) O (water) versus salinity ratio, and a stop in <b>shell</b> <b>secretion</b> below a water temperature of 11. 5 +/- 1. 5 degrees C. A positive correlation (covariance) between delta(18) O and delta(13) C values is present in most specimens. The delta(18) O and delta(13) C values of single specimens are believed to be mainly controlled by water temperature and the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms and decomposition. However, correlation among oysters of different ages indicate that the delta(18) O and delta(13) C values are mainly dependant of three variables: water temperature, salinity and phytoplankton blooms/decomposition. Between ca. 6500 yrs cal B. P. and 2300 yrs cal B. P. the salinity in Bohai Bay increased from less than 20 parts per thousand to 30 parts per thousand. Based on geological data combined with ecological data from C. gigas, we suggest that precipitation decreased during this period, while the input of fluvial sediments increased. The sediment load of rivers increased markedly after ca. 4000 yrs cal B. P., possibly due to a change in climate. In our study area this resulted in the development of the Oyster Plain...|$|E

Regression analysis indicated that the laboratory and field experiments produced clear but different linear trends and we have shown that the field cage thermometry equation is the most suitable for application to the fossil record. Comparisons made with existing aragonitic thermometry equations shows that the Viviparus contectus field collection and field cage equations {{are similar to those of}} both marine and freshwater aragonitic gastropods. Caged specimens were grown (Somerset, UK) between February and August 2008, with water samples and temperature measurements taken monthly.

40|$|Therocephalians were a speciose clade of nonmammalian therapsids whose {{ecological}} diversity and survivorship of the end-Permian mass extinction offer {{the potential to}} investigate the evolution of growth patterns across the clade and their underlying influences on post-extinction body size reductions, or ‘Lilliput effects’. We present a phylogenetic survey of limb bone histology and growth patterns in therocephalians from the Middle Permian through Middle Triassic of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Histologic sections were prepared from 80 limb bones representing 11 genera of therocephalians. Histologic indicators of skeletal growth, including cortical vascularity (%CV) and mean primary osteon diameters (POD), were evaluated in a phylogenetic framework and assessed for correlations with other biologically significant variables (e. g., size and robusticity). Changes in %CV and POD correlated strongly with evolutionary changes in body size (i. e., smaller-bodied descendants tended to have lower %CV than their larger-bodied ancestors across the tree). Bone wall thickness tended to be high in early therocephalians and lower in the gracile-limbed baurioids, but showed no general correlation with cross-sectional area or degree of vascularity (and, thus, growth). Clade-level patterns, however, deviated from previously studied within-lineage patterns. For example, Moschorhinus, one of few therapsid genera to have survived the extinction boundary, demonstrated higher %CV in the Triassic than in the Permian despite its smaller size in the extinction aftermath. Results support a synergistic model of size reductions for Triassic therocephalians, influenced both by within-lineage heterochronic shifts in survivor taxa (as reported in Moschorhinus and the dicynodont Lystrosaurus) and phylogenetically inferred survival of small-bodied taxa that had evolved short growth durations (e. g., baurioids). These findings mirror the multi-causal Lilliput patterns described in marine faunas, but contrast with skeletochronologic studies that suggest slow, prolonged <b>shell</b> <b>secretion</b> over several years in marine benthos.

40|$|Well {{preserved}} {{specimens of}} the Early Palaeozoic craniiform brachiopods Orthisocrania and Craniops retain {{clear evidence of}} a lecithotrophic larval stage, indicating the loss of planktotrophy early in their phylogeny. The size of the earliest mineralized dorsal shell was < 100 mu m across, and the well preserved shell structure in these fossil craniiforms allows their earliest ontogeny to be compared directly with that of living Novocrania, in which the first mineralized dorsal shell (metamorphic shell) is secreted only after settlement of the lecithotrophic larvae. Immediately outside this earliest shell (early post-metamorphic or brephic shell) and {{in the rest of}} the dorsal valve the primary layer in both fossil and living craniiforms has characteristic radially arranged laths, which are invariably lacking in the earliest dorsal shell. The ventral valve of the fossil specimens commonly preserves traces of an early attachment scar (cicatrix), which is equal in size to the dorsal metamorphic shell, and the brephic post-metamorphic ventral valve also has a primary shell with radially arranged laths. However, a primary shell with radial laths is completely lacking in the ventral valve of living Novocrania, indicating that heterochrony may have been involved in the origin of the encrusting mode of life in living craniids; the entire ventral valve of Recent craniids (with the possible exception of Neoancistrocrania) may correspond to the earliest attachment scar of some fossil taxa such as Orthisocrania. It is also probable that the unique absence of an inner mantle lobe as well as the absence of lobate cells in Novocrania could be the result of heterochronic changes. The dorsal valve of both fossil and living craniiforms has a marked outer growth ring, around 500 mu m across, marking the transition to the adult, and a significant change in regime of <b>shell</b> <b>secretion.</b> The earliest craniiform attachment is considered to be homologous to the unique attachment structures described recently in polytoechioids (e. g.

The stratigraphic δ 13 C and δ 18 O trends {{are consistent with}} the global seawater variations during the Campanian and confirm strong climatic perturbation accompanying the global sea-level fall during the uppermost Campanian. Chalk samples contain disseminated early-diagenetic microcrystalline calcite cement having δ 13 C and δ 18 O values only slightly different (by < 1 ‰) than those of separated nannoplankton. This cementation did not alter significantly the original bulk C and O isotopic composition of bulk chalk, which supports the applicability of isotopic analyses of chalk samples, even those containing carbonate cements, for paleoceanographic and chemostratigraphic investigations. Significant differences in δ 13 C and δ 18 O values between different constituents measured from the same levels are discernible. They are related with thermal gradients in the water column and with the habitat and vital effects of biogenic components. Benthic foraminifera reflect strong vital effects in δ 13 C and δ 18 O with a tendency to lower values than the other sample types. The minimum strength of the disequilibrium fractionation effect for δ 18 O during foraminiferal <b>shell</b> <b>secretion</b> is estimated up to 2 ‰. Belemnites show offsets in δ 13 C values, which are difficult to estimate, but their δ 18 O values appear to have recorded composition of seawater.

Slightly higher fertility resulted after inseminations at 4 : 00 p. m. than after 11 : 50 p. m. inseminations for 2 to 6 days and 2 to 9 days following inseminations; however, the differences were not statistically significant. Fertility for 10 to 17 days following insemination was significantly higher when inseminations were made at 11 : 50 p. m. than at 8 : 00 a. m. or 4 : 00 p. m. Duration of fertility was longest after the 11 : 50 p. m. inseminations. Only after the 8 : 00 a. m. inseminations were there hens with zero fertility. Fertility as influenced by time of oviposition following insemination was also studied. Reduced fertility resulted when hens were inseminated 1 to 4 and 23 to 28 hours prior to oviposition. The incidence of hens with zero fertility also was greater when hens were inseminated 1 to 4 hours before oviposition. Those hens laying within four hours after insemination had a hard-shelled egg in the uterus at the time of insemination; and many of those laying within 23 to 28 hours after insemination had an egg in the magnum, were ovulating or approaching ovulation.

The respective roles of the calcium needs for shell formation and of the reproductive status in regulation of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 production were analysed. Plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 decreased 3 hr after suppression of shell formation following premature egg expulsion and remained lower than that of hens laying hard-shelled eggs when premature expulsion of the eggs was continued for several days. Circulating 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 tended to increase progressively when shell formation was resumed. Ablation of the parathyroid glands abolished this increase. In hens laying hard-shelled eggs, the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 was higher during the period of <b>shell</b> <b>secretion.</b> Feeding hens a low calcium diet (1. 2 %) caused a marked increase in the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3.

In hypercalcemic hens laying shell-less eggs and fed a 3. 5 % Ca diet, the plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 was at a high level 4 hr after ovulation and diminished thereafter. This additive stimulation does not, therefore, involve the parathyroid gland and may involve hormonal changes induced by ovulation. Vitamin D binding protein (DBP) in the plasma was at a high level in mature hens and was not affected by shell formation. Consequently, the free 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 index fluctuated in parallel with total level of this hormone in mature hens. It is concluded that the calcium demand for shell formation modulates, in the short term, plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, via the homeostatic regulation of blood calcium by PTH, but that a large part of its increase is independent of PTH and is associated with the endocrine events concomitant with ovulation. status: publishe...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2013 Despite their {{relative}} diversity in terrestrial Permian and Triassic rocks, {{the fossil record}} of therocephalian therapsids (Eutheriodontia) and their utility for understanding evolutionary patterns in the therapsid forerunners of mammals remains poorly understood. In this study, I investigate {{the extent to which}} body size reductions and shifts in growth patterns in Triassic therocephalians were influenced by the end-Permian mass extinction (ca. 252. 3 Ma) (rather than the culmination of longer-term phylogenetic trends traceable to their Permian predecessors). Specifically, I examine whether body size reductions observed in earliest Triassic therocephalians (`Lilliput phenomena') were the product of within-lineage size reductions, differential extinctions, or rapid diversifications of new small-bodied clades. To address this question, I first review the global diversity and taxonomic composition of therocephalians from the Middle Permian through early-Middle Triassic (Chapter 1). I then present a paleobiological investigation of the Permo-Triassic therocephalian Moschorhinus as a case study on within-lineage patterns of growth and body size evolution during the end-Permian mass extinction (Chapter 2). Finally, I examine clade-wide (among-taxon) size patterns by evaluating the stratigraphic and phylogenetic components of body size evolution (Chapter 3) and the underlying influences of bone histology and growth (Chapter 4). To examine within-lineage patterns, I studied cranial sizes and limb bone histology in Permian and Triassic specimens of Moschorhinus, the largest therapsid predator found {{both before and after the}} end-Permian mass extinction. Triassic specimens were found to have significantly decreased basal skull lengths compared to Permian specimens. Histological analysis indicated that variations in body size were associated with differences in subadult growth rate and duration (traits that are highly variable in environmentally stressed extant reptile species). Small Triassic individuals tended to display limb bones with fewer growth marks and more richly vascularized bone tissues than similarly sized Permian individuals, with an abundance of radially-oriented vascular canals, corroborating the hypothesis that conditions of the earliest Triassic favored rapid growth to a minimum body size requirement in Moschorhinus and, consequently, shortened developmental times. Broader-scale `Lilliput-type' patterns were examined in a large sample of therocephalians and compared with that of their sister clade, Cynodontia, in both geologic and phylogenetic contexts. Using a museum collections-based approach, I evaluated temporal and phylogenetic distributions of body size in Permo-Triassic eutheriodonts by time series analysis, rank order correlations, and phylogenetic model fitting. Results supported significant size reductions in earliest Triassic eutheriodonts, but suggested a pattern that was underscored largely by Brownian processes and constructive selectivity (a more general tendency to evolve smaller body sizes as in background intervals). Geologically brief size reductions were likely accomplished by the ecological removal of large-bodied species without rapid originations of new small-bodied clades or shifts from long-term evolutionary patterns. Finally, a survey of growth patterns and histomorphology in limb bones of Karoo therocephalians indicated that long-term changes in bone tissue vascularization (and thus growth) correlated with evolutionary changes in body size (e. g., smaller-bodied descendants tended to have less vascularized bone tissues than their larger-bodied ancestors). Results support a synergistic model of size reductions for Triassic therocephalians, influenced both by within-lineage heterochronic shifts in survivor taxa (e. g., Moschorhinus) and cladistically inferred survival of small-bodied taxa with short growth durations (e. g., baurioids). These findings mirror the multi-causal Lilliput patterns described in marine faunas, but contrast with skeletochronologic studies that suggest slowed, prolonged <b>shell</b> <b>secretion</b> in marine benthos. Subjecting new histologic data to phylogenetic comparative methods, as in these therocephalians, will improve our understanding of the generality of growth and size shifts in Lilliput faunas and interplay between macroevolution and extinction during this and other major geologic transitions...|$|E
