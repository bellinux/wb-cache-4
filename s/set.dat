These are corollaries of a more general result stating that the class of <b>sets</b> that are p-isomorphic to P-quasi-approximable <b>sets</b> has measure 0 in E.

The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The <b>set</b> was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the <b>set.</b> Due to popular demand, a corrected <b>set</b> was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E

When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, near <b>sets</b> {{are either}} {{spatially}} close or descriptively close. Spatially close <b>sets</b> have nonempty intersection.

5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his <b>set</b> theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a <b>set,</b> the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's <b>set</b> theory, the ordinals form a <b>set,</b> so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his <b>set</b> theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E
