2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1969, public outcry {{regarding}} the murders committed by the individual dubbed by the press as the Michigan Murderer and the Co-Ed Killer was increasing, particularly among the student population of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. The increase in frequency in which the killer was striking throughout {{the spring and summer}} of 1969—coupled with the fact most victims had been connected to the University of Michigan or Eastern Michigan University, suggesting the killer may be a fellow student—further compounded the concerns of female university students. Many female students opted to arm themselves with knives, with others adopting a [...] "buddy system" [...] whereby they would refuse to walk anywhere unless in the company of a trusted male friend or at least three other girls. Sales of tear gas, knives, and <b>security</b> <b>locks</b> increased, hitchhiking became a rarity among students, and the reward offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer increased to $42,000.|$|E

Casey and Joe also pass their latches. As for the peephole, Dez and Tex pass, but the others fail due to damaging the peephole lens with mallets (for Joe and Charmaine) or sledgehammers (in Casey's case). Finally, Tex fails to install his door (and thus does not install his latch at all) after splitting the doorjambs twice while assembling it.|$|E

5000|$|A luggage lock is a lock used {{to prevent}} luggage from opening by accident, usually {{with little or no}} {{security}} in mind, although they may serve as a deterrent to potential thieves.

50|$|Nevertheless, the {{business}} continued to grow. In 1879, the Fichet company built its first bank vault room with rentable safe deposit lockers.

50|$|A {{restricted}} keyblank has a keyway {{for which}} a manufacturer {{has set up a}} restricted level of sales and distribution. Restricted keys are often protected by patent, which prohibits other manufacturers from making unauthorized productions of the key blank. In many cases, customers must provide proof of ID before a locksmith will cut additional keys using restricted blanks. Some companies, such as Medeco High <b>Security</b> <b>Locks,</b> have keyways that are restricted to having keys cut in the factory only. This is done to ensure the highest amount of security. These days, many restricted keys have special in-laid features, such as magnets, different types of metal, or even small computer chips to prevent duplication.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} way {{to open the}} majority of pin locks is to insert a key (or variety of keys) which have been cut so that each peak of the key is equal and has been cut down to the lowest groove of the key. This key is then struck sharply with a hammer whilst applying torque. The force of the blow is carried {{down the length of}} the key and (operating as does a Newton's cradle) will move only the driver pins leaving the key pins in place. If done correctly this briefly creates a gap around the shear line alowing the plug to rotate freely. Some modern high <b>security</b> <b>locks</b> include bumping protection, such as Master Lock's [...] "BumpStop" [...] and Ilco's [...] "Bump Halt" [...] technology.|$|E

40|$|There {{are various}} {{techniques}} for defeating locks based on exploiting vibration. In recent years, {{one of these}} techniques for manipulating cylinder locks, called "bumping", has become widespread. The problem is that a large variety of mechanical locks can be opened quickly, in a non-‐destructive manner by using simple attack tools. We studied the physical phenomena responsible for the vibration techniques of lock opening. We considered {{the period of time}} during which the pins of a cylinder lock remain separated as a function of natural frequency, damping properties, and lock design parameters. On the basis of this analysis, we suggest some changes to lock design and assembly that can enhance the <b>security</b> of the <b>lock</b> and resist bumping attacks. Key words: <b>locks,</b> <b>security</b> <b>lock,</b> lock picking, bumping, design of secure locks Pin Tumbler Cylinder When people talk about "the cylinder lock " or “the pin tumbler cylinder”, they have in mind the classic locking mechanism invented by Linus Yale in 1861. The concept is so simple and effective that it remains the basic design principle of modern locks. The mechanis...|$|R
