40|$|We {{present results}} from six {{randomized}} control trials {{of an integrated}} approach to improve livelihoods among the very poor. The approach combines the transfer of a productive asset with consumption support, training, and coaching plus <b>savings</b> <b>encouragement</b> and health education and/or services. Results from {{the implementation of the}} same basic program, adapted {{to a wide variety of}} geographic and institutional contexts and with multiple implementing partners, show statistically significant cost-effective impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by increases in self-employment income) and psychosocial status of the targeted households. The impact on the poor households lasted at least a year after all implementation ended. It is possible to make sustainable improvements in the economic status of the poor with a relatively short-term intervention.

40|$|This paper aims at {{explaining}} {{the dynamics of}} welfare capitalism in Japan. As opposed to previous studies, it emphasizes the role of fiscal system by raising {{the question of how}} <b>savings</b> <b>encouragement</b> combined with low taxation affected the welfare dynamics. During the industrialization period, the Japanese government mobilized private savings as if it were public money. This capital mobilization strategy made the features of the Japanese welfare system exceedingly different from those of western countries, both by making it possible for the government to maintain the small tax state and by enabling households to actively utilize savings assets as a welfare measure. This distinctive institutional setting had an enormous effect on welfare dynamics after the oil shocks of the 1970 s by making it difficult for the government to introduce the new consumption tax and by increasing the importance of assetbased welfare. With the emphasis on fiscal system, this paper contributes to the development of comparative welfare capitalism studies which have explored the possible linkage of welfare and capitalism. Introduction Institutional complementarities among tax, finance, and welfare The origin of Japanese fiscal system The formation of the postwar Japanese welfare capitalism Path-dependency of the Japanese welfare capitalism Implications and conclusions Reference...|$|R
