40|$|International audienceSecurity is {{a concern}} that {{must be taken into}} {{consideration}} starting from the early stages of system development. Over the last two decades, researchers and engineers have developed a considerable number of methods for <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering.</b> Some of them rely on the (re) use of security knowledge. Despite some existing surveys about <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering,</b> there is not yet any reference for researchers and practitioners that presents in a systematic way the existing proposals, techniques, and tools related to security knowledge reuse in <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} fill this gap by looking into drawing a picture of the literature on knowledge and reuse in <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering.</b> The questions we address are related to methods, techniques, modeling frameworks, and tools for and by reuse in <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering.</b> We address these questions through a systematic mapping study. The mapping study was a literature review conducted with the goal of identifying, analyzing, and categorizing state-of-the-art research on our topic. This mapping study analyzes more than thirty approaches, covering 20 years of research in <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering.</b> The contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) A framework was defined for analyzing and comparing the different proposals as well as categorizing future contributions related to knowledge reuse and security requirements engineering; (2) the different forms of knowledge representation and reuse were identified; and (3) previous surveys were updated. We conclude that most methods should introduce more reusable knowledge to manage security requirements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aligning an ICT {{system with}} a {{security}} standard is a challenging task, because of the sparse support for development and documentation that these standards provide. We create patterns for the elements of trustworthiness: security, risk management, privacy, and law. The instantiations of these patterns are used to support the development and documentation of ICT systems according to security standards. In addition, we define relations between security standards and <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering</b> approaches. Key words: <b>security</b> standards, requirements <b>engineering,</b> <b>security,</b> patterns...|$|R

25|$|Reliability {{engineering}} is {{the discipline of}} ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure {{it is just as}} much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some), and logistics engineering. Reliability {{engineering is}} always a critical component of safety engineering, as in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and hazard fault tree analysis, and of <b>security</b> <b>engineering.</b>|$|E
25|$|Information Assurance (IA) is {{the process}} of getting the right {{information}} to the right people at the right time. IA adds business benefit through the use of Information Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, <b>security</b> <b>engineering,</b> and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.|$|E

40|$|Manifold {{approaches}} to <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering</b> have been proposed, {{yet there is}} no consensus how to elicit, analyze, or express security needs. This perspective paper systematizes the problem space of <b>security</b> requirements <b>engineering.</b> <b>Security</b> needs result from the interplay of three dimensions: threats, security goals, and system design. Elementary statements can be made in each dimension, but such one-dimensional requirements remain partial and insufficient. To understand security needs, one has to analyze their interaction. Distinct analysis tasks arise for each pair of dimensions and are supported by different techniques: risk analysis, as in CORAS, between threats and security goals; security design, as exemplified by the framework of Haley et al., between goals and design; and security design analysis, such as Microsoft's threat modeling technique with data flow diagrams and STRIDE, between design and threats. All three perspectives are necessary to develop secure systems. <b>Security</b> requirements <b>engineering</b> must iterate through them, because threats determine the relevance of security goals, security design seeks ways to fulfill them, and design choices themselves influence threats and security goals...|$|R
