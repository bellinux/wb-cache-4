40|$|The lack {{of proper}} {{policies}} for the rural environment, {{in contrast to}} the situation in the urban environment in Brazil, has prevented the rural population from benefiting from basic infrastructure and access to their rights as citizens. The poor school transportation conditions are large barriers to access and retention of pupils in schools. These poor conditions, with lack of comfort and high accident risks, result in long travelling hours to reach the school and lessen learning performance because the children arrive in the school tired and sleepy. The Brazilian Federal Government has adopted different programs and actions in order to overcome these difficulties and to improve school conditions in general. A new standard vehicle has been adopted, which will be fit for the harsh road conditions in the rural areas, and handbooks have been introduced to help the municipalities and their officials to plan and to contract <b>school</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> This paper provides an overview of the outlook for rural school transportation in Brazil, describing the operational conditions (including trip and vehicle conditions) and their users, as well as analysis on the effects on school performance, and also the role of the local and Federal governments.

5000|$|The City Council {{has decided}} that each {{construction}} project should have between 20% and 30% social housing. The first obstacle is that the commune owns little suitable land in built-up areas to build social housing (near <b>schools,</b> shops, <b>services,</b> <b>transport,</b> etc. to avoid creating [...] "ghettos"). The value {{of the land is}} very high and the commune must sell land to social housing operators at well below the actual value. Furthermore, the municipality must guarantee 50% of the borrowings and contribute financially up to €20,000 per unit. The procedures are slow and it can take 3 or 4 years from the sales agreement and delivery of the first housing.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>School</b> <b>transport</b> in Spain is {{conceived}} administratively as a regular, but special, public <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> {{financed by the}} Spanish regional govern-ments through private sector contracts adjudicated by public tendering. As such it has two special features in comparison to systems elsewhere. First, larger operators use conventional buses (rather than special school buses) and these {{can also be used}} for regular services during school hours. Second, as these are regional services, often only regional operators bid for these tenders, so contract assignment resembles a bargaining process between operators and administra-tions, tempering an adequate operation of the market. This problem is common to all Spanish regions. The situation described has generated high costs (i. e. 15 % increase in contract costs in the past year although the number of contracts did not vary significantly). For this reason the Government of Cantabria commis-sioned research to examine the problem. A simple cost allocation model allowed us to detect that <b>school</b> <b>transport</b> costs were, on average, approximately 18 % higher than what could be deemed reasonable. This article describes the problem...|$|R

40|$|Transport is {{a crucial}} {{component}} in logistics, which joints each activity in the logistics chain. The performance of logistics heavily relies on the efficiency of <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> However, until now {{there has not been}} a clear definition about <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, along with the rapid rise of fuel prices, the input-output ratio of transport has been trapped in an unreasonable situation, which causes the poor performance of logistics. Therefore, the research on <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> and <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> efficiency is urgently required.
