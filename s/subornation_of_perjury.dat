The case was called to trial on November 12, 1906, in the Federal District Court in Omaha before Judge William H. Munger. Richards and Comstock did not testify. United States Secret Service men spent 13 months investigating and getting evidence. Affidavits were taken from 600 witnesses, subpoenas were issued for 165 witnesses, and 132 people offered evidence in trail.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and <b>subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury</b> in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E

[...] She was fined $10,000 and given a 10-year prison sentence, with Toguri's attorney Collins lambasting the verdict as [...] "Guilty without evidence".

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{examines the}} idea that partisan witness preparation in criminal trials in the United States amounts to a comparative anomaly in the common law context. In American procedure, parties are not constrained by straightforward rules and ethical canons in their choice and deployment of preparation techniques, save for a prohibition on <b>subornation</b> and use <b>of</b> <b>perjury.</b> The lax regulation of pre-trial witness interviews in the US contrasts with the stricter rules on professional conduct of barristers and prosecutors in England and Wales and the cautious attitude towards extensive witness preparation prevailing in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. These divisions mark deep-seated differences between these countries in what fact-finding arrangements are deemed optimal in the criminal process and what importance is given to witness spontaneity {{as opposed to a}} leeway for parties to shape the evidence submitted for evaluation to the factfinder. Although comparative divergence alone does not render the US approach ‘anomalous’, the difficulty of reconciling its liberal practice with the trial system’s quest for the truth in a sense justifies this label. Some of the excesses of the current practice could be remedied and the truthfinding objective given a more prominent place in the criminal process if a stricter approach were taken towards the regulation of witness preparation in the US and legal and ethical norms were aligned more closely to establishing the truth. In distinguishing between ethical and unethical conduct, the rules should consider not only the mental element of counsel but also the objective effects of preparation on the authenticity and accuracy of witness recollection. While more research into such effects is needed, the article argues tentatively that the most suggestive and therefore objectionable techniques used in the US should be abandoned or subjected to more rigorous regulation...|$|R
60|$|And here, my Lords, I {{would wish}} to say {{something}} of the miserable situation {{of the people of}} that country; but it is not in my commission, and I must be silent, and shall only request your Lordships to observe how this crime of bribery grows in its magnitude. First, the bribe is taken, through Gunga Govind Sing, from this infant, for his succession to the zemindary. Next follows the removal from their offices, and consequent ruin, of all his nearest natural relations. Then the delivery of the province to Debi Sing, upon the pretence of the arrears due to the Company, with all the subsequent horrors committed under the management of that atrocious villain. And lastly, the gross <b>subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury,</b> in making this wretched minor, under twelve years of age, bear testimony upon oath to the good qualities of Mr. Hastings and of his government,--this minor, I say, who lived three hundred miles from the seat of his government, and who, if he knew anything at all of his own affairs, must have known that Mr. Hastings was the cause of all his sufferings.|$|E
50|$|In American law and in Scots law the <b>subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury</b> is {{the crime}} of persuading a person to commit perjury — the {{swearing}} of a false oath {{to tell the truth}} in a legal proceeding, be it spoken or written. The term <b>subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury</b> further describes the circumstance wherein an attorney at law causes a client to lie under oath, or allows another party to lie under oath.|$|E

50|$|<b>Subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury</b> {{stands as}} a subset of American perjury laws and prohibits an {{individual}} from inducing another to commit perjury. <b>Subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury</b> entails equivalent possible punishments as perjury on the federal level. This crime requires an extra level of satisfactory proof, as prosecutors must show not only that perjury occurred, but also that the defendant positively induced said perjury. Furthermore, the inducing defendant must know that the suborned statement is a false, perjurious statement.|$|E

50|$|Williamson's trial also {{resulted}} in conviction for <b>subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury</b> in 1905.

50|$|Moreover, an {{attorney}} who actively encourages a witness to give false testimony is suborning perjury, which is a crime punished either with formal disciplinary action, disbarment, or jail, or a combination thereof. Likewise, a false statement by {{an attorney}} in court also is a crime similar to <b>subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury,</b> and is punished accordingly. Hence, in the professional conduct of an attorney at law, there is a fine delineation between assisting a witness to recall occurred events and encouraging {{him or her to}} give materially false testimony. The practice of ″horse shedding the witness″ (rehearsing testimony) is an example of such perjurious criminal conduct by an attorney, which is depicted in the true-crime novel Anatomy of a Murder (1958), by Robert Traver, and in the eponymous film (Otto Preminger, 1959), about a rape-and-murder case wherein are explored the ethical and legal problems inherent to the <b>subornation</b> <b>of</b> <b>perjury.</b>|$|E
