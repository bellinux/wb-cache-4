25|$|The {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} {{for eight years}} or 125,000 miles (200,000km in metric countries) for the base model with the 60kWh battery pack. The 85kWh battery pack is guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles. A poll among drivers indicate that accumulated battery loss <b>steadies</b> around 5% after 30,000 miles (50,000km), decreasing further about 1% per additional 30,000 miles. Unlike Nissan, Tesla does not specify a limit for battery loss, but some early battery packs have been replaced. A separate battery replacement guarantee takes effect after the eighth year for the 60kWh and 85kWh batteries. Lithium-ion batteries operate best at certain temperatures. The Model S motor, controller and battery temperatures are controlled by a liquid cooling/heating circuit. Waste heat from the motor heats the battery in cold conditions, and battery performance is reduced until a suitable battery temperature is reached.|$|E

5000|$|Four {{models of}} this signal exist. The one with 4 lamps {{is the most}} common. It has a <b>steady</b> red arrow, a <b>steady</b> yellow arrow, a {{flashing}} yellow arrow, and a <b>steady</b> green arrow. One rare version has five lenses, with a <b>steady</b> red arrow, two <b>steady</b> yellow arrows, a flashing yellow arrow, and a <b>steady</b> green arrow, and is only used sometimes, {{when there is a}} leading protected left turn. There are also two with 3 lamps. One signal has a <b>steady</b> red arrow, a <b>steady</b> yellow arrow, and a [...] "dual indication" [...] third lamp which can display either a <b>steady</b> green arrow or a flashing yellow arrow. The other 3-lamp signal has a <b>steady</b> red arrow, a <b>steady</b> yellow arrow and a flashing yellow arrow, with no green arrow; this can be used for either left or right turns, and is used to prevent yellow trap where no green arrow left turn phase exists on the approach. This cannot be done with the circular green without causing yellow trap, because a circular green releases other movements. The <b>steady</b> arrows all have their usual meanings. A flashing yellow arrow indicates a [...] "permitted" [...] left turn, where drivers may turn left without stopping (same as a Yield Sign), but opposing traffic has the right-of-way. The flashing yellow arrow must always be followed by either a <b>steady</b> yellow arrow or a <b>steady</b> green arrow.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for stabilizing intermediate <b>steady</b> state of CSTR is proposed {{by using a}} special type of periodic forced operation, socalled mediating operation.

30|$|The most {{important}} {{effect of the}} stocking is that system (2.4) can have three interior <b>steady</b> states. Without stocking, system (2.3) has at most two interior <b>steady</b> states where the smaller one is a saddle point and the other <b>steady</b> state is asymptotically stable. One region of the solutions converges to the <b>steady</b> state on the positive y-axis so that the x population is driven to extinction when the population is subject to Allee effects {{but there is no}} stocking. When system (2.4) has three interior <b>steady</b> states, then the middle interior <b>steady</b> state is a saddle point while the other two interior <b>steady</b> states are asymptotically stable. See Theorem  3.3 (a)(ii). The stable manifold of the saddle point separates R_+^ 2 into two positively invariant regions such that solutions in each of these regions converge to the corresponding interior <b>steady</b> state. Therefore, for this parameter regime, given in Theorem  3.3 (a)(ii), both competing populations can coexist as an interior <b>steady</b> state, where the magnitude of the population sizes depends on the initial populations.|$|R
