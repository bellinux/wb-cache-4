It is believed that the nag deity visits the household, enjoys languishing in the moist chandan, drinks the milk offering and blesses the household with good luck. Women put temporary henna tattoos (mehndi) on their hand on the previous day and buy new bangles on Nagpanchami Day.

An optimum frequency was suggested for a given condition to realize a more effective <b>soil</b> <b>cutting</b> process. A tillage tool operating on agricultural soil was considered as a cantilever beam subjected to the fluctuating <b>soil</b> <b>cutting</b> resistance. A finite element model was developed to simulate {{the response of the}} deflection, velocity and acceleration of the shank and tillage tool when the soil resistance was applied {{at the end of the}} shank.

40|$|Short crack {{behaviour}} {{during the}} two-dimensional cutting of brittle agricultural soils is a non-symmetrical mixed mode crack loading problem. The inability {{to resolve this}} problem limited the brittle fracture <b>soil</b> <b>cutting</b> theory developed earlier by Aluko and Chandler (2004). In this paper, finite element modelling was used to simulate the loading of a brittle soil, in which a horizontally propagating crack had been initiated, by a two- dimensional plane cutting blade. Using a finite element subroutine, solutions were obtained for the separate values of the modulus (), mode I (KI) and mode II (KII) stress intensity factors for both short and long crack regimes. Further analysis of the stress intensity factor curves led to two possible interpretations for estimating peak <b>soil</b> <b>cutting</b> forces: the energy criterion and the direct mode I criterion. Using both criteria, brittle fracture force predictions were carried out for polished plane cutting blades in a sandy loam and a clay loam soil. The energy criterion was found to under-predict <b>soil</b> <b>cutting</b> forces when compared with published experimentally measured forces on these soils. However, the direct mode I criterion gave reasonable force estimates compared to measured values over a limited range of low rake angles. In conjunction with the passive pressure theory, the brittle fracture model {{can be used to}} predict the expected soil failure mechanism in a given situation by applying the minimal energy criterion in the comparison of forces predicted by both theories...|$|E

30|$|Analytical {{models have}} also been used to predict the {{drilling}} load [9, 14 – 20]. The analytical model of drill-soil interaction was developed using the screw conveyance theory and soil shear rupture principle. The analysis of the soil rupture {{is based on the}} passive earth pressure theory, which has successfully been used to predict the bulldozing force [21, 22]. According to the shape and cutting rake angle of the blade, different cutting models have been proposed to describe the soil rupture mechanism [23 – 26]. These theories {{can be used as a}} fundamental reference for modeling drill-tool interaction. The screw conveyance calculation, which is similar to the bulk solid screw conveyor design, can predict particle screw conveyance load and efficiency [27 – 29]. According to the screw diameters and the rotary speed of an auger, the centripetal force or the weight of particles are the main causes of auger conveyance [30, 31]. The rotary speed is always less than 300  r/min, and the diameters of the drill tool are generally limited below 50  mm in extraterrestrial exploration. For such orders of rotary speed and diameters, the weight of particles could be the main component that provides cuttings conveyance [30]. This study models the screw conveyance process based on a quasi-static analysis. In addition, in a significant number of previous works, the drill-soil interaction was simply divided into screw conveyance and <b>soil</b> <b>cutting</b> processes. The boundary conditions and soil mechanical property differences between these two processes were ignored in previous modeling of the drill-soil interaction. Thus, the calculated results, i.e., the summations of the screw conveyance load and <b>soil</b> <b>cutting</b> load, must either be further verified or only used in special situations.|$|E
