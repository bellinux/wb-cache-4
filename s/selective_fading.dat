Experimental hardware research of these adaptive patent pending Feher Equalizers (FE) confirms computer simulated data [1]. A two-ray RF <b>selective</b> <b>faded</b> telemetry channel has been simulated. A dynamically changing channel environment with a <b>selective</b> <b>fade</b> rate in the 1 Hz to 50 Hz range has been constructed by laboratory hardware. The Test and Evaluation (T&E) setup had RF frequency selective dynamic notch depth variations in the Power Spectral Density (PSD) within the band of the signal of up to 15 dB. As an illustrative example of the adaptive equalizer capability we used a 1 Mb/s rate Feher patented FQPSK [1] Commercially Of The Shelf (COTS) product. Both hardware experimental results as well as simulation indicate substantial performance improvement with the utilization of the FE. It is demonstrated that the FE improves for a large class of frequency <b>selective</b> <b>faded</b> systems the Bit Error Rate(BER) from 10 ^- 2 to 10 ^- 6.

5000|$|... "Speed", {{intended}} to be roughly comparable to words per minute, is the standard term introduced by Western Union for a mechanical teleprinter data transmission rate using the 5-bit ITA2 code that was popular in the 1940s and for several decades thereafter. Such a machine would send 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.42 stop bits. This unusual stop bit time is actually a rest period to allow the mechanical printing mechanism to synchronize {{in the event that}} a garbled signal is received. This is true especially on High frequency radio circuits where <b>selective</b> <b>fading</b> is present. <b>Selective</b> <b>fading</b> causes the mark signal amplitude to be randomly different from the space signal amplitude. <b>Selective</b> <b>fading,</b> or Rayleigh fading can cause two carriers to randomly and independently fade to different depths. [...] Since modern computer equipment cannot easily generate 1.42 bits for the stop period, common practice is to either approximate this with 1.5 bits, or to send 2.0 bits while accepting 1.0 bits receiving.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{interleaved}} spread spectrum orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ISS-OFDM) system and investigate its performance over frequency <b>selective</b> multipath <b>fading</b> channels. The purpose is to exploit frequency diversity capabil-ity, develop an efficient spectrum spreading algorithm and improve the system performance over frequency <b>selective</b> multipath <b>fading</b> channels. At transmitter, a spectrum spread ISS-OFDM signal is generated by employing OFDM modulation and interleaving tech-niques. At the receiver, two solutions including serial demodulation and parallel demodulation for diver-sity combing are proposed, in which the received sig-nals are combined by using a maximum ratio combin-ing (MRC) technique. The simulation indicates that higher frequency diversity is achieved, and the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAR) performances of the proposed ISS-OFDM sys-tem over frequency <b>selective</b> multipath <b>fading</b> chan-nels are improved significantly {{as compared with the}} conventional OFDM systems.

50|$|Since {{different}} frequency {{components of}} the signal are affected independently, {{it is highly unlikely}} that all parts of the signal will be simultaneously affected by a deep fade. Certain modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) are well-suited to employing frequency diversity to provide robustness to fading. OFDM divides the wideband signal into many slowly modulated narrowband subcarriers, each exposed to flat fading rather than frequency <b>selective</b> <b>fading.</b> This can be combated by means of error coding, simple equalization or adaptive bit loading. Inter-symbol interference is avoided by introducing a guard interval between the symbols. CDMA uses the rake receiver to deal with each echo separately.|$|E
5000|$|C-QUAM is not perfect, however, {{in large}} part because pre-AMAX it {{exhibited}} platform motion, with the audio [...] "center" [...] rocking back and forth as if changing the balance knob. This effect is potentially bothersome, especially in a moving vehicle where the received signal changes rapidly, and occupants (particularly the driver) would be more prone to its effects (this was an effect that happened primarily with skywave signals. Groundwave or local coverage usually did not suffer from this issue). This has been alleviated in subsequent revisions. Also, since some stereo information is contained in the sidebands, adjacent channel interference can cause problems. Finally, when only part of a sideband is attenuated (as often happens to skywave signals reflecting off the ionosphere), an effect known as <b>selective</b> <b>fading,</b> very unpleasant effects result; hence, the C-QUAM system is not often if ever used for shortwave broadcasting, nor by stations which receive a great deal of skywave interference.|$|E

The frequency <b>selective</b> <b>fading</b> model used in this paper assumes that two paths with different delays exist between the transmitter and receiver (multipath). The two-path model was simulated in the laboratory and the effects of frequency <b>selective</b> <b>fading</b> on the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and on the waveforms at the output of the FM demodulator were measured.

A simple demodulator which alleviates the effects of frequency <b>selective</b> <b>fading</b> on PCM/FM at moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will be described.
