40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} {{some aspects of}} stress research, including, also, the effects of chemical anaesthesia, in two important species for diversification in aquaculture, blackspot seabream, Pagellus bogaraveo and greater amberjack, Seriola dumerilii. The {{first part of the}} research (trial 1 and 2) was designed to determine the efficacy of clove oil as an anaesthetic alternative to MS- 222. In trial 1, the minimum concentration of anaesthetic producing the total loss of muscular tone within 3 min, and recovery within 10 min, was determined. The obtained results showed that MS- 222 and clove oil were effective as anaesthetics for juveniles of blackspot <b>sea-bream</b> and greater amberjack at concentrations of 40 and 100 mg L- 1, respectively. The aim of trial 2 was to assess the side-effects of both anaesthetics on greater amberjack juveniles by monitoring serum cortisol and glucose levels, and haematocrit values. No significant differences between anaesthetics were found for most of the measured physiological variables. The second part of research (trial 3) was designed to establish the ability of anaesthesia to mitigate stress responses blocking activation of the HPI axis associated to handling stress. In this trial, the stress responses to handling of adult blackspot <b>sea-bream</b> anaesthetised with either anaesthetics were compared to those of unanaesthetised fish used as controls. Serum cortisol and glucose concentrations were used as stress indicators. Both anaesthetics were unable to block activation of the HPI axis that occurs as a consequence of handling stress in blackspot <b>sea-bream,</b> although anaesthesia with both anaesthetics proved to be effective in reducing the duration of stress response...|$|E
40|$|The Madras State has a {{coastline}} of 620 miles with an inshore belt of 9, 000 sq. {{miles and}} a continental shelf of 30, 000 sq. miles. The Bay of Bengal, Palk Strait, Gulf of Mannar and the Arabian Sea with their varied hydrobiological conditions contribute to varied fisheries resources.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{mechanism}} of estradiol- 17 b production in the ovarian follicle of red seabream, in vitro effects of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) on aromatase activity (conversion of testosterone to estradiol- 17 b) and cytochrome P 450 aromatase (P 450 arom) mRNA expression in ovarian fragments of red <b>sea-bream</b> were investigated. Of the growth factors used in the pre-sent study, only IGF-I stimulated both aromatase activity and P 450 arom gene expression in the ovarian fragments of red <b>sea-bream.</b> LH from red seabream pituitary, but not FSH, stimulated both aromatase activity and P 450 arom gene expression. IGF-I slightly enhanced the LH-induced aromatase activity and P 450 arom gene expression. These data and our previous results indicate that LH, but not FSH, stimulates estradiol- 17 b produc-tion in the ovarian follicle of red seabream through stimulation of aromatase activity and P 450 arom gene expression and IGF-I enhances the LH-stimulated P 450 arom gene expression. estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, growth factors, luteinizing hormone, oocyte developmen...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{analysing}} the similar trends and different constraints which influence marine fish farming of new species such as sea-bass, <b>sea-bream</b> and turbot in Europe {{in comparison with the}} Norwegian salmon farming success. In a general context of low progression, European aquaculture has been characterised by the development of intensive fish farming. The most notable fact is the recent increase in intensive salmonid farming, with a turnover of almost 2 millions Ecu. More recently, the intensive farming of sea bass and sea bream has increased very rapidly in the Mediterranean Basin, although on a more reduced extent. Turbot farming is developing slowly too on the French and Spanish Atlantic coast, taking benefit of the temperate climate in that area. Although research has started as soon as the seventies with a strong public incentive both for salmon, sea-bass, <b>sea-bream,</b> the development of these different types of aquaculture has not been done at the same pace. Some elements of sectorial dynamics are analysed like research planning and financing, organisation of the production and public policy. For salmon and sea-bass, aquacultural production now greatly exceeds the fishermen's catch. This rapid development has led t...|$|E

The results of the experiments showed that in all these young and larvae the toxic effect of heavy oil A was {{higher than that of}} heavy oil B, {{and in the case of}} the solvent emulsifier mixed with each of the heavy oils the effect was greater than in the case of oils A and B alone.

40|$|Dietary {{fatty acid}} supply can affect stress {{response}} in fish during early development. Although knowledge on the mechanisms involved in fatty acid regulation of stress tolerance is scarce, {{it has often}} been hypothesised that eicosanoid profiles can influence cortisol production. Genomic cortisol actions are mediated by cytosolic receptors which may respond to cellular fatty acid signalling. An experiment was designed to test the effects of feeding gilthead <b>sea-bream</b> larvae with four microdiets, containing graded arachidonic acid (ARA) levels (0 · 4, 0 · 8, 1 · 5 and 3 · 0 %), on the expression of genes involved in stress response (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, glucocorticoid receptor and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), lipid and, particularly, eicosanoid metabolism (hormone-sensitive lipase, PPARα, phospholipase A 2, cyclo-oxygenase- 2 and 5 -lipoxygenase), as determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Fish fatty acid phenotypes reflected dietary fatty acid profiles. Growth performance, survival after acute stress and similar whole-body basal cortisol levels suggested that <b>sea-bream</b> larvae could tolerate a wide range of dietary ARA levels. Transcription of all genes analysed was significantly reduced at dietary ARA levels above 0 · 4 %. Nonetheless, despite practical suppression of phospholipase A 2 transcription, higher leukotriene B 4 levels were detected in larvae fed 3 · 0 % ARA, whereas a similar trend was observed regarding PGE 2 production. The present study demonstrates that adaptation {{to a wide range of}} dietary ARA levels in gilthead <b>sea-bream</b> larvae involves the modulation of the expression of genes related to eicosanoid synthesis, lipid metabolism and stress response. The roles of ARA, other polyunsaturates and eicosanoids as signals in this process are discussed.

Specifically, we evaluated the variability in the abundances and biomasses of four commercially-targeted fish species: the parrotfish (Sparisoma cretense), the island grouper (Mycteroperca fusca), the white <b>sea-bream</b> (Diplodus sargus cadenati) and the zebra <b>sea-bream</b> Diplodus cervinus cervinus) Four fishing managemente categories were established within and around each MR: (1) a no-take or integral area (collection of all animals is nor permitted), (2) a buffer area (fishing is permitted with traditional fishing gears, (3) a neighbouring fishing area (3 ̆c 20 3 ̆ekm), and (4) a fishing area off a neighbouring island. Two randomly selected sites were sampled within each management category and MR in October and March 2004. Univariate tests provided evidence of a moderate 2 ̆ 2 reserve effect 2 ̆ 2 for both MRs consistent through time. Differences in abundances and biomasses of each species among management categories were clearly species-specific and inconsistent between both MRs. Species of the genus Diplodus showed greater abundances and biomasses within protected locations compared to unprotected locations at El Hierro Island. Moreover, the four selected species showed greater abundances and biomasses in the locations surveyed at El Hierro Island compared to unprotected locations at the neighbouring island. In contrast, S. cretense {{appeared to be the}} only species that benefited from protection in the Chinijo MR. Differences in the sizes of the MRs, the fishing effort around the MRs and the effectiveness of the enforcement withing each MR, appeared to be possible explanations for the patterns observed...|$|E
40|$|The chronological {{appearance}} of endocrine {{cells in the}} pituitary of <b>sea-bream</b> (Sparus auratus) larvae was studied using antisera against salmon prolactin, trout growth hormone, salmon gonadotropin and Nterminal human adrenocorticotropin. The larval pituitary (1 - 12 days after hatching) was oval in shape and was composed of a dense mass of cells with few neurohypophysial fibres. By 60 days after hatching it began to resemble the adult and was divisible into a distinct rostral pars distalis containing prolactin and adrenocorticotropin cells; a proximal pars distalis containing somatotrophs and gonadotrophs and a pars intermedia. Cells immunoreactive with antisera against growth hormone were observed immediately after hatching (2 days postfertilization). Weakly staining prolactin cells were observed 2 days later in the region corresponding to the rostral pars distalis. Cells immunoreactive with antigonadotropin and anti-adrenocorticotropin sera were observed in the pituitary 6 and 8 days after hatching, respectively.

From a couple of visits to the fish culture industries in Japan and Korea, the following conclusions are drawn. First, Korean fish culture industry has a comparative disadvantage over the Japanese one due to its cold temperature along her coastline. Secondly, Korean prefer to the yellowtail less than Japanese. Thus, it caused that Korean yellowtail industry heavily depend upon Japanese market condition. Thirdly, the fish culture in Korea is owned by a number of small scale individuals who are in charge of production, marketing, and purchasing of materials for fish culture. However, it is found that a well organized fisheries cooperative takes part in marketing and purchasing activety on behalf of the fish culturerists in Japan, which reduces the cost and risk involved in fish production and aquaculture business, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show the history of the {{management}} technology of marine aquaculture and the present problems of management technology. We have dealt with the Yellow‐Tail aquaculture, the <b>Sea‐Bream</b> aquaculture, the Kuruma‐Prawn aquaculture and Oyster aquaculture. The following results were obtained: (1) There were no new fishing grounds; (2) the fishing production exceeds the market demand; (3) senescence of fishiig grounds are going on; (4) Total production of the marine aquaculture in Japan has become stable over the last 5 years; (5) Now, only such phenomenon as the red tide and low oxygen mass is not the cause of a large depletion in the marine aquaculture. The environmental problems of the fishing grounds were simple in 1960 ‐ 1970 's. The main existing management technology were to change fishing grounds and feed. However, now the environmental problems of the fishing grounds has become complicated. Also, the existing management technology can not solve the problem of suivival rate, etc. After this, fishery associations need a framework for environmental risk management to reduce environmental impact from aquaculture systems. 本論文の目的は，海面養殖業における管理技術の歴史的過程を把握し，現段階での問題点を明らかにすること である。 本論文では主要海面養殖業であるプリ養殖業，マダイ養殖業，クルマエビ養殖業，カキ養殖業を取り上げた。 分析の結果，次のような結論が得られた。 1 ）新規漁場がない， 2 ）過剰生産となっている， 3 ）漁場老朽化が 進んでいる， 4 ）全国の養殖総生産量はここ 5 年間停滞している， 5 ）現在では，赤潮や低酸素水塊が直接の原 因である大量へい死は少ない。 1960 ～ 1970 年代の漁場環境問題は単純なものであり，これまでの主要な管理技術は新規漁場への転換や餌料転 換であった。しかし，現在の漁場環境問題は，複雑であり，歩留まりの低下等の問題は既存の管理技術では解決 が困難な状況にある。今後は，養殖業からの漁場環境へのインパクトを減らすために環境リスク管理が必要とな る...|$|E

Fish are rich in protein content but the protein content is reduced with processing gave a better result when long-time preservation was carried out. Aim {{of this study was}} comparison of proximate analysis of some fresh and processed seafoods. Raw materials and processed seafoods (canned mackerel tuna, frozen <b>Sea-Bream</b> and Pressed caviar) were obtained from different firms and analyzed. Analysis carried out according AOAC methods. Moisture, protein and fat values of tuna fish were estimated to be 51, 23. 9 and 21. 4 %, respectively. In this study, moisture content of pressed caviar was 36 %, protein content was 34. 4 % and fat content was 16. 7 %, carbohydrate and energy values were 4. 9 % and 316 kcal/ 100 g, respectively. Pressed and smoked seafoods contained lower amount of moisture but higher amounts of the other components than raw materials (p< 0. 05). Canned mackerel tuna, frozen sea bream and pressed caviar also contained higher amounts of fat, carbohydrate and energy, respectively (p< 0. 05) than raw material. Except canning with water, all processing technologies decreased the moisture content but increased energy values (p< 0. 05) of the fish. It is concluded that processed seafoods are rich in chemical components and very nutritive. Canned tuna with salted water may be advised for low-calorie diets. Caviar pressed was one the best sea foods that was produced in Iran.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess whether}} the consumption of fish and shellfish containing a high concentration (> 1500 micrograms/kg) of organoarsenical compounds {{was associated with the}} release of a significant amount of inorganic arsenic (Asi) in vivo. Volunteers were given a known quantity of seafood (ray, cod, plaice, mussel) whose content in total arsenic (As), Asi, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was determined. In addition to the total amount of As excreted within 48 hours, that of Asi and its methylated metabolites (MMA, DMA) was also monitored and compared with that expected {{on the basis of the}} results of our previous studies on the toxicokinetics of Asi, MMA, and DMA in humans. Ingestion of ray, cod, or plaice does not seem to be associated with a significant release of Asi in vivo. Following consumption of mussels, however, the amount of DMA excreted in urine is significantly higher than that expected on the basis of the amount of Asi and its methylated derivatives already present in the shellfish. It was also noted that among the different marine organisms analyzed (ray, cod, plaice, sole, <b>sea-bream,</b> mussel), the highest proportion of Asi (on the average 3 % of the total) was found in mussels. Further metabolic studies are justified to assess the risk of exposure to Asi associated with the consumption of shellfish. In view of the possible release of dimethylarsenic acid from some organoarsenicals, biological monitoring of occupational exposure to Asi by the measurement of its methylated metabolites can provide misleading results if the workers have consumed some marine organisms within 48 hr before urine collection...|$|E
40|$|Glaucoma is {{a chronic}} {{neurodegenerative}} disease mainly characterized by higher intraocular pressure, {{which can lead}} to apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the progres-sive loss of optic nerve axons resulting in structural and func-tional deficits in patients with glaucoma, and is a leading cause of blindness all over the world [1]. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) can occur in the optic nerve head and has been associated with multiple pathogenic mechanisms following lamina cribrosa deformation by elevated intraoc-ular pressure [2]. For example, blood flow disturbances at the optic nerve head may be involved in the pathogenesis of axon loss and RGC apoptosis by hypoxia and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [3]. Additionally, reactive glial cells in the optic nerve head may release excitatory amino acids such as glutamate [4] or nitric oxide [5]. Astaxanthin (AST), a type of carotenoid found in many marine organisms such as salmon, trout, red <b>sea-bream,</b> shrimp, lobster, and fish eggs, can decrease the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by biologic mole-cules [6]. AST can induce various pharmacological effects, including antioxidative activity [7 - 11], antitumor effects [12, 13], anti-inflammatory actions [14], antidiabetic [15] and hepatoprotective effects [16], and immunomodulatory activity [17, 18], suggesting that AST may have considerable potential for beneficial applications in human health and nutrition. In a previous study, AST displayed a neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress in an in vivo experiment using mice [19]. However, no data have yet been reported in RGC primary cultures using other stressors related to GON, such as glutamate toxicity or hypoxia. In this study, we investigate the influence of AST against glutamate- and hypoxia-induced apoptosis, as well as oxidative stress-induced necrosis, in primary rat RGC cultures...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that ghrelin stimulates growth hormone release from the pituitary via the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). We have previously isolated two GHSR subtypes from the pituitary of the black seabream Acanthopagrus schlegeli. In the present study, we have cloned and characterized ghrelin from the same fish species at both the cDNA and gene levels. The full-length seabream ghrelin cDNA, isolated from <b>sea-bream</b> stomach using a novel approach by exploiting a single conserved region in the coding region, was found to encode a prepropeptide of 107 amino acids, with the predicted mature ghrelin peptide consisting of 20 amino acids (GSSFLSPSQKPQNRGKSSRV). Embedded in this full-length cDNA is a putative fish orthologue of the recently reported mammalian obestatin peptide. The ghrelin gene in black seabream, obtained by genomic PCR, was found to encompass four exons and three introns, possessing the same structural organization as in tilapia and goldfish, but different from that in rainbow trout. In addition, a 2230 -bp 5 '-flanking region of the seabream ghrelin gene was obtained by genome walking. Sequence analysis revealed that, {{as in the case of}} the human ghrelin gene, there is neither a GC box nor a CAAT box present in the isolated 5 '-flanking region. However, a number of putative transcription factor-binding sites different from the human counterpart were found in the 5 '-flanking region of the seabream ghrelin gene, suggesting that different cis- and trans-acting elements are involved in controlling their gene expression. Functional activity of this 5 '-flanking region was examined by cloning it into the pGL 3 -Basic vector upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into various cell lines. Positive promoter activity could only be recorded in the colon-derived Caco- 2 cells, suggesting that the cloned 5 '-flanking region represents the functional promoter of the seabream ghrelin gene, which exhibits tissue-specific promoter activity. Using reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, expression of ghrelin was detected only in the seabream stomach, but not in the other tissues examined, including the brain, gill, intestine, kidney, liver and spleen. This stomach-specific expression of ghrelin in seabream is subject to regulation, as administration of growth hormone or ipamorelin to the fish in vivo was demonstrated to enhance its expression. Reminiscent of the homologous upregulation found in the transcriptional control of the seabream GHSR gene, a similar homologous regulatory mechanism might also exist in controlling the expression of seabream ghrelin. The identification of both GHSR and ghrelin from a single fish species would facilitate our subsequent studies on the elucidation of the physiological functions of the ghrelin/GHSR system in teleost. The possible existence of obestatin in teleost opens up new research avenues on the somatotropic axis in fish.
