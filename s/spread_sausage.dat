Also provided are a recombinant vector and a transformed lactic acid bacterium comprising such promoter, {{and the production of}} a desired protein by such transformed bacterium, whereby the gene encoding said desired protein or a precursor thereof is expressed under control of such promoter. The desired protein can be secreted by the bacterium due to the presence of a signal sequence.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the dietary impact of 18 : 3 n- 3 vs. 18 : 2 n- 6 on fatty acid- and micronutrient concentration of beef muscle {{and the extent of}} diet- and processing-induced changes of lipid- and micronutrient concentrations of beef products made thereof (German Corned beef (GCB), tea <b>sausage</b> <b>spread</b> (TSS), scalded <b>sausage</b> (SS)). Beef and beef products were obtained from German Holstein bulls which either received a control diet consisting of maize silage and concentrate with soybean meal (41 %), or an experimental diet of grass silage and concentrate plus rapeseed cake (12 %) and linseed oil (3 %). The study revealed that upon an 18 : 3 n- 3 vs. 18 : 2 n- 6 intervention the amounts of 18 : 3 n- 3, EPA and Σn- 3 LC-PUFA were significantly increased by 2. 6, 2. 3 and 1. 7 fold, respectively. Experimental diet significantly increased β-carotene contents, and the γ-tocopherol contents were decreased. During beef processing, n- 3 PUFA from beef were found to be product-specifically transferred into the corresponding beef products. 18 : 3 n- 3 and Σn- 3 LC-PUFA contents were found to be 1. 4 and 1. 5 times higher in GCB from grass silage- than maize silage-fed bulls. The trace element contents in GCB (iron, copper, zinc, selenium) were not affected by the diet; however γ-tocopherol contents were decreased by experimental diet. In conclusion, dietary n- 3 PUFA were completely transferred into beef products unaffected by beef processing conditions...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} Polish {{breakfast is}} a large spread {{with a variety of}} sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat <b>spreads,</b> the Polish <b>sausage</b> kielbasa, tomatoes, Swiss cheese, and sliced pickles. Twaróg, a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. Twaróg can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with chives into a cream cheese-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red currant spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast. For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} effects of {{providing}} {{a wide range of}} foodstuffs containing n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), occurring naturally or from fortification, on intake and blood and tissue proportions of n- 3 PUFA. DESIGN: Before/after dietary intervention study. SETTING: Adelaide, Australia. SUBJECTS: 16 healthy males recruited from the community. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were provided with a range of foodstuffs naturally containing n- 3 PUFA (fresh fish, canned fish, flaxseed meal, canola oil) and items fortified with fish oil (margarine <b>spread,</b> milk, <b>sausages,</b> luncheon meat, french onion dip). Food choices were left to the discretion of each subject. Intake was estimated by diet diary. Blood was collected at- 2, 0, 2, and 4 weeks for fatty acid analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intakes; plasma, platelet, and mononuclear cell phospholipid fatty acids. RESULTS: Consumption of n- 3 PUFA increased significantly: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) from 1. 4 to 4. 1 g/day (P< 0. 001), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from 0. 03 to 0. 51 g/day (P< 0. 001), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from 0. 09 to 1. 01 g/day (P< 0. 001). Linoleic acid (LA) intake decreased from 13. 1 to 9. 2 g/day (P< 0. 001). The proportions of EPA and DHA increased significantly in all phospholipid pools examined; plasma EPA from 1. 13 % of total fatty acids to 3. 38 % (P< 0. 001) and DHA from 3. 76 to 7. 23 % (P< 0. 001); mononuclear cell EPA from 0. 40 to 1. 25 % (P< 0. 001) and DHA from 2. 33 to 4. 08 % (P< 0. 001); platelet EPA from 0. 41 to 1. 2 % (P< 0. 001) and DHA from 1. 64 to 3. 07 % (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Incorporating fish oil into a range of novel commercial foods provides the opportunity for wider public consumption of n- 3 PUFA with their associated health benefits.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the exogenous effects of alpha-linolenic (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) on the fatty acid distribution and the regulation of lipid metabolism in ruminant tissues. Two animal experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of diets enriched in ALA or LA in German Simmental and Holstein bulls. The influence of LA and ALA enriched diets on the protein expression of lipogenic enzymes in cattle, the tissue specific differences and the relationship between protein expression of lipogenic enzymes, enzyme activities and the products of these enzymes as well as the absorption and deposition of n- 3 and n- 6 fatty acids in ruminants and beef products was analyzed. Feeding a diet enriched in LA or ALA results in an increased deposition of these fatty acids, induced chain elongation, desaturation and deposition of the long-chain products in tissues of ruminants. Essential fatty acids are preferentially deposited in longissimus muscle (MLD) compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and also preferred in erythrocytes; conclusively they are good long-time marker for the fatty acid intake. Despite the low proportion of de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver of ruminants the concentration of n- 3 fatty acids and de novo synthesised n- 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is much higher compared to MLD. Summarizing, there is a tissue specific incorporation and deposition of n- 6 and n- 3 fatty acids depending on the function of the respective tissue. The production conditions of German Corned beef and tea <b>sausage</b> <b>spread</b> made from the meat of the German Holstein bulls did not lead to a loss of beneficial n- 3 fatty acids. The SCD protein expression and the enzyme activity are more inhibited by n- 3 fatty acids than by n- 6 fatty acids in different tissues of bulls. It is of interest to figure out the mechanisms how the tissue-specific effect of Δ 6 D works on protein expression level and on the level of activity...|$|R
