In July 1997, the Government of Kenya refused to meet commitments made earlier to the IMF on governance reforms. As a result, the IMF suspended lending for three years, and the World Bank also put a $90 million <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>credit</b> on hold.

50|$|In 1998, the Tajik {{government}} {{accepted a}} three-year financial {{agreement with the}} IMF’s Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the WB’s <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Credit</b> (SAC). This involved adopting a government restructuring program to respond to increased economic liberalisation and improve public services. By 2004, Tajikistan was developing market infrastructure, appropriate legal institutions and economic management.Because of common Soviet history, Central Asian states shared most of their education policies at independence. Consequently, the post-socialist education reform packages employed by the WB, ADB and other UN organisations in these countries was very similar. The features most directly affected by the new liberal economic strategy were the “decentralization of educational finance and governance”, the “privatization of higher education”, the “reorganization (or “rationalization”) of schools” and the “liberalization of textbook publishing”, although many other facets of education were also indirectly affected. In 2013, a joint statement was released by the Tajik representative office of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), claiming that the World Bank would support Tajikistan’s second-generation reforms in education and emphasising {{the importance of the}} private sector in driving development, and the need to further improve the investment climate.|$|E

40|$|In {{a memorable}} {{speech to the}} United Nations General Assembly, Nikita Krushehev {{predicted}} that communism would bury capitalism. In less emotive and more economistic terms, he was saying in effect that centrally planned economies would outperform market economies {{in terms of both}} output growth and social justice. History has not been kind to Krushehev. Not only central planning but even milder forms of state interventionism now stand discredited, and developing countries round the world are desperately trying to install functioning market economics. This sea-change in development philosophy generally owes something to donor conditionalities associated with <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>credits,</b> to the extent that “reforms” and “structural adjustment” have become virtually synonymous. Shortterm internal or external balance crises, and longer-term stagnation, also signalled to policy-makers the bankruptcy of over-interventionist policies—a lesson driven home by the phenomenal growth performance of the NIC’s, apparently the fruit of marketfriendly policies. In general, reform measures can be classified into three types: expenditurereducing, i. e., monetary, fiscal and wage restraints, expenditure—switching or supply-side measures intended to shift resources from non-tradable to tradables, e. g. real devaluation, tariff and subsidy reduction (aimed at bringing domestic prices in line with world prices for tradables), and institutional and policy reforms primarily armed at providing the private sector with a congenial environment. The policy package appropriate for a century will depend on initial conditions, e. g. demand-side policies will be most effective in a country where desired absorption exceeds full employment output capacity. And a country whose social and cultural backgrounds are conducive to rapid response to expenditure switching will have less need for expenditure reduction with its inevitable contractionary consequences. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to provide {{empirical}} evidence on the growth rates of maize production in three sub - periods in Nigeria namely pre - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period, <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Program period and post - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period. Secondary data on maize production in Nigeria during the Pre - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period (1970 to 1985), <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> period (1986 to 1994) and post - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period (1995 to 2007) were employed in this study. A growth rate model was used to estimate the growth rates of maize in the three sub - periods. The results of the analysis showed that the instantaneous growth rates of maize production are - 0. 1 %, 5. 7 % and 2. 4 % and the compound rates of growth of maize production are - 0. 001 %, 0. 059 % and 0. 024 % for the pre - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme, <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme and post - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme periods respectively.

40|$|The Government of Zimbabwe {{has neither}} fully {{implemented}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> nor has it clearly stated its position {{regarding the use}} of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in its management of the economy. However, Government has, while strongly criticizing the IMF/World Bank approach to <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> sought to effect <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the economy and to apply its own brand as well as conventional IMF instruments of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The Government's brand of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> seeks to satisfy the stated objective of strengthening the productive sectors of the economy. This is done in the contradictory context of a programme for transition to socialism and standing recognition of the need for meaningful social spending. In applying <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> Government does not appear to consider in "package form" the impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> on women nor does it consider any immediate compensatory cushioning. The removal of consumer, however, has been tied to minimum wage enactments. The activities of Government in general do seek to guarantee the security of women under a national macro-economic programme which seeks to generally elevate women into a position of equality and self-reliance in the economy. This programme, if successful, would make it unnecessary to treat women as a special and disadvantaged group needing cushioning from the impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The programme has, so far, only made notable progress in expanding social, public, health and educational facilities for women. These facilities have a direct bearing on the economic advancement of women. The one area where Government's approach has failed is in effecting a transition by women to meaningful management or ownership positions in the productive sectors. Generally, the impact of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> on women is hard to determine. Only a few of the instruments analysed in this paper had a direct determinable bearing on women. These are, the removal of consumer subsidies, credit facilitation for agricultural production, tax adjustment and producer subsidies.,Canadian Agency for International Development...|$|R
40|$|Does the {{implementation}} of a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> agreement increase or decrease government respect for democratic rights?
