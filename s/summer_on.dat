5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{originally}} was {{collected during the}} 1990–91 austral <b>summer</b> <b>on</b> Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains.

The fossils {{were found in the}} siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier.|$|E

The first production included Scooby-Doo and outfits like s'mores, while Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus appeared in sequences of the latter. The show appeared at various other former Paramount Parks, and in each situation, the sequenced did vary between the Scooby-anchored and Peanuts-anchored productions.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Bute {{asked his}} chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, to {{excavate}} and clear the castle ruins. The {{report on the}} investigations was produced by William Burges, an architect {{with an interest in}} medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865. The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop Cardiff Castle in the late 1860s, and the two men became close collaborators. Burges's lavishly illustrated report, which drew extensively on Clark's earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the <b>summer.</b> <b>On</b> receipt of the report, Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Wolf {{founded the}} airline company Cape Air, {{which at the}} time flew solely between Boston and Provincetown, Massachusetts.

In 1994, Nantucket Airlines was purchased by and became a subsidiary of Cape Air. Cape Air is an employee-owned company, and the only airline in the United States with a female President.

5|$|In early 1066, Harold's exiled brother, Tostig Godwinson, raided southeastern England with a fleet he had {{recruited}} in Flanders, later {{joined by}} other ships from Orkney. Threatened by Harold's fleet, Tostig moved north and raided in East Anglia and Lincolnshire, {{but he was}} driven back to his ships by the brothers Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria. Deserted by most of his followers, Tostig withdrew to Scotland, where he spent the summer recruiting fresh forces. King Harold spent the <b>summer</b> <b>on</b> the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade, {{but the bulk of}} his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold dismissed them.|$|E

5|$|Unlike ski jumping, {{which can}} be contested in the <b>summer</b> <b>on</b> {{specially}} equipped hills, ski flying is strictly a winter sport and {{not part of the}} Winter Olympics; no world records have therefore been set at the games. Also in contrast to ski jumping, athletes are not able to practice on ski flying hills out-of-season, as they are used only for competition events. Among the Alpine countries there is an unwritten gentlemen's agreement forbidding athletes under the age of 18 to participate in ski flying events, although an exception was made for 17-year-old Domen Prevc in 2017.|$|E

In October, she was placed back in full commission and, until the summer of 1922, operated with Destroyer Division 8, Flotilla 8, Squadron 3. On 21 June 1922, the ship was placed out of commission at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|At Governor William Dennison's request, Garfield {{deferred}} {{his military}} ambitions {{to remain in}} the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring and early <b>summer</b> <b>on</b> a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment. The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of his neighbors and former students. The regiment traveled to Camp Chase, outside Columbus, Ohio, to complete training. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell.|$|E

5|$|During the club's victory parade, {{with only}} one year left on his {{contract}} Chamakh declared {{that he would be}} staying at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season, despite strong interest from Premier League club Arsenal. Despite the statement, rumors of a move to Arsenal continued to surface with negotiations reportedly having been ongoing throughout the <b>summer.</b> <b>On</b> 3 August 2009, president Jean-Louis Triaud declared that Arsenal had sent a bid of €7million for Chamakh and that he had rejected it, demanding that Arsenal improve its offer. The following day, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger announced {{that he would not be}} offering a better deal and declared the possible transfer dead. The announcement subsequently led Chamakh to confirm his intent to remain at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season. On 29 August, Chamakh reportedly snubbed a move to West Ham United. The club offered Bordeaux £18million for the player and offered Chamakh a four-year contract worth £3million a year. However, Chamakh remained firm on his stance, reiterating his commitment to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|His goals helped Symes land December's League Two Player of the Month and {{an offer}} of a {{contract}} extension by Accrington to fend off reported interest from other clubs during the January 2010 transfer window. However, Symes announced he would not sign a new contract during the transfer window increasing the chance he could leave on a free transfer during the <b>summer</b> <b>on</b> a Bosman ruling transfer. Two weeks later, Accrington announced they had rejected two bids from fellow League Two side Grimsby Town for their striker. One bid included striker Barry Conlon moving in the opposite direction. The second bid {{was reported to be}} a six-figure sum. Symes continued his rich vein of form as his 14thgoal of the season—making it his most productive season to date—levelled the scoring against Premier League Fulham in the FA Cup fourth round. A victory would have given Stanley a fifth round place {{for the first time in}} their history, but they eventually lost 3–1. In the crowd at the club's following game was Preston North End's new manager Darren Ferguson to become Symes' latest suitor. Despite the interest in Symes, no further bids were reported by Accrington for him or for midfielder Bobby Grant as the January transfer window closed. Symes finished the season with 19goals—his best return of his career to that point—with 13 of those coming in the league.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, {{chairman}} Doug Ellis {{once again}} appointed Graham Taylor as manager. Villa finished the 200102 season in eighth place, which {{was similar to}} most of their other Premiership finishes. Taylor quit as manager {{for the second time}} {{after the end of the}} 200203 season. Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership, losing twice to arch rivals Birmingham City. David O'Leary, who had taken Leeds United to the semi-finals of the 200001 Champions League, was brought in as Taylor's replacement. O'Leary took the team to sixth in the table, with a 20 home defeat against Manchester United on the final day meaning that they narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. In 200506, Villa slowly fell down the table and finished in 16th place. The poor placing came despite O'Leary having spent more than £13million the previous <b>summer</b> <b>on</b> players such as Milan Baroš, Kevin Phillips and Wilfred Bouma.|$|E
