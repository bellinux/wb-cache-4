5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{mentioned}} by either of his earliest biographers, Baldinucci or Domenico Bernini, the Elephant and Obelisk is a sculpture {{located near the}} Pantheon, in the Piazza della Minerva, {{in front of the}} Dominican church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Pope Alexander VII decided that he wanted a small ancient Egyptian obelisk (that was discovered beneath the piazza) to be erected on the same site, and in 1665 he commissioned Bernini to create a sculpture to support the obelisk. The sculpture of an elephant bearing the obelisk on its back was executed by one of Bernini's students, Ercole Ferrata, upon a design by his master, and finished in 1667. An inscription on the base relates the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Roman goddess Minerva to the Virgin Mary, who supposedly supplanted those pagan goddesses and to whom the church is dedicated. A popular anecdote concerns the elephant's <b>smile.</b> <b>To</b> find out why it is smiling, legend has it, the viewer must examine the rear end of the animal and notice that its muscles are tensed and its tail is shifted to the left as if it were defecating. The animal's rear is pointed directly at one of the headquarters of the Dominican Order, housing the offices of its Inquisitors as well as the office of Father Giuseppe Paglia, a Dominican friar {{who was one of the}} main antagonists of Bernini, as a final salute and last word.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers criticised Toadstool Tours use of camera, {{especially}} when the ball's presented route would ignore obstacles. GameSpot otherwise welcomed the game's visuals, however, arguing that the recurring Mario characters [...] "never looked better". IGN also lauded the graphics [...] present in the full motion video {{and the rest of}} the game, as well as Toadstool Tours audio. Matt Casamassina acknowledged the characters' voiced taunts, saying [...] "the muttering, complaining Waluigi, never fails to bring a <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> our faces".|$|E
500|$|The film's {{original}} {{score was}} composed by James Horner. Though Horner's previous work comprised mostly high-budget studio films [...] including Titanic (1997), Braveheart (1995), The Mask of Zorro (1998), and Apollo 13 (1995) [...] producer Bonnie Curtis approached him to score The Chumscrubber because [...] "You never know until you ask." [...] Horner agreed after seeing an early {{cut of the}} film. He and Posin spent five days on a soundstage, experimenting with different musical arrangements. Posin described the final product as [...] "dramatic with a wink and a <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> it".|$|E
500|$|... "Good Vibrations" [...] {{established}} a new {{method of operation}} for Wilson. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. This was the same modular approach used during the sessions for Smile and Smiley <b>Smile.</b> <b>To</b> mask each tape edit, vast reverb decays were added at the mixing and sub-mixing stages.|$|E

The two [...] "weren't disappointed." [...] Blackhurst said [...] "The fast-paced tale of courage and dreams kept both entertained with plenty of hilarious moments {{for the children and}} a sprinkle of gags which flew over younger fans' heads but brought a wry <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> mums and dads' faces." [...] Brayford summed it up, saying [...] "It was good, but not quite as good as the TV show." ...|$|E

I do artists, philosophers and poets", he said, [...] warning that memorials are often hastily erected.

Kubizek remarks that Hitler said he had seen Stefanie at the funeral procession, which gave him some consolation. Kubizek claims that [...] "Stefanie had no idea how deeply Adolf was in love with her; she regarded him as a somewhat shy, but nevertheless remarkably tenacious and faithful, admirer. When she responded with a <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> his inquiring glance, he was happy and his mood became unlike anything I had ever observed in him. But when Stefanie, as happened just as often, coldly ignored his gaze, he was crushed and ready to destroy himself and the whole world." ...|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from her}} autobiography, Bondfield {{contributed to a}} {{collection}} of essays entitled What Life Has Taught Me, in which 25 public figures pondered on the lessons of life. Bondfield wrote that her religious convictions gave her [...] "strength to meet defeat with a <b>smile,</b> <b>to</b> face success with a sense of responsibility; to be willing to do one's best without hope of reward [...] to bear misrepresentation without giving way to futile bitterness". In March 1948 Bondfield opened the Mary Macarthur Home at Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool in Lancashire, which provided subsidised holidays for low-paid women workers. In 1949 she made a six-month speaking tour of the United States, her final visit to the country; she left convinced that America would soon adopt a national health service.|$|E
500|$|Combat in Killer7 {{occurs when}} the player {{encounters}} enemies called [...] "Heaven Smiles". Smiles announce their presence with a laughing sound effect and are initially invisible. The player must switch to a first-person viewpoint and scan the surroundings to reveal Smiles. While in first-person view, movement is disabled and the analog stick aims the character's gun. Targeting specific body parts will disable them; for example, shooting off a leg will cause a <b>Smile</b> <b>to</b> {{fall to the ground}} and crawl toward the player. The player may aim for a [...] "critical point" [...] that instantly destroys the Smile. Smiles that get too close will explode and injure the character. If a character dies, players can use Garcian Smith to retrieve the fallen character's head and bring them back to life; if Garcian dies, then the game ends.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the game's negative response, GameZone said {{that even though the}} game does not feature continuous play, [...] "the action flows well once into an event". GameZone's review praised the game's audio track, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] because the comedy is straight from the television show, and the characters will [...] "bring a <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> your face". Reiner also commented positively on the soundtrack and that the game {{may not be the best}} wrestling game available, [...] "but it delivers what the cover advertises". GameSpot's Frank Provo said that [...] "wit" [...] and [...] "charm" [...] are the two most redeeming features of The Simpsons Wrestling, and in spite of the game's weak gameplay, it has [...] "plenty of laughs in store" [...] that devoted fans of The Simpsons will enjoy. The BBC's David Gibbon wrote that the end result of the track is one that will not [...] "fail to impress fans".|$|E

500|$|Starting from Avalanche Studios' inception, the company's {{primary focus}} {{is to create}} open world sandbox games, citing Elite as their inspiration. According to Blomberg, the studio has always been {{interested}} in creating open world games, and they aimed to be [...] "the best" [...] in developing them. The company seeks to remain flexible to market changes and tries not to limit themselves to one business model. Avalanche also focuses on developing games with long gameplay length and high replay value. Sundberg considers Avalanche Studios to be an independent company, and often keeps the rights to their intellectual properties. Sundberg also stated that video game developers should not put too much weight in income; as a result, the company seldom develops [...] "forced" [...] multiplayer modes, as they believe that approach [...] "makes absolutely no sense" [...] and does not add any value to the game. When seeking future projects, the studio chooses projects that they are passionate about and allow creative freedom. They only make games that [...] " [...] love to play" [...] or games that [...] "can bring a <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> people's faces".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a formal party in which Spears {{seems to be}} looking for someone. The opening shot of her was {{inspired}} by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her. He persuades her to <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her [...] "So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies [...] "Now I'm okay." [...] She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.|$|E
500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} ‚Äî it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands ‚Äî"the forbidden sign"‚Äî and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with a <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> give her a little time.|$|E
