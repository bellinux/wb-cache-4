40|$|We review {{theoretical}} and {{experimental studies of}} the influence of modal interactions on the non-linear response of harmonically excited structural and dynamical systems. In particular, we dis-cuss the response of pendulums, <b>ships,</b> <b>rings,</b> shells, arches, beam structures, surface waves, and the similarities in the qualitative behavior of these systems. The systems are characterized by quadratic nonlinearities which may lead to two-to-one and combination autoparametric reso-nances. These resonances give rise to a coupling between the modes involved in the resonance leading to nonlinear periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic motions. 1. INTRODUCTION 1. 1 One-to-one Interna...|$|R

5000|$|A {{close look}} at the fixed duct support photo shows several {{properties}} or round ring supports. 1) there are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from 2 rolled WT's, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a fixed support could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a duct flange. The duct flange normally has 3/4" [...] bolts at 6" [...] nominal; spacing. Duct flange angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16" [...] or 3/8" [...] angle thicknesses are common. [...] See above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius, are from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and <b>shipping</b> <b>rings</b> at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection. Note the 3000 HP fan inlet transition and stack inlet transition also shown in this photo.|$|R

Caroline Bonnell, who boarded one of the first lifeboats dispatched from the ship, told reporters what happened later: [...] "There was a big wave.

60|$|The boy, who {{was getting}} alarmed, seized the tongue of the <b>ship's</b> bell, and <b>rang</b> {{with all his}} might. Whether this had the effect to which Jackman had referred, we cannot tell, but next moment what {{appeared}} to be a mountain loomed out of the mist. The steam-whistle had been silent for some time, but as soon as the bell was heard it burst forth with increased fury. From the instant her form was dimly seen the fate of the yacht was sealed. There was a wild shouting on board the steamer, but there was no time for action.|$|R
5000|$|Many composers also {{tackled the}} subject of the ship's sinking.

Other musical responses sought to evoke the disaster in musical form. Soon after the sinking a [...] "Descriptive Musical Sketch (Piano, Chorus and Reciter)" [...] was staged, and those wanting to re-enact the disaster at home could listen to the recording of The Wreck of the Titanic, a [...] "Descriptive Piano Solo, right from the scene where the <b>ship's</b> bell <b>rings</b> for departure to the pathetic 'burial at sea' ... reminiscent of the sad disaster which will live in history as long as the world rolls on." [...] There was even a Titanic Two-Step which was derived from a then-popular dance craze, though it is unclear how the dance steps were supposed to represent the sinking ship.|$|R

[...] "Or else--give way for your lives," [...] he wildly added, starting at a clattering hubbub in the <b>ship,</b> above which <b>rang</b> the tocsin of the hatchet-polishers; and seizing Don Benito by the throat he added, [...] "this plotting pirate means murder!" [...] Here, in apparent verification of the words, the servant, a dagger in his hand, was seen on the rail overhead, poised, in the act of leaping, as if with desperate fidelity to befriend his master to the last; while, seemingly to aid the black, the three white sailors were trying to clamber into the hampered bow. Meantime, the whole host of negroes, as if inflamed at the sight of their jeopardized captain, impended in one sooty avalanche over the bulwarks.|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of South Atlantic Water (SAW) into {{the northern hemisphere}} is investigated in this work. This flow represents the upper branch of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and thus has a direct influence on the global heat budget. A variety of data is used: direct hydrographic and velocity observations from ship surveys, profiles from Argo floats and data from an ocean model (FLAME). The model and the observations show high consistency in {{the strength of the}} mean total inflow into the Caribbean, its range of variability, and the distribution of water from the South Atlantic. During the <b>ship</b> cruises large <b>rings</b> were observed at 16 degrees N. The ring propagation is investigated in FLAME and the complex interaction of the rings with the Lesser Antilles discussed. The spreading of SAW into the North Atlantic is analyzed. The mean SAW transport into the Caribbean derived from observations is estimated to be 9. 3 Sv. The analysis with FLAME yields a similar transport. When the rings observed at 16 degrees N are taken into account the total SAW transport is 15. 3 Sv. Since the upper layer MOC transport is in the order of 16 - 18 Sv, the remaining SAW transport by the STCs is less than 3 Sv...|$|R

5000|$|... “The {{first case}} was the award made to the {{volunteer}} crew of life savers at Goderich Ontario who rescued six men and a woman from the stranded schooner A C Maxwell of Cleveland, Ohio, at day break on December 9, 1885. This vessel while on a voyage home from Marquette, Michigan in tow of a steamer broke adrift and was buffeted helplessly about on Lake Huron during a furious storm lasting five days. Her sails were blown to shreds, the rudder, anchors, and only boat lost, and in a sinking condition she was driven on the shoals several miles south of Goderich. Those on the ill-fated vessel were exhausted and half frozen, with apparently no prospect of ever getting {{to a place of}} safety. Fortunately, they kept the <b>ship's</b> bell <b>ringing,</b> which, at an early hour in the morning, attracted the attention of William Babb, captain of the Goderich life-boat, who hurried down to the beach, and, although not able to make out the situation in the darkness, instantly recognized the signal as one of distress The wind was still blowing a gale from the southwest with a heavy sea, thick with floating ice, running along shore. Captain Babb, notwithstanding the almost hopeless prospect of reaching the craft and the imminent danger which confronted the undertaking, quickly mustered a crew of volunteers and launched the life-boat. He had forewarned each man of the great peril he was about to face, but the sturdy group of fishermen were undaunted, and, with unflinching heroism, put forth through the angry breakers on their errand of mercy. Then followed a terrible struggle against wind, wave, and drift ice before they gained the vessel. Less determined and stout-hearted men would have given up long before the four miles of storm tossed waters had been conquered, but the lofty spirit that animated them was far greater than the thought of personal danger, and they steadfastly kept at their oars until the rescue was an accomplished fact. It was with great difficulty that the suffering crew were taken from the schooner and conveyed in safety to the shore. They were then kindly cared for, and when their condition warranted, were sent to their homes. Unquestionably every soul would have perished {{had it not been for}} the supreme and gallant efforts of the life-boat men. In recognition of their heroic action on this occasion, a gold medal was awarded to Captain Babb and silver medals to the other participants, namely: Thomas Finn, Daniel Mclver, Malcolm McDonald, Neil Mclver, John McLean and John McDonald. The presentation of these awards was subsequently made by the United States consul in the town hall of Goderich, before a large and enthusiastic gathering of citizens.” ...|$|R
