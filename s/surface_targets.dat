5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed.

5|$|The guns used three {{different}} charges, {{depending on the}} situation: a full charge, a full flashless charge, and a reduced charge. The standard full charge weighed 15.2–15.5lb (6.9–7.0kg), the flashless charge was slightly heavier at 16lb (7.3kg), and the reduced charge was significantly smaller, at 3.6lb (1.6kg). Both full charges provided a muzzle velocity of 2,600ft/s (790m/s) in new guns, but as continued fire wore down the barrels, muzzle velocity degraded slightly, to 2,500ft/s (760m/s). The reduced charge's muzzle velocity was correspondingly lower, at 1,200ft/s (370m/s). Each gun was supplied with 450 rounds, and was expected to fire 4,600 shells before it was worn enough to warrant replacement. At the maximum effective elevation to engage <b>surface</b> <b>targets,</b> 45degrees, the guns could hit targets up to 17,392yards (15,903m) away. The maximum height at which aircraft could be engaged was 37,200feet (11,900m).|$|E
5|$|Their {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{consisted of}} fourteen 10.5cm C/33 L/65 guns, sixteen 3.7cm L/83 guns, and between ten and twenty 2cm guns. The 10.5cm guns fired {{at a rate}} of 15–18 rounds per minute, and had an effective ceiling of 12,500m (41,010feet). They were mounted in six Dop. L. C/31 twin mounts amidships, which allowed depression to −8° and elevation to 80°. When used to engage <b>surface</b> <b>targets,</b> the guns had a maximum range of 17,700m (19,357yd) at an elevation of 45°. The 3.7cm guns were placed in eight manually operated Dopp LC/30 twin mounts. At 85°, they had an effective ceiling of 6,800m (22,310ft), though tracers were limited to 4,800m (15,750ft). They had a rate of fire of 30rounds per minute.|$|E

25|$|The {{two stages}} were both steered by thrust vectoring. Inertial {{navigation}} guided the missile {{to about a}} 900 m (3,000-foot) CEP, insufficient for use against hardened targets. They were mostly useful for attacking dispersed military <b>surface</b> <b>targets</b> (airfields or radar sites), clearing a pathway for heavy bombers, although in the general public perception Polaris was a strategic second-strike retaliatory weapon.|$|E
25|$|The C/30 was a single-shot {{anti-aircraft}} gun that was loaded one round {{at a time}} which dropped its effective rate of fire to a mere 30 rounds per minute, far inferior to the 80-100 rounds per minute of its contemporary, the Bofors 40 mm {{anti-aircraft gun}}. Its muzzle velocity {{was on the other}} hand far superior (about 25% higher), which greatly eased the aiming. The SK C/30U gun was modified for use by submarines. All mountings were suitable for use against both air and soft <b>surface</b> <b>targets.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main gun is a Type 210 100 mm naval gun, {{derived from}} the French Creusot-Loire T100C, in a turret with a reduced radar {{cross-section}} design.

It is possible, but unlikely, that the Chinese laser-guided projectiles are in service with the gun. Infrared-guided projectiles are another possibility, but a single-feed design would reduce the rate of fire if mixed with unguided projectiles.|$|E

Each Bofors mount was to be fitted with an integrated fire control radar. This gave a capability for up to 17 aerial targets to be engaged simultaneously (four with long-range barrage fire from the 6 inch guns, three by the 4.5 inch guns and ten at short-range by the Bofors guns).|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Nimrod fleet {{carried out}} three basic operational roles during their RAF service: Anti-Submarine Warfare duties typically involved surveillance over an allocated {{area of the}} North Atlantic to detect the presence of Soviet submarines in that area and to track their movements. In the event of war, reconnaissance information gathered during these patrols would be shared with other allied aircraft to enable coordinated strikes at both submarines and <b>surface</b> <b>targets.</b> Search and rescue (SAR) missions were another important duty of the RAF's Nimrod fleet, operating under the Air Rescue Coordination Centre at RAF Kinloss, and were a common sight in both military and civil maritime incidents. Throughout the Nimrod's operational life, a minimum of one aircraft was being held {{in a state of}} readiness to respond to SAR demands at all times.|$|E
25|$|The South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter {{aircraft}} are also equipped with PS-05/A pulse-doppler X-band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi. This all-weather radar system {{is capable of}} locating and identifying air targets 120km away and <b>surface</b> <b>targets</b> 70km away. It is also able to automatically track multiple targets in {{the upper and lower}} spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It can guide several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously (although the Air Force still lacks modern beyond visual range missile capability). When deployed operationally on combat missions and air patrols the aircraft can link their systems to the South African National Defence Force's digital network protocol, Link ZA, to share data with other radar systems to help create a wider picture as to the situation in the air and on the ground in order to rapidly adapt to a change in short term situations.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: At present, it is {{difficult}} to visualize the internalization of surface receptors induced by ubiquitination that is taken place at the plasma membrane in mammals. This problem makes it difficult to reveal molecular basis for ubiquitination-mediated internalization in mammals. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: In order to overcome it, we have generated T-REx-c-MIR, a novel mammalian Tet-on B cell line using a constitutively active E 3 ubiquitin ligase, c-MIR, and its artificial target molecule. By applying the surface biotinylation method to T-REx-c-MIR, we succeeded to monitor the fate of <b>surface</b> <b>target</b> molecules after initiation of ubiquitination process by doxycycline (Dox) -induced c-MIR expression. Target molecules that pre-existed at the plasma membrane before induction of c-MIR expression were oligo-ubiquitinated and degraded by Dox-induced c-MIR expression. Dox-induced c-MIR expression initiated rapid internalization of <b>surface</b> <b>target</b> molecules, and blockage of the internalization induced the accumulation of the <b>surface</b> <b>target</b> molecules that were newly ubiquitinated by c-MIR. Inhibition of the surface ubiquitination by down-regulating ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E 2 impaired the internalization of target molecules. Finally, a complex of c-MIR and target molecule was detected at the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCES: These results demonstrate that in T-REx-c-MIR, <b>surface</b> <b>target</b> molecule is ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane and followed by being internalized from the plasma membrane.

25|$|The USN had forward-basing {{arrangements}} for its Atlantic-based Polaris fleet {{with both the}} United Kingdom and Spain, permitting the use of bases at the Holy Loch in Scotland (established in 1961) and at Naval Station Rota (Polaris base established 1964) in the Bay of Cadiz. The forward deployment bases were much closer to patrol areas than U.S. East Coast bases, avoiding the necessity for lengthy transit times. In the Pacific, a Polaris base was also established at Guam in 1964. The Regulus missile program was deactivated {{with the advent of}} Polaris in the Pacific. The forward-basing arrangement was continued when Poseidon replaced Polaris, starting in 1972, in what by then were the 31 Atlantic Fleet SSBNs. The 10 older SSBNs that could not use Poseidon were assigned to the Pacific Fleet in the 1970s. Polaris was not accurate enough to destroy hardened targets, but would have been effective against dispersed <b>surface</b> <b>targets,</b> such as airfields, radar and SAM sites, as well as military and industrial centers of strategic importance. The military authorities, however, regarded Polaris as but one part of a nuclear triad including ICBMs and bombers, each with its own function.
