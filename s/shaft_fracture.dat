50|$|Direct blow on back {{of upper}} forearm {{would be a}} very {{uncommon}} cause. In this context, isolated ulnar shaft fractures are most commonly seen in defence against blunt trauma (e.g. nightstick injury). Such an isolated ulnar <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> is not a Monteggia fracture. It is called a 'nightstick fracture'.|$|E
50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} of humerus fractures is typically made through radiographic imaging. For proximal fractures, X-rays {{can be taken}} from a scapular anteroposterior (AP) view, which takes {{an image of the}} front of the shoulder region from an angle, a scapular Y view, which takes an image {{of the back of the}} shoulder region from an angle, and an axillar lateral view, which has the patient lie on his or her back, lift the bottom half of the arm up to the side, and have an image taken of the axilla region underneath the shoulder. Fractures of the humerus shaft are usually correctly identified with radiographic images taken from the AP and lateral viewpoints. Damage to the radial nerve from a <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> can be identified by an inability to bend the hand backwards or by decreased sensation in the back of the hand. Images of the distal region are often of poor quality due to the patient being unable to extend the elbow because of pain. If a severe distal fracture is supected, then a computed tomography (CT) scan can provide greater detail of the fracture. Nondisplaced distal fractures may not be directly visible; they may only be visible due to fat being displaced because of internal bleeding in the elbow.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{incidence}} of hospitalised humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> was 4.8 per 100, 000 person-years. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} nationwide study to assess {{the incidence of}} hospitalisation due to humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> in children and adolescents. In our study, we observed a slight increase in hospitalisation due to humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> among girls. It must be considered, however, that humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> are relatively uncommon and the observed increase may have been due to annual normal variation. The low and relatively stable incidence of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> can be accounted for by the injury mechanism. <b>Shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> require a rather uncommon trauma mechanism with twisting or transverse high-energy injury, which is often associated with multiple traumas [25, 26, 27].|$|R
30|$|There {{are very}} few {{clinical}} studies in the literature comparing locked plate and limited-contact dynamic compression plate fixation of humerus <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether a difference in plate design improves the outcome in managing a particular chosen group of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures.</b> We hereby present a retrospective study of humerus <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> treated with ORIF with LCDCP or LCP.|$|R
30|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{identified}} that humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> in children aged < 1 year are strongly suggestive of abuse, with reported rates between 36 and 100  % [2, 25, 26]. In the current study, eight of 11 (73  %) humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> in patients aged < 1 year compared {{to two of}} 16 (12  %) humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> for children aged 1 − 2 years were reported as abuse.|$|R

40|$|Worldwide, road {{injuries}} cause over 1. 3 million {{deaths and}} many more disabilities annually, disproportionately affecting {{the young and the}} poor. Approximately one in ten road injuries involves a femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> that is most effectively treated with surgery. Current femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> incidence according to country and age group is unknown and difficult to measure directly but is critical to designing and evaluating interventions...|$|E
40|$|Fracture of {{the penis}} is an {{uncommon}} injury. Physicians {{need to be}} aware of the urgency in the diagnosis and treatment of penile injury. Due to psychological embarrassment such patient will not present immediately for medical treatment. Most common cause of penile <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> is sexual intercourse and commonly involved with urethral injury. Here, we are presenting a case of penile <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> due to its atypical presentation. Case Report: A 37 year male presented with penile mid <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> while doing sexual intercourse and managed with exploration with repair of corpus cavernosum and retrieval of blood clots. Discussion: Tunica albuginea is one of the strongest fascia in the human body. One reason for the increased risk of penile fracture is that the tunica albuginea stretches and thins significantly during erection. In penile fracture, the normal external appearance is completely obliterated because of significant penile deformity, swelling and ecchymosis. Early surgical treatment has now replaced all conservative treatment with better outcome. So, best treatment for penile mid <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> is emergency surgical therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Both pelvic <b>fractures</b> and femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> {{are caused}} by high-energy injuries. When {{unstable}} pelvic <b>fractures</b> and femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> occur concomitantly, the optimal treatment method is controversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish a reasonable principle for treating such complicated injuries. Methods: Forty patients sustaining unstable pelvic fractures and concomitant femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> were treated in a 7 -year period. The initial management of the fractures was started at the emergency service according to the Advanced Trauma Life Support protocol. Unstable pelvic fractures were wrapped by cloth sheets and femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> were immobilized with a splint. Angiography was performed on patients with unstable hemodynamic status. The definitive treatment for combined fractures was performed after stabilizing the hemodynamics. Closed nailing was used for femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures,</b> and pelvic fractures were treated with various techniques. Results: The mortality rate was 12. 5...|$|R

40|$|Isolated {{posterior}} dislocation of {{the shoulder}} with ipsilateral humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> is a rare combina-tion. Three cases of such co-existence have been reported so far. We report a fourth case and review the literature. Our aim is to highlight {{the importance of this}} rare co-existence. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose posterior dislocation {{of the shoulder}} as most concentration is on the humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture.</b> Delayed diagnosis has a poorer prognosis...|$|E

The proximal decompression produced by removal of the screw led to relief of the symptoms...|$|E
30|$|The {{incidence}} of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> {{has been increasing}} over time. This represents a growing public health concern in a climate of cost containment. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze national trends in surgical management of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> and determine factors predictive of surgical intervention.|$|R
30|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of the}} present study was to describe the incidence and trends of operative treatment for humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> among children and adolescents aged 0 – 16 years in Finland between 1987 and 2010. The main finding was that, despite the overall increase in surgical treatment in children and adolescents, the incidence of surgery for humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> remained low during the 24 -year study period. Also, the incidence of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> leading to hospitalisation remained low, with no significant changes during the study period.|$|R
40|$|Background The optimal {{approach}} to operative treatment of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> remains debatable.

40|$|Dislocation of the {{shoulder}} and proximal humerus fracture with coexistent humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> is a rare injury reported in literature. There have been a total of 20 cases {{reported in the literature}} since 19401 - 13 (see Table 1). These injuries often occur as a result of high velocity trauma and most have been treated, at least partially, with invasive or operative management. We present the case of a woman with an anterior dislocation, three-part proximal humerus fracture and concomitant humerus <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> and discuss her non-invasive treatment...|$|E
30|$|Femoral shaft {{non-union}} or delayed union, in comparison, is more likely. In their {{series of}} reconstruction nailing for ipsilateral hip and femoral shaft fractures, Vidyadhara and Rao reported delayed {{union of the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> in 22 out of 43 patients. Additional surgery was performed in 6 cases [20]. Similarly, Jain et al. reported a 20 % incidence of femoral shaft non-union using reconstruction nailing [11]. In our patient group, the two implant-related complications both involved the <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> (18 %). This {{is consistent with the}} findings by Alho [1] who suggested that, whilst AVN represents the most devastating complication in this setting, it is the union of the <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> which predominantly determines the overall outcome of surgical treatment [2]. However, complications involving the femoral shaft are thought to be easier to treat compared with neck fractures [4, 21, 23]. In both our patients, a single additional operation led to satisfactory union.|$|E
40|$|Besides the conquasant {{fractures}}, open humeral shafft fractures {{belong to}} the group of the most severe fractures. They most frequently occur as a result of traffic accidents or fall from heights caused by the influence of a strong direct force. They are very frequent in polytrauma patients. The study presents the treatment of a heavily injury man (37 -year-old) with open humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> and pelvic fracture caused by fall from height, as well as the treatment results of such heavy injuries. External skeletal fixation of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> and surgical treatment of wounds are performed after short reanimation and diagnostic procedures. Control radiographies of the humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> showed satisfactory reposition. Pelvic fracture have been treated nonoperatively with bed rest and analgesic medications. Primary surgical treatment of wounds, external fixation, leaving the wounds open and performing necessary debridements and adequate drug therapy are essential in achieving good results in patients with open humeral shaft fractures...|$|E
30|$|Utilization of ORIF for humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> {{has been}} {{steadily}} increasing with time. Surgical intervention was more common with younger patients, female gender, private insurance, and larger hospital size. The increasing incidence of surgical management for humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> may represent a public health burden given the historical success of non-operative management.|$|R
30|$|Ipsilateral femoral {{neck and}} <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> {{commonly}} occur in young adults {{and are the}} result of high-energy injuries such as road traffic accidents or a fall from a height. Although relatively rare, the incidence ranges between 2.5 and 9 % of all femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> [1, 21] but seems to be rising [11].|$|R
40|$|Background: Footballers {{constitute}} a unique {{group of patients}} with tibial <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures.</b> They tend to have excellent general health and well developed musculature in the leg, and their fractures are generally closed injuries caused by low velocity trauma.

40|$|Polytrauma {{represents}} {{the most difficult}} form of trauma epidemic. Appropriate treatment of the femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> in polytrauma patients can significantly reduce mortality and morbidity. External skeletal fixation in patients with femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> presents a minor surgical trauma with minimal blood loss. In modern trauma centres, external skeletal fixation in polytrauma patients is a temporary method ({{as a part of}} „damage control“strategy) where immediate extensive internal fixation could be risky. It is usually postponed until the patient status is stable with normal vital parameters. This paper presents a polytrauma patient with dominant abdominal injury and femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture.</b> During the same operation, external skeletal fixation was applied after abdominal surgery was done. Conversion of external into internal fixation was carried out because of postoperative febrile state that lasted for 14 days. External skeletal fixation was a definitive method of treatment. Fracture of the femoral shaft healed after 7 months with good functional outcome. External skeletal fixation is a successful method of treatment for femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> in polytrauma patients. It is a temporary method as a part of „damage control“ strategy and is usually followed by internal fixation. Sometimes, it is a definitive treatment method in patients with open and comminuted fractures of the femoral shaft and in polytrauma patients when the above mentioned conversion is not safe...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{displaced}} femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> that occurred {{with no sign}} of contact-induced, stress, fatigue, or previous abnormal bone pathology in a 19 -y-old man who kicked the ground instead of the ball when playing soccer. After examination to rule out abnormal bone pathology, intramedullary nailing was performed. Bone union was achieved and he could return to recreational soccer. Among soccer injuries, the occurrence of displaced femoral shaft fractures in the absence of stress, fatigue, or pathological fracture is rare. Awareness of such a rare cause of displaced femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> would help clinicians in the field of sports and soccer medicin...|$|E
40|$|Use {{of local}} {{fasciocutaneous}} flap is gaining popularity {{as an effective}} method of treating type III B open tibial <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> in adults. We treated 16 fractures at National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation, Dhaka during the period between March 1993 and December 1994 to evaluate the result of management of type III B open tibial <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture</b> using local fasciocutaneous flaps in adults. Of the 16 tibial fractures the mean healing time was 6. 13 months (3. 5 to 11 months). The major post operative complications were deep infections (43. 75 %), non-union (31. 25 %) and malunion (12. 5 %). The results were excellent in 18. 75 %, good in 37. 5 %, fair in 18. 75 % and poor in 25 % cases. Salvage of the limb should be the primary aim of management of type III B open tibial <b>shaft</b> <b>fracture.</b> We conclude that use of local fasciocutaneous flap is an easy and effective method of management of open type III B tibial shaft fractures...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> {{in the elderly}} poses special problems (Barry 1967) {{and it has been}} assumed that internal fixation is usually the treatment of choice (B#{ 246 }hler 1968). Although there have been retrospective trials of operative and conservative treatment of femoral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> (McKeever 1945, Dencker 1965) none has been devoted specifically to the elderly.

Its special feature is the method of selection of the patients for these two groups...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> have {{continued}} to increase along with an aging population. Independent of this increased prevalence of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures,</b> the utilization of ORIF in the United States has also trended upwards in a similar manner. Predictive factors for operative ultization were identified as younger age, open fracture, and private insurance.|$|R

40|$|Background: Humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>{{fractures}}</b> {{account for}} 1 to 3 % of all fractures in adults and for 20 % of all humeral fractures. Non-operative treatment {{is still the}} standard treatment of isolated humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures,</b> although this method can present unsatisfactory results. Surgical treatment is reserved for specific conditions. Modern concepts of internal fixation of long bone <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> advocate relative stabilisation techniques with no harm to fracture zone. Recently described, minimally invasive bridge plate osteosynthesis {{has been shown to}} be a secure technique with good results for treating humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures.</b> There is no good quality evidence advocating which method is more effective. This randomised controlled trial will be performed to investigate the effectiveness of surgical treatment of humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> with bridge plating in comparison with conservative treatment with functional brace. Methods/Design: This randomised clinical trial aims to include 110 patients with humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> who will be allocated after randomisation to one of the two groups: bridge plate or functional brace. Surgical treatment will be performed according to technique described by Livani and Belangero using a narrow DCP plate. Non-operative management will consist of a functional brace for 6 weeks or until fracture consolidation. All patients will be included in the same rehabilitation program and will be followed up for 1 year after intervention. the primary outcome will be the DASH score after 6 months of intervention. As secondary outcomes, we will assess SF- 36 questionnaire, treatment complications, Constant score, pain (Visual Analogue Scale) and radiographs. Discussion: According to current evidence shown in a recent systematic review, this study is one of the first randomised controlled trials designed to compare two methods to treat humeral <b>shaft</b> <b>fractures</b> (functional brace and bridge plate surgery) ...|$|R
