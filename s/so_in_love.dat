[...] Zack Handlen of The A.V.

[...] He also called it [...] "a hard episode not to love, frankly." [...] Handlen felt that the humor and sweetness helped to make the episode a success. He also wrote that Mulder and Scully's dynamic worked towards the episode's favor.|$|E

500|$|As the {{daughter}} of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age. After embarking on her own career, she {{earned a reputation as}} a [...] "wild child," [...] which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism. In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, [...] "I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand." [...] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, [...] "I'm <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with my brother right now."

The lyrics of [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] concern the breakdown of a woman's relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity, and the song [...] "sounds {{a lot like a}} statement of independence".

[...] Lewis Beale of Film Journal International said [...] "Impeccably shot, cast and directed, this is a truly impressive film from sophomore writer-director Andrew Dominik... but suffers from an unfortunate case of elephantiasis."

[...] Beale wrote, [...] "The director seems <b>so</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with his languorous pacing, he's incapable of cutting the five or ten seconds {{in any number of}} scenes that could have given the film a more manageable running time. In the scheme of things, however, this amounts to little more than a quibble."

[...] "He has no mercy on those who claim a property in negro-slaves as so much live-stock on their estates ... but not a word has he to say, not a whisper does he breathe against the claim set up by the Despots of the Earth over their Continental subjects, but does every thing in his power to confirm and sanction it! He must give no offence. ... He preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages; and tolerates its worst abuses in civilized states." [...] To [...] "render signal services to mankind" [...] requires greater moral strength than Wilberforce possesses: what is needed is [...] "a severity, a sternness, a self-denial, and a painful sense of duty" [...] that in Wilberforce's case vanish in exchange for a nod of approval from the king or the Prime Minister. Even in Wilberforce's acts of independence from his party's political standpoint, Hazlitt notes a subtle balancing of motives. In the words of Wilberforce biographer William Hague, who quotes Hazlitt's Spirit of the Age criticism, [...] "Hazlitt considered that Wilberforce meant well, but would never risk becoming unpopular with the ruling establishment: 'He ... reaps the credit of independence without the obloquy ... He has all the air of the most perfect independence, and gains a character for impartiality and candour, when he is only striking a balance between the éclat of differing from a Minister on some vantage ground, and the risk or odium that may attend it.|$|E

The song follows the retro sound Duffy had been previously known for and was called [...] "indebted to the pre-Beatles era". It was received negatively for [...] "paint too much of a resemblance" [...] to [...] "Warwick Avenue". The title song, which follows, is a love song that was again said to contain 1950s music references. The song features vinyl sounds and is sung to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar.
