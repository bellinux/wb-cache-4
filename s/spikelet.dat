25|$|A wild naked Oat, Avena nuda, {{indigenous}} to China {{has been used}} to produce new breeds which yield in some instances 100 per cent. more than their cultivated parents. Four or five grains are suspended in each <b>spikelet</b> by a thread like filament about half-an-inch long. This peculiar habit of the plant 'has been extended in the progeny and an' accompanying illustration shows a <b>spikelet</b> with no fewer than 14 grains in it.|$|E
25|$|Flowers of Poaceae are {{characteristically}} {{arranged in}} spikelets, each having {{one or more}} florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the <b>spikelet</b> that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A <b>spikelet</b> consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed {{by one or more}} florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the palea. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and anemophilous or wind-pollinated. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. This complex structure {{can be seen in the}} image on the right, portraying a wheat (Triticum aestivum) <b>spikelet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Light wind {{transports}} CO2 to {{the leaf}} canopy but strong wind causes severe damage and {{may lead to}} sterility (due to pollen dehydration, <b>spikelet</b> sterility, and abortive endosperms).|$|E
40|$|In general, the {{fertility}} and kernel weight of inferior <b>spikelets</b> of rice (Oryza Sativa L.) are obviously {{lower than those}} of superior <b>spikelets,</b> especially under abiotic stress. However, heat stress at anthesis seems to cause more damage to superior <b>spikelets</b> than to inferior <b>spikelets.</b> When rice plants were subjected to heat stress of 40 ℃ at anthesis, a greater decrease in fertility and kernel weight was observed in superior <b>spikelets</b> compared to inferior <b>spikelets.</b> This decrese has primarily been described to their different organ temperatures, in which the temperature of the superior <b>spikelets</b> was significantly higher than that of inferior <b>spikelets.</b> We inferred the differences in canopy temperature, light intensity and panicle types, were the primary reasons for the temperature difference between superior and inferior <b>spikelets.</b> Under heat stress, {{the fertility}} and kernel weight of superior and inferior <b>spikelets</b> decreased as the panicle numbers per plant were reduced, which was accompanied by the significantly increased canopy temperatures. Thus, it was suggested that the rice plant with characteristic features of an upright growth habit and loose panicles might be more susceptible to heat stress resulting from their higher canopy and <b>spikelets</b> temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{dynamics of}} kernel components for <b>spikelets</b> at different positions within a rice panicle were investigated during grain filling {{to understand the}} physiological reasons for the variation of grain quality. Two rice cultivars, Yangdao 6 (indica) and Yangjing 9538 (japonica), were field-grown, and the grain filling characters and contents of starch, soluble sugar, and protein of the <b>spikelets</b> at different positions were studied. There were significant differences in matter accumulation among <b>spikelets</b> at different positions during grain filling. The early-flowering <b>spikelets</b> presented dominance over the late-flowering <b>spikelets</b> in initial time and initial rate of accumulation. At the initial and mid filling stages, the contents and the rates of starch and amylose accumulation in <b>spikelets</b> decreased with the flowering sequence, but soluble sugar content (SSC) exhibited the opposite trend. The difference in SSC among the <b>spikelets</b> of Yangjing 9538 was {{greater than that of}} Yangdao 6, but amylose content in mature <b>spikelets</b> showed no obvious relationship to their flowering sequence. The crude protein content (CPC) of early-flowering <b>spikelets</b> decreased more rapidly than that of late-flowering ones at the initial filling stage, and CPC in the <b>spikelets</b> on the secondary branch was higher than that on the primary branch, but CPC in early-flowering ones was lower than that in late-flowering across the whole grain filling period. Grain water content (GWC) of early-flowering <b>spikelets</b> decreased more rapidly than that of late-flowering <b>spikelets</b> on the same branch at the initial and mid filling stages, especially for the top grain on each primary branch. The results suggested that poor grain filling of late-flowering <b>spikelets</b> may be attributed to their low biological activity rather than carbohydrate supply limitation...|$|R
50|$|Other grasses {{also produce}} {{hazardous}} <b>spikelets.</b> The <b>spikelets</b> are sometimes called foxtails, {{even though the}} grasses are not.|$|R
25|$|Spikelets are {{arranged}} in triplets which alternate along the rachis. In wild barley (and other Old World species of Hordeum), only the central <b>spikelet</b> is fertile, while {{the other two are}} reduced. This condition is retained in certain cultivars known as two-row barleys. A pair of mutations (one dominant, the other recessive) result in fertile lateral spikelets to produce six-row barleys. Recent genetic studies have revealed that a mutation in one gene, vrs1, is responsible for the transition from two-row to six-row barley.|$|E

2500|$|Wild {{emmer wheat}} spikelets {{effectively}} self-cultivate by propelling themselves mechanically into soils with their awns. [...] During {{a period of}} increased humidity during the night, the awns of the <b>spikelet</b> become erect and draw together, {{and in the process}} push the grain into the soil. [...] During the daytime, the humidity drops and the awns slacken back again; however, fine silica hairs on the awns act as hooks in the soil and prevent the spikelets from backing out. [...] During the course of alternating stages of daytime and nighttime humidity, the awns' pumping movements, which resemble a swimming frog kick, will drill the <b>spikelet</b> an inch or more into the soil.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is a raceme bearing 6, 7, or 8 <b>spikelets.</b> The <b>spikelets</b> {{are up to}} 4 or 5 centimeters {{long and}} stick out {{from one side of}} the raceme.

30|$|The {{number of}} <b>spikelets</b> per panicle for Jpn 2 was 70.0 [*]±[*] 14.4 under field {{conditions}} (Figure  5 d). This was significantly more than that of Jpn 1 (P[*]<[*] 0.05). This trend may be independent of {{factors such as the}} nitrogen in the soil because the difference was reconfirmed with plants grown under glass house condition (Table  6). Individuals at the Jpn 1 site had a reduced number of <b>spikelets,</b> when they were grown under glass house condition. This mainly resulted from a reduction of secondary <b>spikelets.</b> It may be not have been warm enough to generate secondary <b>spikelets,</b> as we observed at heading in October in Japan. The number of <b>spikelets</b> was increased on the first rachis both in Jpn 1 and Jpn 2. Fertilization may be affected only by the number of <b>spikelets</b> on the first rachis.|$|R

50|$|A <b>spikelet</b> {{can refer}} to a small spike, {{although}} it is primarily {{used to refer to}} the ultimate flower cluster unit in grasses (family Poaceae) and sedges (family Cyperaceae), in which case the stalk supporting the cluster becomes the pedicel.

40|$|To {{estimate}} genetic variability, heritability {{and genetic}} advance a {{study was conducted}} on 10 diverse parents (3 CMS lines and 7 advance breeding lines) and 21 hybrids of rice. The results obtained from present investigation showed that adequate variabilityamong the parents and crosses for agro-morpho-physiological components. The magnitude of difference between PCV and GCVobserved was relatively low for all the characters viz., days to 50 % flowering, flag leaf length, flag leaf width, flag leaf area,plant height, pollen fertility, sterile <b>spikelets</b> per panicle, fertile <b>spikelets</b> per panicle, <b>spikelets</b> per panicle, <b>spikelets</b> fertility,panicle length, grain yield per plant, test weight and head rice recovery, indicating less environmental influence. All thecharacters exhibited high broad sense heritability. The high heritability along with high genetic advance were registered as percent of mean for grain yield per plant, pollen fertility (%), sterile <b>spikelets</b> per panicle, fertile <b>spikelets</b> per panicle, spikeletsfertility (%), head rice recovery (%), 1000 seed weight, <b>spikelets</b> per panicle. Therefore, the improvement of these traits throughselection {{is the most important}} way to achieve the genetic gain generation after generation. High heritability coupled with highgenetic advance indicates the preponderance of additive gene action and such characters could be improved through selection...|$|R

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) is an {{important}} disease of wheat crops. The incidence of diseased <b>spikelets</b> in the population is most naturally estimated by sampling ears of wheat and {{counting the number of}} infected <b>spikelets,</b> X, and the total number of <b>spikelets,</b> Y, on each ear. However, there is usually much more variation from ear to ear in the number of infected <b>spikelets</b> than in the total number of <b>spikelets</b> and in practice it is common to obtain a larger sample of X values than Y values.
