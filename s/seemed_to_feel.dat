His boat Annie had been lost in the war to a sea mine, and so he bought Benachie as a replacement, on board which he once forgot to remove his cap on meeting the Duke of Kent, an omission which mortified him for years afterwards. He served on several other fishing vessels over the next twenty years before joining the Navy again as a drifter captain to serve in the Second World War, which he spent on uneventful duties in home waters accompanied by his son who had been wounded in the Battle of France serving with the Gordon Highlanders and invalided out of the army. He was on occasion heard to complain that he had been refused foreign service due to his age, which he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> should be an advantage rather than a hindrance.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey dubbed the album [...] " [...] most thematically consistent, least self-contradicting work", and stated, [...] "it {{may not be}} his definitive album, but it just might be his best". Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReview <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> differently, remarking that the album [...] "is not only the quintessential Shakur album, {{but one of the}} most important rap albums released in the 1990s as a whole".|$|E
2500|$|... "Soon, {{with the}} {{composition}} of the musical illustrations for Pictures from an Exhibition by the architect Hartmann, he reached the acme of that musical radicalism, to whose 'new shores' and to whose 'unfathomed depths' the admirers of his 'Peepshows' and 'Savishnas' had pushed him so diligently. In music for these illustrations, as Mussorgsky called them, he represented , children, Baba Yaga in her wooden house on chicken legs, catacombs, gates, and even rattling carts. All this was not done jokingly, but 'seriously'.""There was no end to the enthusiasm shown by his devotees; but many of Mussorgsky's friends, on the other hand, and especially the comrade composers, were seriously puzzled and, listening to the 'novelty,' shook their heads in bewilderment. Naturally, Mussorgsky noticed their bewilderment and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that he 'had gone too far.' He set the illustrations aside without even trying to publish them. Mussorgsky devoted himself exclusively to Khovanshchina." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cimino's next film, Heaven's Gate (1980), debuted to lacerating {{reviews and}} took in only $3 million in ticket sales, {{effectively}} leaving United Artists bankrupt. The failure of Heaven's Gate led several critics to revise {{their positions on}} The Deer Hunter. Canby said in his famous review of Heaven's Gate, [...] " [...] fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the Devil to obtain the success of The Deer Hunter, and the Devil has just come around to collect." [...] Andrew Sarris wrote in his review of Heaven's Gate, [...] "I'm a little surprised {{that many of the}} same critics who lionized Cimino for The Deer Hunter have now thrown him to the wolves with equal enthusiasm." [...] Sarris added, [...] "I was never taken in... Hence, the stupidity and incoherence in Heaven's Gate came as no surprise since very much the same stupidity and incoherence had been amply evident in The Deer Hunter." [...] In his book Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven's Gate, Steven Bach wrote, [...] "critics <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> obliged to go on the record about The Deer Hunter, to demonstrate that their critical credentials were un-besmirched by having been, as Sarris put it, 'taken in.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst the {{reviewer}} in The Guardian of 16 May 1928 <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{that the}} play itself showed no great originality, {{he was impressed}} with Laughton, saying [...] "we can hardly resist the play despite its wheezy start and inability to accelerate, because M. Poirot {{is presented in the}} flesh by Mr. Charles Laughton, who, unlike much youth of brilliant hopes, continues to perform almost more than he so lavishly promised.” The reviewer concluded, [...] "M. Poirot sifts the alibis of the assembled company, finds a scent and hunts it close. None of the other characters appears to have any more personality than is necessary for a human fragment of the puzzle. It is hardly needed. Mr. Laughton is there, and he cannot fail to entertain, whether he is in the supreme frenzy of vigilance, or relaxing over the oldest of old brandies, or making a tender gesture to a charming young lady who is as English as a rose and not, it seems, more talkative or intellectual. Scarcely the wife for Poirot, but let us not be fussy and make difficulties. Mr. Laughton is an important arrival in Crookery Nook, yet we trust he will not stay there too long. We have other uses for such an actor than to brood over the fingermarks on the dagger and discover why the parlourmaid was in the garden at the moment of the crime.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One Life Stand {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 34 reviews. The Observers Gareth Grundy {{wrote that the}} album [...] "not only sees [...] back on track, it's also their best work, paring down those past excesses and unifying them into an extraordinarily lovely whole." [...] Huw Jones of Slant Magazine described it as [...] "a smooth, sleek, and splendid pop record" [...] where [...] "ach individual track sticks to its own tone and theme, while the group gracefully sashays through several shifts in tone and tempo." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic noted that [...] "their sensitive side dominates One Life Stand—they don't sound ready for the floor, they sound ready to settle down. Even the most energetic songs feel tempered compared to the neon energy of Made in the Dark and The Warnings hits." [...] She added that [...] "hough this emotional nakedness is an unusual move after Made in the Dark pushed Hot Chip {{to a new level}} of attention and acclaim, it also shows they're in it for the long haul." [...] Nick Annan from Clash deemed it [...] "different to Made In The Dark but a more cohesive and more heartfelt effort too. One Life Stand sees Hot Chip let us into their hearts as well as their thoughts." [...] Benjamin Boles of Now commented that [...] "t's not that they've completely reinvented their sound as much as they've simply focused and polished it up. The real shift is in their attitude, which allows them to embrace earnestness and write some straightforward love songs. It's a strategy that could have backfired, but instead it has inspired their strongest and most consistent album so far." [...] Uncuts Andrew Mueller believed that the album [...] "contains little trace of the discordant outings or rather rigidly utilitarian dance grooves they <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> obliged to deploy on previous albums. This is an album that sees Hot Chip freeing themselves of the surly bonds of their more orthodox dance and electronic influences and settling comfortably into the orbit of New Order and Pet Shop Boys." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kitchener {{achieved}} further successes at the Battle of Atbara in April 1898, {{and then}} the Battle of Omdurman in September 1898. After marching to the walls of Khartoum, he placed his army into a crescent shape with the Nile to the rear, together with the gunboats in support. This enabled him to bring overwhelming firepower against any attack of the Ansar from any direction, though with the disadvantage of having his men spread out thinly, with hardly any forces in reserve. Such an arrangement could have proven disastrous if the Ansar had broken through the thin khaki line. At about 5am on September 2, 1898, a huge force of Ansar, {{under the command of}} the Khalifa himself, came out of the fort at Omdurman, marching under their black banners inscribed with Koranic quotations in Arabic; this led Bennet Burleigh, the Sudan correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, to write: [...] "It was not alone the reverberation of the tread of horses and men's feet I heard and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> as well as hear, but a voiced continuous shouting and chanting-the Dervish invocation and battle challenge [...] "Allah e Allah Rasool Allah el Mahdi!" [...] they reiterated in vociferous rising measure, as they swept over the intervening ground". Kitchener had the ground carefully studied so that his officers would know the best angle of fire, and had his army opened fire on the Ansar first with artillery, then machine guns and finally rifles as the enemy advanced. A young Winston Churchill, serving as an army officer, wrote of what he saw: [...] "A ragged line of men were coming on desperately, struggling forward {{in the face of the}} pitiless fire-black banners tossing and collapsing; white figures subsiding in dozens to the ground...valiant men were struggling on through a hell of whistling metal, exploding shells, and spurting dust—suffering, despairing, dying". By about 8:30am, much of the Dervish army was dead; Kitchener ordered his men to advance, fearing that the Khalifa might escape with what was left of his army to the fort of Omdurman, forcing Kitchener to lay siege to it.|$|E
