5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E

Burrell tells Rawls that Daniels {{is a long way from}} his [...] "throne" [...] and that he is too. He taunts Rawls by saying that he made his move against him too soon (Rawls did undermine him in front of Carcetti in Corner Boys, although it is not clear how Burrell would know about it; he may have guessed from Carcetti putting Rawls in charge 'de facto' of the department in lieu of Burrell, or may have <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> test him.). Rawls admits to the mistake and Burrell warns him never to cross him again.|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] "and {{they sent}} the coat of many colors, {{and they brought}} it to their father; and said: ‘This have we found.

Similarly, reading the words of [...] "Discern, please," [...] Rabbi Hama ben Hanina noted that with the same word, Judah made an {{announcement}} to his father, and Judah's daughter-in-law made an announcement to him.

2500|$|The title role—"one of {{the most}} taxing and wide-ranging parts in the entire repertory"—is one {{of the most}} {{difficult}} in the soprano repertoire. It calls for great vocal control of range, flexibility, and dynamics as well as containing a wide range of emotions: conflict of personal and public life, romantic life, maternal love, friendship, jealousy, murderous intent, and resignation. The German soprano Lilli Lehmann once remarked that the singing of all three Brünnhilde roles of Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen in one evening would be less stressful than the singing of one Norma. She also commented [...] "When you sing Wagner, you are so carried away by the dramatic emotion, the action, and the scene that you do not have to think how to sing the words. That comes of itself. But in Bellini, you must always have a care for beauty of tone and correct emission."According to the Met Opera Archives Lehmann <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel.|$|E

All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?’ 6 They <b>said</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E

[...] Therefore, they said, people should make supports for the Firmament, one in the north, one in the south, one in the west, and the Tower of Babel in the east.
