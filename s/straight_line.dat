40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for extracting groups of <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> that {{represent}} roof boundaries and roof ridgelines from highresolution aerial images using corresponding Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) roof polyhedrons as initial approximations. The proposed method is based on two main steps. First, <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> that are candidates to represent roof ridgelines and roof boundaries of a building are extracted from the aerial image. Second, a group of <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> that represent roof boundaries and roof ridgelines of a selected building is obtained through the optimization of a Markov Random Field (MRF) -based energy function using the genetic algorithm optimization method. The formulation of this energy function considers several attributes, such as {{the proximity of the}} extracted <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> to the corresponding projected ALS-derived roof polyhedron and the rectangularity (extracted <b>straight</b> <b>lines</b> that intersect at nearly 90 °). Experimental results are presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R

As shown on the right, this is a linear form of the Michaelis–Menten equation and produces a <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> with the equation y = mx + c with a y-intercept equivalent to 1/Vmax and an x-intercept of the graph representing −1/KM.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies in a <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
