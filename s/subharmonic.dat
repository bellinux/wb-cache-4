5|$|Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but {{his lines}} are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language {{dialogue}} were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, {{whose work is}} not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a <b>subharmonic</b> generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany {{the movement of the}} puppet's limbs and mouth.|$|E

25|$|Seiches can be {{considered}} long period or infragravity waves, which are due to <b>subharmonic</b> nonlinear wave interaction with the wind waves, having periods longer than the accompanying wind-generated waves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subharmonics</b> only exist {{naturally}} in bells and steel plates and {{differ from the}} sounds produced conventionally by synthesizers and software programmes for electronic music. It appeared that the world of sound produced by mixing <b>subharmonics</b> would be forever dominated by the only existing instrument, the Mixturtrautonium, and its constructor and player, Oskar Sala. Nobody else had ever mastered or played Sala’s instrument, and when he died, {{it seemed that the}} sound world of <b>subharmonics</b> was lost.|$|R
40|$|A {{feedforward}} artificial {{neural network}} has been realized and trained to individualize <b>subharmonics</b> frequencies in an electric network. The adopted sampling window is fixed in 20 ms correspondent to a period of the fundamental frequency of 50 Hz, nevertheless the net is {{able to identify the}} <b>subharmonics</b> frequencies even if their period is not completed. The particular binary successive approximation structure realized for the ANN forecasts the scalability of the same net so allowing to recognize the <b>subharmonics</b> with a prefixed resolution. The net has been widely tested on synthesized signal...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a forced oscillatory system which is linearly damped but nonlinear in the restoring force is investigated according to the author's previous papers (Magiros, 1957, 1958. It is shown under which conditions the system may contain <b>subharmonics</b> of order 1 / 2. The amplitudes of the <b>subharmonics</b> and their components, and the bounds for the amplitude of the external force, are given {{in terms of the}} coefficients of the differential equation of the system, which are not necessarily very small, as well as the regions in the (c 1 /c 3, I) -plane, where we have <b>subharmonics</b> with two, one, or neither amplitudes. Also discussed are the stability of the <b>subharmonics,</b> the free vibrations of the system, and the case when one of the coefficients of the nonlinear terms is zero...|$|R
500|$|Harmonic and <b>subharmonic</b> orbits {{are special}} types of such closed orbits. A closed {{trajectory}} {{is called a}} harmonic orbit if k is an integer, i.e., if [...] in the formula [...] For example, if [...] (green planet in Figures 1 and 4, green orbit in Figure 9), the resulting orbit is the third harmonic of the original orbit. Conversely, the closed trajectory is called a <b>subharmonic</b> orbit if k is the inverse of an integer, i.e., if [...] in the formula [...] For example, if [...] (green planet in Figure 5, green orbit in Figure 10), the resulting orbit is called the third <b>subharmonic</b> of the original orbit. Although such orbits are unlikely to occur in nature, they are helpful for illustrating Newton's theorem.|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a <b>subharmonic</b> of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A C2 {{function}} that satisfies Δf ≥ 0 is called <b>subharmonic.</b> [...] This condition guarantees that the maximum principle will hold, although other properties of harmonic functions may fail. [...] More generally, a function is <b>subharmonic</b> if and only if, {{in the interior}} of any ball in its domain, its graph lies below that of the harmonic function interpolating its boundary values on the ball.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subharmonics</b> can be {{produced}} by signal amplification through loudspeakers.|$|R
40|$|Various {{mechanisms}} for generation of <b>subharmonics</b> in periodic plasma-filled waveguides excited by charged beam are considered. It is shown that beam particles {{seized by the}} excited electromagnetic wave can demonstrate under certain conditions the complex dynamics that results in generation of <b>subharmonics</b> and cause {{the transition to the}} stochastic regime of the instability...|$|R

2500|$|In {{potential}} theory, a <b>subharmonic</b> function f satisfies [...] Δf≥0. Any <b>subharmonic</b> {{function that}} is bounded above by a harmonic function for all {{points on the}} boundary of a ball are bounded above by the harmonic function for all points inside the ball. Similarly, if a submartingale and a martingale have equivalent expectations for a given time, {{the history of the}} submartingale tends to be bounded above by the history of the martingale. Roughly speaking, the prefix [...] "sub-" [...] is consistent because the current observation Xn is less than (or equal to) the conditional expectation E. Consequently, the current observation provides support from below the future conditional expectation, and the process tends to increase in future time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{classification}} scheme above is typically used by geometers. There {{is a different}} classification for Riemann surfaces which is typically used by complex analysts. It employs a different definition for [...] "parabolic" [...] and [...] "hyperbolic". In this alternative {{classification scheme}}, a Riemann surface is called parabolic {{if there are no}} nonconstant negative <b>subharmonic</b> functions on the surface and is otherwise called hyperbolic. This class of hyperbolic surfaces is further subdivided into subclasses according to whether function spaces other than the negative <b>subharmonic</b> functions are degenerate, e.g. Riemann surfaces on which all bounded holomorphic functions are constant, or on which all bounded harmonic functions are constant, or on which all positive harmonic functions are constant, etc.|$|E
2500|$|When 0 < p < 1, a {{function}} F in Hp cannot be reconstructed {{from the real}} part of its boundary limit function on the circle, {{because of the lack}} of convexity of Lp in this case. [...] Convexity fails but a kind of [...] "complex convexity" [...] remains, namely the fact that z → |z|q is <b>subharmonic</b> for every q > 0. As a consequence, if ...|$|E

She is credited with [...] "introducing" [...] the use of violin <b>subharmonics,</b> which allow a violinist to play a full octave below the low G on the violin without adjusting the tuning of the instrument.|$|R
40|$|Observation of {{the period}} {{doubling}} cascade in a Rayleigh-Bénard experiment in mercury. The experimental cell has an aspect ratio Γ = 4 and contains four convective rolls. A DC magnetic field of 270 G is applied along the convective roll axis. The measured Feigenbaum number is δ = 4. 4. The ratio of the successive <b>subharmonics</b> is {{of the order of}} 14 dB for the lowest measured <b>subharmonics...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{consists}} of two parts. In the first one we discuss the <b>subharmonics</b> of any order in the case where the nonlinearity enters in the elastic forces. The basic differential equation is with coefficients not necessarily small. The “steady state” and “transient” solutions of the differential equation, and the conditions {{for the existence of}} the <b>subharmonics</b> and their stability in a steady state are examined. In {{the second part of the}} paper an application is given, namely, the investigation of the <b>subharmonics</b> of order 1 / 3 according to the theory of the first part. An illustrated example is given, the “inverse problem” is examined, and the conditions for the stability and instability of the “harmonic solution” are found...|$|R
2500|$|Harmonic {{functions}} {{satisfy the}} following maximum principle: if K {{is not a}} nonempty compact subset of U, then f restricted to K attains its maximum and minimum on the boundary of K. [...] If U is connected, this means that f cannot have local maxima or minima, other than the exceptional case where f is constant. Similar properties can be shown for <b>subharmonic</b> functions.|$|E
2500|$|Fusion or pattern matching: {{fundamentals}} may {{be perceived}} through pattern matching of the separately analyzed partials to a best-fit exact-harmonic template ( [...] , [...] ) or the best-fit <b>subharmonic</b> ( [...] , [...] ), or harmonics may be perceptually fused into one entity, with dissonances being those intervals less likely mistaken for unisons, the imperfect intervals, because of the multiple estimates, at perfect intervals, of fundamentals, for one harmonic tone ( [...] , [...] ). By these definitions, inharmonic partials of otherwise harmonic spectra are usually processed separately (Hartmann et al., 1990), unless frequency or amplitude modulated coherently with the harmonic partials [...] For some of these definitions, neural firing supplies the data for pattern matching; see directly below (e.g., [...] ).|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a pitch {{determination}} algorithm (PDA) based on Subharmonic-to-Harmonic Ratio (SHR) is proposed. The algorithm {{is motivated by}} the results of a recent study on the perceived pitch of alternate pulse cycles in speech [1]. The algorithm employs a logarithmic frequency scale and a spectrum shifting technique to obtain the amplitude summation of harmonics and <b>subharmonics,</b> respectively. Through comparing the amplitude ratio of <b>subharmonics</b> and harmonics with the pitch perception results, the pitch of normal speech as well as speech with alternate pulse cycles (APC) can be determined.. Evaluation of the algorithm is performed on CSTR's database and on synthesized speech with APC. The results show that this algorithm {{is one of the most}} reliable PDAs. Furthermore, superior to most other algorithms, it handles <b>subharmonics</b> reasonably well...|$|R

5000|$|The hybrid term <b>subharmonic</b> is used {{in music}} and {{dynamics}} in a few different ways. In its pure sense, the term <b>subharmonic</b> refers strictly to {{any member of the}} <b>subharmonic</b> series (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.). When the <b>subharmonic</b> series is used to refer to frequency relationships, it is written with f representing some highest known reference frequency (f/1, f/2, f/3, f/4, etc.). The complex tones of acoustic instruments do not produce partials that resemble the <b>subharmonic</b> series. However, such tones can be produced artificially with audio software and electronics. Subharmonics can be contrasted with harmonics. While harmonics can [...] "...occur in any nonlinear system", there are [...] "...only fairly restricted conditions" [...] that will lead to the [...] "nonlinear phenomenon known as <b>subharmonic</b> generation".One way to define subharmonics is that they are [...] "...integral submultiples of the fundamental (driving) frequency".|$|E
40|$|The Duffing {{equation}} with damping {{has been}} considered when the forcing function is composed of a harmonic term of frequency w and a higher harmonic term of frequency 3 w. The existence of <b>subharmonics</b> of order 1 / 3 and ultra-harmonics of order 2, 5, 7, 9 was shown. The existence of other <b>subharmonics,</b> ultra-harmonics, and ultra-subharmonics when damping is present was left as an open question since the first term, ko, of {{the expansion of the}} damping coefficient, k, in powers of epsilon is zero. A procedure was outlined by which the initial conditions could be determined when the other parameters in the buffing equation are known in order to insure the existence of <b>subharmonics</b> of order 1 / 3. A similar procedure could be used to obtain the initial conditions that would insure the existence of ultra-harmonics or harmonics. The existence of harmonics for the Duffing equation with damping but with only the first harmonic forcing term was shown;Stability conditions were established for the four types of periodic solutions. The special stability conditions were worked out for harmonics, <b>subharmonics</b> of order 1 / 3, and ultra-harmonies of order 2, 5, 7, 9...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Subharmonic {{generation}} {{is a complex}} nonlinear phenomenon which can arise from nonlinear oscillations, bifur-cation and chaos. It {{is well known that}} single-input–single-output Volterra series cannot currently be applied to model systems which exhibit <b>subharmonics.</b> A new modeling alternative is introduced in this paper which overcomes these restrictions by using local multiple input single output Volterra models. The generalized frequency-response functions can then be applied to interpret systems with <b>subharmonics</b> in the frequency domain.

40|$|An {{improvement}} of a feedforward {{artificial neural network}} for individualizing electric network <b>subharmonics</b> frequencies has been realized increasing the neural network resolution. Whishing to have a quick system able to signal the presence of <b>subharmonics</b> in real time, It has been fixed a sampling window of 20 ms equal to a period of an ideal fundamental frequency of 50 Hz. This choice obliges to pick up {{only a fraction of}} the <b>subharmonics</b> period that is not ever completed inside the sampling window making the classical spectral frequency recognition method unsuited. This obliges to transfer the problem of the their recognition on the neural network trained phase obtained by an appropriate discretization of the training set. The binary successive approximation structure has the merit of the scalability exploited in this article to increase the resolution than previous work.

40|$|Ruggero et al. (PNAS 97 (22) p. 11744, 2000) {{compared}} threshold tuning {{curves of}} chinchilla basilar membrane (BM) vibrations and auditory nerve (AN) fibers. They {{noted that the}} AN tuning curves lacked the supra-CF frequency plateaus that are present in BM responses and suggested that BM vibrations do not translate into AN responses in the supra-CF frequency region. This observation is relevant {{to the relationship between}} BM motion (macromechanics) and hair cell stimulation (micromechanics). To further investigate the discrepancy, we recorded AN responses from the gerbil, concentrating on the supra-CF region of single AN fibers. We observed a supra-CF frequency plateau in AN responses at very high sound pressure levels (> 100 dB SPL). This AN plateau was at least 10 to 15 dB higher than what is predicted from BM plateaus. However, at high sound pressure levels, we also recorded <b>subharmonics</b> in the acoustic signal in the ear canal. The <b>subharmonics</b> were not produced by the speaker and appeared to be produced in the auditory mechanics. Dallos and Linnell (JASA 40 (3) p. 561, 1966) studied similar <b>subharmonics,</b> and concluded that they were produced in the ear drum and in the cochlea. We still need to determine whether the <b>subharmonics</b> are responsible for the supra-CF frequency plateaus in the AN responses or if the AN responses are due to the motion of the BM at the fundamental frequency...|$|R
