5|$|Snow {{affects the}} rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads. They share a common tool for {{clearing}} snow, the <b>snow</b> <b>plow.</b> However, the application is different in each case—whereas roadways employ anti-icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice, airfields may not; railroads rely on abrasives to enhance traction on tracks.|$|E

The {{aircraft}} struck the <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> with its right wing, immediately killing the <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> operator and causing {{the plane to}} swerve off the runway.

25|$|Eighteen days later, when a {{blizzard}} hits, the group uses the whiteout {{to go to}} the general store for supplies, but are stranded after it ends. While the group heads for the station, Eben creates a diversion by having the vampires chase him to his grandmother's house, where he uses one of her ultraviolet lights to burn the face of Marlow's lover, Iris (Megan Franich), so badly that Marlow is forced to kill her. As he escapes, the town <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> operator, Beau (Mark Boone Junior), creates another distraction with his tractor, killing many of the vampires, before trying to blow himself up; when he fails, Marlow crushes his head. Eben arrives at the station, where he is then forced to kill Carter (Nathaniel Lees), who has been bitten and is turning into a vampire.|$|E
25|$|Blue lights (in light bars) {{are used}} by (reserved for) police, {{ambulance}} service, emergency blood transport, fire brigade, emergency response teams (public services), correction facilities. Blue-red combo is often used by police and ambulance, but red can only be used in combo with blue. Some police units often use additional lighting, e.g. strobe lights, alternating headlight flash, behind-windshield blue/red lights. Detachable blue flash lamps are occasionally used by unsigned cars of special police forces, by personal transport services for government members, and diplomatic convoy/escort vehicles. Amber/yellow flashing lights are for warning some special attribute (e.g. oversized, slow, parking at unexpected places etc.) of vehicles like garbage trucks, road cleaning/control/repair, <b>snow</b> <b>plow,</b> car assistance services, construction, transporting dangerous materials etc. Amber/yellow lights do not grant traffic privileges, except {{to go in the}} opposite direction in one-way streets or driving on the opposite side in some cases, e.g. road cleaning.|$|E

500|$|A larger {{improvement}} {{came about}} {{as a part of}} the industrial revolution in the 1940s following the return of the men from World War II. Following World War II improved economic and farming factors saw an increase of taxation, and mechanized road building programs resulting in better roads. The [...] municipality had now acquired power road building and maintenance equipment. In 1958, the road construction equipment was traded for an Adams No. 440 motor grader and <b>snow</b> <b>plow.</b> Improved highways and travel by automobile soon saw the demise of a great majority of settlements along the prairie which were lively communities in the first half of the 20th century. [...] November 1947 saw communities along the Yellowhead organize together with caravans and meetings to encourage the Trans-Canada Trail to build on the northern route connecting eastern and western Canada. The Trans-Canada was officially opened in 1962 along the southern route.|$|E

A wing from C-FTLU was used to replace the one separated on N994Z after the incident.

2500|$|Ownership of {{the class}} moved to Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS) in 1904, when it bought KKS. The trams were {{variously}} rebuilt from 1918. One was converted to a <b>snow</b> <b>plow,</b> while three motor cars and three trailers were converted to cargo trams for hauling grain. The remaining units were rebuilt and lengthened in 1919 and 1920. The wheelbase was extended from [...] and the platform bays covered. A further rebuilding took place between 1921 and 1925, when they received new motors and undercarriages from Siemens Schuckertwerke. They passed on to Oslo Sporveier when it took over KSS in 1924. There the trams remained in service until 1967.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 ODOT began {{installing}} pavement {{sensors and}} Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices, {{as well as}} generating computer-modeled <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> routes to enhance its snow and ice removal program. The pavement sensors relay valuable information such as pavement and air temperature, precipitation accumulation and wind speed. By identifying and reporting weather conditions on the highway, the sensors help ODOT prioritize its response and more efficiently clear the roads. [...] A number of pavement sensors currently exist on highways around the state. Data from these sensors is transferred to ODOT's district offices, and entered into the (RWIS) on the ODOT web site. Motorists can track winter weather conditions by accessing RWIS on the internet. [...] RWIS also lists winter weather advisories, snow warnings, and highway closures. The information is kept current and is available 24 hours per day.|$|E

2500|$|The Ohio Department of Transportation {{currently}} {{has access to}} 1,536 snow plows to help maintain good road conditions during winter months, and has approximately 2,500employees available each season for snow and ice removal. [...] In addition to trucks, the department also has 650,000 tons of salt stored at 220 locations statewide. While ODOT spends an average of $24million per year for winter operations, though most years can use anywhere from 300,000 to 900,000 tons of salt per year. [...] ODOT now manages a decentralized snow and ice program, giving districts, counties, and <b>snow</b> <b>plow</b> operators a set of guidelines to follow, which can be modified to best assist the area. In prior years, the department issued twelve pages of directives that mandated when and where plows are to be used. This system proved to be inefficient, which helped to bring the new system about.|$|E

Portions of Interstate 95 and Interstate 495 in Virginia and Maryland (especially on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge), as well as Interstate 270, were brought to a standstill through the early hours of January21.
