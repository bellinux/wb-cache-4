The river flowed along {{what is now the}} west side of Pancras Road until it was rerouted underground in 1825. The name [...] "Battle Bridge" [...] is linked to tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the Celtic British Iceni tribe led by Boudica. According to folklore, King's Cross is the site of Boudica's final battle and some sources <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> buried under one of the platforms.

Don confides that he had to fire Lane for embezzlement. Lane arrives home drunk to find that Rebecca has surprised him with a new Jaguar. She tells him her reasoning — he never spends on himself. He vomits, but, the next morning, reassures Rebecca (Embeth Davidtz) that he likes the car. Lane attempts to commit suicide {{in the middle of the}} night using the new car's exhaust, but, in an ironic confirmation of Cooper's earlier retort of Jaguars that [...] "They don't start!", the car fails to start. He then walks into SCDP's empty office and types a letter at his desk.|$|E
500|$|Conceivably, Olga was {{initially}} either {{open to the}} possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind. Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf Zahle, at the end of October 1925: [...] "My feeling is that she is not the one she believes—but one can't <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not as a fact". However, within a month she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, [...] "There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A." [...] Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia. Olga later said she sent the gift and letters [...] "out of pity", and called the claims [...] "a complete fabrication". When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper, Anderson's supporters, Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony. She told her official biographer, [...] "I never received any such telegram." [...] The supposed telegram was never produced by Anderson's supporters, and it has never been found among any of the papers relating to the case. Xenia said, ...|$|E

2500|$|Maxine Marx {{reported}} in The Unknown Marx Brothers that the brothers listed their real names (Julius, Leonard, Adolph, Milton, and Herbert) on playbills and in programs, and only used the nicknames behind the scenes, until Alexander Woollcott overheard them calling {{one another by}} the nicknames. He asked them why they used their real names publicly when they had such wonderful nicknames, and they replied, [...] "That wouldn't be dignified." [...] Woollcott answered with a belly laugh. Woollcott {{did not meet the}} Marx Brothers until the premiere of I'll <b>Say</b> <b>She</b> <b>Is,</b> which was their first Broadway show, so this would mean that they used their real names throughout their vaudeville days, and that the name [...] "Gummo" [...] never appeared in print during his time in the act. Other sources reported that the Marx Brothers went by their nicknames during their vaudeville era, but briefly listed themselves by their given names when I'll <b>Say</b> <b>She</b> <b>Is</b> opened because they were worried that a Broadway audience would reject a vaudeville act if they were perceived as low class.|$|E

They {{signed a contract}} with Paramount Pictures and embarked on their film career at Paramount's studios in New York City's Astoria section. Their first two released films (after an unreleased short silent film titled Humor Risk) were adaptations of the Broadway shows The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930). Both were written by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind. Production then shifted to Hollywood, beginning with a short film that was included in Paramount's twentieth anniversary documentary, The House That Shadows Built (1931), in which they adapted a scene from I'll <b>Say</b> <b>She</b> <b>Is.</b> Their third feature-length film, Monkey Business (1931), was their first movie not based on a stage production.|$|E

Fields, Jack Benny, George Burns, Henny Youngman, the Smothers Brothers, Flip Wilson, Phyllis Diller, Jack E. Leonard, George Jessel and the Marx Brothers. Most of the comedians provided their own voices for their animated counterparts, except for Fields and Chico Marx (both had died), and Zeppo Marx (who had left show business in 1933). Voice actor Paul Frees filled in for all three (no voice was needed for Harpo). The Marx Brothers' segment was a reworking of a scene from their Broadway play I'll <b>Say</b> <b>She</b> <b>Is,</b> a parody of Napoleon that Groucho considered among the brothers' funniest routines. The sketch featured animated representations, if not the voices, of all four brothers.
